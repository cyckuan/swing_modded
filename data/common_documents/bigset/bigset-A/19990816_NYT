COURT REINSTATES NEGLIGENCE LAWSUIT IN WOMAN'S SLAYING

<P>
   Battered and scared for her life, Michele McGuffey went to
Anacortes, Wash., police in 1993 to say she wanted charges filed
against her abusive husband.
</P>
<P>
   A detective told McGuffey he would refer the case to Skagit
County prosecutors the next morning. He never did.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, Michael McGuffey allegedly approached his
estranged wife in her car as she arrived at work, grabbed her by
her long curly hair and shot her to death.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Washington state appeals court has ruled that McGuffey's
mother, Barbara Torres of Sedro-Woolley, can sue the city of
Anacortes for negligence in the death of her 25-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-1 ruling overturned a lower court's dismissal of Torres'
wrongful death lawsuit, saying that the detective's promise was
``an express assurance of assistance.'' A jury, the ruling said,
might conclude that McGuffey stayed in the Anacortes area because
of that assurance, rather than go into hiding as she had done once
before.
</P>
<P>
   Torres saw the appeals court ruling as a victory for her
daughter and a hope for future victims of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every turn, (domestic violence) is there. ... The police
need to be trained,'' she said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Torres persuaded her daughter to go to police in August 1993
after McGuffey hit her in the head with a gun, raped her and
threatened future violence, the appeals decision said. Torres said
her daughter told her that Michael McGuffey showed her his loaded
gun, held it to her head and cocked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew what the next step would be. ... I told her, `We have
to get help,''' Torres said. ``We didn't get any help.''
</P>
<P>
   The petite, gentle McGuffey met her husband when she was a
``starry-eyed kid'' of 16, and married him two years later, her
mother said. The abuse began soon after, and included McGuffey's
pouring hot grease on her head and raping her at gunpoint, the
appeals court decision said. Michele McGuffey left him once, but
returned after learning she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1993, McGuffey went to Mount Vernon police after moving
to a battered women's shelter, saying her husband had threatened to
kill her if she left, the appeals decision said. She had first said
she wanted to press charges, but later backed out. She later moved
to Anacortes, 80 miles north of Seattle, where she went back to
school to become a legal assistant and worked as a waitress to
support her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In August, McGuffey lay in wait for his wife as she returned to
her apartment after work and attacked her again, the decision said.
Michele McGuffey first reported the attack to Anacortes police,
then said she wanted to drop the rape charge and would only pursue
the assault charge.
</P>
<P>
   Such backtracking is not uncommon with domestic violence
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The Anacortes detective said in a deposition that he didn't
refer the case because he was busy working on another one and
because he got the impression that McGuffey was ``real hesitant of
going through with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages in McGuffey's death, and
Torres said any money received would go to a fund for McGuffey's
daughter, now 10, whom Torres is rearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about money, it's about right and wrong,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McGuffey disappeared after his wife's death; he's wanted
in an arrest warrant on suspicion of first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said she waited two years after her daughter's death to
file the wrongful death lawsuit to make sure she wasn't doing it
out of anger.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court judge who dissented in the case, William
Baker, wrote that the slaying might well have occurred even if the
detective had referred the case as promised. Nothing police said
assured that McGuffey would be protected against her husband, he
wrote, and the lawsuit was filed because McGuffey was not protected
not because the case wasn't referred.
</P>
<P>
   Anacortes Mayor Dean Maxwell said Sunday he hasn't had a chance
to review the decision, which the city could appeal to the state
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible thing for the family ... '' he said.
``We'll get legal counsel to review (the decision), and we'll go
from there.''

BRADLEY PUSHES FOR STRICT GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Betty Coddington of East Boston wasn't much interested
in the inner workings of government until the night two years ago
when she woke up to the sound of bullets smashing through a window
on the first floor of her house.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, her dislike of guns has blossomed into advocacy of
an outright ban, and Coddington, 72, was ready to talk policy
Sunday. She, along with 25 mostly older East Boston residents,
gathered around presidential hopeful Bill Bradley to discuss gun
control _ an issue Bradley is counting on to win over people like
her in neighborhoods like this one.
</P>
<P>
   As he laid out a wish list of gun control measures stricter than
any other candidate's, Bradley cited this year's rash of random
shootings and asserted that the measures he backs could have headed
some of them off. Sunday, he called for a stringent agenda that
included a requirement that all guns be registered with the
government, much like automobiles, and a ban on cheap handguns
known as Saturday Night Specials.
</P>
<P>
   He also recommended background checks at gun shows to weed out
people with a history of mental illness. The checks he recommends,
he said, could have kept weapons out of the hands of Buford Furrow,
who is charged with wounding five people last week at a California
community center and then killing a postal worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by far the strongest call for gun control I've seen
from any candidate,'' said Jerry Belair of a locally based advocacy
group Stop Handgun Violence. And after this year's series of random
shootings, people who had been neutral on gun control are uniquely
receptive to the idea of controlling access to guns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're changing their minds this year,'' Blair added.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has also staked out a strong position on
gun control, calling for states to issue photo licenses to people
who buy handguns and for dealers to report the serial numbers of
every handgun they sell, which would facilitate tracing guns used
in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But his plan stops short of Bradley's proposal that all guns be
registered with the government. Bradley has also proposed that the
crime of selling a gun to a middleman who then sells it to a minor
should be upgraded from a misdemeanor to a felony, a position Gore
has not taken.
</P>
<P>
   And a month after GOP frontrunner George W. Bush passed
legislation in Texas blocking communities from suing gun
manufacturers, Bradley encouraged the proliferating number of
lawsuits, saying they put the gun industry ``exactly where big
tobacco was eight or 10 years ago.'' In June, Boston became the
20th community to file for damages from gun manufacturers on the
basis of health care costs and lowered property values owing to gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ultimately what happened with the tobacco lobby,''
Bradley said. Frustrated by the pace of legislative action, tobacco
opponents ``chose instead to go to the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most in the East Boston crowd said they hadn't settled
on a candidate at this early point in the campaign, Bradley's focus
on guns struck a chord even with some who professed an aversion to
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like guns. Everything about them, I don't like,'' said
Coddington. ``I think all guns should be banned.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the crowd, like Eva Marie DiMaggio of the Chelsea
Street Neighborhood Crime Watch who has a 17-year-old son, were
longtime gun opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to be worried about drunk driving or
drug use or him getting a girl pregnant,'' DiMaggio said. ``Now I'm
worried about him confronting someone who has a gun.''

SEATTLE RESEARCH GROUP WORKING ON A NEW ATTACK AGAINST DIABETES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Kathleen Kuechenmeister was only 8 when she learned
she had diabetes. Now, nearly four decades later, the disease is
slowly eroding her health. It has destroyed her kidneys, clouded
her sight and damaged nerves, making it difficult to walk.
</P>
<P>
   At 46, she can no longer live alone, for fear of losing
consciousness because her blood sugars have gone out of control.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuechenmeister, and 266,000 others like her in Washington
state, have new hope for a cure for Type 1 diabetes, a
debilitating, chronic illness that kills one American every three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Type 1 diabetes (sometimes called juvenile diabetes) is a
complex condition caused when islet cells in the pancreas fail to
produce insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, an unusual consortium of Seattle institutions plans
to resurrect an old idea _ transplanting islet cells from a donor
pancreas into diabetic patients to free them from a lifetime of
insulin injections.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure will be pioneered in Seattle. Centers in Boston
and Miami are expected to begin similar programs in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting a long time for islet cells to become
available,'' Kuechenmeister said. ``It's almost too much to hope
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Although islet cell transplants were first pioneered 15 years
ago, they've been all but discontinued in recent years because
their success rate _ 5 percent to 7 percent _ was so dismal.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers at Virginia Mason Research Center, the
University of Washington and the Pacific Northwest Research
Institute have devised a novel strategy for transplanting islet
cells _ one they believe will increase the success rate at least
tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach combines advances in the understanding of the
biology of diabetes with new drugs for preventing rejection of
transplanted tissues.
</P>
<P>
   It was enticing enough to lure seven institutions, many of which
normally compete for patients and research dollars, to collaborate
on the transplant program.
</P>
<P>
   The seven _ the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the
Pacific Northwest Research Institute, the Puget Sound Blood Center,
Swedish Medical Center, the UW, Virginia Mason Medical Center and
Virginia Mason Research Center _ have joined forces to create the
Seattle Human Islet Transplantation Project.
</P>
<P>
   It recently received $2.3 million from the Juvenile Diabetes
Foundation International.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these people coming together and putting in their piece of
the puzzle _ that's what's so exciting about this grant,'' said Dr.
Paul Robertson, chief executive officer and scientific director of
the Pacific Northwest Research Institute in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diabetes is a problem no one person is going to solve.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, a diabetes expert, wrote the grant and is
orchestrating the project.
</P>
<P>
   The Puget Sound Blood Center is developing new procedures for
isolating and storing the islets, and eventually will serve as an
islet bank for transplant programs on the West Coast, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The research institute, the oldest non-profit biomedical
research institute in the Northwest, is working on the basic
science of islet cell division to try to find a way to grow them in
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The number of transplants is now limited by the supply of donor
pancreases, Robertson said. If scientists can figure out a way to
amplify the cell supply, more diabetics may be able to receive
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The transplant procedures themselves will be done at the UW
Medical Center, Virginia Mason Medical Center and Swedish Medical
Center, all in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In an islet transplant, the islets are separated from the
pancreas and injected into a vein leading to the liver. The
transplanted islets set up shop in the liver, secreting insulin in
response to glucose levels in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Previous attempts at islet cell transplants failed, in part,
because doctors didn't realize that the standard drugs used to
prevent rejection were also accidentally killing the fragile islet
cells before they could begin making insulin, said Dr. Jerry Nepom,
director of Virginia Mason Research Center and one of the
originators of the new protocol.
</P>
<P>
   They also failed to take into account that Type 1 diabetes is an
``autoimmune'' disease, which means that the body is genetically
programmed to attack its own islet cells.
</P>
<P>
   When the first attempts at islet transplantation failed,
researchers thought the problem was the body rejecting foreign
tissue, the classic problem with all organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
   What they didn't realize was that the patient's autoimmune
disease was continuing to attack the new islet cells the same way
it did the old ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle scientists, however, have found a way around that by
using a new regimen of drugs, one that short-circuits the body's
autoimmune response without harming the islet cells.
</P>
<P>
   The new regimen includes Enbrel, a bioengineered drug originally
developed by Immunex Corp. of Seattle to treat rheumatoid
arthritis. The drug cocktail does not include prednisone and
cyclosporine, the two most commonly used anti-rejection drugs, both
of which are toxic to islet cells.
</P>
<P>
   The drug regimen will be tried first on 10 kidney transplant
recipients to make sure it prevents organ rejection.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the program will begin enrolling diabetic kidney
patients for dual transplants (kidneys and islet cells) early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Because one of the main complications of diabetes is kidney
failure, about half the people on the waiting list for new kidneys
are diabetic.
</P>
<P>
   Kuechenmeister, for example, received a kidney from her sister
13 years ago. Although the transplant restored her kidney function,
it did nothing for her underlying diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the drugs she takes to prevent organ rejection make
it more difficult to control her blood sugar. Prednisone is
particularly troublesome for diabetic patients, she said. It can
cause extreme mood swings and other psychiatric side effects.
</P>
<P>
   She is hoping that the combination of new drugs being tested
will someday free her from taking prednisone.
</P>
<P>
   But she is even more excited about the prospect of someday
getting new islet cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I would see it in my lifetime,'' said
Kuechenmeister, who has been following research on diabetes since
the 1970s. ``What they've done in the last couple of years is just
amazing.''

   REDMOND, Wash. _ Ranks and medals are not flaunted at Post 2995.
War stories, particularly the self-aggrandizing type, are
discouraged. The blue organizational cap studded with service pins
is rarely seen here, used only on formal occasions.
</P>
<P>
   In this spacious, 3-year-old building on 148th Avenue that
houses the Eastside's largest post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars
of the United States, there are only two things that count:
</P>
<P>
   Honorable service in the U.S. military in a foreign conflict and
continued service, as a VFW member, to fellow veterans in need of
help.
</P>
<P>
   As 30,000 members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars gather in
Kansas City, Mo., this week to celebrate the 100th anniversary of
America's oldest national veterans organization, local VFW members
continue to work out of the spotlight in a variety of grassroots
programs to help other veterans and citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the reputation that we only drink at the bar and march
in parades,'' said John Kenny, a decorated World War II veteran and
Post 2995 member for 15 years. ``Nothing could be farther from the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Each post has a full-time case officer trained to act as a
go-between for veterans having problems obtaining medical or other
benefits, Kenny said. At each local organization, there is an
appointed ``surgeon'' responsible for visiting hospitalized
veterans with flowers or other gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, the Redmond, Wash., VFW post has run a monthly meals
program for the homeless at a Seattle shelter, gathering to create
several hundred meals and then transporting them to the facility.
``We found that 70 percent of the homeless there were veterans,''
Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   VFW officials and local members say they are saddened that fewer
and fewer Americans have direct connections to the military and to
those who have served in past wars.
</P>
<P>
   Post member Don Leonard, who runs the unit's business affairs,
said, ``I go to the bank, and the teller always asks me, `What is
the VFW?'''
</P>
<P>
   With a membership of 2.1 million veterans, the VFW remains an
influential organization in terms of lobbying in Washington, D.C.,
for veterans' benefits and on behalf of a strong military.
</P>
<P>
   But organization officials say it is an uphill struggle to
maintain an adequate level of medical and other benefits for
retired vets, particularly in the wake of recent budget cuts of 20
percent in the Veterans Affairs medical system.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are 8.1 million living World War II veterans, the
youngest of whom are in their mid-70s, and their requirements for
medical care will increase dramatically in the years ahead, said
Kenny, who works on legislative issues for Post 2995. Another 6
million veterans served in the Korean War era a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   While at national and state headquarters the VFW's focus is on
lobbying to ensure the protection of veterans' rights, local posts
take a more hands-on approach, said Dick Keeton, a senior state VFW
official. ``Our top priority is service work, helping veterans in
hospitals and their family members,'' Keeton said.
</P>
<P>
   Local VFW posts are involved in a wide variety of sponsorship
programs for other civic groups. For instance, Post 2995 provides
space and support for a local Civil Air Patrol chapter. The post
also supports the Marine Corps' annual ``Toys for Tots'' charity
program and provides meeting space for a local Cub Scout pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here to be among my peers,'' said Bud Thackrah, 67, a
retired Bellevue resident whose burly forearms sport tattoos from
his service as a Marine in the Korean War. ``The VFW is my home
away from home, and here there is a great spirit of being with
people who are responsible for ... keeping America free.''
</P>
<P>
   The aging of the World War II and Korean veteran populations has
led to a generational shift within the VFW and other veterans'
groups in recent years. Most of the current leadership positions at
VFW Post 2995 are held by Vietnam-era veterans who have the time
and energy to do the business at hand, Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, a decorated combat veteran of Vietnam with the 1st
Infantry Division, noted he was born the same year _ 1944 _ that
his VFW comrade Kenny arrived in New Guinea to join the 32nd
Infantry Division as a machine gunner in the bloody ``island
hopping'' campaign by Gen. Douglas MacArthur that culminated in the
postwar occupation of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But at Post 2995 neither rank nor date of service matter much.
Other things do.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Thackrah excused himself early from the afternoon
social hour.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for a nighttime mission, sitting at the bedside of a
friend, a Persian Gulf War veteran, who lies near death at the
Seattle VA hospital.

SERENA AND TENNIS: IT FITS HER LIKE A GLOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ For Serena Williams, a professional
tennis career is a lot like a piece of expensive jewelry. She's
trying it on to see how she likes it. The truth? It flatters her
beyond belief.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be working on commission in some tony store to
recognize that tennis accentuates Williams' best features. She has
noticed it, too, but that doesn't mean something else in life's
display window won't grab her eye tomorrow. The tennis-ager is
always shopping for new gems and new journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' peers on the professional tour _ a group that includes
her older sister Venus _ can only hope she stumbles upon something
she considers even more precious than the No. 1 global ranking.
Otherwise, we're not sure anyone can stop her from claiming it for
her collection.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time Compton resident acknowledged Sunday that she is
covetously eyeing Martina Hingis' throne. Williams didn't bat a
lash when a man in the Manhattan Country Club stands serenaded her
with the sweet-sounding ``Number One'' following her straight-sets
victory over JulieHalard-Decugis in the singles final at the Acura
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing it, Williams, who was standing at midcourt,
straightened her posture and gushed to nobody in particular and
everybody in general, ``Yes, No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, she made it clear she hadn't simply gotten
swept up in the moment. ``I wasn't joking at all,'' she said. ``I
definitely feel (the No. 1 ranking) is within my reach.''
</P>
<P>
   So do we, mainly because her reach encompasses every inch of the
tennis surface _ and probably the adjacent food court as well.
Williams is so quick on her feet, balls seem to bounce more slowly
in her court. In the semifinals here, Hingis tied Williams up at
the baseline, then tried dinking the ball over the net with little
success.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Halard-Decugis ran Williams from side to side and up
and down, which made for breathtaking rallies but just one service
break for the Frenchwoman, in the eighth game of the second set. We
don't want to say Williams' athleticism had Halard-Decugis hearing
footsteps, but even when she hit a clean winner Halard-Decugis
could be seen glancing nervously over her shoulder on her way back
to the baseline, as if she half-expected to see the ball flying off
Williams' racket.
</P>
<P>
   Halard-Decugis' first serve might have failed her far too often
Sunday, but words didn't. ``She was too good for me today,'' said
Halard-Decugis, who is ranked No. 11 in the world, two spots behind
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Only one place separates them in the rankings but there is a
world of difference between the two players. Halard-Decugis is 28
and married to her coach. She has short, spiked hair, a lean build
and on Sunday she wore a pleated skirt, an oversized polo shirt and
no jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is 19 and single. She has cornrows and a muscular build
and showed up for the kill in a snug-fitting dress, with gold
jewelry dangling from her ears, neck and wrist.
</P>
<P>
   One is modest, the other flashy, and the way they both hit the
ball is scary. Their pace is hellacious and they have powerful
serves. No wonder Steffi Graf decided to retire. She saw the future
of tennis and it was a heat-seeking missile.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows Williams can hit the fuzz off the ball. On
Sunday, we saw Halard-Decugis handle Williams' serves more deftly
than most and return her lethal ground strokes in kind. Anyone who
watched the match can tell you: To say someone ``hits like a girl''
is high praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both playing pretty powerful,'' said Williams, and
with players like that, who needs No. 1 playing No. 2? If nothing
else, the ousters in the semifinals of top-ranked Hingis and
second-ranked Lindsay Davenport freed us to celebrate the depth of
the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   In Williams' lifetime, women's tennis has come a long way: from
Chris Evert, who made it OK to perspire, to Martina Navratilova,
who made it OK to have muscles, to Steffi Graf, who made it OK to
talk trash.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is the resulting hybrid. In at least one respect,
though, she is refreshingly original. Home-schooled by her mother,
Oracene, Williams speaks with a diction as crisp as her forehand
passing shot. Her speech is sprinkled with words such as
``ameliorate'' and she talks enthusiastically of enrolling in an
art school in Fort Lauderdale in the fall and being out of tennis
by the time she's 23 because ``there's so much more I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   With a perspective as broad as her shoulders, how can Williams
lose?

ROOKIE TEACHERS NOW COME TO CLASS PREPARED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARADISE VALLEY _ In 1987, new teachers were left on their own
as they greeted the incoming Class of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was: `Here's the key to your room, here's the Xerox
machine, here's the books. Go at it,' '' recalled Kathy Wiebke, who
has taught in the Paradise Valley Unified School District since
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen James, who in 1987 began teaching at Eagle Ridge in
Paradise Valley in the Phoenix metropolitanarea, was assigned to a
portable classroom on the outskirts of campus. It was dubbed the
``Pink Flamingo'' to denote its fleabag ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   Though her colleagues were ``a great resource, very
supportive,'' James describes her and others' first-year experience
as somewhat isolating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a whole lot of learning from mistakes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not supposed to happen with today's incoming teachers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new emphasis on giving college students who major in
education more classroom experience before they graduate, and
providing more follow-up after they start teaching, education
college officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise Valley's new mentor system is an example.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Wiebke, James and Julie Salley _ all nationally
certified teachers _ will become Paradise Valley's first
mentor-teachers. They have been relieved of classroom duties so
they can devote all their time to helping first-year teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people leave the profession in the first few years,''
Wiebke said. ``We're there to give them a safety net. We can model
for them, guide them, provide emotional support.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Appleton, Arizona State University's associate dean for
teacher education, said mentoring and practical experience help
newcomers hone their skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The universities have come to recognize what many new teachers
have known for a long time: Teaching is a skill. It takes practice
and time to develop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when education students toiled over
educational theory in college classrooms. Now they're out in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students spend a lot of time in classrooms being mentored by
master teachers. University course work is integrated into that
experience. In elementary education, our largest program, all our
methods courses are site-based. Teachers share in the
responsibility of teaching and supervising our students,'' Appleton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Student teaching used to be education students' first exposure
to the classroom, Wiebke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, student teachers have been in the classroom since they
entered the College of Education. The more experience you have in
the classroom, the more successful you will be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Hanson, who teaches seventh-grade language arts at
Ingleside Middle School in Scottsdale, said that 13 years ago,
student teachers observed only their host teacher. Today's incoming
teachers ``see a variety of techniques and management tools,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Graham, interim dean of the College of Education at Grand
Canyon University, said schools were justifiably criticized in the
1970s and 1980s for directing instruction to the average student.
Today's teachers are taught to individualize their approach, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you came out of a teacher preparation program back then,
you taught to the middle. The kids who were bright and got it did
well. Those with problems fell further and further behind. It was
considered OK for a teacher to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we say there are different kids who learn at a different
pace with different styles. There are two basic styles _ auditory
learners and visual learners. We work on teaching several
strategies to reach all kids, rather than being a one-style
teacher,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's teachers also encourage students to participate in their
learning rather than be passive recipients, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marla Slack, director of the University of Phoenix's Center for
Teacher Education, said classrooms have become more culturally
diverse over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Special education, just emerging as a field of study in the
1980s, is now a specialty in much demand, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Students also have evolved over the past 13 years, educators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think students are now much more aware of standards. Those
expectations weren't around back then,'' Slack said.
</P>
<P>
   Students are getting smarter and more sophisticated, teachers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids today have so much more on the ball,'' Hanson said.
``From what they see on TV and are exposed to in the media, I think
they are a lot less naive than kids in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   That maturity poses a challenge for teachers, Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to tap into innocence and excitement, and sometimes
it's hard to find it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and the Internet have given students more access to
knowledge, the teachers said.
</P>
<P>
   Social issues _ divorce, drug abuse, smoking, teen pregnancy _
were present when the Class of 2000 started kindergarten, and are
still factors today, teachers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems are probably the same, but I think they just get
more air time,'' Hanson said. ``That exacerbates it, makes it look
larger than it is.'' &QL;

SEATTLE RESEARCH GROUP WORKING ON A NEW ATTACK AGAINST DIABETES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Kathleen Kuechenmeister was only 8 when she learned
she had diabetes. Now, nearly four decades later, the disease is
slowly eroding her health. It has destroyed her kidneys, clouded
her sight and damaged nerves, making it difficult to walk.
</P>
<P>
   At 46, she can no longer live alone, for fear of losing
consciousness because her blood sugars have gone out of control.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuechenmeister, and 266,000 others like her in Washington
state, have new hope for a cure for Type 1 diabetes, a
debilitating, chronic illness that kills one American every three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Type 1 diabetes (sometimes called juvenile diabetes) is a
complex condition caused when islet cells in the pancreas fail to
produce insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, an unusual consortium of Seattle institutions plans
to resurrect an old idea _ transplanting islet cells from a donor
pancreas into diabetic patients to free them from a lifetime of
insulin injections.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure will be pioneered in Seattle. Centers in Boston
and Miami are expected to begin similar programs in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting a long time for islet cells to become
available,'' Kuechenmeister said. ``It's almost too much to hope
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Although islet cell transplants were first pioneered 15 years
ago, they've been all but discontinued in recent years because
their success rate _ 5 percent to 7 percent _ was so dismal.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers at Virginia Mason Research Center, the
University of Washington and the Pacific Northwest Research
Institute have devised a novel strategy for transplanting islet
cells _ one they believe will increase the success rate at least
tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach combines advances in the understanding of the
biology of diabetes with new drugs for preventing rejection of
transplanted tissues.
</P>
<P>
   It was enticing enough to lure seven institutions, many of which
normally compete for patients and research dollars, to collaborate
on the transplant program.
</P>
<P>
   The seven _ the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the
Pacific Northwest Research Institute, the Puget Sound Blood Center,
Swedish Medical Center, the UW, Virginia Mason Medical Center and
Virginia Mason Research Center _ have joined forces to create the
Seattle Human Islet Transplantation Project.
</P>
<P>
   It recently received $2.3 million from the Juvenile Diabetes
Foundation International.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these people coming together and putting in their piece of
the puzzle _ that's what's so exciting about this grant,'' said Dr.
Paul Robertson, chief executive officer and scientific director of
the Pacific Northwest Research Institute in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diabetes is a problem no one person is going to solve.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, a diabetes expert, wrote the grant and is
orchestrating the project.
</P>
<P>
   The Puget Sound Blood Center is developing new procedures for
isolating and storing the islets, and eventually will serve as an
islet bank for transplant programs on the West Coast, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The research institute, the oldest non-profit biomedical
research institute in the Northwest, is working on the basic
science of islet cell division to try to find a way to grow them in
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The number of transplants is now limited by the supply of donor
pancreases, Robertson said. If scientists can figure out a way to
amplify the cell supply, more diabetics may be able to receive
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The transplant procedures themselves will be done at the UW
Medical Center, Virginia Mason Medical Center and Swedish Medical
Center, all in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In an islet transplant, the islets are separated from the
pancreas and injected into a vein leading to the liver. The
transplanted islets set up shop in the liver, secreting insulin in
response to glucose levels in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Previous attempts at islet cell transplants failed, in part,
because doctors didn't realize that the standard drugs used to
prevent rejection were also accidentally killing the fragile islet
cells before they could begin making insulin, said Dr. Jerry Nepom,
director of Virginia Mason Research Center and one of the
originators of the new protocol.
</P>
<P>
   They also failed to take into account that Type 1 diabetes is an
``autoimmune'' disease, which means that the body is genetically
programmed to attack its own islet cells.
</P>
<P>
   When the first attempts at islet transplantation failed,
researchers thought the problem was the body rejecting foreign
tissue, the classic problem with all organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
   What they didn't realize was that the patient's autoimmune
disease was continuing to attack the new islet cells the same way
it did the old ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle scientists, however, have found a way around that by
using a new regimen of drugs, one that short-circuits the body's
autoimmune response without harming the islet cells.
</P>
<P>
   The new regimen includes Enbrel, a bioengineered drug originally
developed by Immunex Corp. of Seattle to treat rheumatoid
arthritis. The drug cocktail does not include prednisone and
cyclosporine, the two most commonly used anti-rejection drugs, both
of which are toxic to islet cells.
</P>
<P>
   The drug regimen will be tried first on 10 kidney transplant
recipients to make sure it prevents organ rejection.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the program will begin enrolling diabetic kidney
patients for dual transplants (kidneys and islet cells) early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Because one of the main complications of diabetes is kidney
failure, about half the people on the waiting list for new kidneys
are diabetic.
</P>
<P>
   Kuechenmeister, for example, received a kidney from her sister
13 years ago. Although the transplant restored her kidney function,
it did nothing for her underlying diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the drugs she takes to prevent organ rejection make
it more difficult to control her blood sugar. Prednisone is
particularly troublesome for diabetic patients, she said. It can
cause extreme mood swings and other psychiatric side effects.
</P>
<P>
   She is hoping that the combination of new drugs being tested
will someday free her from taking prednisone.
</P>
<P>
   But she is even more excited about the prospect of someday
getting new islet cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I would see it in my lifetime,'' said
Kuechenmeister, who has been following research on diabetes since
the 1970s. ``What they've done in the last couple of years is just
amazing.''

COLLECTOR `BORN' LIKING EXOTIC CRITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Luke Thirkhill is looking a bit Dr. Dolittle-ish.
</P>
<P>
   A gray-banded king snake is coiled around his neck. A
citron-crested cockatoo is perched on his shoulder. A rare Hawaiian
goose is waddling around his feet, nonchalantly relieving herself
on his shoe.
</P>
<P>
   And in an insulated lunch box nearby, a baby cockatoo is
squawking for her breakfast of bird gruel.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Thirkhill's best friends wear feathers, scales or fur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animal children are born, not made,'' he says. ``I was born
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his mother tells him, he was making bird sounds while he
was still in his crib. He never played with tin soldiers or trucks.
His room was filled with toy animals.
</P>
<P>
   His first memory is of rescuing a neighbor's runaway tortoise at
the base of Camelback Mountain when he was 5. The neighbor let him
keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Thirkhill's fetish for fauna grew. His father, the late
real-estate agent Ed Thirkhill, built a pen in the family's back
yard to house an increasing population of turtles.
</P>
<P>
   His collection expanded to include scorpions, black widows and
tarantulas that lived in an aquarium on a hand-fed diet of
crickets. When he was 6, he began to collect gopher and king
snakes. Then there was the Christmas he was 8 and found a box of
pigeons wrapped up under the tree.
</P>
<P>
   He showed animals at the State Fair for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   When he went away to prep school in 1977, he took along an
assortment of reptiles that were housed at the school's science
center and in his dormitory room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my only pursuit,'' Thirkhill, 38, says of his fondness
for animals. ``It was my only interest and still is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirkhill does more than just collect animals. With almost 200
species of plants and animals represented at his Scottsdale home,
he is a self-styled naturalist who has been a curator at the
Phoenix Zoo and Out of Africa. He likes nothing better than hosting
wildlife lectures with members of his menagerie in tow.
</P>
<P>
   He and his friends are popular hosts. When Norma, the endangered
Hawaiian ne ne, poops in front of a young audience, the kids go
wild.
</P>
<P>
   Bodily functions, it seems, are a crowd-pleaser among the
younger set. Norma is happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Thirkhill's family likes his furry and feathered pals
almost as much as he does. Wife Deborah works for the Phoenix Zoo,
caring for animals used in education programs. She is also the
editor of the ``Journal of the Young'' ``Entomologists' Society''.
</P>
<P>
   Thirkhill met his wife when she answered his ad for an iguana.
They've been married 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Their children, Kelly, 10, and Matthew, 8, help tend the flock
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thirkhill has had the more commonplace dogs and cats as
pets, it's the exotic animals that most intrigue him, especially
birds and reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, he concedes, shy from pets that have no limbs.
Americans are mammal lovers.
</P>
<P>
   But as the white cockatoo with the flared yellow headpiece bobs
happily up and down, Thirkhill explains that such birds are ``love
sponges'' that mate for life. Fowl, he says, can be as affectionate
as canines and easily bond with humans.
</P>
<P>
   Lapbirds? Perhaps. Melolo rubs its feathered head against
Thirkhill's cheek.
</P>
<P>
   The snake Thirkhill is wearing as a choker came from a hunt in
western Texas in 1997. When there's a new moon in Langtree, king
snakes are most active, and collectors converge on towns in the
area to snag the best specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Thirkhill bagged Mr. Dryden in nearby Dryden, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he and his family went on an even grander adventure
to track moths _ ``my latest passion.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Arizona-Mexico border, they camped out overnight with
other amateur and professional entomologists. Against a backdrop of
white sheets, Thirkhill and his wife switched on a mercury vapor
light to attract moths and in minutes were treated to a
lepidopteran fandango of more than 50 species.
</P>
<P>
   Using a popular coffee table book on moths and butterflies as
their guide, they began to spot familiar specimens, including a
rare giant silk moth in shades of brown, black, tan and white with
a 4-inch wingspan.
</P>
<P>
   A stranger stopped by and gasped at the sight, offering to help
identify the beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah suddenly recognized it: Rothschildia cincta cincta,
commonly known as Rothschild's moth. Then she and her husband
recognized the helpful stranger as none other than James Tuttle,
author of their coffee table book. Tuttle was as excited at the
discovery as his hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like two kids fighting over a quarter in the grass,''
Thirkhill says with a laugh, conceding that for most people, ``it's
hard to drum up excitement about moths.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirkhill netted the Rothschild and brought it home to be
mounted. Now the prize of his collection, its beauty will be
preserved forever.
</P>
<P>
   Not only Arizona, but Hollywood has benefited from Thirkhill's
expertise with what he calls ``creepy crawlies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1996, he served as scorpion wrangler for the
Oliver Stone movie ``U-Turn,'' filmed in Superior. Sean Penn
starred as a gambler detoured to Arizona after his car broke down
in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   One scene called for Penn's character to encounter a scorpion
while drinking from a faucet. In almost two dozen takes, Thirkhill
used long forceps to position a pena blanca scorpion on the spigot.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in for the star, Penn's nervous stunt double shook
visibly as he was asked to eyeball the venomous insect.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its frightening reputation, Thirkhill found the scorpion
a reluctant star, crawling out of camera range time and again until
double-sided tape applied to the faucet threads trapped its six
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, producers hired Thirkhill to wrangle scorpions and
tarantulas for ``The Last Point Seen,'' a television movie filmed
in Apache Junction and starring Linda Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Thirkhill's new business is called Sonoran Naturalist, which
will conduct Jeep tours of the desert and present wildlife programs
drawing on his years of experience as a bird, mammal and reptile
keeper at the Phoenix Zoo (he once fed yogurt to Congo the gorilla)
and his five-year stint as curator of reptiles and birds at Out of
Africa. Call (480) 941-9000 for information.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, he drives a bus for Phoenix Country Day School, where
he has also presented his wildlife lectures.
</P>
<P>
   In educating students about preserving animal life, Thirkhill
said, he hopes to encourage young naturalists and foster interest
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Society will benefit, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the road, this generation of children will decide which
animals will be on Noah's Ark and which animals won't, which we
have room for and which we don't as we lose habitats,'' he says.
``My purpose is to inspire an interest so they will take up
wildlife as a career, as a natural history pursuit. This is the
time, when they are young and when they're most impressionable.'' &QL;

CHURCH SUPPORTS ITS JEWISH BROTHERS AND SISTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY HARRISON SHEPPARD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - When a gunman sprayed bullets through the lobby of
the North Valley Jewish Community Center last week, wounding five
people, the Episcopal church next door was ready to help. But that
was no surprise - the church has been working literally
side-by-side with its Jewish neighbors for years now.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their conflicting beliefs, the St. Andrew &AMP; St. Charles
Episcopal Church and the Reform synagogue Temple Beth Torah have
shared the same sanctuary and meeting space for almost a decade.
Christian masses and Jewish Sabbath services are held in the same
room at different times. To prepare, they simply take the cross
down and put up a Torah.
</P>
<P>
   With such a close relationship, the shootings especially hit
home for church members, even though it was targeted at Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're neighbors in a very close sense,'' noted church member
Carol Sherwood of suburban Granada Hills. ``I was glad the church
was here to be open for them. We consider ourselves part of the
same community and we're glad we could be there for part of the
healing.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary inside the church ended up as a literal sanctuary
to the children fleeing the violent scene Tuesday, waiting to be
reunited with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Parish administrator Marv Simmons noted that church officials
tried to speak to as many media representatives as they could ``to
let the world know the Christian community here was 100 percent
behind the community center.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the Rev. Jim Seipel was worried that
congregants would similarly be personally, emotionally affected by
the shooting. In his Sunday service, he cautioned them not to let
fear, anger and hatred into their hearts. By doing so, he said,
they would become just as bad as Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., the
white supremacist who allegedly shot five people at the North
Valley Jewish Community Center next to the church/synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Seipel, who was filling in for the church's regular pastor, who
is on vacation, told the congregation that the worst enemy of God
``is hatred, and it is fear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't live in fear,'' Seipel said. ``There is no tool that
gives itself to evil more easily than fear. When you are in fear,
you are one step away from anger, just as in anger, you are one
step from danger.''

MARINERS GET DANDY EFFORT BY MECHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On a third day at Fenway, the Mariners made you want to
look forward, not back.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up 24 runs in less than 24 hours, they offered
another teasing glimpse at the future, beating the Boston Red Sox
4-3 Sunday behind the strong right arm and cool head of Gil Meche.
</P>
<P>
   They sent a 20-year-old rookie out to do a man's work. Meche
clocked in and out as if he were still at Class AA New Haven, his
place of employment 2{ months ago.
</P>
<P>
   With a little help from red-hot Alex Rodriguez, newcomer Ryan
Jackson and the Mariners bullpen, Meche earned his fourth victory
in six decisions _ and his first on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit his fourth homer in four days and drove in what
turned out to be the winning run with an eighth-inning single. He
was the only Mariner to have his way with Fenway Park throughout
the series, going 6-for-12 with six runs and five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, the moment belonged to the hard-throwing
right-hander from Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has to tell me: I can see what I can do when I throw it
for a strike and when I don't,'' Meche said. ``My best game was my
first victory, but this is the best I've pitched. I made
adjustments. I was in a rhythm out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He allowed just three hits for his second consecutive start. He
retired 13 of the last 14 Red Sox batters he faced, including the
last eight. He closed out his seventh and final inning by getting
three groundouts on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   People worry about a future without Rodriguez and Ken Griffey
Jr. Who knows, a few years down the line, the No. 1 guy on the
Mariners pitching staff _ or even the entire club, for that matter
_ might be Meche.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to go with Meche or Freddy Garcia,'' fellow rookie
pitcher John Halama said, mulling a future Seattle rotation. ``They
have No. 1 stuff. They're power pitchers. There's something there
to think about, though things change every year. We're young and
we're learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Lou Piniella, ``You see a young man who can develop
into an outstanding major league pitcher. With experience, he can
only get better. Let him get a solid year of major league
experience under his belt, then we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   With the season in the tank and pitching a big reason, the
progress of the Mariners' trio of young arms is about the only
thing worth charting. The rookies have taken their lumps at times _
Garcia and Halama got knocked out early in blowouts by the Red Sox
Friday and Saturday _ but collectively they're 24-13.
</P>
<P>
   Meche got into trouble twice against Boston and got hurt just
once. He walked two of the first three batters he faced but emerged
from the first inning unharmed. In the third, he served up
consecutive run-scoring doubles to Brian Daubach and Nomar
Garciaparra after another walk. But he didn't flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw the ball hard. He has good stuff. He has some
skill,'' said Boston third baseman John Valentin, who went 0-for-3,
striking out twice, against Meche. ``If he harnesses his pitches
and gets better control, he could be really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had a hand in every Mariners run. That's not
surprising. When Meche pitches and wins, Rodriguez usually
produces, twice providing grand slams.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Rodriguez drew a leadoff walk, advanced on a
single and passed ball and scored on Jay Buhner's sacrifice fly for
the game's first run. In the fourth, the Mariners shortstop reached
on Garciaparra's fielding error, stole second and scored on
Jackson's single to center, tying the game 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first start after a call-up from Tacoma, Jackson went
2-for-4, singling his first two times up. A year ago, he singled in
his first big-league at-bat with Florida, got sent back to the
minors and singled in his first at-bat when he returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than people think, first impressions are important,''
Jackson said. ``That's generally been my style throughout my career
_ be aggressive. I don't get too far into counts. If I get a pitch,
I'm on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez broke the 2-2 tie with his 31st homer, a two-out blast
to center. He brought in the Mariners' final run with a two-out
single in the eighth, offsetting another RBI double by Garciaparra
in the bottom half of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve Meche's gem, closer Jose Mesa got through the ninth
in impressive fashion for his 25th save in 28 tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing better than getting a win against a pretty tough team
like Boston,'' Meche said.
</P>
<P>
   It took a kid to lead the way.

SEAHAWKS NOT READY FOR `NOW' TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On the eve of his first training-camp practice as
coach and general manager of the Seahawks, Mike Holmgren talked of
the emotional tug-of-war that can result when the coach wants one
thing and the general manager seeks something entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   With his coaching ultraego pushing for tunnel-vision immediacy
on one shoulder and his GM persona prodding for big-picture
understanding on the other, Holmgren is forced to not only listen
but digest the debate before acting.
</P>
<P>
   Those voices returned in the wake of Saturday night's preseason
opener at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   As Holmgren left the field after a 24-10 loss to the Buffalo
Bills, he appeared ready to chew a hole in the dome's concrete
roof. His jaw was locked. His gaze was fixed. His gait was
deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   No wave of acknowledgment to the fans gathered around the tunnel
leading to the Seahawks' locker room. No trace of a smile, not even
that little smirk he seems unable to control.
</P>
<P>
   All week on the practice fields at Eastern Washington
University, Holmgren had stressed playing error-free football. But
Saturday night, the players embarrassed him and themselves by
making the same mistakes he had spent so much time trying to
eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   On the game's second play, defensive tackle Sam Adams jumped
offside. On the first offensive play, tight end Christian Fauria
moved before the ball was snapped. Before the much-anticipated
night was over, backup quarterback Glenn Foley had given the Bills
21 points by losing a fumble and throwing two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   (begin italic) ``Rip 'em. Really let 'em have it. Show 'em this
will not be tolerated. Leave 'em a lasting impression that this
isn't good enough, not if you want to be good,'' (end italic) the
devil on Holmgren's shoulder must have been hollering.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Holmgren, and his players, the angelic voice on
the other shoulder was more persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell he was upset in that we weren't as polished as
he would have liked us to be, and he definitely made the point that
we have a long way to go,'' wide receiver Mike Pritchard said of
Holmgren's postgame talk. ``But it could have been much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren realizes the same thing his players do, but perhaps it
is lost on some fans: This is not as easy as taking a talented
group of players, adding a successful coach with a proven system
and producing an instant juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I look at a game film, it kind of clears up things
for me and I feel better than right after the game,'' Holmgren said
Sunday, after reviewing video of the opener. ``Right after the
game, you're pretty emotional. Of course I wanted to win the game.
But after looking at the film, we did more good things than I
thought we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it will be the mistakes and breakdowns that prevented the
Seahawks from winning that will be the main focus in practice.
</P>
<P>
   As defensive end Michael Sinclair put it, ``It's called
chemistry. You see that in the Los Angeles Lakers. Those guys are
such great players, but without chemistry they're just a regular
team. Mental errors kill chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   The players know what needs to be done. Now they must do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not panicking, but in the same sense there were a lot of
signs going up that we still need to work on a lot of things,''
Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   Work they will, starting Monday morning at EWU. But it will be
an extremely short week for the Seahawks, who play the 49ers in San
Francisco on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   They must improve. They can't afford another lackluster effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think going into that game we'll be a little more intense
and everybody will have a certain sense of urgency,'' Pritchard
said.
</P>
<P>
   If not, it will be harder for Holmgren to keep that devil on his
shoulder at bay.

MORE OOZE THAN AHS IN SEAHAWK PRESEASON OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Seahawks were back in Cheney, Wash., on Sunday.
Where they belong. For now, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has got to go there. I guess it better be us,''
veteran defensive end Michael Sinclair said Saturday night, moments
after the Seahawks' wildly forgettable cameo appearance in The Big
City.
</P>
<P>
   As Gladys Knight used to sing about the midnight train to
Georgia, the Hawks were whistling ``Dixie'' about their postgame
flight back to Spokane, which is like the French Riviera compared
to Cheney, but it won't matter to the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   The dig out of the Behring-Flores-Erickson eras will take longer
than two spring minicamps and half a training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Their 24-10 preseason loss to the Buffalo Bills at the Kingdome
proved that the Mike Holmgren Era sounds better on paper than it
looks on the playing field. For now, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   What other conclusion can you draw when Holmgren uses the word
``pitiful'' to describe the work of the offense?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a total surprise. The offense is a little
behind,'' Holmgren said. ``We're sloppy and we're trying to
emphasize playing cleaner. But that bothered me that we didn't play
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren seemed only slightly relieved that his Seattle debut
came in mid-August, when flubs like this don't work against you in
the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really count,'' the coach said. ``I'm not 0-1,
really.''
</P>
<P>
   See, this is somewhat personal for Holmgren, whom we all know is
much more than the coach. He is the Seahawks, and it is his record
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, in the postgame news conference, Holmgren wore a look
that hinted at potentially serious disappointment in the character
of his new team _ and it is still a new team for him.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not lose patience, but he is not shy about his
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get the first down. I want to score. I want to win.
We were in playground mode out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From everything we've ever seen, there is no ``playground'' mode
anywhere in the West Coast Offense playbook, which is perhaps why
Holmgren could not help but put the blame for poorly executed plays
squarely on the shoulders of players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a concentration thing by an individual player,''
he said. ``Maybe I was expecting too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to the Seahawk with the most explaining to do
this week back in Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be a surprise if many people in the Pacific
Northwest woke up Sunday and said a hearty prayer of thanks for not
being Glenn Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, the Seahawks' backup quarterback, had the misfortune of
firing two consecutive interceptions Saturday, all but annihilating
the Hawks' ability to move the ball.
</P>
<P>
   (Now we know why the NFL goes bananas every time you slip and
make the mistake of calling them ``exhibition'' instead of
``preseason'' games. Because it leads to the inevitable question
about what sort of bad football is exactly being exhibited?)
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who understands tough coaches since it was Bill Parcells
who let Foley loose, left the building without answering questions.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame him?
</P>
<P>
   While the Hawks must leave Cheney early this week for Thursday's
game in San Francisco, Foley knew that his ``quality'' time with
Holmgren up until the departure will be spent in the film room.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Foley had one sweet little TD pass to deflect some
of the blistering tutorial he will no doubt receive.
</P>
<P>
   But when Holmgren repeatedly stops the projector to point out to
Foley the evils of throwing into double coverage, the best Foley
can hope for is that the projector overheats and burns the
celluloid into a puddle of ooze _ which is about the shape the
offense was in most of Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to play better on offense. That's evident,'' said
starting quarterback Jon Kitna, whose outing Holmgren described as
merely ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we were doing some good things, but we had guys
slipping and falling in the one wet spot in the whole stadium. That
kind of cost us. We get a false start. We put ourselves in
situations that were hard to overcome. I fumbled a snap and it
brings us to second and 13,'' Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the little things that continue to stick in my mind.
Those things we need to work on and need to eliminate. Not that
they don't happen every once in awhile. They need to be eliminated,
and we're going to work hard at that. We made strides at camp
already on those little things, and we will continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Kitna think Holmgren would give the team a pass for this
first preseason game chock full of mediocrity and miscues?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was, uhh ... let's just say there was no pass out there,''
Kitna said, without revealing the exact language Holmgren used to
express his disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expects us to go out there and execute and to show we're a
class organization and a class team and that we're able to do the
things that were asked of us,'' Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to have played better. But we don't feel like we let
him down. I don't think this is a letdown. This is just a starting
point. We are establishing an identity.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, Holmgren has more Cheney time to help with the
Hawks' change of identity.

   HATE-GROUP-STRATEGY _ Over the last few years, hate groups in
this country have changed their strategy. Instead of being
organized in identifiable groups, they have fragmented, experts on
terrorism say, with leaders providing the philosophical fodder and
individuals _ called Lone Wolves _ or pairs, doing the killing. The
idea, some experts say, is leaderless resistance and it often makes
it difficult for law enforcement to stop acts of terrorism. By Jo

   NY-WELFARE-CARD (New York) _ A few months ago, the state of New
York gave a new electronic banking card to Margarita O., an

gives her access not to a checking account, but to $448 a month in
government food credits and cash. The card held much promise. She
would have the same access everyone else had to all those automatic

<P>
   &UR; NO OTHER BOOK &QL; 
 &UR; By Randall Jarrell &QL; 
 &UR; (HarperCollins, $27.50) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer remembered much about writing ``The Woman at the
Washington'' ``Zoo'' _ a poem is, so to speak, a way of making you
forget how you wrote it _ but I had almost all the sheets of paper
on which it was written, starting with a paper napkin from the
Methodist Cafeteria. If you had asked me where I had begun the
poem, I'd have said: `Why, sir, at the beginning'; it was a
surprise to me to see that I hadn't.'' This charming passage
introduces Jarrell's essay about the work for which he won a
National Book Award in 1961, and little gems such as it are
everywhere in this collection of criticism and prose. Part of the
pleasure is that you seem to stumble on them unawares, but, of
course, that's an illusion _ such things are never so accidental.
Perhaps it's because Jarrell died in 1965, and his essay
collections have been out of print. More likely, it's because, as
volume editor Brad Leithauser points out, Jarrell was deeply
passionate about the rewards and challenges of literature and
deeply generous in his attention to them. Jarrell notes, for
example, that Marianne Moore's poems ``judge what is said about
them almost as much as poems can so that even one's praise is
hesitant, uncertain of its welcome.'' When you've read William
Carlos Williams' ``Patterson,'' he says, ``You know for the rest of
your life what it is like to be a waterfall.'' And Malraux ``writes
a passage of ordinary exposition so that we breathe irregularly and
jerk our heads from side to side like spectators at a tennis
match.'' Other subjects include Robert Frost, W.H. Auden and
reading itself. ``Mediocrity,'' he writes, ``may often give us
unqualified pleasure; it does not disturb our self-satisfaction but
rather encourages us with the thought that we are as good as
another. . . . Properly speaking, we learn only from those books we
cannot judge.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; GONE BOY &QL; 
 &UR; By Gregory Gibson (Kodansha, $24) &QL; 
On Dec. 14, 1992, Gibson's 18-year-old son, Galen, was killed by a
fellow student at a small college in Massachusetts (the murderer,
Wayne Lo, went on a random shooting spree that left four people
wounded and two dead). With the dreadful phone call that woke them
that night, Gibson, his wife and their younger children embarked on
a process that all parents dread, one that took them through
disbelief, anger, confusion, frustration and obsession. Gibson
filed a lawsuit against the college (its staff had intercepted
ammunition that Lo had ordered through the mail, then passed it on
to Lo unopened), but the case dragged on until Gibson was so filled
with rage that he felt capable of murder himself. He set out to
free himself, in a sense, by looking at the facts of his son's
death and writing this book. In it, he interviews witnesses, Lo's
friends, attorneys, the gun dealer who sold Lo his weapon _ and
finds himself reacting to them in surprising ways. But the climax
of his book comes when he meets the parents of Wayne Lo _ sweet,
wounded people whose son, like Gibson's, is lost to them. Sad,
sometimes funny, beautifully written (Gibson is an antiquarian book
dealer) and ultimately triumphant, this is the story of a father's
journey through grief and his refusal to be destroyed by it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ONE YEAR OFF &QL; 
 &UR; By David Elliot Cohen  &QL; 
 &UR; (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We read the parts about Italy first and were dismayed to learn
that Cohen was so cowed by Italian drivers that in Florence he
actually paid one of them to park his car for him. This did not
bode well for our enjoyment of his book, and sure enough, we found
it to be a bit of a trial. Here's the hook: Cohen turned 40 and,
sensing a midlife crisis on the horizon, decided he should sell his
small publishing business and his house, take his kids out of
school (the oldest was 8) and spend a year traveling around the
world. His wife agreed to this, which seems shockingly adventurous
for people who can't park a car in Florence. But we digress: This
book is a collection of ``adventures, anecdotes and minor
epiphanies'' from their year off, served up as e-mail letters they
sent to their friends. Some of it is great fun. Some of it is . . .
well, ``kid'' anecdotes, which as we all know are entertaining in
direct proportion to your degree of affiliation with the kids in
question. Kara and Willie were bored at a volcano in Costa Rica but
fascinated by the ubiquitous dog poop in Paris, and Cohen has
quotes to prove it. More interesting is the fact that the family
traveled more than 50,000 miles in 13 months for less money than it
would have cost to live in California for that time. And they'd do
it again in a heartbeat despite the ennui and the dog poop. This is
not a true travel book, but if you have kids and are looking for
inspiration, it might be for you. &QL; 
 &UR; ANNE FRANK &QL; 
 &UR; By Melissa Muller (Owl, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Muller's biography of Frank, new in paperback, includes
references to five previously unpublished pages of Anne's diary in
which she criticizes her parents' marriage and expresses her wish
that the diary be kept out of her family's hands. Anne's father
kept these pages separate from the rest of her diary and gave them
to a friend just before his death in 1980. News of their existence
caused a stir last year, and holders of the Anne Frank copyright
denied Muller permission to quote them directly. That seems shoddy
in light of the final pages of this book, which contain a note from
Miep Gies, the woman who helped the Frank family during the two
years when they were in hiding. How did she find the courage to do
it? ``Of course, it takes courage to do one's duty as a human
being, of course, one has to be prepared to make certain
sacrifices,'' she writes. ``But that's true in many of life's
situations.'' &QL;

TOP TWO SHOW VALUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense has ranked near
the bottom of the National League for a reason. Production from the
top two batters in the order has been nonexistent, leaving
frustrated No. 3 hitter Gary Sheffield with just 59 RBI even though
he is batting .314.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday night's 5-4 loss to the Atlanta Braves, the Dodgers
saw how important their top two hitters, Eric Young and Mark
Grudzielanek, can be.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took leads of 3-0 and 4-2 with the help of Young,
who had two hits and two runs. Young was back in the lineup Sunday
after taking Saturday off. Friday night he was activated from the
disabled list after missing 18 games with a sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, the Dodgers' No. 2 hitter, had three singles in
his first three at-bats and gave the Dodgers a 3-0 lead with an RBI
single in the second inning. He made it 4-2 after opening the fifth
with a basehit and later scoring on a bases-loaded walk to Devon
White.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this spot and I think I'm getting more selective at the
plate,'' said Grudzielanek, a noted free swinger. ``This is the
part of the order that has been a trouble spot this year, but I
think we are making improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Young and Grudzielanek's early success stalled, however, and
they made outs in their last seven at-bats. The Dodgers loaded the
bases three times in the last four innings but did not score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some good things up there early in the game,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``But we couldn't get it done at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Double steal: Catcher Paul LoDuca, who started in place of
Todd Hundley, helped chase left-hander Tom Glavine with a
seventh-inning single, but he will be best remembered for stealing
home in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca, batting .460 (6 for 13) since his Aug. 3 recall from
Triple-A Albuquerque, reached on an infield single with one out. He
was sacrificed to second and went to third on an infield hit by
Young. With Grudzielanek at the plate, Young took off for second.
When Braves catcher Eddie Perez threw to second, LoDuca took off
and stole home.
</P>
<P>
   It was Young's 33rd stolen base of the season but the first of
LoDuca's career.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: Braves right-hander John Smoltz, who left
Saturday's game with one out in the sixth with a strained groin,
felt much better Sunday and will not miss his next start. . . .
Brian Jordan's two home runs marked the sixth time he has done that
in his career and the first time since July 19, 1996, when he
played for St. Louis. Jordan's homers, Nos. 21 and 22, were the
149th and 150th homers allowed by Dodgers pitchers this year. The
record for most opponent home runs is 173 in 1958. The Braves won
the season series with the Dodgers 5-4, marking the seventh time
this decade that has happened. . . . When Young was caught stealing
in the 10th inning, it ended a streak of successful Dodgers stolen
base attempts at 12, a streak that began Aug. 9 in New York. . . .
Braves third baseman Chipper Jones had reached base in 39
consecutive games before going 0 for 5 Sunday.

GOVERNOR ADDRESSES UNITY RALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY HARRISON SHEPPARD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Standing together against the forces of hatred and
intolerance, Attorney General Janet Reno, Gov. Gray Davis and a
host of political and religious leaders on Sunday denounced racial
and ethnic hatred and demanded stricter gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must confront hate,'' Reno said. ``We must not back down.
We must speak out against hatred and prejudice everywhere we find
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 people flocked to California State University,
Northridge, for the Unity Rally, organized by local Jewish groups
to honor the five victims shot Tuesday at the North Valley Jewish
Community Center and the mail carrier who died of multiple gunshot
wounds in suburban Chatsworth only a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., a neo-Nazi from Washington state, has
been charged with the shootings and could face the death penalty if
convicted. According to authorities, Furrow admitted to targeting
the JCC as a ``wake-up call'' for Americans to start killing Jews,
and said he murdered Filipino-American mail carrier Joseph Santos
Ileto because he was not white and he was a federal employee.
</P>
<P>
   The rally also saluted the heroes of the shootings: the
paramedics, police officers, camp counselors and others who offered
medical assistance and psychological support to those traumatized
by the events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their quick and brave behavior saved lives,'' said Nancy
Parris Moskowitz, president of the North Valley JCC.
</P>
<P>
   A ``unity garden'' will be planted at the center to honor both
victims and heroes, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who signed a strict anti-assault weapons law last month,
said he would continue to work for even tougher gun-control
measures. As a Vietnam veteran, he said, he has seen firsthand the
damage assault weapons can cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a place in the theater of war. They have no place in
a civilized society,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he is asking local and state law enforcement
agencies to help community centers beef up their security and that
financial assistance will be made available to those centers. He
added that tolerance has to be taught to children as a tenet of
society, as important as life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan raised their voices
over the shouts of a few Jewish militants who believe violence
should be met with force - not a message of unity and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center said it was
more than just the availability of guns or the fact that Furrow
once tried to commit himself to a mental hospital that created the
seeds of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buford Furrow was a hater before he even took a pill, and he
was a bigot before he even saw his first gun,'' Hier said.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Israel, through its acting consul general Uri
Palti, sent condolences to the Ileto family and the five JCC
victims, and thanked the city for its strong response to the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of the state of Israel and the people of Israel,
today our hearts beat as one with you,'' Palti said.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan urged Angelenos to resist fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot let the actions of a hopeless, desperate person with
hatred in his heart dictate the way we lead our lives,'' Riordan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish leaders agreed, saying that anti-Semitic groups like
Aryan Nations, which counted Furrow as a member, will not scare
them. They noted that the Jewish people have been persecuted many
times in the past, most notably during the Holocaust, and always
managed to survive their oppressors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not afraid,'' said Abraham Foxman, national director of
the Anti-Defamation League, who flew in from New York for the
rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only because we have faith, but because we are not alone.
... Let the Buford Furrows of this world be afraid, for the good
people of this world will put them back under the rocks from which
they came.''
</P>
<P>
   The most seriously wounded victim of the shooting at the North
Valley Jewish Community Center and the only one still in the
hospital was upgraded from critical to serious condition this
weekend. &QL; 
Five-year-old Benjamin Kadish was attending the Jewish day camp
when he was shot in the thigh and seriously wounded in the abdomen,
losing almost half his blood.

   Members of the Jewish Federation of Greater Phoenix took a break
under a tree on the Oviatt lawn in a day that included flying into
Los Angeles, visiting the Museum of Tolerance, participating in the
rally and flying home.
</P>
<P>
   The group meets with its local police department annually to
discuss security at its center, but Tuesday's shooting gave it
pause to think again, its leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balance is very difficult between open and welcoming and
what is appropriate security,'' said federation President Neil
Hiller.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the lawn, opinions on what should happen next
varied from a call for Furrow to receive the death penalty to gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Alan and Helen Rubenstein, their daughter Emily, 12, and son
Todd, 5, all brought picket signs but had to take the stakes out at
the request of organizers. Officials were worried about anything
being available for use as a weapon, Alan Rubenstein said he was
told.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the signs read, ``Don't be scared, be prepared'' and
``Anti-hate and gun control legislation now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rubensteins, residents of nearby Encino, said too many
members of the Jewish community are in denial that violence against
them can take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson of the Holocaust was that by the time you got to
Auschwitz, it was too late,'' said Alan Rubenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews in the crowd expressed resilience in the face of
terrorism. Ricardo Felman, whose 18-year-old daughter Michelle led
day campers from the North Valley Jewish Community Center on a tour
of the Museum of Tolerance the day of the attack, said he had a
message to hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop attacking us, because the more you attack us, the more
unified we'll be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Malinoff said it has been 19 years since he was program
director at the center, but that connection spurred him to come and
let racist groups know ``we won't back off.''
</P>
<P>
   Malinoff added that he occasionally worried about terrorist
attacks during his time at the center, but still believed in
boundaries that at one time would have kept the center's
preschoolers safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought that someone would attack a center or
certainly attack children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hiller agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at our society. You look at Columbine, you look at
Georgia. I don't think we can imagine what some of these people are
imagining,'' he said.

   LOS ANGELES - Declaring war against hatred and bigotry, about
2,000 people gathered for a Unity Rally at California State
University, Northridge, on Sunday, vowing to fight for a new era of
racial tolerance in the aftermath of last week's rampage through
the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those poor children, and that poor mailman,'' said Abigail
Sussman of suburban North Hills, referring to the slaying of mail
carrier Joseph Santos Ileto and wounding of five people at the
North Valley Jewish Community Center by a gunman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just going about everyday life when that monster
pounced in and attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to start a war of our own - a war of peace to end the
unraveling moral fabric in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally attracted people from across the southwestern United
States, though most, like the 25 members of the Unitarian
Universalist Church in the community of Canoga Park, came from the
Valley area to show their belief in justice and love.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't let hatred control our community, not on our watch,''
said the Rev. Gail Geisenhainer.
</P>
<P>
   Participants from as far away as Phoenix, San Diego and Nevada,
joined Gov. Gray Davis, Mayor Richard Riordan and U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno for the Unity Rally to show that Americans
overwhelmingly denounce the ``lone wolf'' attack that has led to
filing capital punishment charges against 37-year-old white
supremacist Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. in state and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The rally came six days after Tuesday's attack at the Jewish
Community Center in Granada Hills that left three small boys and
two staff members wounded. Ileto was gunned down an hour later in
suburban Chatsworth because he was a Filipino and federal employee,
according to Furrow's confession.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participants were dozens of Filipino immigrants - many
of them World War II veterans - who came to express their sorrow
for the slain postal worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filipinos are a quiet minority who come to this country
searching for a better life. We want peace, not trouble. We want
life, not to be targeted by racists,'' said 75-year-old Anistacio
Agbunag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are out here with Jews, blacks, whites and Asians to show
that we will not stand for this behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally was marred by a disruption by a pair of Jewish
militants, including former Valley Jewish Defense League leader Irv
Rubin. They disrupted Davis' speech, booing and shouting at him.
Last month, Davis signed laws restricting gun purchases and
tightening the ban on assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Davis said one of the best ways to honor
those wounded and killed in Tuesday's rampage is to ``rid our
streets of assault weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin responded by shouting ``The Second Amendment is just as
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis continued by saying that as a Vietnam War veteran, he
knows assault weapons have ``no place in civilized society.''
</P>
<P>
   The hecklers handed out fliers to crowd members that read
``Don't leave yourself unarmed against those who want to murder
you. Gun control laws are only observed by decent people and haters
aren't decent.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people threw the fliers on the ground. Some tore them up.
</P>
<P>
   Their disruption did little to detract from the rally's message
that peace is the greatest weapon against hate.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Grace-Watkins, an African-American, said her children used
to spend the better part of their summers swimming at the North
Valley Jewish Community Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We care about the cause,'' she said. ``People have to open
their hearts to each other.''

   LOS ANGELES - Noli Wiesen had to do something.
</P>
<P>
   The image of distraught parents waiting to be reunited with
their children at the North Valley Jewish Community Center, where a
gunman wounded five people Tuesday, struck home for the Santa
Clarita mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe what was happening in my neighborhood,''
said Wiesen, 30, who grew up in Granada Hills and had participated
in activities at the center as a little girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart went out to those people. I wanted to do something
for those children,'' said Wiesen, who has a 4-year-old boy named
Michael.
</P>
<P>
   So Wiesen, a publicist who operates a marketing business from
her home, got on the phone and began calling Valley businesses,
such as Western Bagel Too in Granada Hills and Brunswick Matador
Bowl in the community of Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesen is asking businesses to contribute the contents for goody
baskets she will put together and deliver to children returning to
the center on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragic event, and we all feel bad about it. We wanted
to do something,'' said Skip Scheidt, chief operating officer of
Western Bagel Too, which makes it company policy to donate to
charitable causes.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Frost, general manager of Brunswick Matador Bowl, felt the
same way. Frost wants to do whatever he can to help the children,
whether it's free bowling games for the youngsters or fund-raising
parties for the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very close to home,'' explained Frost, who has six
children and three grandchildren of his own. ``We're not doing it
for the publicity. We're doing it because we have lots of kids of
our own, and it's a sad thing that this person did.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiesen said she hopes the goody baskets lift the spirits of the
returning children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, What if I can bring something so they can have a
smile when they come back?'' Wiesen said. ``It's going to be
hard.''

<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ President Clinton, his wife, his daughter
and his mother-in-law piled into the family Air Force C-20 Sunday
morning and went house-hunting in Westchester County, where they
made five stops and paused to schmooze with neighbors-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton prepares to leave public life and Hillary Rodham
Clinton gears up for an effort to join it, the family swept through
the wealthy New York City suburbs with about as much casualness as
one can muster when accompanied by a black sedan, two sport-utility
vehicles, three police cruisers and four mini-vans.
</P>
<P>
   They even stopped for (most) stop signs.
</P>
<P>
   Two aides trundled off the plane with heavy coolers, apparently
packed to ensure that the Clintons could concentrate on the task at
hand instead of having to search for a drive-through. And they were
pretty diligent: The first family had planned to stay for less than
four hours, but wound up riding around for more than six.
</P>
<P>
   They announced no decision. Aides have said the president and
Mrs. Clinton definitely plan to move to Westchester, although they
may rent instead of buying. The couple were accompanied by Chelsea
and Mrs. Clinton's mother, Dorothy Rodham, for a trip that was
labeled ``private time'' by the White House, but which was taken at
government expense.
</P>
<P>
   Before the White House, the Clintons had been living in the
Governor's Mansion in Arkansas, and have no home to return to when
he leaves office in 2001. And if Mrs. Clinton is to run for senate
next year, she must establish a residence in New York by election
day.
</P>
<P>
   At one stop, according to witnesses, Clinton wandered out the
kitchen door to kibbitz with friends of the homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Manhattan or the Hamptons, where such an exercise
might be greeted with pointed indifference, crowds waited for hours
outside two of the houses, and several curious people made U-turns
to see what the commotion was about. While many people complained
about the intrusion, they still stood and gawked.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest throng gathered outside a four-story house that is
swathed in pale-pink stucco and shaded by a weeping-willow tree,
with a marble foyer and a pool out back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's in there checking the kitchen, maybe flushing a toilet,
looking for leaks,'' said Steven M. Green, 55, a hand surgeon who
lives a block away.
</P>
<P>
   A baby shower across the street broke up as the revelers spilled
outside, where they were greeted by Secret Service agents wielding
magnetic wands. The honoree, Suzanne Stauffer, 35, said gamely,
``This was supposed to be a surprise shower, and I'm sure
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The excursion took the Clintons down winding roads loaded with
country clubs and tree-shrouded estates with fountains in front.
Even though the houses were mostly seven-figure offerings on
private roads or behind iron gates, several homeowners said they
believed the first family would improve property values if they
moved in.
</P>
<P>
   The first family finished the day in Edgemont, at a $1.7 million
hilltop house on a corkscrew of a major street known to locals as
``Suicide Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   A local resident, Jon Cramer, 44, said he doubted that Mrs.
Clinton would prevail if she decides to run for the Senate, where
she most likely would face New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she'll move in, lose the election, move out and leave
the imprimatur on the neighborhood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Mitchell, who lives two blocks from the Edgemont house,
was one of many who said they believed the hoopla would die down in
a hurry. ``We have a number of celebrities around here _ I'm
constantly bumping into David Hartman,'' she said. ``After a
fashion, it would become everyday.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Plenty of people fretted about the traffic, but Anna Dekker, 47,
said, ``I don't think I'm going to run into them in C-Town,''
referring to a local grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Glassman, 27, a computer consultant who lives near the
Edgemont house and was wearing a T-shirt from the Black Dog on
Martha's Vineyard _ where the Clintons have vacationed _ said he
saw political overtones to the search. ``They want to look like
they're doing what the average Joe would do,'' he said. ``It is
kind of cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The first stop was in the village of Rye Brook, where the
Clintons disappeared down a long drive at a house labeled
``Brokenwood.'' A house with a swing set is next door, modest
split-levels across the street. A woman in a black Mercedes station
wagon rolled down her window and asked what was up. When reporters
and aides hesitated briefly, she said with irritation, ``I live
right here. What's going on?'' No one said a word, but suddenly a
light dawned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me,'' she said, looking stricken. ``President
Clinton! Come on! Oh, come on.'' She zoomed away.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was Pound Ridge, which was remote enough to make
cellular-phone use problematic for the Clintons' entourage. Their
third stop was at a home in Mamaroneck, but reporters were
prevented from seeing the house.
</P>
<P>
   After that, they headed for New Rochelle. William O'Shaughnessy,
a local broadcast executive, said the interior of the house they
saw is heavy on velvet and velour. ``In Arkansas, this is a
mansion,'' he said. ``Here, it's a substantial manor house.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Myrna Root, who has been inside many times,
described the architectural style as ``Mediterranean, with a hint
of Tudor.''
</P>
<P>
   An owner of the house, Vic Vuksanaj, said the Clintons ``liked
everything they saw. They haven't decided anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the traffic jam, Phil Papa, 33, said, ``This is a
reality check about what would happen if you had a former president
in your neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But the objections seemed to melt when, in their only contact
with the public Sunday, the president and Mrs. Clinton came outside
and signed autographs for neighbors, who had been corralled behind
a candy-striped rope. Clinton wore a yellow Oxford shirt, a blue
blazer, brown slacks and brown shoes, while Mrs. Clinton had on a
dark suit. Mrs. Clinton accepted a kiss from a man in the crowd who
said she would be a great senator.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Clinton had ducked into the silver Suburban with five
antennas that was ferrying the family. The crowd cheered for her
and, as if answering a curtain call, she emerged and grinned as she
shook hands. Clinton patted his daughter on the back, and rubbed
his wife's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Burrell, 38, said she would love to have Mrs. Clinton as
a neighbor. ``She seems very normal,'' Ms. Burrell said as the
motorcade fired its engines. ``Very normal.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO OTHER BOOK &QL; 
 &UR; By Randall Jarrell &QL; 
 &UR; (HarperCollins, $27.50) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer remembered much about writing ``The Woman at the
Washington'' ``Zoo'' _ a poem is, so to speak, a way of making you
forget how you wrote it _ but I had almost all the sheets of paper
on which it was written, starting with a paper napkin from the
Methodist Cafeteria. If you had asked me where I had begun the
poem, I'd have said: `Why, sir, at the beginning'; it was a
surprise to me to see that I hadn't.'' This charming passage
introduces Jarrell's essay about the work for which he won a
National Book Award in 1961, and little gems such as it are
everywhere in this collection of criticism and prose. Part of the
pleasure is that you seem to stumble on them unawares, but, of
course, that's an illusion _ such things are never so accidental.
Perhaps it's because Jarrell died in 1965, and his essay
collections have been out of print. More likely, it's because, as
volume editor Brad Leithauser points out, Jarrell was deeply
passionate about the rewards and challenges of literature and
deeply generous in his attention to them. Jarrell notes, for
example, that Marianne Moore's poems ``judge what is said about
them almost as much as poems can so that even one's praise is
hesitant, uncertain of its welcome.'' When you've read William
Carlos Williams' ``Patterson,'' he says, ``You know for the rest of
your life what it is like to be a waterfall.'' And Malraux ``writes
a passage of ordinary exposition so that we breathe irregularly and
jerk our heads from side to side like spectators at a tennis
match.'' Other subjects include Robert Frost, W.H. Auden and
reading itself. ``Mediocrity,'' he writes, ``may often give us
unqualified pleasure; it does not disturb our self-satisfaction but
rather encourages us with the thought that we are as good as
another. . . . Properly speaking, we learn only from those books we
cannot judge.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; GONE BOY &QL; 
 &UR; By Gregory Gibson (Kodansha, $24) &QL; 
On Dec. 14, 1992, Gibson's 18-year-old son, Galen, was killed by a
fellow student at a small college in Massachusetts (the murderer,
Wayne Lo, went on a random shooting spree that left four people
wounded and two dead). With the dreadful phone call that woke them
that night, Gibson, his wife and their younger children embarked on
a process that all parents dread, one that took them through
disbelief, anger, confusion, frustration and obsession. Gibson
filed a lawsuit against the college (its staff had intercepted
ammunition that Lo had ordered through the mail, then passed it on
to Lo unopened), but the case dragged on until Gibson was so filled
with rage that he felt capable of murder himself. He set out to
free himself, in a sense, by looking at the facts of his son's
death and writing this book. In it, he interviews witnesses, Lo's
friends, attorneys, the gun dealer who sold Lo his weapon _ and
finds himself reacting to them in surprising ways. But the climax
of his book comes when he meets the parents of Wayne Lo _ sweet,
wounded people whose son, like Gibson's, is lost to them. Sad,
sometimes funny, beautifully written (Gibson is an antiquarian book
dealer) and ultimately triumphant, this is the story of a father's
journey through grief and his refusal to be destroyed by it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ONE YEAR OFF &QL; 
 &UR; By David Elliot Cohen  &QL; 
 &UR; (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We read the parts about Italy first and were dismayed to learn
that Cohen was so cowed by Italian drivers that in Florence he
actually paid one of them to park his car for him. This did not
bode well for our enjoyment of his book, and sure enough, we found
it to be a bit of a trial. Here's the hook: Cohen turned 40 and,
sensing a midlife crisis on the horizon, decided he should sell his
small publishing business and his house, take his kids out of
school (the oldest was 8) and spend a year traveling around the
world. His wife agreed to this, which seems shockingly adventurous
for people who can't park a car in Florence. But we digress: This
book is a collection of ``adventures, anecdotes and minor
epiphanies'' from their year off, served up as e-mail letters they
sent to their friends. Some of it is great fun. Some of it is . . .
well, ``kid'' anecdotes, which as we all know are entertaining in
direct proportion to your degree of affiliation with the kids in
question. Kara and Willie were bored at a volcano in Costa Rica but
fascinated by the ubiquitous dog poop in Paris, and Cohen has
quotes to prove it. More interesting is the fact that the family
traveled more than 50,000 miles in 13 months for less money than it
would have cost to live in California for that time. And they'd do
it again in a heartbeat despite the ennui and the dog poop. This is
not a true travel book, but if you have kids and are looking for
inspiration, it might be for you. &QL; 
 &UR; ANNE FRANK &QL; 
 &UR; By Melissa Muller (Owl, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Muller's biography of Frank, new in paperback, includes
references to five previously unpublished pages of Anne's diary in
which she criticizes her parents' marriage and expresses her wish
that the diary be kept out of her family's hands. Anne's father
kept these pages separate from the rest of her diary and gave them
to a friend just before his death in 1980. News of their existence
caused a stir last year, and holders of the Anne Frank copyright
denied Muller permission to quote them directly. That seems shoddy
in light of the final pages of this book, which contain a note from
Miep Gies, the woman who helped the Frank family during the two
years when they were in hiding. How did she find the courage to do
it? ``Of course, it takes courage to do one's duty as a human
being, of course, one has to be prepared to make certain
sacrifices,'' she writes. ``But that's true in many of life's
situations.'' &QL;

ROOKIE TEACHERS NOW COME TO CLASS PREPARED

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARADISE VALLEY _ In 1987, new teachers were left on their own
as they greeted the incoming Class of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was: `Here's the key to your room, here's the Xerox
machine, here's the books. Go at it,' '' recalled Kathy Wiebke, who
has taught in the Paradise Valley Unified School District since
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen James, who in 1987 began teaching at Eagle Ridge in
Paradise Valley in the Phoenix metropolitanarea, was assigned to a
portable classroom on the outskirts of campus. It was dubbed the
``Pink Flamingo'' to denote its fleabag ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   Though her colleagues were ``a great resource, very
supportive,'' James describes her and others' first-year experience
as somewhat isolating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a whole lot of learning from mistakes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not supposed to happen with today's incoming teachers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new emphasis on giving college students who major in
education more classroom experience before they graduate, and
providing more follow-up after they start teaching, education
college officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise Valley's new mentor system is an example.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Wiebke, James and Julie Salley _ all nationally
certified teachers _ will become Paradise Valley's first
mentor-teachers. They have been relieved of classroom duties so
they can devote all their time to helping first-year teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people leave the profession in the first few years,''
Wiebke said. ``We're there to give them a safety net. We can model
for them, guide them, provide emotional support.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Appleton, Arizona State University's associate dean for
teacher education, said mentoring and practical experience help
newcomers hone their skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The universities have come to recognize what many new teachers
have known for a long time: Teaching is a skill. It takes practice
and time to develop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when education students toiled over
educational theory in college classrooms. Now they're out in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students spend a lot of time in classrooms being mentored by
master teachers. University course work is integrated into that
experience. In elementary education, our largest program, all our
methods courses are site-based. Teachers share in the
responsibility of teaching and supervising our students,'' Appleton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Student teaching used to be education students' first exposure
to the classroom, Wiebke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, student teachers have been in the classroom since they
entered the College of Education. The more experience you have in
the classroom, the more successful you will be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Hanson, who teaches seventh-grade language arts at
Ingleside Middle School in Scottsdale, said that 13 years ago,
student teachers observed only their host teacher. Today's incoming
teachers ``see a variety of techniques and management tools,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Graham, interim dean of the College of Education at Grand
Canyon University, said schools were justifiably criticized in the
1970s and 1980s for directing instruction to the average student.
Today's teachers are taught to individualize their approach, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you came out of a teacher preparation program back then,
you taught to the middle. The kids who were bright and got it did
well. Those with problems fell further and further behind. It was
considered OK for a teacher to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we say there are different kids who learn at a different
pace with different styles. There are two basic styles _ auditory
learners and visual learners. We work on teaching several
strategies to reach all kids, rather than being a one-style
teacher,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's teachers also encourage students to participate in their
learning rather than be passive recipients, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marla Slack, director of the University of Phoenix's Center for
Teacher Education, said classrooms have become more culturally
diverse over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Special education, just emerging as a field of study in the
1980s, is now a specialty in much demand, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Students also have evolved over the past 13 years, educators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think students are now much more aware of standards. Those
expectations weren't around back then,'' Slack said.
</P>
<P>
   Students are getting smarter and more sophisticated, teachers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids today have so much more on the ball,'' Hanson said.
``From what they see on TV and are exposed to in the media, I think
they are a lot less naive than kids in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   That maturity poses a challenge for teachers, Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to tap into innocence and excitement, and sometimes
it's hard to find it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and the Internet have given students more access to
knowledge, the teachers said.
</P>
<P>
   Social issues _ divorce, drug abuse, smoking, teen pregnancy _
were present when the Class of 2000 started kindergarten, and are
still factors today, teachers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems are probably the same, but I think they just get
more air time,'' Hanson said. ``That exacerbates it, makes it look
larger than it is.'' &QL;

COLLECTOR `BORN' LIKING EXOTIC CRITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Luke Thirkhill is looking a bit Dr. Dolittle-ish.
</P>
<P>
   A gray-banded king snake is coiled around his neck. A
citron-crested cockatoo is perched on his shoulder. A rare Hawaiian
goose is waddling around his feet, nonchalantly relieving herself
on his shoe.
</P>
<P>
   And in an insulated lunch box nearby, a baby cockatoo is
squawking for her breakfast of bird gruel.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Thirkhill's best friends wear feathers, scales or fur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animal children are born, not made,'' he says. ``I was born
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his mother tells him, he was making bird sounds while he
was still in his crib. He never played with tin soldiers or trucks.
His room was filled with toy animals.
</P>
<P>
   His first memory is of rescuing a neighbor's runaway tortoise at
the base of Camelback Mountain when he was 5. The neighbor let him
keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Thirkhill's fetish for fauna grew. His father, the late
real-estate agent Ed Thirkhill, built a pen in the family's back
yard to house an increasing population of turtles.
</P>
<P>
   His collection expanded to include scorpions, black widows and
tarantulas that lived in an aquarium on a hand-fed diet of
crickets. When he was 6, he began to collect gopher and king
snakes. Then there was the Christmas he was 8 and found a box of
pigeons wrapped up under the tree.
</P>
<P>
   He showed animals at the State Fair for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   When he went away to prep school in 1977, he took along an
assortment of reptiles that were housed at the school's science
center and in his dormitory room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my only pursuit,'' Thirkhill, 38, says of his fondness
for animals. ``It was my only interest and still is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirkhill does more than just collect animals. With almost 200
species of plants and animals represented at his Scottsdale home,
he is a self-styled naturalist who has been a curator at the
Phoenix Zoo and Out of Africa. He likes nothing better than hosting
wildlife lectures with members of his menagerie in tow.
</P>
<P>
   He and his friends are popular hosts. When Norma, the endangered
Hawaiian ne ne, poops in front of a young audience, the kids go
wild.
</P>
<P>
   Bodily functions, it seems, are a crowd-pleaser among the
younger set. Norma is happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Thirkhill's family likes his furry and feathered pals
almost as much as he does. Wife Deborah works for the Phoenix Zoo,
caring for animals used in education programs. She is also the
editor of the ``Journal of the Young'' ``Entomologists' Society''.
</P>
<P>
   Thirkhill met his wife when she answered his ad for an iguana.
They've been married 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Their children, Kelly, 10, and Matthew, 8, help tend the flock
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thirkhill has had the more commonplace dogs and cats as
pets, it's the exotic animals that most intrigue him, especially
birds and reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, he concedes, shy from pets that have no limbs.
Americans are mammal lovers.
</P>
<P>
   But as the white cockatoo with the flared yellow headpiece bobs
happily up and down, Thirkhill explains that such birds are ``love
sponges'' that mate for life. Fowl, he says, can be as affectionate
as canines and easily bond with humans.
</P>
<P>
   Lapbirds? Perhaps. Melolo rubs its feathered head against
Thirkhill's cheek.
</P>
<P>
   The snake Thirkhill is wearing as a choker came from a hunt in
western Texas in 1997. When there's a new moon in Langtree, king
snakes are most active, and collectors converge on towns in the
area to snag the best specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Thirkhill bagged Mr. Dryden in nearby Dryden, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he and his family went on an even grander adventure
to track moths _ ``my latest passion.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Arizona-Mexico border, they camped out overnight with
other amateur and professional entomologists. Against a backdrop of
white sheets, Thirkhill and his wife switched on a mercury vapor
light to attract moths and in minutes were treated to a
lepidopteran fandango of more than 50 species.
</P>
<P>
   Using a popular coffee table book on moths and butterflies as
their guide, they began to spot familiar specimens, including a
rare giant silk moth in shades of brown, black, tan and white with
a 4-inch wingspan.
</P>
<P>
   A stranger stopped by and gasped at the sight, offering to help
identify the beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah suddenly recognized it: Rothschildia cincta cincta,
commonly known as Rothschild's moth. Then she and her husband
recognized the helpful stranger as none other than James Tuttle,
author of their coffee table book. Tuttle was as excited at the
discovery as his hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like two kids fighting over a quarter in the grass,''
Thirkhill says with a laugh, conceding that for most people, ``it's
hard to drum up excitement about moths.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirkhill netted the Rothschild and brought it home to be
mounted. Now the prize of his collection, its beauty will be
preserved forever.
</P>
<P>
   Not only Arizona, but Hollywood has benefited from Thirkhill's
expertise with what he calls ``creepy crawlies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1996, he served as scorpion wrangler for the
Oliver Stone movie ``U-Turn,'' filmed in Superior. Sean Penn
starred as a gambler detoured to Arizona after his car broke down
in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   One scene called for Penn's character to encounter a scorpion
while drinking from a faucet. In almost two dozen takes, Thirkhill
used long forceps to position a pena blanca scorpion on the spigot.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in for the star, Penn's nervous stunt double shook
visibly as he was asked to eyeball the venomous insect.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its frightening reputation, Thirkhill found the scorpion
a reluctant star, crawling out of camera range time and again until
double-sided tape applied to the faucet threads trapped its six
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, producers hired Thirkhill to wrangle scorpions and
tarantulas for ``The Last Point Seen,'' a television movie filmed
in Apache Junction and starring Linda Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Thirkhill's new business is called Sonoran Naturalist, which
will conduct Jeep tours of the desert and present wildlife programs
drawing on his years of experience as a bird, mammal and reptile
keeper at the Phoenix Zoo (he once fed yogurt to Congo the gorilla)
and his five-year stint as curator of reptiles and birds at Out of
Africa. Call (480) 941-9000 for information.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, he drives a bus for Phoenix Country Day School, where
he has also presented his wildlife lectures.
</P>
<P>
   In educating students about preserving animal life, Thirkhill
said, he hopes to encourage young naturalists and foster interest
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Society will benefit, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the road, this generation of children will decide which
animals will be on Noah's Ark and which animals won't, which we
have room for and which we don't as we lose habitats,'' he says.
``My purpose is to inspire an interest so they will take up
wildlife as a career, as a natural history pursuit. This is the
time, when they are young and when they're most impressionable.'' &QL;

OFFICER SHOOTS MAN CARRYING A MACHETE DURING A DRUG STING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 46-year-old man was shot and seriously injured
Sunday by a police officer in East Harlem during an undercover drug
operation because the man apparently threatened the officer with a
machete, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts differ about what happened before Angel Torres, a
building superintendent, was shot. Officer Valerie St. Rose, a
spokeswoman for the police, said reports indicated that Torres
chased an officer with the machete. But a store clerk, Khalid
Ssuoeleh, said he saw a man with a machete being chased by the
police.
</P>
<P>
   St. Rose said the shooting occurred about 5:15 p.m. when
undercover officers investigated a suspected drug operation at East
110th Street and Lexington Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Torres' name was not released by the police, but he was
identified by several residents of the area. He was struck in the
abdomen and taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, where he
was listed in serious condition. The circumstances of the shooting
were still being investigated, said St. Rose. A 34-inch machete was
recovered, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Espada, who said she has known Torres for nine years,
said he speaks no English. She said he had just shaved his head
Sunday because of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Ssuoeleh, a clerk at a nearby bodega, said he saw a bald man
with a large knife being chased by what he thought were
plainclothes officers. Ssuoeleh said he heard two shots.

DODGERS COOLED OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Second place is not what anyone had in mind, but
in the Los Angeles Dodgers' search for respectability in the final
seven weeks, it was starting to look like a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But games like Sunday's 5-4 loss to the Atlanta Braves in 11
innings was a cold reminder that momentum, like a good bullpen, is
a hard thing to find.
</P>
<P>
   A victory would have moved them within 5{ games of slumping
second-place San Francisco with 44 to play. It wouldn't have made
the crowd of 41,606 at Dodger Stadium forget the major overhaul
planned for this winter, but it could have been the team's seventh
win in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of winning their third consecutive series and knocking
the Braves out of first place in the National League East, they
have a lot to ponder as they open a three-game series against the
lowly Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any value in finishing the season strongly? They are
now back in fourth place, 14 games behind division-leading Arizona.
But the Giants are 9-20 since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you need to have things to shoot for,'' said shortstop
Mark Grudzielanek, who had three hits. ``We'd like to hurt a few
teams' chances down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are just hurt and not just because Alan Mills walked
Andruw Jones with the bases loaded in the eighth to tie the game
and Jamie Arnold (2-3) allowed three straight singles in the 11th,
including the game-winner by Jose Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Ismael Valdes left the game after seven innings and just
88 pitches when he developed back spasms in the sixth inning. It is
a problem that has flared up several times this season, but he
managed to pitch two more innings through the discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who allowed seven hits and three runs, will have his
back examined today and isn't certain if he will make his next
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm worried,'' he said. ``This is a problem I've had
since 1992. I've been able to pitch through it, but I'm not so sure
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the team, Valdes would like to finish strongly. After two
subpar seasons cost him a chance for a lucrative multiyear contract
last winter, he signed a one-year deal for $4.75 million. Although
he has not won since July 16, Valdes has joined Kevin Brown as the
Dodgers' most consistent pitchers. Even though he entered the game
with an 8-11 record, his 3.49 ERA moves into the league's top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers chased Tom Glavine in the eighth inning but didn't
score after loading the bases. They also loaded the bases in the
ninth, but third baseman Adrian Beltre took a called third strike
against left-hander Mike Remlinger to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes' only mistakes came on two home runs by Braves
right-fielder Brian Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But when Valdes turned it over to the bullpen, trouble followed.
Mike Maddux came on and immediately allowed a double to Gerald
Williams. He retired the next two batters but was lifted after
walking Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Pedro Borbon took over to face Ryan Klesko, but the
Braves countered with Brian Hunter, who walked to load the bases.
Mills entered the game and walked Jones to force in the tying run.
Mills struck out Hernandez to end the inning, but the damage was
done.
</P>
<P>
   Things looked much better early when the Dodgers scored a run in
the first and two in the second to take a 3-0 lead. The
first-inning run was significant for a couple of reasons. Eric
Young, who is being eased back into the lineup after missing 18
games with an injured left ankle, led off the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have six games remaining with the Giants, including
the final three games ever to be played in 3Com (Candlestick) Park.

DEFENSE OF PATRIOTS WON'T REST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ If you play defense for the New England
Patriots it will not be a pleasant week of training at Bryant
College.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell and his assistants will have
to show coach Pete Carroll major improvement when the team plays
Dallas in its second exhibition game Saturday night at Foxboro
Stadium to calm him down a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's 20-14 loss to the Washington Redskins not only
irked Carroll, but caused him to question the depth of his
defensive line and linebacking corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two guys in casts (tackle Brandon Mitchell and end Greg
Spires, both with broken hands) and Henry Thomas sitting on the
sideline,'' said Carroll, who didn't mention Willie McGinest being
held out for precautionary reasons. ``The linebacking corps, too.
We're very thin for this time of the year. It's thinner than you
want to be and it's going to affect our special teams also.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to see what we can do. Just to make it through
practice is a challenge to us right now.'' That's personnel. That's
an issue that may or not get better depending on what magic wand
personnel man Bobby Grier can wave.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes, according to Carroll, will be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out of sync on defense and because of the changes we
had to make we weren't nearly as sharp as we need to be in a couple
of weeks,'' said Carroll of the linebacker spot, where Ted Johnson
went down with a ruptured biceps tendon and rookie Andy Katzenmoyer
took over his spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a newness there,'' Carroll said. ``It caused a
situation where some plays got away from us and that's why we
looked so soft up inside. We took a step back. The coordination has
to get back.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said the team's play against the run was miserable.
``These are things we know how to fix, and I don't think it's a
lasting problem,'' he said. ``We have to be sharper with the
communications that take place. It'll just get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins were able to rush for 5 yards per carry and had 149
yards on the ground. For a team that prides itself in stopping the
run, the Patriots were run over.
</P>
<P>
   Many pointed to Katzenmoyer as the major culprit, but after
reviewing the film Carroll didn't think he played that badly and
that his mistakes were because of inexperience rather than a lack
of talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had problems (being) convinced that what he was seeing was
what he should see,'' said the coach. ``He was hesitant. You could
see him play physical. When he did know plays he had prepared for,
he approached it very well. He made some tackles (he had only three
on the night) in the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played blocks he had to play well, but not always at the
right time. He was a little bit inconsistent, but that's just
newness at the spot. I think he's going to be fine as long as he
progresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll defended Tebucky Jones's role in a 67-yard completion on
a slant pattern from Washington quarterback Rodney Peete to
receiver Albert Connell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got knocked off the play by Vernon Crawford,'' said the
coach. ``Tebucky was right there making the tackle, but Vernon
missed the receiver and hit Tebucky. He was on the money on his
stuff. He did very well and he'll play more next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Of linebacker Tedy Bruschi, Carroll said, ``He did all right. He
made it through the game and had a solid game. He didn't have any
big plays. He had one play where he got knocked down that I wish he
didn't have, but he called the signals and took care of that part
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll wasn't too pleased with Crawford, the third-year
linebacker out of Florida State who is being relied on to be a
backup on the outside. ``He's struggling,'' Carroll said. ``He
needs to do better on special teams. And after three years, he
needs to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said Spires, who replaced McGinest and had a 7-yard sack
on Brad Johnson, ``was up and down.'' He said free agent rookie
defensive end Willie Cohens ``made some plays,'' and rookie nose
tackle Garrett Johnson ``did all right.'' He saluted linebacker
Bernard Russ's nine tackles and one onside kick recovery, but also
said he had a couple of major breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But he emphasized that ``the whole coordination between the line
and linebackers was way off. That's why I was disappointed. If
you're a little bit out of position they can run the ball like that
and make yards. It makes me sick to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was bothered that a lack of production by the offense
left the score 20-0, Redskins at halftime. He was miffed at Adam
Vinatieri's missed 29-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   What did catch his eye, Carroll said, was ``the timing of the
passing game with Drew Bledsoe and the receivers was what we had
hoped it would be. He threw with confidence. Guys ran good
routes.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the list of positives was the play of second-round pick
Kevin Faulk, who gained 44 yards on 11 carries and caught an 8-yard
pass for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He flashed, he showed the quickness that we had hoped, a
little bit of wiggle, and made nice decisions with the football,''
said Carroll. However, obviously in need of improvement is Faulk's
blocking; he was called for a penalty on a crackback. While Carroll
doesn't believe Faulk ever will be a devastating blocker because of
his size, the Patriots are trying to get him to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll had little to say about the offensive line, perhaps an
indication that nothing stood out, good or bad.

WOODS CLAIMS SECOND MAJOR 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ It was a week in which his motives had been
questioned, putting him in the middle of a messy controversy that
threatened to ruin the century's last major golf championship. But
Tiger Woods shrugged it off and when he needed it most, he relied
on that intangible that is his trademark _ a ferocious competitive
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Woods won the 81st PGA Championship at Medinah Country Club
Sunday, closing with an even-par 72 for an 11-under 277 total, one
shot better than 19-year-old Sergio Garcia, the Spaniard who should
share equal billing in a back-nine drama that saved this proud
championship from the depths of an ill-timed Ryder Cup pay-for-play
debate. Woods prevailed, not with his unmatched skills, but with a
determination not to throw it into the arms of the youngster they
call El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   While it wasn't a brilliant display of golf _ Woods made two
bogeys and a double down the stretch; Garcia, in his round of 71,
made infrequent visits to the fairway _ it was a classic
confrontation between two young guns who embrace pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling (caddie) Stevie (Williams) how much fun this is
playing with this much pressure,'' said Woods, at 23 a major winner
for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   It was there thanks to the electrifying talents of Garcia. He
was born to play golf, and from an early age he has been guided and
advised by a legend named Seve Ballesteros. Many years ago, the
18-year-old Ballesteros nearly won a British Open. Sunday, his
protege stared down the world's greatest player, never blinked, and
captivated a golf audience by displaying both a game and a grit
that had to make Ballesteros proud.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn, Garcia trailed by five shots as Woods threatened to
run away thanks to three birdies going out. It was a blitz that
pushed Mike Weir (80_285), Woods's third-round co-leader, so far
into the background he may as well have been a marker. But perhaps
nobody noticed Weir's disappearance, for Woods was putting them to
sleep with frightening precision.
</P>
<P>
   But you know kids. They love to wake people up. Which Garcia did
with a birdie at the 10th. Woods was the first to notice.
``Granted, I had a five-shot lead,'' said Woods, ``but there were a
lot of holes to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of them were par 5s that Woods normally would eat for lunch,
but inexplicably he drove poorly at both the 10th and 14th and only
could salvage par. In between those, the snoozer became a sizzler.
</P>
<P>
   It was a three-player race for a while, as 42-year-old Nick
Price, charging with a front-side 32, got to 11 under through 11
holes, but he fell back with bogeys at the 12th and 13th when he
attacked tough pins.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Price displayed seasoned desire, but on this day it
gave way to youthful fire, which intensified at the par-3 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, at 14 under, stood on the tee, staring 219 yards away as
Garcia, at 10 under, lined up a birdie putt. It was in the jar all
the way, a roll that elicited one of those great sports moments
that you cannot stage. Garcia walked the last few steps toward the
hole and when the ball fell, he pumped his right fist, first out of
excitement, then toward the tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to know that I was still there,'' said Garcia.
``It wasn't, I don't know how to say, a bad thing. I was kind of
telling him: `If you want to win, you have to play well.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Woods didn't see it, but he didn't have to. He accepted the
challenge, then faltered. His 6-iron was too long. Two chips and
two putts later, Woods's lead was one.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia got generous at the 15th, when, from underneath a tree
(remember, his mentor once saved a major title from a parking lot),
he ran a magical approach to the back of a green he never should
have been able to reach. Fate caught him, though; Garcia chipped
long, missed the comebacker, and made bogey to fall two back.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Woods missed a birdie chance at that 15th that
could have ended the drama. Instead, there was more. Garcia, in
vintage Ballesteros form, drove it up against the base of a tree
just off the right side of the 16th fairway. Impossible shot? Not
when you tutored under a magician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the risk because, I felt like I could do it,'' said
Garcia, who opened the blade of his 6-iron, swung hard, made full
contact, then jumped back out of fear. ``The worst thing, probably
hit the tree and hit myself and two-stroke penalty. And I don't
know, make 8, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but this is an improbable game when in the hands of lads who
never have been introduced to caution. ``I just closed my eyes, hit
the ball,'' said Garcia, who could not believe what he saw when he
opened them _ his ball, 189 yards away, sitting on the green. He
sprinted, he jumped, he gasped, he shook his head in amazement.
Then he saved par.
</P>
<P>
   Woods came in behind with a bogey, and just one shot separated
the two players who perhaps will usher this sport into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say you've got to expect the best out of your
competitor,'' said Woods. ``I expected Sergio (to birdie)'' one of
the closing holes.
</P>
<P>
   No. The tank had run dry of drama.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia missed birdie putts at both 17 and 18, allowing Woods to
par in. It wasn't easy, but he negotiated a 7-foot slider at the
17th after chipping from thick rough, then calmed his emotions to
play the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   It was a 3-wood and pitching wedge to a 445-yard closing hole.
Two putts. Two majors. Too bad the fun had ended.

Garner not long for the scrap heap
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner doesn't encourage the random firing of baseball
managers, including himself, but in a moment of introspection he
admitted such measures are sometimes in order.
</P>
<P>
   Few have left a job with more candor or dignity than Garner when
the Milwaukee Brewers told him the other day his services were no
longer needed. He had been on the scene for most of eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play up to my expectations,'' he said, ``or theirs.
In this situation, I think it's deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   You hesitate to argue with a bright, proud competitor like
Garner. Still, those in the media hate to lose a fellow of his
class, although one would guess his absence from the game will be
short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd stroke of timing, the Brewers arrive in Houston for a
four-game series starting today, just as their former manager
returns to his offseason home, where he spent eight seasons as a
player and three as a coach. He is here, in the city, but not here,
in the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' he says, ``but when the Astros traded me to Los
Angeles, the Dodgers were coming to town, and all I had to do was
switch clubhouses. But it was strange and a little confusing. In
the first game, I found myself rooting for Billy Doran (who had
displaced Phil at second base). Billy got a hit, and I let out a
`Yesss!' I got some funny looks in the Dodger dugout that said,
`Hey, you're on our side now.'''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no suspicious looks from either team this week
because it isn't likely Garner is ready to make his first Astrodome
appearance as a former manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to kick back and take it easy,'' he said. ``All of
our kids go to Texas A&AMP;M, and this will be the first time I've been
able to help Carol move them into school. After that, we'll
probably do a little traveling.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers are not open to sympathy because they basically know at
the moment they sign a contract that they will be fired. They just
don't know the date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anyone feeling badly for me,'' Garner said. ``I
think it was the right time; time for me to move on and time for
the club.''
</P>
<P>
   This admission reflects the philosophy of Sparky Anderson, who
built a powerhouse in Cincinnati and later won a World Series in
Detroit. It was Sparky's belief that after five seasons a manager
is on borrowed time because the players begin to tune him out. They
are thrown together for seven months, and they know each other's
habits, moods and jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know Sparky said that,'' Garner says, ``but I agree
with it. I used to think that after my playing days I would want to
go into the front office and become a general manager, so I could
help break that system of changing managers. But I don't think that
way now. I told someone the other day that I thought four to six
years was tops for a manager with one team.''
</P>
<P>
   Garner, and the Brewers, were caught in the classic small-market
trap. They had not enjoyed a winning record since 1992, when Phil
was second in the Manager of the Year voting in his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we developed a pretty good core,'' he says, ``and our
payroll jumped from about $22 million to $34 million in two years.
Everyone thought that was enough, but in the interim everybody else
was jumping from 35 to 50. So we were still behind the eight ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``So do you have to spend another 20 to 30 million to win in
Milwaukee? The market now says that a No. 1 pitcher is going to
cost between 8 and 12 million, and you have to give it to them for
three or four years. It's crazy, and you and I could argue the
merits of that all day long. But if you're going to compete, that's
what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   His pride will require Garner to manage again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't give up after the first one,'' he says, ``or even
the second. You need to give it three tries so you can do the
different things that you learned from being fired.''
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Garner reached championship series with three
teams, including the Astros in 1986, rotating at third base with
Denny Walling. He helped the Pirates win a World Series over the
Orioles in 1979, batting .500. He played smart and tough and never
called in sick, earning the nickname ``Scrap Iron.'' And, always,
he learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best advice I ever got,'' he says, ``came from Chuck
Tanner and Bill Virdon (his managers in Pittsburgh and with the
Astros). Both of them said the same thing: `Take the high road, no
matter what.' I've tried to do that. When bad things happen, the
first line of defense is, `It's not my fault.' But you know what?
That doesn't help. Everybody wants to win. There wasn't any
ugliness in Milwaukee. It just didn't work out. You acknowledge
that, and you move on.''
</P>
<P>
   You doubt Garner will be on the move long.

IRON MAN WOODS SURVIVES 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ The shoulders rose. The shoulders fell. If this
were a cartoon, you'd be looking at the word ``sigh'' with a little
circle around it. You've seen marathon winners looking less
exhausted than Tiger Woods did after tapping the ball in the hole
for his 277th and final shot at the 81st PGA Championship on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The first major title was absurdly easy. Twenty-eight months
ago, Woods reduced a submissive Augusta National to a
pitch-and-putt course. He won by a surreal 12 strokes and the Jack
Nicklaus Major Championship Countdown had begun. The second major _
at a point when some people were insanely wondering aloud if there
would even be a second _ was work.
</P>
<P>
   Woods won this tournament, damn near threw it back, and then won
it again with a clutch par-saving putt on the 17th and a solid,
professional, no-frills par on the 18th. He couldn't relax because
Sergio Garcia wouldn't let him relax. But he won. He's got the
trophy. He's got the check ($630,000) and he's got the
satisfaction. The second one is going to be the dam-burster. Let
the deluge of majors begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally got No. 2, and, yes, it's a relief,'' he said.
``From a media standpoint, I won't have to answer that question
anymore. I've been asked about it all week. Now I can say I knocked
the door down.''
</P>
<P>
   He did it the way he says it must be done: He gave himself a
chance. He was four strokes ahead of the pack at the turn, and five
up with seven holes to play. That lead disappeared faster than you
could say ``Greg Norman'' with a bogey on No. 12 (his par putt
lipped out) and a double bogey on the par-3 13th (he overshot the
green into high grass with a 6-iron), combined with a Garcia birdie
on 13. But no one ever caught him. If someone had, well, OK, it
could have gone down as a good walk, soiled. But no one ever did.
</P>
<P>
   ``My focus was always there,'' he said. ``It never left me. I
tried hard on every shot, but some of them just didn't happen. I
lost four shots off the lead, but Sergio never got closer than one
back. He was still chasing me.''
</P>
<P>
   The great ones always think this way. If Larry Bird said it
once, he said it 77,000 times. ``I never get worried,'' he would
say, ``until we're 1 down without the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods never let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Did he make it exciting? Yes, he did. Still leading Garcia by
one stroke (they had swapped bogeys on the 15th and 16th,
respectively) he put his tee shot on the 206-yard par-3 17th into
high grass a tantalizing 12 feet above the pin. Playing partner
Mike Weir _ his nightmarish 80 should be inserted into the middle
of ``The Blair Witch Project'' _ was in a similar situation a few
feet farther to the right. Weir knocked his shot to within 2 feet.
Woods's wasn't quite as crisp, stopping a good 5 feet above the
hole.
</P>
<P>
   As any golfer knows there are 5-footers and there are 5-footers,
and suddenly this was the most important shot of the week for Mr.
Tiger Woods. A miss had to be short, for trouble lurked below the
hole. If Tiger weren't careful, he could have wound up 1 down
without the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `Just trust your stroke and bury it,' ''
Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know the rest. He buried it.
</P>
<P>
   So it was one up with one to play, and once he found out that
Garcia had not been able to birdie the hole, he went into
championship protection mode, which, in the case of a maestro such
as Woods, consisted of a 3-wood and pitching wedge to 15 feet or so
above and to the right of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the lag putt needed to stop short, if anything.
Woods didn't try to be a hero. He tapped it just right, leaving
himself a foot and a half short. As he walked to the hole, there
was a huge smile on his face. He lined up the putt and stroked it
home.
</P>
<P>
   He will never, ever, let us know whether he really was scared
when that lead dropped from five shots to one so rapidly, because
to do so would demonstrate human frailty a champion hates to
acknowledge. But his reaction was proof that he had been shaken by
the brash young Spaniard, who is too young and carefree to think
evil thoughts. At 19, Garcia is phenomenally gifted and mentally
bulletproof, so much so that he claimed not to remember he had
dropped a tee shot into Lake Kadijah back on the second hole until
someone asked him about it afterward. ``After I hit the bogey
putt,'' he shrugged, ``I forgot I hit it to the water.''
</P>
<P>
   When Woods was 19, he probably would have said the same thing.
But now that he is 23, with a resume that includes triumphs and
frustrations, he appreciates just how difficult his chosen
profession can be. He respects the game and its challenges, even as
he trusts his own unique talent.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is convinced he is a vastly different player and person
than he was when he won in Augusta two years and four months ago.
He says that he and coach Butch Harmon have spent countless hours
away from public scrutiny tinkering and retooling his game to the
point where he maintains that anyone looking at 1997 videotapes vs.
1999 videotapes could spot the difference. ``I can make more
recoveries because my bad shots aren't as bad now,'' he points out.
</P>
<P>
   So now Tiger can say he has bagged one more more major than
Orville Moody and Charles Coody. Of course, he's 16 behind
Nicklaus. But what do you say we allow him a day or two before we
ask him how many majors he plans to win next year? Let him enjoy
this. He really did work for it.

NEXT RED SOX FOE GETS A'S FOR EFFORT

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Who are these Oakland A's, the mystery guests in the
American League's 1999 wild-card shuffle?
</P>
<P>
   They are proof that the biggest wallet doesn't always win. They
are a monument to old-fashioned scouting, player development,
patience, fundamentals, and hunger.
</P>
<P>
   And they are one game behind your Boston Red Sox as they invade
Fenway Park Monday night for the first of four games.
</P>
<P>
   Scorecard sales should soar. There's no more Reggie Jackson,
Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire, or Tony La Russa. You can't identify
some of the A's even with a program.
</P>
<P>
   There are some local connections. We know that Boston
millionaire David Mugar wants to buy the A's and we know that
Oakland's director of player personnel, J.P. Ricciardi, lives in
West Boylston and coaches high school basketball at Holy Name in
Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   We know that Red Sox castoff Matt Stairs is hitting tons of
homers and that John Jaha _ who failed a physical with the Sox last
winter _ represented Oakland at Fenway in the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   We know that Oakland is the team that swept Boston in the 1988
and '90 playoffs but hasn't been good lately.
</P>
<P>
   And we know that Oakland is baseball's best low-payroll team.
October baseball has been played almost exclusively by the rich
teams in recent years. The Yankees, Braves, and Indians have
dominated their divisions. Now we have the A's, who started the
season with a payroll of $23 million (ranking 26 of 30 teams),
contending for the postseason. They are baseball's feel-good movie
of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   While citizens of Red Sox Nation fret about Toronto, the A's
have emerged as the Sox' top challenger (a half-game ahead of the
Blue Jays) in the wild-card race. The no-names with the low
salaries just swept the Jays in Toronto. The A's are 21-9 since the
All-Star break and 11-3 in August, a mere game behind the Red Sox
with 45 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do names win?'' asked Lou Piniella, manager of a Seattle team
that has Ken Griffey, Alex Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez, and Jay
Buhner, yet finds itself seven games behind Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to our place after the All-Star break and they had a
little swagger,'' added Piniella. ``This will be a nice series in
Boston. Forget about the wild card, right now they're making it
tough on Texas.'' Oakland is 4 1/2 games behind the Rangers in the
AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams, like a lot of baseball fans, has
a tough time naming the A's. Boston has played only four games
against Oakland, none since May 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got those tough lefthanders,'' said Williams. ``The
third baseman, I think is a lefthanded hitter, his name escapes me
(Eric Cesar Chavez). The shortstop (Miguel Tejada). (Jason) Giambi.
(Matt) Stairs. The kid in left field (Ben Grieve). The righthanded
DH who played in the All-Star Game (Jaha). They've scored a lot of
runs, that team.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's just scored 31 runs in a three-game sweep at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland made major moves before the trading deadline. A lot of
teams bid for Kansas City's Kevin Appier, but it was Oakland that
landed the righty ace. The A's also beefed up with pitchers Jason
Isringhausen and Omar Olivares, veteran second baseman Randy
Velarde, and future center fielder Terrence Long. The A's have made
30 roster moves since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The A's haven't played .500 ball since 1992, when they still had
McGwire and La Russa. Just two years ago they were 65-97 under
present manager Art Howe, but general manager Billy Beane has
rebuilt the franchise and now the A's are thinking playoffs again.

<P>
   The A's rank last in the AL in hitting (.254), but are third in
pitching (4.53) and first in late-season acquisitions. They start
Olivares Monday night, Gil Heredia Tuesday, Appier Wednesday, and
Tim Hudson Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The A's don't play in a new HOK Stadium that allows them to
print money. They are rarely highlighted on Fox or ESPN and don't
have any players doing sneaker commercials. But they might be the
team that keeps the Red Sox out of the playoffs.

SWEEP NOT IN CARDS FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARINERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BOSTON _ When the Red Sox are on a streak, it's easy to forget
there are other teams that have the ability to be a factor in the
American League wild-card race. The Seattle Mariners are one of
those teams.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you thought the Olde Towne Team would complete a
three-game sweep of the Mariners, Seattle's bats finally woke up
enough to trip the Red Sox, 4-3, before 32,460 Sunday at Fenway
Park. After outscoring Seattle in the first two games, 24-8, Boston
struggled most of the afternoon against rookie righthander Gil
Meche, one of Seattle's highly touted young pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had only three hits and two runs off Meche (4-2),
who worked seven innings. They did pick up a run in the eighth off
reliever Tom Davey. But veteran Jose Mesa slammed the door in the
ninth, ending a four-game Boston winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The timing, of course, couldn't have been worse. The loss,
coupled with Oakland's 9-5 victory over Toronto Sunday, left Boston
with only a one-game lead over the A's in the wild-card derby.
Since the Athletics will be in town for the next four nights, the
Sox could have used more of a cushion. Boston is 15-8 against AL
West teams but only 1-3 against Oakland. And it's not the same A's
team the Sox faced early in the season. But, then, these aren't the
same Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you lose,'' said rookie first baseman Brian
Daubach, who had a career-best series, going 9 for 13 with 12 runs
batted in. ``But you have to forget about today and get ready for
Oakland. They've changed a lot and they've been one of the hottest
teams in the league. So it should be an exciting series.''
</P>
<P>
   What transpired over the weekend was also exciting, starting
with an 11-6 victory Friday night and continuing Saturday in a 13-2
rout that unfortunately was overshadowed by a controversy involving
star pitcher Pedro Martinez. The Mariners were killjoys Sunday.
Despite a strong outing by Mark Portugal (7-10), with the score
tied at 2 in the sixth inning, Alex Rodriguez stroked his 31st home
run of the season. Portugal gave up a fourth run in the eighth on
an infield single to third by Rodriguez, and Boston couldn't
recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The pitch he homered on) was something up in the zone,'' said
Rodriguez, who reached base four times and scored three runs. ``I
stroked it pretty well. But I hit it into that strong wind. I
didn't know it was going to get out of the park. I thought it would
hit the wall. When I saw it I thought it was a double. I'm glad it
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez went 6 for 12 in the series with three home runs and
five RBIs. Not a bad weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got intensity and ability, and he plays to win,'' said
Mariners manager Lou Piniella. ``On the home run, he crushed that
ball. A-Rod can play, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez added that just because the Mariners are still under
.500 doesn't mean they aren't a good team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very fortunate,'' he said. ``I'm a part of a very
good lineup and they have to pitch to me so I have a lot of
protection. They kicked our butts twice, so it's good to win. Any
victory you get in Boston is great because it is a tough place to
play the last couple of years. The nice thing is that we did it
with pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle took a 1-0 lead in second. Rodriguez walked and moved to
third on a single by Edgar Martinez and a passed ball. Rodriguez
scored on a sacrifice fly by Jay Buhner. Boston took a 2-1 lead in
the third on a walk to Jose Offerman and doubles by Daubach and
Nomar Garciaparra. Seattle pushed across a run in the fourth when
Rodriguez reached on an error by Garciaparra, stole second, and
scored on a single to center by Ryan Jackson, who was just called
up from the minors and was making his American League debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw strikes,'' said Portugal. ``In the third and fourth
innings I kind of lost my concentration, but later I calmed down
and pretty much threw the ball where I wanted to. Unfortunately, in
the sixth, I got a ball up to A-Rod that came back over the plate
and he hit it over the fence. Those things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal was still in the game when Rodriguez drove in the
fourth Seattle run. With two out in the eighth, Raul Ibanez reached
on an error by left fielder Troy O'Leary. Ken Griffey singled to
center, and Ibanez came home on the infield single to third by
Rodriguez. Sox manager Jimy Williams said he had no regrets about
leaving Portugal in to face the Mariners shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a tough offense over there,'' he said. ``I left him
in there because he was still pitching good. They got a ground ball
hit that scored a run.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to brood, said Portugal. Sox hitters and pitchers know
what they have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be easy the last month and a half of the
season,'' he said. ``It never is. You've just got to keep
battling.''

KORIR POURS IT ON AT FALMOUTH FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALMOUTH, Mass. _ Vineyard Sound usually serves as the perfect
backdrop for the Falmouth Road Race. The ocean lapping the shore on
Surf Drive, Nobska Light sitting in the distance, seagulls flying
in the blue sky, and thousands of runners winding their way from
Woods Hole to Falmouth Heights usually are the images that mark
Falmouth on the third Sunday in August.
</P>
<P>
   Not Sunday, as the sea whipped the shore and the skies darkened
and opened up to put a resounding end to the summer of '99 drought.
Except for a brief respite at 9, the rain came down hard and
relentlessly all morning. So forget idyllic thoughts of sun and
sea; the 9,000 runners had enough water to think about as they
sloshed their way on the 7.1-mile course that hugs the Atlantic
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But the rain made no difference to John Korir of Kenya, who
thwarted Khalid Khannouchi's chance for a three-peat, edging ahead
just a quarter of a mile from the finish.
</P>
<P>
   The two finished in reverse order from last year, when Korir ran
Falmouth for the first time. It was also his first year racing on
US roads, but it's clear he and American races are a good match.
After finishing third in the Utica (N.Y.) Boilermaker 15K last
year, he won the Bix 7-Miler in Davenport, Iowa, by .001 second. He
also won the ConnectiCare Classic 5K, and Crim 10-mile race in
Flint, Mich. This year Korir, 23, won the Utica and Davenport
races, and finished second to Khannouchi in Atlanta July 4 at the
Peachtree 10K with a time of 28:01.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry continued Sunday. Korir took home a $10,000 check
and Khannouchi won $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   With the elite runners starting at the front of the pack, the
Kenyans, who surrounded Moroccan Khannouchi, wasted no time in
jumping out ahead. Brian Baker of Dorchester was part of that crowd
too, leading the way for the first 2 miles, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   As if ignoring the rain that at times came down torrentially,
the runners seemed determined to keep a business-as-usual attitude
and shake the rest of the pack. So the tables lined with cups of
water went ignored, and the runners defiantly splashed through
ankle-deep puddles as the leaders kept up a speedy 4:40-mile pace.
</P>
<P>
   When the runners headed for the final mile, Khannouchi and Korir
broke away from the pack that was down to eight runners, and ran
shoulder-to-shoulder. Then, less than a quarter of a mile from the
finish on Grand Avenue at Falmouth Heights, Korir gave the surge
that Khannouchi made famous the past two years, and broke the tape
first in 32:06. Khannouchi was two seconds behind, while the other
runners spent the next hour sloshing their way over the line.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi, 27, said when he woke up Sunday morning and saw the
rain, he was discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to keep my confidence but I knew it was going to be a
tough day,'' he said. ``It was hard running in the water, and I
didn't have the kick that I usually have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Khannouchi, who lives in Ossining, N.Y., and is applying for
US citizenship, refused to blame his performance on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my best, that's all I can say,'' he said. ``This was a
tough day. I really wanted to make history but . . . it didn't work
out.
</P>
<P>
   Korir had just the opposite take on the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it, I like running in the rain,'' said Korir, who
trains with Fila's team at Pine Manor College. ``I'd rather have
that than the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   The spectators along the course seemed equally as oblivious to
the soggy day as they donned slickers, popped up umbrellas, and
cheered the runners on. A rock band played music from the Marina
Park Bandstand at Falmouth Harbor, and other fans along the way
blared music from a boom box, ignoring the absolutely non-beach
day. Race director John Carroll said the crowd might have been down
a bit, but wasn't much sparser than last year's 75,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were places where there were people two and three deep
with umbrellas,'' he said. ``It was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod DeHaven, of Madison, Wis., won $4,000 as the first American
to finish, in 32:50. He was running with the leaders until Mile 4,
then dropped back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was gaining on 7 and 8, but I ran out of time,'' said
DeHaven, who finished ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Korir, who had to settle for second place last year, won't
settle for that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was the first year I ran here, so I didn't know the
course,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He knows it now.

   MEDINAH, Ill. _ It may be uncertain whether they'll wave the
flag or smash it over one another's head, but like it or not, your
US Ryder Cup team is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Almost, anyway. The two-year qualifica- tion process ended
yesterday with the final round at the PGA Championship. And it in-
volved a lot less intrigue than emerged five days before from a
second-floor meeting room at Medinah Country Club where, con- trary
to the postmortem spin, it was re- vealed that the American team's
fighting spirit may be more evident within its ranks than against
the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   After a week brimming with turmoil, tes- tiness, and Tiger, the
10 Ryder points lead- ers _ all of them guaranteed berths _ are the
same as they were before this Tour carnival descended on
Chicagoland: PGA champion Woods, David Duval, Payne Stewart, Davis
Love, Mark O'Meara, Hal Sutton, Justin Leonard, Jim Furyk, Phil
Mickelson, and Jeff Maggert.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ben Crenshaw indicated that he wouldn't know the
identity of the two cap- tain's selections to round out the team
when he left the course last night ``because there's too much
figuring to do,'' Tom Lehman and Fred Couples are the overwhelming
club- house leaders. That's mainly because they're not clubhouse
lawyers, of which this team al- ready has an abundance.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw will make the announcement at a Medinah press
conference this morning. Then the distinguished dozen will concen-
trate on trying to recapture the Cup from Europe Sept. 24-26 at The
Country Club in Brookline, Mass. That is, unless they're still
hissing over how much input the PGA of America will give the
touring pros in deter- mining how Ryder profits are distributed to
charity. Supposedly laid to harmonious rest by Tuesday's truce, the
issue resurfaced with a vengeance the next day when Cren-H shaw
blasted the four main contrarians _ Woods, Duval, O'Meara, and
Mickelson _ for making commerce rather than competition the
centerpiece so close to the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -------------------- &LR;  Crenshaw steadfastly insisted yesterday
that the feud is forgotten and that ``it's on- ward to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's behind us,'' he said of the squab- bling. ``I'm happy
with this team the way it's formed. It's formidable. These are
people I feel confident in because of the way they've played the
last two years. Like I said the other day when I pointed down the
(locker- room) carpet to the restrooms, we're all on the same
path.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, he doesn't mean into the toi- let, where the past
two US Ryder teams have wound up in the biennial competition. In
fact, with the exception of Ryder rookie Duval, this group is
bursting with experi-  &UR; .................... &LR;  ence, most of it bad.
All of the other nine automatic choices have played in the Ryder,
and all nine have played on Ryder losers. Only Stewart, Love, and
O'Meara know the taste of international victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hesitate to say it,'' said Sutton, who is ending a 12-year
Ryder hiatus, ``but I think we have the best players in the world
in the US. But we haven't proved it, and it's high time we did.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much sweating involved yesterday as the finish line
approached. The top five in the standings _ Duval, Woods, Stewart,
Love, and O'Meara _ were guaran- teed spots before they teed off
Thursday,  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  though Woods wound up displacing
Duval at No. 1 by virtue of his victory. Sutton, Furyk, and
Mickelson _ who said after finishing in 57th place with a 77_295
that he and Cren-H shaw had hashed out their differences and that
``whatever transpired this week is irrel- evant'' _ were secure
after making the cut Friday. Even Leonard, who missed it, didn't
have to stare at the TV over the weekend because he was secure in
seventh place.
</P>
<P>
   Only Maggert, who also missed the cut, was vulnerable. Even at
that, it would have taken some superior efforts to nose him out.
Lehman, who began yesterday 11th on the Ryder list, needed to
finish ninth in the tour- nament to leapfrog Maggert; he wound up
34th with a 76_291 and headed with his fam- ily to Colorado for a
couple of days of R&AMP;R, though he promised ``to keep my cell phone
on'' in hopes of getting a call from Crenshaw last night.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other long shots, 14th-place Chris Perry needed a
two-way tie for sixth; he fell short with a 10th-place 71_285. No.
16 Steve Pate had to claim fourth place out- right; he settled for
an eighth-place tie with a 69_284.
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 Bob Estes provided a temporary subsidiary drama in the
tournament within a tournament. Needing a two-way tie for fifth, he
jumped into a tie for fourth as he birdied four of five holes from
the 10th through 14th, going 8 under for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first round where I've had the Ryder on my
mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He could forget about it after bogeys at 16 and 17 dropped him
into a sixth-place tie at 69_282 _ one shot shy of his first Ryder
ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``One shot over two years,'' lamented Es- tes, who doesn't
expect Crenshaw to choose him even though he displaced Lehman at
11th and ``at least gave Ben something to think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a putt that lipped out,'' he added of the margin of
failure, ``a ball that hits a spike mark.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Estes learned the lesson of the Ryder Cup: A
sprint doesn't necessar- ily win a marathon. That's at least one
thing the whole team can agree on. Can't they?

PORTUGAL NOT IN TOTAL CONTROL

 SOX-PORTUGAL-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As scheduled, righthander Mark Portugal took the mound
Sunday. As always, the ability to predict his performance stopped
the moment he delivered the first pitch at 1:07 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Psychics, paid prognosticators, and would-be baseball prophets
know better than to forecast the outcome of a Portugal start this
season. One day the 36-year-old veteran with a surgically repaired
right elbow and a brace supporting his right knee considers
retirement to spend more time with his kids. Two months later he
winds up one out shy of a complete game against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's 22 starts for Boston have ranged from a 1 1/3-inning
display of ineptitude against New York, to a fit-filled three
innings against Detroit, to his flirtation with the complete game.
When comparing his starts this season, no pattern emerges. Seven
scattered wins and 10 losses are separated by six no-decisions.
</P>
<P>
   So in the grand Boston tradition of puzzling baseball logic and
in the wake of Pedro Martinez's controversial scratch Saturday, the
Red Sox turned to Portugal for a sense of stability and return to
normalcy. The win proved elusive, but 7 2/3 innings of work were
not a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to try to break that mode,'' said Portugal of his
inconsistent performances. ``I seem to pitch a good game, pitch a
bad game. Hopefully my next game I can build on what I did today. I
was happy with the way I threw the ball with the exception of a
couple of pitches. The next start I'll go out there with the same
mentality. Throw strikes and get people out.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Jimy Williams: ``To me, when he came out, he was
still pitching good. His command and control got better as the game
went on.''
</P>
<P>
   With Portugal, the highlights often are hidden in the fine
print. He recorded five strikeouts _ starting the game with two _
and allowed just two earned runs against the Mariners. The five Ks
matched his season high. And for the 10th time this year, he
finished an outing allowing no more than two earned runs. In his
last two home games, which include the performance against
Cleveland, Portugal has surrendered just three earned runs and
posted a 1.65 ERA over 16 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran appeared in complete control in the first inning,
striking out second baseman David Bell swinging and left fielder
Raul Ibanez looking and getting Ken Griffey to ground out. Although
Portugal felt he lost some of the strike zone in the second, third,
and fourth innings, he calmed down later in the game and placed the
ball where he wanted _ with the notable exception of a sixth-inning
offering to Alex Rodriguez. On a 1-1 count, the Seattle shortstop
sent a ball placed high in the zone 415 feet to center for his 31st
home run of the season. Yet the Red Sox righthander threw 70
strikes out of 100 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a very good ball club over there,'' said Portugal.
``They probably haven't played up to their potential this season.
But when you go over their lineup and you think about the hitters
that they have in there, you definitely have to be careful. They've
got some dangerous hitters in that lineup. It's not a team that you
can keep down completely. You just try to contain them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the regular season comes to a conclusion and the wild-card
race tightens, Portugal understands this is not the time for
heroics. He knows that all the pitchers in the rotation need to
perform consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for everybody to pitch like this,'' he said,
using Sunday's display as an example. ``We can't try to put any
pressure on anybody to go out there and do more than they're
capable of. Pedro's our big horse and we've just got to try and
follow suit after him.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone in the clubhouse knows how to prepare for an
unpredictable finish, it's Portugal.

LOS ANGELES: kept interest going.'' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mid-summer sensation ``The Blair Witch Project'' finished third
with $15 million at 2,412 theaters to give Artisan a total of
$107.6 million after 33 days. ``Blair Witch,'' which became on
Saturday the 11th 1999 film and the 193rd of all time to hit $100
million, lost only 34 percent of its audience despite direct
competition from ``Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's third weekend of ``Runaway Bride'' finished a close
fourth, with $14.2 million at 3,212 sites, as the comedy moved past
$98 million in 17 days. MGM's second weekend of ``The Thomas Crown
Affair'' held up well in fifth with $10.5 million at 2,427
theaters, dropping only 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' third weekend of ``Deep Blue Sea'' followed with
$7.2 million at 2,710 theaters, giving the shark-fest a respectable
$57.6 million in 17 days. With ``The Haunting'' in 11th place with
$3.3 million, the quartet of horror films contributed $51.6 million
or nearly 40 percent of total business - a stunning achievement for
a genre that traditionally vanishes quickly from theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Family audiences continued to give solid support to Disney's
fourth weekend of ``Inspector Gadget'' with $6.2 million at 2,591
theaters to push its 24-day gross past $7 million. But Universal's
second weekend of ``Mystery Men'' stumbled into eighth with a
disappointing $4.7 million at 2,142 sites as the offbeat comedy
lost 53 percent of its audience.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's opening of ``Brokedown Palace,'' with Claire
Danes and Kate Beckinsdale in a tough-to-market tale of teen-agers
jailed in Thailand for drug trafficking, generated moderate
business in ninth with $4 million at 1,720 sites. That edged
Warner's second weekend of ``The Iron Giant,'' which continued to
disappoint its supporters with a lukewarm $3.9 million at 2,179
theaters despite outstanding reviews.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' fourth weekend of ``The Haunting'' came in 11th with
$3.3 million at 2,239 locations, followed by Universal's sixth
weekend of ``American Pie'' with $2.8 million at 1,382 screens and
New Line's near-death opening of ``Detroit Rock City'' with a
meager $1.9 million at 1,802 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's 13th weekend of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom
Menace'' showed it still carries force at the box office with $1.6
million at 763 theaters to push its 89-day total to $415.7 million.
The prequel was the last movie prior to ``The Sixth Sense'' to win
the box office on consecutive weekends, piling up three victories
in late May and early June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' is likely to lead again next weekend, when
its chief competition looks to be Warner's romantic comedy ``Mickey
Blue Eyes'' with Hugh Grant starring as an art dealer who marries
into a mob family. Bucksbaum predicts ``Mickey'' will take in
somewhere between $10 million and $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also opening will be Miramax's teen comedy-drama ``Teaching Mrs.
Tingle'' and Sony's ``Universal Soldier: The Return.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredible run we're having,'' Bucksbaum said.
``Earlier in the summer, `Blair Witch' and `Sixth Sense' weren't
even factored into people's calculations. So you now have a
situation where everyone, particularly megaplexes, is getting
enough product and that's very profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few films have wound up being crushed, such as Sony's
``Dick,'' which plunged a depressing 61 percent in its second
weekend to a near-invisible $860,000 at 1,522 theaters. The
political comedy has grossed a mere $6 million in a dozen days
despite receiving strong critical endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Final results for the Friday-Sunday period were to be released
Monday.

`SIXTH SENSE' CONJURES UP $26.1 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - Horror continued to prove irresistible at the
nation's multiplexes as the second weekend of ``The Sixth Sense''
easily led with an impressive $26.1 million at 2,395 theaters amid
a robust weekend at the nation's box office, studio sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sense,'' with Bruce Willis aiding an 8-year-old boy beset by
supernatural forces, obliterated forecasts for the second weekend
in a row by losing only 2 percent from its opening. The Disney
release, originally set for October, has now taken in an astounding
$70 million in 10 days during what is traditionally a period when
moviegoing slacks off.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood trackers had expected the opening of Universal's
``Bowfinger,'' pairing Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy for the first
time, to finish first and become the 10th different movie in 10
weeks to top the box office list. Instead, ``Bowfinger'' came in a
distant second with a still-solid $18.2 million as ``Sixth Sense''
benefited from exceptional word-of-mouth recommendation about its
intricate plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horror films typically fall off 45 to 50 percent in their
second weekend, so the performance by `Sixth Sense' is
phenomenal,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of Reel Source
forecasting service. ``Our tracking shows that people are seeing it
over and over because the ending blows them away.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the month, ``Sixth Sense'' will have become only
the fourth August movie to top $100 million, joining
``Unforgiven,'' ``The Fugitive'' and ``Clear and Present Danger.''
Bucksbaum, noting that ``Sixth Sense'' appears to be benefiting
from strong support among young moviegoers due to its PG-13 rating,
predicted final domestic gross could hit $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   Disney added 234 theaters to ``Sixth'' this weekend and will
likely bring on additional sites next Friday, according to
distribution chief Chuck Viane. ``We are seeing a lot of repeat
business,'' he added. ``When you hit a chord with the audience like
this, they turn out to be very, very loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``Bowfinger,'' which received strong critical
support, generated exceptional business in Southern California but
noted its inside-Hollywood slant may have held back initial grosses
in other markets. ``It's still a good opening and it should play
well into the fall,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Universal distribution chief Nikki Rocco said ``Bowfinger,''
which stars Martin as a scamming director and Murphy in dual roles
as a paranoid superstar and his nerdy brother, would benefit in
coming weeks from strong recommendations among customers.
``Everyone who's seen it just loves it,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Three other films topped the $10 million mark as the summer
season continued to post numbers far above last year's
record-setting pace. Overall business topped $130 million, up a
remarkable 23 percent over the same weekend last year, even though
this weekend slid 15 percent from last weekend, the second-highest
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't recall a time when business has been this strong on an
ongoing basis,'' said veteran tracker Arthur Rockwell. ``Overall
demand for product - big, little, medium - has been incredible. The
variety of product has kept interest going.''

CRENSHAW NEED ONLY ADD HIS TWO CENTS 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ It may be uncertain whether they'll wave the
flag or smash it over one another's head, but like it or not, your
US Ryder Cup team is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Almost, anyway. The two-year qualification process ended Sunday
with the final round at the PGA Championship. And it involved a lot
less intrigue than emerged five days before from a second-floor
meeting room at Medinah Country Club where, contrary to the
postmortem spin, it was revealed that the American team's fighting
spirit may be more evident within its ranks than against the
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   After a week brimming with turmoil, testiness, and Tiger, the 10
Ryder points leaders _ all of them guaranteed berths _ are the same
as they were before this Tour carnival descended on Chicagoland:
PGA champion Woods, David Duval, Payne Stewart, Davis Love, Mark
O'Meara, Hal Sutton, Justin Leonard, Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson, and
Jeff Maggert.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ben Crenshaw indicated that he wouldn't know the
identity of the two captain's selections to round out the team when
he left the course Sunday &UR;  &LR; night ``because there's too much
figuring to do,'' Tom Lehman and Fred Couples are the overwhelming
clubhouse leaders. That's mainly because they're not clubhouse
lawyers, of which this team already has an abundance.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw will make the announcement at a Medinah press
conference this morning. Then the distinguished dozen will
concentrate on trying to recapture the Cup from Europe Sept. 24-26
at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass. That is, unless they're
still hissing over how much input the PGA of America will give the
touring pros in determining how Ryder profits are distributed to
charity. Supposedly laid to harmonious rest by Tuesday's truce, the
issue resurfaced with a vengeance the next day when Crenshaw
blasted the four main contrarians _ Woods, Duval, O'Meara, and
Mickelson _ for making commerce rather than competition the
centerpiece so close to the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw steadfastly insisted Sunday that the feud is forgotten
and that ``it's onward to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's behind us,'' he said of the squabbling. ``I'm happy with
this team the way it's formed. It's formidable. These are people I
feel confident in because of the way they've played the last two
years. Like I said the other day when I pointed down the
(locker-room) carpet to the restrooms, we're all on the same
path.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, he doesn't mean into the toilet, where the past two
US Ryder teams have wound up in the biennial competition. In fact,
with the exception of Ryder rookie Duval, this group is bursting
with experience, most of it bad. All of the other nine automatic
choices have played in the Ryder, and all nine have played on Ryder
losers. Only Stewart, Love, and O'Meara know the taste of
international victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hesitate to say it,'' said Sutton, who is ending a 12-year
Ryder hiatus, ``but I think we have the best players in the world
in the US. But we haven't proved it, and it's high time we did.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much sweating involved Sunday as the finish line
approached. The top five in the standings _ Duval, Woods, Stewart,
Love, and O'Meara _ were guaranteed spots before they teed off
Thursday, though Woods wound up displacing Duval at No. 1 by virtue
of his victory. Sutton, Furyk, and Mickelson _ who said after
finishing in 57th place with a 77_295 that he and Crenshaw had
hashed out their differences and that ``whatever transpired this
week is irrelevant'' _ were secure after making the cut Friday.
Even Leonard, who missed it, didn't have to stare at the TV over
the weekend because he was secure in seventh place.
</P>
<P>
   Only Maggert, who also missed the cut, was vulnerable. Even at
that, it would have taken some superior efforts to nose him out.
Lehman, who began Sunday 11th on the Ryder list, needed to finish
ninth in the tournament to leapfrog Maggert; he wound up 34th with
a 76_291 and headed with his family to Colorado for a couple of
days of R&AMP;R, though he promised ``to keep my cell phone on'' in
hopes of getting a call from Crenshaw Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other long shots, 14th-place Chris Perry needed a
two-way tie for sixth; he fell short with a 10th-place 71_285. No.
16 Steve Pate had to claim fourth place outright; he settled for an
eighth-place tie with a 69_284.
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 Bob Estes provided a temporary subsidiary drama in the
tournament within a tournament. Needing a two-way tie for fifth, he
jumped into a tie for fourth as he birdied four of five holes from
the 10th through 14th, going 8 under for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first round where I've had the Ryder on my
mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He could forget about it after bogeys at 16 and 17 dropped him
into a sixth-place tie at 69_282 _ one shot shy of his first Ryder
ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``One shot over two years,'' lamented Estes, who doesn't expect
Crenshaw to choose him even though he displaced Lehman at 11th and
``at least gave Ben something to think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a putt that lipped out,'' he added of the margin of
failure, ``a ball that hits a spike mark.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Estes learned the lesson of the Ryder Cup: A
sprint doesn't necessarily win a marathon. That's at least one
thing the whole team can agree on. Can't they?

SERENA AND TENNIS: IT FITS HER LIKE A GLOVE
</HEADLINE>
 ... CORRECTS SERENA'S AGE TO(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ For Serena Williams, a professional
tennis career is a lot like a piece of expensive jewelry. She's
trying it on to see how she likes it. The truth? It flatters her
beyond belief.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be working on commission in some tony store to
recognize that tennis accentuates Williams' best features. She has
noticed it, too, but that doesn't mean something else in life's
display window won't grab her eye tomorrow. The tennis-ager is
always shopping for new gems and new journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' peers on the professional tour _ a group that includes
her older sister Venus _ can only hope she stumbles upon something
she considers even more precious than the No. 1 global ranking.
Otherwise, we're not sure anyone can stop her from claiming it for
her collection.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time Compton resident acknowledged Sunday that she is
covetously eyeing Martina Hingis' throne. Williams didn't bat a
lash when a man in the Manhattan Country Club stands serenaded her
with the sweet-sounding ``Number One'' following her straight-sets
victory over JulieHalard-Decugis in the singles final at the Acura
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing it, Williams, who was standing at midcourt,
straightened her posture and gushed to nobody in particular and
everybody in general, ``Yes, No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, she made it clear she hadn't simply gotten
swept up in the moment. ``I wasn't joking at all,'' she said. ``I
definitely feel (the No. 1 ranking) is within my reach.''
</P>
<P>
   So do we, mainly because her reach encompasses every inch of the
tennis surface _ and probably the adjacent food court as well.
Williams is so quick on her feet, balls seem to bounce more slowly
in her court. In the semifinals here, Hingis tied Williams up at
the baseline, then tried dinking the ball over the net with little
success.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Halard-Decugis ran Williams from side to side and up
and down, which made for breathtaking rallies but just one service
break for the Frenchwoman, in the eighth game of the second set. We
don't want to say Williams' athleticism had Halard-Decugis hearing
footsteps, but even when she hit a clean winner Halard-Decugis
could be seen glancing nervously over her shoulder on her way back
to the baseline, as if she half-expected to see the ball flying off
Williams' racket.
</P>
<P>
   Halard-Decugis' first serve might have failed her far too often
Sunday, but words didn't. ``She was too good for me today,'' said
Halard-Decugis, who is ranked No. 11 in the world, two spots behind
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Only one place separates them in the rankings but there is a
world of difference between the two players. Halard-Decugis is 28
and married to her coach. She has short, spiked hair, a lean build
and on Sunday she wore a pleated skirt, an oversized polo shirt and
no jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is 17 and single. She has cornrows and a muscular build
and showed up for the kill in a snug-fitting dress, with gold
jewelry dangling from her ears, neck and wrist.
</P>
<P>
   One is modest, the other flashy, and the way they both hit the
ball is scary. Their pace is hellacious and they have powerful
serves. No wonder Steffi Graf decided to retire. She saw the future
of tennis and it was a heat-seeking missile.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows Williams can hit the fuzz off the ball. On
Sunday, we saw Halard-Decugis handle Williams' serves more deftly
than most and return her lethal ground strokes in kind. Anyone who
watched the match can tell you: To say someone ``hits like a girl''
is high praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both playing pretty powerful,'' said Williams, and
with players like that, who needs No. 1 playing No. 2? If nothing
else, the ousters in the semifinals of top-ranked Hingis and
second-ranked Lindsay Davenport freed us to celebrate the depth of
the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   In Williams' lifetime, women's tennis has come a long way: from
Chris Evert, who made it OK to perspire, to Martina Navratilova,
who made it OK to have muscles, to Steffi Graf, who made it OK to
talk trash.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is the resulting hybrid. In at least one respect,
though, she is refreshingly original. Home-schooled by her mother,
Oracene, Williams speaks with a diction as crisp as her forehand
passing shot. Her speech is sprinkled with words such as
``ameliorate'' and she talks enthusiastically of enrolling in an
art school in Fort Lauderdale in the fall and being out of tennis
by the time she's 23 because ``there's so much more I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   With a perspective as broad as her shoulders, how can Williams
lose?

NDEREBA MAKES SPLASH AT FALMOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
 WOMEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALMOUTH, Mass. _ First, Colleen De Reuck tried to get away from
Catherine Ndereba in the forested early miles. No luck. Then, 5
miles into the race with Ndereba settled in right behind her left
shoulder, she knew it was now or never, surge or be gobbled up.
Maybe both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 5 and 6 I was going to try to break her,'' said De
Reuck, a South African living in Boulder, Colo., who has one of the
best overall records here of any woman in race history. ``But she
sat on me. I'd get a little gap and she'd close.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that, for the third time in four years, De Reuck
led for most of Sunday's 27th annual Falmouth Road Race only to see
Ndereba slip by at the 6-mile mark and ease steadily ahead for
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she was coming,'' said the 35-year-old De Reuck, who
nonetheless could do nothing about it. ``I just don't have that
speed,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Ndereba broke the tape in 36 minutes 32 seconds for her third
win in four years _ interrupted only by maternity leave in 1997 _
and a $10,000 check. De Reuck came in nine seconds back in 36:41 to
earn $5,000, while Jane Ngotho, a 30-year-old Kenyan, was third in
37:11 and took home $2,000. The first American, Jennifer Rhines of
Haverford, Pa., was sixth in 37:24.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the downpour, Ndereba's winning time was almost a
minute off her course record of 35:37, set in her debut here in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the fourth time De Reuck has finished second at
Falmouth (1995, '96 and '98, to go along with a pair of victories
in '93 and '97), but she cheerily insisted she wasn't disappointed.
On the contrary, De Reuck declared she had a great time splashing
through the ankle-deep puddles. ``It was actually like fun, just
playing in the rain,'' she said, adding philosophically, ``It's a
drought year; you can't be fussy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ndereba, on the other hand, wasn't as enamored of the weather.
``We aren't used to running in the wet or the rain,'' said the
drenched Kenyan, trying to dry off in the athletes' tent. ``It was
very much my fear I would fall in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her concerns, the Kenyan woman who has dominated US road
racing this season with nine wins in 13 tries appeared to run
effortlessly from the gun. Midway into the 7.1-mile trek, just
after turning onto Surf Drive, she was two relaxed strides behind
the leader De Reuck and three ahead of Ngotho, with Olga Markova, a
two-time Boston Marathon winner in '92 and '93, a close fourth and
Kenyan Teresa Wanjiku right behind her. By 4.5 miles Wanjiku and
Markova were falling back.
</P>
<P>
   At Mile 5, De Reuck glanced over her right shoulder to find
Ndereba exactly where she expected: right there. Soon it was just
the two of them, as Ngotho began to drop back. ``I was trying to
catch up, but the race was finished,'' said Ngotho.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ndereba said it was merely a coincidence that she has
passed De Reuck at virtually the same spot for the third year
(``Whenever I run, I don't have a plan. I listen to my body''), she
made her customary move just before the 6-mile mark, slipping past
De Reuck and slowly building her lead. At the 10-kilometer
(6.2-mile) mark she was 10 yards ahead; by the Mariner's Point it
was 25; by the finish close to 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I feel good,'' the winner said when asked how she felt
about yet another victory here, soggy as it was. ``This is the
third year I have run on this course, and I like it.''

WOODS HOLDS OFF GARCIA'S CHARGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Golf's final major championship of the 1900s had
a sense of history about it long before Tiger Woods and Sergio
Garcia teed it up for the final round of the PGA Championship
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Historic grumbling about U.S. players wanting more compensation
for playing in the Ryder Cup. Historic length of Medinah Country
Club's No. 3 course _ 7,401 yards. Historic field featuring 94 of
the top 100 golfers in the world, the best field of any major this
century.
</P>
<P>
   But the 23-year-old Woods and Spain's 19-year-old Garcia proved
that there is much more history to be made and that the future of
golf is secure well into the 21st century as the pair of
still-emerging superstars ended the 81st PGA Championship with a
classic dual of nerves and skill.
</P>
<P>
   At 11-under with an even-par round Sunday, Woods prevailed for
his second major title in three years on the PGA Tour, earning the
$630,000 winner's check and ending questions about when he would
ever duplicate his 1997 win at the Masters. Woods also overtook
David Duval, who finished well back tied for 10 place, as the No. 1
player in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods seemed more relieved than triumphant after
withstanding a rollicking run by Garcia, who fell just one stroke
short of catching Woods while stealing the hearts of the gallery on
the back nine at Medinah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough day, but it's always nice to play with all the
pressure on the line,'' Woods said. ``If you don't like that and
you don't have fun doing that, then I don't know why you're even
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The shot of the day came on the par-4, 452-yard 16th when Garcia
rolled his drive up against an oak tree next to the fairway. With
what seemed an impossible lie and 189 yards to the pin, Garcia said
he pulled out a 6-iron and closed his eyes on the downswing.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the ball sliced to the green, with Garcia running and
jumping down the fairway after it like a kid who'd just lost his
kite string. Garcia made par, while Woods behind him, coming off a
double-bogey on 13, and a bogey at 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened my eyes and I saw the ball going to the green, and I
was pretty excited there,'' Garcia said of the improbable shot.
</P>
<P>
   However, it still wasn't enough for the Spaniard nicknamed ``El
Ni &UR; gftilde &LR; no,'' as Woods was able to weather the storm with
play-it-safe pars on 17 and 18. He also had to withstand a crowd
that suddenly was chanting, ``Sergio, Sergio,'' while some fans
even heckled Woods down the final two holes. One fan rooting for
Garcia told Woods that he would bet him $1,000 that he would slice
his shot on 17 into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying some things that they shouldn't have said,''
Woods said, irritated that a crowd that had once embraced him
turned on him in the middle of the round. ``And if I would have
showed any kind of emotion, they would have got on me pretty good.
... They were saying some pretty tough things, and you just had to
block it out and execute your golf shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said the crowd appeared to change after the front nine,
when Garcia started making his run with birdies on 10 and 13. With
Woods standing on the tee at the par-3 13th over Lake Kadijah,
Garcia ran up to the top of a hill to let his rival know he was
still a factor in the tournament after sinking an 18-foot birdie
putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to know that I was still there and to show him
that he had to finish well to win,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, however, not only embraced Woods with a hug after the
round but embraced the crowd as well. The enthusiasm of the
Chicago-area golf fans made Garcia feel ``like I was American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were incredible, and I would like to thank them and to
dedicate this tournament to them because I really think they
deserve it,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of Woods and Garcia overshadowed the downfall of
Canadian Mike Weir, who had history against him from the outset
Sunday. No Canadian (he's from Sarnia, Ontario) and no left-hander
had ever won the championship in 81 years. Weir started the day in
a tie for the lead with Woods at 11-under, but a horrendous 8-over
80 left him tied with Duval and five others in 10th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever could go wrong out there went wrong,'' a disheartened
Weir said.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to Jay Haas and Stewart Cink, three shots
behind Woods. Nick Price finished alone in fifth at 7-under after a
roller-coaster round that saw him score six birdies over the first
11 holes but end with three bogies over the last six holes to drop
him out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 19, is the youngest player to compete in a PGA
Championship since Gene Sarazen in 1921 and was trying to become
the first European to win the Wanamaker Trophy since the PGA
switched to stroke play in 1958. By finishing second, Garcia picked
up $378,000 for his biggest check since turning pro earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, he set the stage for a long rivalry with
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said when I turned pro that I wanted to be the No. 1 golfer
in the world,'' Garcia said. ``So I knew I was going to be a rival
for Tiger. But I said that I want to be a rival but always be
friends like we did today.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has only more history to make. He'd like to think he can
challenge Jack Nicklaus' all-time mark of winning 18 major
championships. However, he'd gone 10 majors since his Masters title
without winning another one.
</P>
<P>
   At 23 years, eight months and 16 days, Woods is the fifth
youngest PGA champion ever and the youngest since Nicklaus won his
first in 1963 at 23 years and six months. But that was Nicklaus'
third major title, after he had already won the Masters and the
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Nicklaus had a wonderful record at an early age
and he won numerous championships,'' Woods said, comparing careers
at this stage in his. ``But whether that puts me on track, it's
hard to say. ... I know that the key for me is to keep giving
myself chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Nicklaus' main rival in his era was Arnold Palmer,
Woods wasn't about to limit his rivals to just Garcia alone. He
listed other young players such as Duval, Justin Leonard, Phil
Mickelson, Ernie Els, Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's going to be a handful of players that are
going to lead golf into the next millennium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And they all will be chasing a Tiger for their part in the
history of the game.

MANDATORY INSURANCE LAW HASN'T WORKED, INSURERS, CONSUMER ADVOCATES
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ten years since Washington lawmakers made it illegal
to drive without car insurance, both consumer advocates and
insurance company executives say the law has done nothing to reduce
the number of uninsured drivers on the roads.
</P>
<P>
   The law's overwhelming passage in 1989 reflected a growing
frustration with uninsured drivers who were causing crashes and
injuries they couldn't pay for. Lawmakers besieged with horror
stories felt uninsured drivers should be punished with sizable
fines, recalled King County Councilman Pete Von Reichbauer, a
Federal Way Republican who sponsored the bill when he was a state
senator.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, critics said the law lacked teeth because it
contained no measures to make auto insurance more affordable for
the poor. Von Reichbauer acknowledged that the law didn't do
anything to give the poor more access to insurance, but said he
hoped at the time it would ``open the door'' to subsequent
legislation that would.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue never resurfaced as a priority in Olympia, the
state capital. Ten years later, the mandatory liability insurance
law's only concrete impact has been imposition of a $480 fine for
those caught driving without such insurance. More than 59,000
people paid the penalty last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures provided by several major Washington auto
insurers, including Safeco, the steep penalties have done little to
motivate uninsured drivers to change their habits. The frequency of
claims filed from accidents with uninsured motorists have not
declined over the decade, remaining stable despite the mandatory
liability insurance law.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wolfe, vice president of government affairs for Safeco in
Seattle, said that in 1989, the company handled 24
uninsured-motorist claims for every 10,000 insured vehicles. In the
second quarter of 1999, it also handled 24 claims per 10,000
policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry never believed that this would be a workable
solution for dealing with uninsured drivers,'' said Mel Sorensen,
assistant vice president and the Northwest regional manager of the
National Association of Independent Insurers. ``These kinds of
punitive approaches are built on a faulty foundation, which is the
whole idea that mandatory insurance works.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayward Evans, director of the Central Area Motivation Project,
a Seattle social service agency, is hoping to prod lawmakers into
creating a lower-priced auto insurance policy for Washington's
poor, who account for 19 percent of the state's population. Evans
argues it was irresponsible of the state to levy hefty fines for
those driving without insurance without guaranteeing it was within
the reach of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making criminals out of people who are trying to get to
work or get their kids to day care without offering them any other
options,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Harkins, Washington's chief deputy insurance
commissioner, said the point of mandatory insurance is to guarantee
that every driver can be responsible financially in an accident and
to recognize that it's unfair that most drivers are forced to buy
uninsured motorist coverage. But it hasn't achieved its aims, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lofty goal, but unless we really attack the economic
problem that many people can't purchase insurance, it's never going
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 study by the state Traffic Safety Commission concluded
that 8.5 percent of Washington drivers were uninsured, and
researchers there say there's no indication their numbers have
declined.
</P>
<P>
   In the King County District Court and Seattle Municipal Court,
where suspended-license cases make up between a quarter to a third
of the misdemeanor caseloads, judges, prosecutors and public
defenders say that the failure to pay driving without insurance
tickets is one of the causes of that near-epidemic. The state
Department of Licensing estimates there are 340,183 suspended or
revoked licenses, compared with 4.2 million licensed drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Washington hasn't commissioned any recent research
examining the factors prompting uninsured motorists to continue to
drive.
</P>
<P>
   But uninsured drivers were scrutinized in an extensive study
done this year by the California Department of Insurance, where
researchers found they tend to be young and have incomes of less
than $20,000 a year. In focus groups, the drivers said auto
insurance was a low priority compared to things like medical
insurance and clothing for their children.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also found that entrenched habits and attitudes
among the uninsured, including a prevalent view among respondents
that they were ``the kind of person who does not have insurance''
influenced their decision.
</P>
<P>
   They had a high distrust of insurance companies and were far
less likely than insured people to take concrete steps to get a
policy, like calling an agent for an estimate, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   California's Republican Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush
now believes a two-pronged approach is needed to address the
growing ranks of uninsured motorists: lower-cost insurance options
and extensive educational outreach to poorer areas where fewer
policies are being written.
</P>
<P>
   Growing evidence that insurance remains beyond the reach of a
segment of the poor has prompted low-cost policy proposals in
Washington and California in recent years. But finding solutions
that aren't opposed by the powerful insurance lobby has been
difficult. Insurance companies instead tend to support measures
that would bring insurance costs down for all drivers, such as
limiting accident-prone teens' night driving or lowering the
drunken-driving blood-alcohol level.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Washington Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn proposed
legislation that would have banned insurance companies from
considering factors like marital status, sex, age, loss or lack of
previous insurance and employment and credit history in determining
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Senn argues that such factors discriminate against low-income
people, who are more likely to have periods in which they can't
afford insurance or have problems paying their bills. But the
insurance industry successfully fought her proposals, presenting
statistical evidence that the factors were good predictors of how
accident-prone drivers were.
</P>
<P>
   For example, young drivers are involved in more crashes.
National Safety Council figures show drivers aged 16 to 34 account
for only a third of the nation's drivers, but are involved in about
half of all accidents. And although female drivers were
proportionately more likely to be involved in accidents, male
drivers were 2.7 times as likely to be involved in a fatal crash,
1997 council figures show.
</P>
<P>
   And drivers without past insurance are more likely to be
involved in accidents, said Karl Newman, executive of the
Washington Insurance Commission. He said one large Washington
insurance company offered policies to drivers with good records but
a lack of past insurance found that during a five-year period, they
ended up paying out 10 percent more in claims for those drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Another option California lawmakers are considering is creating
a policy with much lower levels of liability coverage than law
currently requires. In Washington, existing law requires all
drivers to have $25,000 in liability for bodily injury of one
person in an accident, $50,000 for injuries to two or more people,
and $10,000 for property damage. California's current requirements
are already considerably lower.
</P>
<P>
   One leading California bill would require insurance companies to
offer a $300 annual liability policy with even lower limits to
people living at 150 percent or less of the federal poverty level
with good driving rec-
</P>
<P>
   ords. Tim Hart, senior legislative counsel for the California
Department of Insurance, said the liability levels in bill ($10,000
for bodily injury to one person; $20,000 for two or more people;
$3,000 for property damage) would cover an estimated 60 percent and
80 percent of accident claims.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Martha Escutia, the Democrat from urban east Los Angeles
sponsoring the bill, has said that it would give the poor access to
a basic policy and a chance to break their illegal driving
patterns. But because it has a mandated price tag and wouldn't
cover every accident, it's highly controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Kotambu Shabazz, an insurance broker at the Robinson Group in
Seattle who works to help low-income people find affordable
insurance, said he would feel guilty pitching coverage so low that
his customers would be vulnerable in a major accident.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that people who buy safe cars, keep their driving
records clean and maintain their auto insurance already get
moderate rates, and the key is educating lower income people of
that reality.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers in California have taken a somewhat different view. The
Association of California Insurance companies has expressed support
for the creation of a lower-liability policy, but only if they, and
not the government, set policy rates. Safeco's Wolfe said his
company would not want to see a flat-rated policy like Escutia's
mandated. He said if rates are set too low, there's a danger other
already insured drivers would end up paying higher rates to cover
the losses on the low-income policies.
</P>
<P>
   In rare cases, Washington's Department of Social and Health
Services will help those in the state's welfare-to-work program
with insurance payments. Cindy Mund, a WorkFirst program
administrator, said the $300 subsidy is only offered when it's
pivotal in helping the person succeed at a new job. Subsidies for
public transit are far more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   But Evans of CAMP has asked for greater use of the insurance
subsidies, arguing that for many, having a car is necessary to
escape poverty. His views are echoed in a study released this month
by Washington, D.C.-based researchers at the Brookings Institutions
and the Progressive Policy Institute examining welfare-to-work
programs in 10 states, including Washington. It concludes more
resources should be invested in helping low-income working parents
obtain cars and auto insurance, because public transit systems
aren't meeting their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For both rural and inner-city poor, access means being able to
reach the prosperous suburbs of our booming metropolitan economies,
and mobility means having the private automobile necessary for the
trip,'' the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Senn, Rep. Kip Tokuda, King County Councilman Larry Gossett and
several Seattle City Council members, including Peter Steinbrueck
and Margaret Pageler, are now studying options for making it more
likely that Washington's poor will have auto insurance. But given
that insurance rates for most drivers have been falling steadily in
recent years, it may be difficult to get state lawmakers to act on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Tokuda said he'll explore the concept of a lower-priced
liability insurance at an upcoming retreat of House members. And
Evans said he is organizing a round table next month to bring
insurers, Senn, leading Republican lawmakers and Seattle-area
politicians together to discuss options.

MOTHER WITHOUT CAR INSURANCE TAKES A RISK EVERY DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Tami Madigan and her three young sons wake up every
morning in a Duvall, Wash., homeless shelter, and her determination
to deliver them to a better life is the reason she starts each
weekday breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   She drives to work and day care without car insurance or a valid
license.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know her secret, you might think the smiling,
wavy-haired 27-year-old was a poster child for Washington's
welfare-to-work program. After two years of public assistance, she
recently landed a $22,000-a-year job as an office assistant in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   It's a job she says she loves. And it's a relief, she says, to
finally be able to say yes when one of her tow-headed boys asks for
candy or a toy.
</P>
<P>
   Madigan is not about to lose that new job. She's saving money to
get an apartment in the city, closer to work, and day care. In the
meantime, the Madigans are sharing a $200-a-month room in the
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long commute. And the last bus from her downtown Seattle
job to Duvall - 20 miles northeast of Seattle - leaves at 5:30
p.m., which doesn't give her enough time to round up Thomas, 2,
Matthew, 3, and Zachary, 9, from three separate day cares after she
leaves work. So she recently bought a Ford Probe, which she drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so nerve-wracking,'' she said. ``Every time I see a cop I
panic.''
</P>
<P>
   A caseworker at the Central Area Motivation Project, Thaddius
Anderson, is working to help Madigan drive legally again. Madigan's
driving troubles began a few years ago, when she lost her job and
then let her insurance lapse. It wasn't long before she got tickets
for driving without insurance and valid license tabs. By then she
was receiving public assistance, she said, and she didn't have the
$600 to pay her tickets. Her license was suspended, and for a while
she stopped driving _ until she got her new job.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that Madigan will be able to get her license
reinstated by setting up time-payment plans to pay off her old
tickets. But getting insurance will be a thornier matter.
</P>
<P>
   Madigan wrongly assumed that because she had never been involved
in an accident, her rates would be relatively low. But in the eyes
of insurers, Madigan has accrued a long list of statistically
proven strikes against her.
</P>
<P>
   She is single, has two recent traffic tickets and a suspended
license, and hasn't had insurance in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Her lack of insurance automatically puts her in the high risk
category, according to Kotambu Shabazz, an insurance broker at the
Robinson Group in Seattle who estimated her auto insurance costs
for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   Madigan said because she has no savings, she wants to be sure
that if she is in an accident most of the damage would be covered.
She wants the liability insurance required under Washington law to
protect other drivers, as well as collision and comprehensive
insurance to protect herself and her boys. Even with a $500
deductible, Shabazz said, full coverage with Safeco would be $1,656
annually.
</P>
<P>
   That would amount to 10 percent of Madigan's take-home pay,
about five times what the average American household devotes to
auto insurance, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz notes that if Madigan kept her driving record clean and
regularly made monthly insurance payments, over time her policy
costs would drop dramatically, to $1,200 annually in her second
year and to $944 in her third insured year.
</P>
<P>
   Madigan said she'll have to wait until she finds an apartment
and examines costs like clothing, furniture and health care before
deciding whether she can afford it. But, she said, she's going to
try to come up with the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to stop driving like this,'' she said.

 MCCAIN SAYS 51/2 YEARS AS POW NO HERO'S TALE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOP presidential hopeful John McCain hasn't talked much on the
campaign trail about the 51/2 years he spent in North Vietnamese
prison camps _ a nightmare during which he believes that he
``failed'' his family and country by signing a confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was no hero. Nor have I ever considered myself such,''
McCain said in an interview with The Chronicle. ``I was privileged
to serve in the company of heroes. I observed 1,000 acts of courage
and compassion and love that enriched my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I failed as a prisoner to live up to the expectations
and the standards that were set for me by my father and grandfather
_ because I signed a confession.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Arizona senator prepares to begin a two-week California
campaign trip Monday, McCain's distinguished and often-painful past
as a POW is now certain to become more familiar to voters.
</P>
<P>
   And it is no mystery why.
</P>
<P>
   In a year in which character has taken center stage in politics,
McCain's extraordinary life story may draw a distinct contrast to
those of the other GOP hopefuls, particularly that of GOP
front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, who topped the Iowa straw poll over the
weekend, is facing increasing criticism. Marilyn Quayle, the wife
of GOP candidate Dan Quayle, dismissed Bush as a ``party frat
boy,'' and other conservatives like George Will have criticized
Bush for his refusal to discuss whether he has used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   McCain refused to take part in the pay-for-play Iowa poll,
calling it a ``sham.'' Instead, he has focused on other key states
like California, hiring new fund-raisers and veteran GOP strategist
Todd Harris here.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has begun to distribute statewide a dramatic biographical
video detailing his POW story. The son and grandson of
distinguished admirals, McCain was a decorated Navy pilot on his
23rd bombing mission over North Vietnam when shot down on Oct. 26,
1967. He spent 51/2 years in the notorious North Vietnamese prison
camps, two in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Adm. John McCain II, commander of all U.S. forces in
the Pacific during the Vietnam War, gave the order to bomb Hanoi
even while his son was incarcerated there. McCain was repeatedly
beaten and tortured after he refused early VIP release, saying
prisoners incarcerated longer should go first.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, McCain begins a three-week national tour _ appearing
on the ``Tonight'' show and on major daytime talk shows _ to mark
publication of his memoirs, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' which he calls
the story of ``three generations of imperfect men who tried to do
the right thing _ and didn't always succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, he reveals that he repeatedly tried to commit suicide as
a POW _ in one case trying to hang himself with his own shirt.
After an extended period of torture, he signed a confession
admitting to being a war criminal _ an incident, he admits, that
haunts him to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has
his breaking point,'' McCain has written. ``I had reached mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, political insiders say, the candidate's candid remembrances
may serve to focus a new light on a campaign that, while exciting
many Republicans, has been financially and politically swamped by
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``When voters hear what John McCain has to say, and once they
learn about (his history), they tend to respond very strongly,''
said Dan Schnur, his communications chief.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's fellow POWs, including those who served with him in
the notorious Hanoi Hilton compound, reject McCain's tough
self-assessment of his actions during POW years _ especially the
idea that he somehow ``failed'' his country, or them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're some of the toughest SOBs who ever walked the valley,''
said Orson Swindle, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who spent
61/2 years in POW captivity and ``slept side-by-side for two
years'' in a cramped cell with McCain. ``We have endured. We're
tough, not because we're supermen, but because we recognize our
limitations, and our strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of a single person who ... was tortured, who did
not break under the torture,'' said Swindle, now a federal trade
commissioner. ``It was one of the lessons we learned: The mark of
real men is not that you can avoid being beaten down. The mark is
to get up off the floor and fight again.''
</P>
<P>
   Swindle said he also confessed under torture. ``I found out I
wasn't John Wayne. And it hurts, to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Of McCain's frank admission of suicide attempts, Swindle said
such attempts were ``not uncommon'' among POWs. ``A lot of guys
considered it, when you hurt as bad as we did,'' said Swindle. ``I
begged them to kill me. They said it would be too good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, even in the dark days, McCain often fought to
communicate with his fellow prisoners _ at the risk of brutal
beatings _ and to devise means to keep up their spirits to survive
years in cramped cells and horrific conditions.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the confines of the Hanoi Hilton, ``we decided
we would construct a course on the history of the evolution of the
American novel,'' Swindle said. ``(It was) what do you remember
about `Catcher in the Rye?''' he said. ``We put all our knowledge
together _ and who the hell was to challenge us?''
</P>
<P>
   Swindle also remembered Christmas 1972, when ``we had the idea
to do `The Christmas Carol' and act out the play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen `Stalag 17,' and we thought first we'd re-create
it,'' he laughs. ``Then, we thought it wasn't a good idea, so (we
did) Dickens. John played Scrooge, and I played Christmas past,
present and future. We stole some cotton, and made hats, and we put
on this thing. And it was totally obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   But those were actions for which North Vietnamese jailers
``singled us out,'' Swindle said. ``They called us the bad apples
in the barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite constant tormenting, beatings and torture, Swindle said,
McCain proved ``courageous, outrageous ... an incredible
entertainer and morale booster, quick to crack a joke ... and one
of the most loyal friends I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar view is shared by Everett Alvarez, the first pilot
shot down in Vietnam in 1964, and now a management consultant in
Washington. Alvarez, who was imprisoned for 81/2 years, said McCain
``had extra pressure put on him'' because he was the son and
grandson of distinguished military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said the senator's history is both relevant to his
presidential quest and revealing about how he would perform on the
job. ``Having had that (POW) experience, you're not going to cower
or be intimidated by special interests, by advocates of something
you don't think is right,'' Alvarez said, ``no matter what the
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself said his POW stature shouldn't be a factor in his
ability to win support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that it wasn't just the fact that I was a Vietnam
veteran that could cause (voters) to deal with me with some
respect,'' he said. ``It's not what you've done. It's what you will
do, or can do.''

   GLOBAL-RETIREMENT-REVIEW (United Nations) _ When it comes to
worrying about how to sustain a Social Security system in an era of
aging populations _ or how to insure that there will be enough new
talent to fill the workplace as fewer babies are born and more
people retire _ the United States is far from alone. Around the
world, but particularly in Europe and richer Asian nations, the
situation is even more alarming, and so are the choices governments
may soon have to make. By Barbara Crossette. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   EVOLUTION-CREATIONISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ As politicians fight
over whether evolution should be taught in school, its supporters
might strengthen their case if they conceded a point to its
opponents: Since evolution is indeed a theory and not a proven
fact, there may be benefits to having it taught side by side with
creationism. The result could be a wider appreciation that
creationism isn't even a theory, and that what evolution's
opponents consider its weakness is actually its strength: like all
of science, it is based on malleable human knowledge. By George
Johnson. (`a' category)

<P>
   BUDGET-SURPLUS-REVIEW (Washington) _ There is no budget surplus
this year, and at the rate Congress is going, there may not be one
anytime soon. It's beginning to look about as real as a $3 bill.
For when Congress comes back from vacation, a ritual dance around
an enormous pile of money will resume. And when this dance is done,
the first pot of black ink the government was supposed to have
saved in 30 years will be drained, deliberately and completely,
according to Republicans and Democrats alike. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENTS-IN-PUBLIC-REVIEW (Undated) _ There was a time when
presidents could move about freely in public with little or no
entourage, often to mingle with the people. But in the age of the
choreographed photo-op and the scripted `listening tour,' of all
news all the time and blanket Secret Service protection, it seems
all but impossible that an American politician, even a president as
populist as Bill Clinton, could pull off such a stunt. By Todd
Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   DROUGHT-BLAME-REVIEW (Undated) _ Amid this summer's drought, the
cherished American activities of plant and lawn watering have been
criminalized by state and local governments desperate to change
people's behavior and save water. While the goal may be justified,
a basic question remains: How did this rap get pinned on the
average citizen? By Joe Sharkey.

the Presley archives.

   MEXICO-FEMALE-COPS-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ As part of an
anti-corruption drive, the new police chief here hopes to reduce
bribe-taking by traffic cops by allowing only female officers to
write tickets. The rationale is that women, who are not accustomed
to being in positions of power, are less susceptible to corruption.
Also, it is felt, women are easier to communicate and deal with. By
Joseph Treaster.

<P>
   YELTSIN-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
seemingly erratic behavior in naming a virtual unknown as his new
prime minister and political heir does not necessarily mean he has
taken leave of his senses. It may well be part of a Yeltsin plan to
hold on to as much power as he can, for as long as he can. By
Celestine Bohlen.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; KAATERSKILL FALLS &LR;  By Allegra Goodman. Delta, $12.95. This
panoramic first novel explores the small excitements and larger,
religious rhythms of life in a cloistered Orthodox Jewish community
in the 1970s. Last year in The New York Times Book Review, Daphne
Merkin said the author ``has an almost 19th-century ability to
create a sense of linkage, of one existence impinging on the
next.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGENDS OF THE AMERICAN DESERT: SOJOURNS IN THE GREATER
SOUTHWEST &LR;  By Alex Shoumatoff. Harper Perennial, $15. This
ferociously omnivorous narrative is as sprawling and unruly as its
terrain, the swath of land stretching from Mexico City to southern
Colorado and the Texas panhandle. ``Shoumatoff is a wily and
attentive guide'' to the region and its history, folklore and
amazing variety of cultures, Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote in The New
York Times Book Review in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW THE CANYON BECAME GRAND: A SHORT HISTORY &LR; , by Stephen J.
Pyne (Penguin, $12.95), shows how human attitudes toward the Grand
Canyon have changed over time, from indifference among Spanish
explorers in 1540 to wonder among today's visitors. Last year the
reviewer Timothy Egan called this an ``energetic paean'' to ``the
canyon's glories and the people who have tried to understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUITE A YEAR FOR PLUMS &LR;  By Bailey White. Vintage, $12. In this
sweet-natured first novel, a plant pathologist falls for an ascetic
wildlife artist who shows up in his small Georgia town and sets the
locals abuzz. ``On one level'' the book ``is about chickens and
peanut cultivars and pine straw fires; on another, it's about art
and impermanence and freedom,'' Tom Drury wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STEPHEN SONDHEIM: A LIFE &LR;  By Meryle Secrest. Delta, $14.95. The
author puts her subject on the psychoanalyst's couch in this
portrait of the brilliant but insecure composer who brought
bleakness and maturity to the habitually sunny Broadway musical.
The result is an ``admirable biography'' by ``a tireless researcher
and marathon interviewer,'' Benedict Nightingale wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONDON HOLIDAY &LR;  By Richard Peck. Penguin, $12.95. Three
American women _ a society wife, an interior designer and a
schoolteacher _ travel to London to renew their friendship and
unpack their emotional baggage at Mrs. Smith-Porter's charming
bed-and-breakfast. ``It's difficult not to lapse into Anglophile
burbles when describing this tidy little novel,'' Kimberly B.
Marlowe wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE AMERICAN CENTURY: THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE UNITED STATES
AS A WORLD POWER &LR;  By Donald W. White. Yale University, $18. In a
cultural and intellectual tour of the American psyche, the author
argues that failure at home and abroad turned the self-confident
superpower of the early 1960s into a purposeless behemoth. ``This
is a first-rate work, a kind of inner history of the Cold War,''
Fareed Zakaria wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HALF-LIFE OF HAPPINESS &LR;  By John Casey. Vintage
Contemporaries, $14. This novel's sharp-eyed narrator looks back on
her parents' bohemian marriage in 1970s Charlottesville, Va., and
how it came apart after her mother fell in love with another woman.
``Casey is marvelous at conjuring up the excitement of a campaign
meeting or a boxing match or the repartee of a domestic row,''
Lorna Sage wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SAME EMBRACE &LR;  By Michael Lowenthal. Plume, $12.95.
Identical twin brothers find their relationship threatened when one
becomes a gay activist and the other embraces Orthodox Judaism.
This first novel ``is an eloquent exploration of the nature of
faith, the consequences of judgment and the stubborn endurance of
family ties,'' Linda Barrett Osborne wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEN AND WHALES &LR;  By Richard Ellis. Lyons, $30. This handsomely
illustrated volume tracks the complex relationship between humans
and the earth's largest living creatures, from classical and
biblical references to the 1982 worldwide ban on commercial
whaling. ``His achievement is impressive and considerable,'' Robert
Finch wrote in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; SHIPWRECK OF THE WHALESHIP
ESSEX &LR; , by Owen Chase ($12.95), a vivid firsthand narrative of the
sinking of the vessel by a sperm whale in 1821, leaving the
survivors adrift in lifeboats in the South Seas for three months.
This edition also includes shorter accounts by the ship's captain
and a crew member, as well as notes by Herman Melville, who found
in Chase's book an inspiration for ``Moby Dick.'' ``The reading of
this wondrous story ... had a surprising effect on me,'' Melville
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A FLOATING LIFE: THE ADVENTURES OF LI PO &LR;  By Simon Elegant.
Ecco, $16. Based on fact and legend, this fictional memoir portrays
the great Tang dynasty poet Li Po (A.D. 700-762) as an inspired
roisterer, fond of wine and tall tales. ``The novel succeeds in
summoning up the man and his age in ways that are both deliciously
foreign and all too familiar,'' Philip Gambone wrote last year.

   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Out of gas, out of money and 200 miles from
home, Roland Pahland had good reasons to regret his passion for
seeing a solar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   He had battled traffic jams for nine hours driving south from
Hannover to Stuttgart to get directly in the eclipse's path
Wednesday. When he got there, rain clouds blocked his view and that
of hundreds of thousands of others. Now, having failed to calculate
how much gas he would burn sitting in traffic, Pahland, an
unemployed truck driver, was drumming up donations by singing
country-and-western songs at a highway rest stop.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all that, he spoke with wide-eyed wonder about watching
the sky turn dark and then light again. ``This was a
once-in-a-lifetime experience,'' he said. ``We didn't get to see
the corona of the eclipse, but we did see the sky become totally
dark and then suddenly turn light two minutes later. I will never
forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eclipses do that to people. Millions of Europeans drove for
hours, just for the chance to put on paper glasses with blackened
lenses and gape at an event that lasted two-and-a-half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There was something wondrous about the wonder itself. Between
horrible weather and ghastly traffic in much of Europe, it was as
if the Grinch had tried to steal the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   German autobahns were clogged all day with more than 200 miles
of traffic jams. Yet there were few signs of bitterness or
frustration. Even though they woke up to warnings of both bad
weather and bad traffic, thousands of people decided they simply
had to take a chance to witness the event, which won't repeat
itself in the area until 2081.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, which was almost directly in the path of the eclipse,
traffic stopped almost entirely and office workers poured into the
streets. Trading came to a near halt at stock exchanges in
Frankfurt, Paris and other cities. In Rome, Pope John Paul II
shortened his weekly general audience in order to watch the
eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Many Germans drove as close as they could to the eclipse's path,
then parked along shoulders of the autobahn or at gas stations and
rest areas. Parking areas became picnic spots. Astronomy buffs
compared notes on their solar-shielded cameras and telescopes.
Strangers shared their spectacles, which had become all but
impossible to buy by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And as the moon slowly crept in front of the sun, novices and
experts alike grew quieter and more reverent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had the feeling that people had put everything behind them
for the two minutes when it was happening,'' said Marcel Wenderoth,
23, a hotel receptionist who decided Tuesday night to drive with
his wife and 2-year-old son several hours from Dortmund. ``It was
euphoric.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Aug. 7 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

A RUSSIAN WHO'S STILL DANCING AS FAST AS HE CAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Is Russian President Boris Yeltsin crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Why else would a lame-duck president _ whose zombie-like public
appearances reinforce fears about his state of mind _ suddenly
jettison his latest prime minister, his fourth in 17 months, and
name as his political heir an unknown KGB officer who has no
political party, no popular support and the charisma of a
well-mannered Doberman Pincer?
</P>
<P>
   As tempting as the Mad Czar theory may be, there are other
explanations for Yeltsin's latest gyrations that may be even more
disturbing. According to those who know him well, Yeltsin probably
has a plan, possibly a flawed plan, which like most of his plans
has to do with holding on to as much power as he can, for as long
as he can.
</P>
<P>
   In naming Vladimir Putin as his new prime minister and preferred
successor last week, Yeltsin signaled that he is not going to sit
by idly while his opponents, either on the left (the Communists) or
those in the political center sweep up the remnants of his tattered
authority, and claim it as their own.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who for months now
has been in the Kremlin's ``enemies'' camp, formed a coalition with
a handful of autocratic governors, which perhaps, and most
importantly, may be joined this week by former Prime Minister
Yevgeni Primakov, Russia's most popular political figure.
</P>
<P>
   In dumping former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, the president
apparently decided that the mild-mannered 47-year-old former
commissioner lacked the gumption to tackle opponents like Luzhkov.
The 68-year-old president also stated firmly that he intends to
leave office in July 2000, as the Russian constitution requires him
to do at the end of his second term.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians believe him. But in a sign of their deep distrust
of their willful and capricious president, many others are not
convinced, fearing, for instance, a declaration of a state of
emergency or some other series of events that could disrupt the
first constitutional transfer of power in Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do many Russians necessarily believe that Putin, 46, will
still be Yeltsin's preferred choice as a successor by the time the
presidential elections roll around, several months after December's
parliamentary elections. Russian politics are littered with men
who, at one time or another, held the mantle that has now been
bestowed on Putin.
</P>
<P>
   One ace up Yeltsin's sleeve could be, oddly enough, Sergei
Stepashin, who served as prime minister for 82 days, and who last
week passed the ultimate test of loyalty: In an emotional
appearance before his Cabinet, Stepashin thanked the man who had
just fired him. Now courted by center-right parties still friendly
to the Kremlin, Stepashin may end up with the covert backing of the
Yeltsin entourage and as a bonus, a popular image as a man wronged
by an erratic czar.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin is determined to keep his hand in the elaborate
chess game that is Russian politics. His latest move was described
by one analyst as ``castling,'' where the king and castle swap
places. ``Yeltsin is very good at grasping the political
situation,'' said Gavril Popov, a former Moscow mayor and a
one-time Yeltsin ally in Russia's early democratic movement, in the
weekly newspaper Argumenti I Facti last week. ``He finds a decisive
solution which his administration cannot. The level of his physical
incapacities should never be overestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   In Putin, Yeltsin will have a loyal servant _ and a recent boss
of Russia's domestic intelligence service at that _ who will be
more ready than his predecessor to pull the kind of levers of power
that might make even Russia's most brazen regional bosses, an
increasingly independent lot, think twice. Often portrayed as the
kingmakers in the coming elections, they are still sensitive to the
granting of funds and the release of compromising information _
tools at the Kremlin's disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Such a bald use of power does not contradict the widely held
view that Yeltsin's influence as a political leader is almost
exhausted. Nor does it discount the fact that his team of advisers
has now shrunk to the size of a ``family'' _ the term used to refer
to the small circle of Kremlin insiders that includes his staff,
his daughter Tatyana Dyachenko and a smattering of power-hungry
oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   But power is a tangible commodity in Russia, used every day, in
many ways across the society _ in the way bosses belittle their
subordinates, in the way petty bureaucrats grant or withhold
meetings and signatures, in the way traffic police browbeat drivers
to cough up ``fines'' for tenuous violations. And Yeltsin, who has
used up advisers and staff like Kleenex, understands this better
than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's young, imperfect democracy has no system of checks and
balances. As in the days of the czars and commissars, if you lose
power, someone else will grab it. Power-sharing is only on the
winner's terms.
</P>
<P>
   When Luzhkov teamed up with the governors, analysts dubbed the
alliance Russia's new ``party of power'' _ a label pinned on ``Our
Home Is Russia,'' a political party formed in 1995 by Yeltsin's
prime minister, Victor Chernomyrdin, in reality the home of the
then-dominant political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   To borrow a phrase from the old Soviet propaganda machine, it is
no accident that Yeltsin fired Stepashin after the alliance was
forged Aug. 4, making his prime minister the scapegoat for failing
to stop a bandwagon threatening to slip out of the Kremlin's
control. By numerous accounts, Yeltsin tried to fire him Aug. 5 but
was dissuaded _ by his longtime adviser, the reformer Anatoly
Chubais, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday the president made his choice.

   MOSCOW _ Is Russian President Boris Yeltsin crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Why else would a lame-duck president _ whose zombie-like public
appearances reinforce fears about his state of mind _ suddenly
jettison his latest prime minister, his fourth in 17 months, and
name as his political heir an unknown KGB officer who has no
political party, no popular support and the charisma of a
well-mannered Doberman Pincer?
</P>
<P>
   As tempting as the Mad Czar theory may be, there are other
explanations for Yeltsin's latest gyrations that may be even more
disturbing. According to those who know him well, Yeltsin probably
has a plan, possibly a flawed plan, which like most of his plans
has to do with holding on to as much power as he can, for as long
as he can.
</P>
<P>
   In naming Vladimir Putin as his new prime minister and preferred
successor last week, Yeltsin signaled that he is not going to sit
by idly while his opponents, either on the left (the Communists) or
those in the political center sweep up the remnants of his tattered
authority, and claim it as their own.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who for months now
has been in the Kremlin's ``enemies'' camp, formed a coalition with
a handful of autocratic governors, which perhaps, and most
importantly, may be joined this week by former Prime Minister
Yevgeni Primakov, Russia's most popular political figure.
</P>
<P>
   In dumping former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, the president
apparently decided that the mild-mannered 47-year-old former
commissioner lacked the gumption to tackle opponents like Luzhkov.
The 68-year-old president also stated firmly that he intends to
leave office in July 2000, as the Russian constitution requires him
to do at the end of his second term.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians believe him. But in a sign of their deep distrust
of their willful and capricious president, many others are not
convinced, fearing, for instance, a declaration of a state of
emergency or some other series of events that could disrupt the
first constitutional transfer of power in Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do many Russians necessarily believe that Putin, 46, will
still be Yeltsin's preferred choice as a successor by the time the
presidential elections roll around, several months after December's
parliamentary elections. Russian politics are littered with men
who, at one time or another, held the mantle that has now been
bestowed on Putin.
</P>
<P>
   One ace up Yeltsin's sleeve could be, oddly enough, Sergei
Stepashin, who served as prime minister for 82 days, and who last
week passed the ultimate test of loyalty: In an emotional
appearance before his Cabinet, Stepashin thanked the man who had
just fired him. Now courted by center-right parties still friendly
to the Kremlin, Stepashin may end up with the covert backing of the
Yeltsin entourage and as a bonus, a popular image as a man wronged
by an erratic czar.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin is determined to keep his hand in the elaborate
chess game that is Russian politics. His latest move was described
by one analyst as ``castling,'' where the king and castle swap
places. ``Yeltsin is very good at grasping the political
situation,'' said Gavril Popov, a former Moscow mayor and a
one-time Yeltsin ally in Russia's early democratic movement, in the
weekly newspaper Argumenti I Facti last week. ``He finds a decisive
solution which his administration cannot. The level of his physical
incapacities should never be overestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   In Putin, Yeltsin will have a loyal servant _ and a recent boss
of Russia's domestic intelligence service at that _ who will be
more ready than his predecessor to pull the kind of levers of power
that might make even Russia's most brazen regional bosses, an
increasingly independent lot, think twice. Often portrayed as the
kingmakers in the coming elections, they are still sensitive to the
granting of funds and the release of compromising information _
tools at the Kremlin's disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Such a bald use of power does not contradict the widely held
view that Yeltsin's influence as a political leader is almost
exhausted. Nor does it discount the fact that his team of advisers
has now shrunk to the size of a ``family'' _ the term used to refer
to the small circle of Kremlin insiders that includes his staff,
his daughter Tatyana Dyachenko and a smattering of power-hungry
oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   But power is a tangible commodity in Russia, used every day, in
many ways across the society _ in the way bosses belittle their
subordinates, in the way petty bureaucrats grant or withhold
meetings and signatures, in the way traffic police browbeat drivers
to cough up ``fines'' for tenuous violations. And Yeltsin, who has
used up advisers and staff like Kleenex, understands this better
than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's young, imperfect democracy has no system of checks and
balances. As in the days of the czars and commissars, if you lose
power, someone else will grab it. Power-sharing is only on the
winner's terms.
</P>
<P>
   When Luzhkov teamed up with the governors, analysts dubbed the
alliance Russia's new ``party of power'' _ a label pinned on ``Our
Home Is Russia,'' a political party formed in 1995 by Yeltsin's
prime minister, Victor Chernomyrdin, in reality the home of the
then-dominant political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   To borrow a phrase from the old Soviet propaganda machine, it is
no accident that Yeltsin fired Stepashin after the alliance was
forged Aug. 4, making his prime minister the scapegoat for failing
to stop a bandwagon threatening to slip out of the Kremlin's
control. By numerous accounts, Yeltsin tried to fire him Aug. 5 but
was dissuaded _ by his longtime adviser, the reformer Anatoly
Chubais, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday the president made his choice.

HUNTING FOR THAT ELUSIVE SURPLUS

   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Dennis Hastert went to a nuts and
bolts factory outside Chicago last week and waved four $1 bills in
the air. The money was supposed to represent a trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the surplus,'' he said, and then promised to give
three of the dollars back to Americans in the form of a whopping
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the surplus right now is as real as a $3 bill. This year was
supposed to bring the first surplus in three decades. But when
Congress comes back from vacation in September, a ritual dance
around this pot of money will resume. And when the dance is done,
the pot will be empty. Its fate does not augur well for the
21st-century surpluses that are supposed to underwrite the
Republican tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The tussle over the public treasure is shaping up as a war.
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, the conservative major domo, said in
an interview last week that draining the surplus was a deliberate
strategy designed to force President Clinton to submit to the
Republicans' political will.
</P>
<P>
   He said the president had three choices. One: get down ``on his
knees'' and sign the spending bills the Republicans are writing,
which cut or kill many of Clinton's favorite programs. Two: raid
another pot of money, the sacrosanct Social Security surplus, to
restore those cuts. Three: shut down the government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded: ``I can think of nothing more cynical or
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   As Congress and the White House play chicken, and Republicans
and Democrats vie for advantage in next year's elections, this will
be one of the only serious political games in town next month.
``Both sides are just maneuvering, and we throw an occasional stone
at each other,'' said Jim Dyer, staff director of the House
Appropriations Committee, where the spending bills originate.
``Frankly, it's just a terrible way to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   With the future of the U.S. economy, control of the Congress and
the next presidency at stake, each side is accusing the other of
bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   First, Clinton submitted a budget balanced with theoretical
money, like $10 billion in proposed new cigarette taxes. The
Republicans, who would sooner publicly convert to paganism than
pass such a tax, wrote their own version of a budget balanced with
more theoretical money, mainly cuts in domestic programs so deep
that Congress would never approve them.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the only rule that both sides are supposed to play by
in this game is the 1997 law that imposed spending limits, or caps,
on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the game now is how to evade the caps. Congress has
dug deep into a bag of tricks that Stan Collender, the managing
director of the Federal Budget Consulting Group at
Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations firm, called ``the biggest
collection of budget gimmicks ever put together in one year.''
</P>
<P>
   First, they're calling anything that moves an emergency,'' said
Collender, whose job is explaining government spending to corporate
clients. This allows Congress to dip into the projected $14 billion
surplus. So far, the emergencies include $4.5 billion for the 2000
census and $7.4 billion in farm subsidies. The Republicans also set
aside $4.5 billion to finance the first year of their tax cut. Do
the math: no more surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you have directed score keeping,'' Collender said,
``which is essentially lying about the numbers, playing with
accounting.'' This maneuver, by some lights, created the $14
billion surplus in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there's forward funding,'' he said, ``maybe $12 billion
this year, which is borrowing from a future year.'' This is the
government's equivalent of Popeye's pal Wimpy saying he will gladly
pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, Collender said, and the Republicans will spend
``about $30 billion more than they're saying they will spend,''
while claiming they are keeping the caps on tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't live with the caps,'' the White House budget
director, Jacob J. Lew, said in an interview. ``They're having to
do ridiculous kinds of things to keep the process moving along.
We're clearly headed toward some difficult days.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress left town with 11 of this year's 13 spending bills
incomplete. Clinton has threatened to veto 7 of them over
Republican cuts. After Labor Day, 16 working days remain for
Congress before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no budget by then, the Republicans and the president
are going to have to cut a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will negotiate with the president, after he vetoes the
bills, on his knees,'' DeLay said, daring him to raid Social
Security funds or risk a government shutdown. This could prove
either a brilliant ploy or a paralyzing blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, ``It's kind of cynical,'' said Lew. ``They're going
to have to decide whether they want to create a sense of mounting
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   That decision seems to have been made. If there is no deal by
Oct. 1, DeLay said, Congress can pass a ``continuing resolution''
that essentially finances the government at this year's levels.
Clinton can give up and sign it. Or he can unleash a political
nuclear weapon and veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Then the government shuts down _ or, as DeLay put it, ``the
president will have shut down the government.'' The last time that
happened, in 1995, the Republicans took the blame, and lost
congressional seats all over the country in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look forward to this,'' said Dyer. ``It's really hard
to figure how this plays out in September.''

EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN MEXICO: COUNTING ON WOMEN TO BE MORE HONEST
THAN MEN

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For as long as anyone here can remember, the
common response to being pulled over for a traffic violation has
been to slip a few pesos to the police officer and watch him
quietly walk away, case closed.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is a new police chief in town, Alejandro Gertz
Manero, a former university rector, and he is surprising everyone
by seriously going after corruption in the sprawling capital as
well as its out-of-control crime.
</P>
<P>
   After firing 120 unit commanders and 1,000 officers in his force
of 37,000, Gertz has turned to the 900 men in the traffic squad
who, by all accounts, have been nicely supplementing their
$400-a-month salaries with a kind of bribe that is so endemic hat
it has become a part of the language: the mordida, or bite.
</P>
<P>
   For help, Gertz has turned to female officers, who make up five
percent of his force. To the sputtering outrage of the 900 male
traffic officers, Gertz has taken away their lucrative
ticket-writing authority and handed over their pens and pads to 64
women. The reason was simple, Gertz said: ``I trust them.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse for the men and not so great for Mexican
feminists, Gertz has created teams of two women, and four men. The
women, sharing a squad car, are in charge, and only they can write
tickets _ for anything from double-parking to speeding. One of the
duties of the men, who follow along on motorcycles and in other
vehicles, is to act as bodyguards for the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to protect the women in case something rough
happens,'' Gertz said. And he likes the team approach, he said,
because ``it's very difficult to bribe a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gertz, 59, has no illusion that women are fundamentally immune
to corruption. He, of course, has heard accounts of the corruption
of women like Imelda Marcos in the Philippines and Benazir Bhutto
in Pakistan. Still, he says, ``You very seldom have any corruption
problems with women in Mexico.'' But the relative purity of Mexican
women may have more to do with lack of opportunity than moral
superiority. ``Women traditionally have not been in positions of
power,'' said Lucia Lagunes, the head of the nonprofit Women's
Communication and Information group here. And therefore, she says,
``We are not accustomed to corrupt practices.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Francisca Reyes Castellanos sees it, Mexican women
can be every bit as corrupt as their male counterparts. ``I don
think it's a problem of gender,'' said Ms. Reyes, who is the
president of the National Union of Women, a legal rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But she adds, ``Of course it is easier to communicate with a
woman than with a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, Gertz says, is very much what he had in mind. ``We are
trying to regain the confidence of the people,'' he said in an
interview. ``And I think it will be easier for women to get closer
to the people. In Mexico we see women as more gentle, more
polite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious,'' he said. ``If a group of men has been
perceived for so many years as being corrupt, and you don't have
that perception of corruption among women in the police force, why
not give them a chance?''
</P>
<P>
   So far only the displaced men are complaining. And, Gertz says,
no wonder. ``They're protesting because their income has been
cut,'' he said. As Ms. Reyes sees it, Gertz is ``making a great
effort to improve the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women on the traffic detail are young, in their 20s
and 30s. Some Mexicans say male officers are more susceptible to
bribes because they are more often the main breadwinner in a
family. But Gertz said that had not figured into his enlisting the
women.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the women will turn out much differently than the men is
a matter of speculation. ``This is really about wage-earning
power,'' said Federico Estevez, a political science professor.
``Strictly in terms of numbers, women have been edged out of the
market for bribes. But now these women are being given a monopoly.
They are the only ones who can write tickets. Are you kidding?
They're being handed a gold mine.''
</P>
<P>
   And they are not likely to face less temptation. ``Drivers like
the system the way it has been,'' said Estevez. ``It's cheaper and
doesn't take as much time.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine for speeding, for example, is about 500 pesos, roughly
$55. Often, the mordida can be as little as 20 pesos, or about $2,
depending on how prosperous the driver looks.
</P>
<P>
   Even with bribes commonplace, Gertz said, the police wrote 1.6
million traffic tickets in 1997, the latest year with full data.
With the much smaller force, ticket-writing has plunged 75 percent.
But, Gertz said, the women are being much more productive.
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, he said, volume is not so important. In 1997, he
said, only 10 percent of those who were given tickets bothered to
pay them. ``People just ignored them,'' he said.

Communication and Information group here. And therefore, she says,
``We are not accustomed to corrupt practices.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Francisca Reyes Castellanos sees it, Mexican women
can be every bit as corrupt as their male counterparts. ``I don
think it's a problem of gender,'' said Ms. Reyes, who is the
president of the National Union of Women, a legal rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But she adds, ``Of course it is easier to communicate with a
woman than with a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, Gertz says, is very much what he had in mind. ``We are
trying to regain the confidence of the people,'' he said in an
interview. ``And I think it will be easier for women to get closer
to the people. In Mexico we see women as more gentle, more
polite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious,'' he said. ``If a group of men has been
perceived for so many years as being corrupt, and you don't have
that perception of corruption among women in the police force, why
not give them a chance?''
</P>
<P>
   So far only the displaced men are complaining. And, Gertz says,
no wonder. ``They're protesting because their income has been
cut,'' he said. As Ms. Reyes sees it, Gertz is ``making a great
effort to improve the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women on the traffic detail are young, in their 20s
and 30s. Some Mexicans say male officers are more susceptible to
bribes because they are more often the main breadwinner in a
family. But Gertz said that had not figured into his enlisting the
women.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the women will turn out much differently than the men is
a matter of speculation. ``This is really about wage-earning
power,'' said Federico Estevez, a political science professor.
``Strictly in terms of numbers, women have been edged out of the
market for bribes. But now these women are being given a monopoly.
They are the only ones who can write tickets. Are you kidding?
They're being handed a gold mine.''
</P>
<P>
   And they are not likely to face less temptation. ``Drivers like
the system the way it has been,'' said Estevez. ``It's cheaper and
doesn't take as much time.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine for speeding, for example, is about 500 pesos, roughly
$55. Often, the mordida can be as little as 20 pesos, or about $2,
depending on how prosperous the driver looks.
</P>
<P>
   Even with bribes commonplace, Gertz said, the police wrote 1.6
million traffic tickets in 1997, the latest year with full data.
With the much smaller force, ticket-writing has plunged 75 percent.
But, Gertz said, the women are being much more productive.
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, he said, volume is not so important. In 1997, he
said, only 10 percent of those who were given tickets bothered to
pay them. ``People just ignored them,'' he said.

IT'S A FACT: FAITH AND THEORY COLLIDE OVER EVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By GEORGE JOHNSON

<P>
   Educators and scientists may find it shocking or merely tedious
that politicians are still fighting over whether evolution should
be taught in school. But those who champion scientific over
religious explanations might strengthen their case if they conceded
a point to the opposition: Since evolution is indeed a theory and
not a fact, it can be taught side by side with creationism. The
result would be a wider appreciation that creationism isn't even a
theory, and that what evolution's opponents consider its weakness
is actually its strength: Like all of science, it is based on
malleable human knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kansas Board of Education voted last week to discourage
the teaching of evolution and eliminate questions about the subject
from student evaluation tests, the rationale was familiar. Since no
one can rewind the universal clock and be present at creation, any
idea about how life began is, at best, informed speculation. Using
the same reasoning, the board also cut the Big Bang, cosmology's
unifying vision, from the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The implication was that, in Kansas, students will be considered
educated if they learn to accept only what is directly evident to
their senses or what they trust was observed by competent witnesses
_ with an exception made for what they believe because it is
decreed by their particular religion. Taken to the extreme, this
would eliminate not only the reigning theories of biology and
cosmology but almost all of science, including the atomic theory of
matter and the heliocentric model of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   The skewed view of science that won over the Kansas school board
is epitomized by the warning used in Alabama classrooms: ``This
textbook discusses evolution, a controversial theory some
scientists present as a scientific explanation for the origin of
living things, such as plants, animals and humans. No one was
present when life first appeared on Earth. Therefore, any statement
about life's origins should be considered as theory, not fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sentence is false. Most scientists, by far, accept the
theory; the controversies are over details. But the second part of
the warning is undeniably true, and science would benefit if it
were more often presented this way.
</P>
<P>
   Science consists entirely of theories _ tentative, fluid
proposals based on people's best bets for how the world works. It
is because they are not set in stone that these ideas have a chance
of being nudged closer and closer toward describing reality, or
discarded in favor of something better. Last week, two days after
the Kansas school board decision, paleontologists published
evidence that may push back the appearance of complex life _ single
cells with nuclei _ by as much as a billion years.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever setbacks like the one in Kansas occur, scientists leap
forth to point out the fallacy of the creationist position: There
is no compelling reason to single out the evolution of life or the
cosmos as being less than absolute. It would be just as sensible
for school boards to affix a warning inside physics books: ``No one
has directly observed the detailed substructure of matter.
Therefore, any statement about it being made of atoms should be
considered as theory, not fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the dynamic view of science doesn't come
across strongly enough in the classroom. For reasons of expediency,
scientific theories are presented as done deals. Little
appreciation is conveyed for the intellectual struggle that went
into interpreting the data or examining the assumptions _ always
open to question _ that lurk behind the experiments. Lost from most
explications is the exhilarating possibility that a theory that
seems undeniable today could be overturned tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   With science presented almost as though it were received wisdom,
it's little wonder that some legislators and school board members
confuse it with a competing religion, and misconstrue a religious
belief like creationism as an alternate scientific theory.
</P>
<P>
   They're encouraged to do so by a new wave of creationists who,
in an act of intellectual jujitsu, promote their belief in absolute
knowledge by invoking the relativistic arguments of post-modern
philosophy: While creationism is built on belief in a caring,
all-powerful, constantly intervening creator, who completed his
work just thousands of years ago, evolution has its own tenets of
faith. The most fundamental is the belief that the world consists
of insentient matter unfolding on its own over vast eons of time _
eons that can only be inferred from indirect evidence. One is still
free to believe in a deity, but it's not a necessary part of the
equations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other fundamentals of science is the doctrine of
uniformity, that the physical laws are the same now as they were in
the past. And this is closely related to another unprovable
assumption, Occam's razor: Given two explanations for a phenomenon,
the simpler one is more likely to be true. If one chooses to reject
these assumptions, then evidence taken to support evolution, like
radiocarbon dating, can be rearranged to support creationism.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed this way, science may seem like just another religion _
based on things one chooses to believe because they seem deep down
to be true. But giving creationism equal time in the classroom
would undermine the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Granted that it is possible, starting from naturalism or
supernaturalism, to draw different pictures of the world, which
one, the lesson plan could ask, seems more ad hoc, more a case of
special pleading? Can you envision evidence that would cause
science to support a much younger Earth? The answer is yes. It
would take very convincing data coming from many different
directions, but the mechanisms used to measure geological time are
not unshakable truths.
</P>
<P>
   Then the teacher could ask, Is there any conceivable experiment
that would cause creationists to accept a 4-billion-year-old planet
or the evolution of human life from a single-celled ancestor?
Maybe. But then it wouldn't be creationism anymore. For something
to be called a theory, it has to be falsifiable, capable of being
overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   Students could also be taught the dangers that come when a
scientist mistakes a theory for eternal truth, shoring up flimsy
hypotheses by contorting the data. They could learn of cases in
which a religion flexibly adjusted its doctrines because of new
social realities, allowing, for example, homosexuals into the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   But slowly, by giving creationism equal time with evolution,
students would see a powerfully subtle difference. Science is,
foremost, a method of interrogating reality _ proposing hypotheses
that seem true and then testing them; trying, almost perversely, to
negate them, and elevating only the handful that survive to the
status of a theory. Creationism is a doctrine, whose adherents are
interested only in seeking out data that support it.
</P>
<P>
   In making sense of the world, one is always free to start from
different assumptions. But part of a good education is learning
what you are trading off in the bargain.

BLAMING THE VICTIM IN THE DROUGHT WAR

<P>
   As this summer's drought hangs on like an unwanted guest at the
cottage, the cherished American pastime of lawn watering has been
criminalized by states desperate to change people's behavior and
save water.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman declared a state of
emergency Aug. 5, invoking extraordinary powers that threaten
people with fines up to $5,000 for disobeying water-use rules.
State Environmental Protection Commissioner Robert Shinn even
called on citizens to snitch on one another. ``We depend on
neighbors to monitor their neighbors because there aren't enough
police to do what we have to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials also said more severe measures could be
imposed, including the monitoring of home water use.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions may be helping. New Jersey's water supply has
improved slightly since the emergency decree and with the help of
recent scattered thunderstorms. But a basic question remains: How
did this rap get pinned on the average citizen?
</P>
<P>
   After all, when a power blackout hit a big chunk of Manhattan
during July's heat wave, no one blamed apartment-dwellers for
running air conditioners. Instead, politicians denounced
Consolidated Edison for not planning better and investing more to
anticipate surges in demand.
</P>
<P>
   But during the current drought, virtually the only official
response has been to point a finger at homeowners and issue
emergency measures. While cutting back sharply on nonessential
water use makes obvious sense, some experts say state and local
governments and the news media have failed to recognize drought as
a complex set of phenomena that demand long-range regional planning
and hard decisions after the inevitable rains come and the
emergency decrees fade away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government should have a greater role in planning for water
resources rather than just blaming people,'' said Wenonah Hauter,
the director of the Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project,
a Washington organization founded by Ralph Nader that lobbies for
better technological and political approaches to the use of energy
and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what we're hearing is haphazard responses about
lawns,'' Hauter said, ``but there are longer-term issues such as
the effect of urban sprawl on water resources that government
should be paying attention to.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans are willing to make sacrifices in crises. There is
widespread support, for example, for providing emergency relief to
the farm industry, which is exempt from most emergency water
restrictions. But there is often little public discussion about
emergency powers exercised by governors on matters like home water
use and lawn watering.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, there should be a more robust public debate about
how about government functions in a liberal democracy in times of
emergency _ especially about the amount of power that moves to the
central authority, whether in Trenton, Albany or Washington,'' said
Andrew Grossman, a political science professor at Albion College in
Albion, Mich., citing the potential for civil rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has set up a commission to study the
drought. But so far the government's chief response has been to
declare disaster emergencies in New Jersey, Connecticut, West
Virginia and parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,
Kentucky, Ohio and New Mexico. These decrees provide federal
emergency subsidies to the farming industry, which has lost
billions of dollars in withered summer crops.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just food crops at stake. In New Jersey, for
example, the leading cash crop category is nursery, greenhouse and
lawn-sod products _ mainly decorative plants, shrubs and bushes
sold at garden centers for home use _ which accounted for $255
million in sales last year. So while homeowners are restricted in
watering their shrubs and plants, farmers are able to continue
producing such plants for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Even with their beloved lawns, Americans have shown a
willingness to voluntarily reduce water use without the threat of
criminal prosecution, said Professor Gordon Geballe, an associate
dean of the Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental
Studies. ``In the New Haven area, there are a large number of lawns
that are brown, and we don't have a water shortage yet,'' he said,
noting that lawns account for about 30 percent of water use in
metropolitan regions.
</P>
<P>
   Geballe said some people are reappraising the real costs of
their emerald-green expanses of grass _ and are adjusting their
behavior to ``escape the lawn-must-always-be-green addiction'' in
favor of an ``ecological approach'' that takes into account both a
lawn's use of water and the contribution that lawn mowers make to
carbon dioxide emissions, which may contribute to climatic
phenomena like drought.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, plant experts say there is a practical way to
mitigate future droughts without the threat of criminal
prosecution. Karen Snetselaar, a professor of biology at St.
Joseph's University in Philadelphia, said the overwatering of grass
and plants encourages them to keep their roots close to the soil
surface, where they are most vulnerable during droughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to water every day,'' she said, ``and most of the
time that's the wrong thing to do, unless you are trying to get
seeds to germinate or when you have very young plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, by watering grass, shrubs and plants no more than once
a week the plants will modify their behavior and ``send their roots
farther down in the soil,'' she said. ``That way, when it doesn't
rain for a while, the plants have extensive root systems and
they're OK for a longer period the next time there's a drought.''

   Geballe said some people are reappraising the real costs of
their emerald-green expanses of grass _ and are adjusting their
behavior to ``escape the lawn-must-always-be-green addiction'' in
favor of an ``ecological approach'' that takes into account both a
lawn's use of water and the contribution that lawn mowers make to
carbon dioxide emissions, which may contribute to climatic
phenomena like drought.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, plant experts say there is a practical way to
mitigate future droughts without the threat of criminal
prosecution. Karen Snetselaar, a professor of biology at St.
Joseph's University in Philadelphia, said the overwatering of grass
and plants encourages them to keep their roots close to the soil
surface, where they are most vulnerable during droughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to water every day,'' she said, ``and most of the
time that's the wrong thing to do, unless you are trying to get
seeds to germinate or when you have very young plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, by watering grass, shrubs and plants no more than once
a week the plants will modify their behavior and ``send their roots
farther down in the soil,'' she said. ``That way, when it doesn't
rain for a while, the plants have extensive root systems and
they're OK for a longer period the next time there's a drought.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States is far from alone when it
comes to worrying about how to sustain a long-term Social Security
system in an era of aging populations _ or how to insure that there
will be enough new talent to fill the work place as fewer babies
are born and more people retire. Around the world, but particularly
in Europe and richer Asian nations, the situation is even more
alarming, and so are the choices governments may soon have to make.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading people to retire later may seem like the easiest
alternative, but planners worldwide are finding that cultural and
social attitudes toward leisure, family, old age and status have a
great effect on policymaking. Along with economic globalization and
urbanization, the idea of a hard-earned, dignified and pleasurable
retirement is catching on in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the space of about 100 years, people have not only
accepted, but grown to believe that retirement is a right somehow,
a human right almost,'' said Dalmer Hoskins, secretary-general of
the International Social Security Association in Geneva. ``Working
with these 150 countries that have pensions system, I'm struck more
by the commonalities among them than the differences.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly what a decent level of retirement living
is, he said, ``but it's written into the constitutions of country
after country.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, as Hoskins frames it, is whether more retirement
is really what most economies really need, particularly in
industrialized Europe, where populations are shrinking and aging,
and most people are retiring before the age of 60 and living
another 20 years or more. He suggests that in Europe and the United
States, national interests and those of private enterprise may be
dangerously out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   ``The private sector is retiring people at consistently earlier
ages,'' he said, adding that forcing people to retire in the name
of downsizing and reorganization has gone hand in hand with the
shirking of responsibility for pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   Big, even cosmic, ideas float around the subject of retirement.
Peter Peterson, an investment banker and chairman of the Institute
for International Economics, argued in ``Gray Dawn: How the Coming
Age Wave Will Transform America _ and the World'' (Times Books
1999) that ``We are confronting demographic changes so substantive
that they could redefine economic and political systems in the
developed countries over the next generation.'' Early retirement,
he asserted, is already undermining the survival of developed
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Unless people can be persuaded to work longer into old age, say
Peterson and others, like Joseph Chamie, director of the U.N.
Population Division, developed countries will have to accept a loss
of productivity, creativity and even general economic health.
</P>
<P>
   Or they will be forced to accept waves of immigration from
poorer nations, a policy that Japan, Germany and other European
countries would like to avoid for social and cultural reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, one serious hurdle is ageism, Peterson
says, reflecting on the youth culture that pervades many American
companies. ``Overcoming ageism will requiring ongoing education and
commitment, much as overcoming racism in American work places has
over the past few years,'' he writes. ``An entire stereotype will
have to be reversed, along with all the institutional rules and
habits of thought that perpetuate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother, a lot of retirees seem to be saying, as they
settle into country club retirement communities or book another
cruise.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, where the proportion of people 60 or older will
rise to 26 percent from the current 10 percent in the next 30
years, the government hopes to push the retirement age from 62 to
67. But Singaporeans, who must contribute to a national savings
plan, can take their accumulated retirement package at age 55, and
a fair number do, said Dr. Kanwal Jit Soin, a former independent
member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think they deserve retirement by the age of 55 or 60,''
she said in an interview, adding that this is particularly true of
older people with few or no professional qualifications or skills,
born before Singapore's economy took off. ``And we are also a
society with strong filial ideals,'' said Dr. Soin, an orthopedic
surgeon. ``Children take care of their parents and grandparents
look after their grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   With Singapore's standard of living now rivaling southern
Europe's, retirees also go on cruises and vacations they could
never have afforded in earlier decades.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore _ with a dominant Chinese population but a mix of
people of Indian, Malay and European ancestry _ is almost alone
among Asian nations in changing its immigration policy to allow
more foreigners with skills to settle in the small country, really
an island city-state. It also allows unskilled workers, most from
poorer Asian nations, to work for limited periods, filling manual
jobs that Singapore's 3.5 million people have largely outgrown
through education and training for a technological future.
</P>
<P>
   Japan takes a different approach, rejecting increased
immigration. It tries to keep people working longer through
incentives to their employers, said Linda Martin, president of the
Population Council in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese government has a fairly aggressive policy to
encourage employers to retain older workers,'' she said. ``It
provides some financial incentives to companies that maintain a
certain percentage of older employees, and sometimes older workers
retire and are rehired by the same company, often with a lesser
title or lower stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese,'' she added, ``are a bit ahead of the United
States in how to make productive use of older people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Third World, where most people keep on working to
survive, the formal retirement situation is very mixed, and
sometimes more complicated. A survey of retirement ages by the U.N.
Population Division shows the lowest ages in the poorest countries,
mostly African, but also several in South Asia. Yet these are also
often places where there are no pensions or other benefits, no
social security systems and no subsidized health plans. A low
national retirement age _ the lowest is 40 in the Solomon Islands _
often reflects short life expectancy, the pressure of younger
working-age populations, or both.
</P>
<P>
   In India, the employed are squeezed from both ends of the age
scale, with millions of young people joining the work force every
year, while older people are living longer than ever before and are
beginning to demand retirement programs. Since independence in
1947, India has raised life expectancy to 63 from 39. But until
very recently it retained a 58-year-old mandatory retirement age
for government employees, opening places for younger people but
forcing even experienced ambassadors and key civil servants to
search for work. The age has now been raised to 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``In countries like India and China, people can't or don't want
to be reliant on their children now,'' said Hoskins of the
International Social Security Association. But they remain in
retirement limbo, waiting for governments and the private sector to
act.

   A madeleine dipped in lime-blossom tea sent Marcel Proust off on
an eight-volume reminiscence. A visit from a highly perfumed
Parisian prompted a one-sentence rant. ``My dear friend,'' Proust
wrote, ``the last time you were so good as to come and see me _ for
nobody comes any more to see the wretched invalid that I am _ I was
obliged to take the chair you sat in and keep it out in the
courtyard for three days: it was impregnated with the scent.''
</P>
<P>
   One can only imagine the blast Proust would have sent the friend
who gave him a subscription to a glossy magazine packed with
``scent strips.'' But if Proust lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, he
would have less to complain about, perhaps. Some buildings and
businesses there have declared themselves fragrance-free zones. The
Halifax Herald newspaper has a no-scent policy: Employees may not
wear perfume, after-shave lotion or scented hairspray at work.
Schoolchildren may be sent to the principal's office if the teacher
can smell them. A telephone customer-service center enacted a
similar policy; it sends employees home to bathe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some people who are sensitive to smells _ so sensitive that
they can be paralyzed by perfume, but not in the provocative way
Madison Avenue promises _ say Halifax has not gone far enough.
``It's very, very minor compared to what I see as absolutely
required for people with chemical sensitivities,'' said Susan
Molloy, who has been on disability for multiple chemical
sensitivity more than 10 years, ``and yet it's the best thing
that's happened so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Nelson of the National Foundation for the Chemically
Hypersensitive in Rhodes, Mich., who estimates that he has advised
25,000 people on fragrance problems, concurred. ``In California,
they made it a courtesy, not a law, not to wear over-heavy
fragrances that cause these problems,'' he said. That's not going
far enough for Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, efforts to provide fragrance-free zones _ which
gained steam in the early 1990s, before the passage of the federal
Americans with Disabilities Act _ appear to have slacked off. The
2,500-member First United Methodist Church in Boise, Idaho, dropped
its fragrance-free service after the minister who organized it (and
whose wife was fragrance-sensitive) moved to another church. The
75-seat chapel where the service was held is made of untreated
materials _ the walls are Arizona sandstone, the floors are made of
marble and flagstone, not covered with chemical-laden carpeting
like the main sanctuary. The pews are natural wood.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Molloy, 50, describes her life as a struggle
to avoid nearly everything _ including densely populated places.
Eight years ago, she left the San Francisco Bay Area for a remote
corner of Arizona. There, she and a handful of other people with
multiple chemical sensitivity have bought 400 acres in chunks of 20
or 40 acres. ``It's overgrazed ranchland,'' she said. ``The
ranchers can't make much use of it. We are letting the native
grasses grow back.'' Unlike allergy sufferers who worry that the
great outdoors aggravates their sneezes and sniffles, Ms. Molloy
said, ``Natural things are for the most part not too bad, at least
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She works for a disability organization, advising others with
similar symptoms by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   And employment? Forget it, she said. ``It's impossible to get
hired if you have this,'' she said. ``If you develop MCS after you
have a good position and they can't get rid of you, there is the
possibility that effective accommodations can be approached, but
there's no way to apply for a job after you have this disease.
Imagine calling a prospective employer and saying, `Hi, will you
come outside to interview me?' The first time a truck goes by or
somebody lights a cigarette and you fall or lose the ability to
speak, the employer figures you probably can't do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Molloy avoids moviehouses and malls. And the zoo? Forget it
_ at least the Dallas Zoo. Reuters reported that researchers there
have found a scent that drives the endangered ocelot positively
wild _ Calvin Klein Obsession for Men cologne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about what would work with them and used things
like rat feces and ocelot scent,'' the zoo's research curator, Dr.
Cynthia Bennett, was quoted as saying. ``Then on a lark my research
technician brought in cologne because a lot of other animals like
it and we put Obsession out and our ocelots went wild over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have passed their findings along to Calvin Klein
Cosmetics Co., she said. ``They thought it was cute,'' she said.
``I think they were grateful we weren't trying it on vultures.''

   LOS ANGELES _ From Mark Twain's place-switching ``Prince and the
Pauper'' to Audrey Hepburn's footloose royal highness in ``Roman
Holiday,'' the notion that the mighty might find a way to move
unknown _ or at least unnoticed _ among the masses has an enduring
romantic appeal. Now comes word that Jordan's new young King
Abdullah II has actually done it, posing as a taxi passenger and a
television reporter, in fake beard and ordinary clothes, to see
what life is like for his subjects on Amman's busy streets.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when a president like Theodore Roosevelt rode
horseback in Rock Creek Park, and Harry Truman walked Pennsylvania
Avenue relatively unencumbered by cameras or bodyguards. But in the
age of the choreographed photo-op and the scripted ``listening
tour,'' it seems unimaginable that an American politician, even a
president as populist as Bill Clinton, could pull off such a stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impossible,'' says George Stephanopoulos, the former senior
White House aide. ``Simply impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the president couldn't wear a kaffiyeh, the
distinctive red-and-white Arab headdress that obscures anyone's
face. For another, the ethos of White House press coverage is
heavily invested in dogging the president's every step, and news
executives would howl if a president tried to ditch his protective
motorcade, with its camera van, doctor, decoy limousine and heavy
weapons truck. So would the Secret Service, which strongly
discouraged Clinton's early penchant for jogging through the
streets of Washington, a practice that eventually stopped
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Service would be a problem in many ways,'' said
Marlin Fitzwater, who was White House press secretary under
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. ``One, they would object,
in line with their responsibilities. They'd say, `It's our job to
protect you and we can't protect you under those circumstances.'
Then they'd put enough people on the squad that the president
couldn't get away with it. No matter how you dress six agents down,
they'd look like agents. Plus, American presidents are so well
known on television that it would be tough, and there would be
suspicion by the press and public that they were trying to get away
with something.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, former FBI agent Gary Aldrich caused a stir three years
ago when he suggested in a best-selling book that Clinton had
sneaked out of the White House for trysts in a Washington hotel _
an allegation that was never remotely substantiated and that
Aldrich later conceded was ``hypothetical.'' About the only time
anyone can recall Clinton ever leaving the White House without his
full entourage was the night his aide and childhood friend, Vincent
Foster, committed suicide and the president and a small Secret
Service detail visited the Foster home.
</P>
<P>
   Unplanned presidential movements are not impossible, and Clinton
regularly goes to restaurants or stores, in Washington and on
trips, but only after the Secret Service has checked out the sites.
In 1970, Richard M. Nixon made a famous pre-dawn visit to the
Lincoln Memorial to chat with students protesting the Vietnam War.
In 1979, at the height of his warnings about a national malaise,
Jimmy Carter would occasionally sneak away from Camp David to chat
with ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember once the president was supposed to be at Camp David
and we suddenly got wind that he was in Wheeling, W.Va. talking
with some family,'' recalled Mark Knoller, the veteran radio
reporter who then covered the White House for the Associated Press
and now works for CBS. ``And the AP rented a small aircraft at
National Airport and put me and a wire guy on it, and we went to
interview the people that Carter had met with, but he was long gone
by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Less recognizable officials have more options. When she was New
York City's welfare commissioner in the early 1990s, Barbara Sabol
sometimes dressed in wigs and sweatshirts to apply for welfare
benefits, then described the indignities and shortcomings of the
process. As chairman of the New York City Taxi and Limousine
Commission in the same era, Jack Lusk periodically drove a cab to
better understand the hacking life.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years as mayor of New York City, Ed Koch lived a more or
less normal life, attending movies and dining out, though never
incognito. Quite the opposite, Koch demanded endlessly of one and
all: ``How'm I doin'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I created a climate where people were not at all
fearful to talk to me,'' Koch recalled. ``That's not always true
with public figures. People became accustomed to me. I'd walk down
the street and somebody across the street would yell, ``Don't ask!
You're doing good.''
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians' attempts at undercover operations have
produced comic results. When Rudolph Giuliani was the federal
prosecutor in Manhattan in the mid-1980s, he and Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato donned sunglasses, vests and jeans for a drug raid in
Washington Heights and wound up looking like refugees from a
middle-aged road company of ``Grease.''
</P>
<P>
   In this town, the local version of royalty _ movie stars _
manages to move largely unmolested. Just last Sunday, Shirley
MacLaine and Tom Hanks separately strolled the beaches of Malibu.
Ms. MacLaine's brother, Warren Beatty, is toying with running for
president, and it's easy to imagine ``Bulworth'' in a hip-hop
stocking cap and shades rapping through Georgetown. But could
Clinton go for a burger in bomber jacket and baseball cap?
</P>
<P>
   ``All the caveats being said, and for all of these enormous
pressure, you certainly could do it,'' Fitzwater said. ``And you
could do it easily if the Secret Service cooperated. You'd have the
agents go in advance, mingle with the crowd, have only one go with
him and take him out the back of the White House in a plain,
unmarked car. And indeed the best evidence for that is that we
snuck a lot of people in and out of the White House _ including
President Nixon _ without the press or anybody knowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I guess the honest answer might be that I don't know if my
two presidents ever did that,'' he said. ``I don't think so, but I
don't know.''

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ These are high holy days for Elvis fans: the
end of a week of commemorations leading up to the anniversary
Monday of the pop icon's 1977 death here at Graceland amid
overindulgence and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   This year, attention is being drawn to long-mothballed artifacts
of the singer's odyssey from mere mortal to flawed deity. Lisa
Marie Presley, Elvis' only child and primary heir, has decided to
auction off thousands of her father's personal items and documents
_ most of which have never been publicly displayed. Her aim is to
raise millions to build a homeless shelter in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding, handled by the New York auction house Guernsey's,
will take place Columbus Day weekend at the MGM Grand casino in Las
Vegas. Bids on the items, organized in more than 1,000 lots, will
also be taken online at icollector.com.
</P>
<P>
   For sale are not only Elvis artifacts like guitars, costumes,
posters, credit cards, the 1956 Lincoln in which he squired around
Natalie Wood and even the King's blue velvet beanbag chair, but
also contracts he signed and hundreds of other unpublished
documents and letters illuminating the singer's rise and fall. Here
is a small sampling from the Elvis archives.

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Early on, the King had a hard time getting
bookings. In 1954, his manager and guitarist, Scotty Moore,

</P>
<P>
   Mr. Scotty Moore . . . Thank you so much for your letter
regarding your artist, and while we are a booking and promotion

   `Rocky' and a Little Cannoli
</P>
<P>
   Most of the movies of Baltimore's open-air film festival are
available around the corner in the video shop for anyone who wants
to curl up alone for escape. So the likely reason for 800 people
gathering in the streets of Little Italy to watch the movies play
20 feet tall on the side of a wall would seem to be for the novel
pleasure of one another's company.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the weekend al fresco movies this summer is
astonishing the neighborhood, which, like other turn-of-the-century
ethnic ghettoes, has nobly dwindled to a bulwark of good
restaurants and determined old people. But a young woman who has
stuck with the neighborhood, Mary Ann Cricchio, proprietor of Da
Mimmo's restaurant, was pondering the piazza social scene in a
visit to Palermo last summer. She decided to try and duplicate the
simple beauty of people strolling, talking, laughing, eating and,
finally, plopping down together to watch an outdoor movie.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cricchio is as delighted as the newcomers seem to be. The
Friday sun sets in Little Italy and hundreds arrive packing lawn
chairs and extended families. Many are returning from suburban
warrens for a reminder of the grit and warmth of the old
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets down to earth,'' explains John Pente, an
89-year-old native of Little Italy. His third-floor bedroom window
opposite the parking lot wall is the only practical spot _ the
perfect spot, it turned out _ to set up the theater-sized projector
and sound system for the crowd below. At the July inaugural, the
offer of free treats from Vaccaro's bakery saw 1,000 cannolis
scarfed down during ``Rocky.'' Next week, it's ``The Bicycle
Thief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ci vediamo al cinema!'' beams Ms. Cricchio. ``See you at the
movies!''

   It Was Lead, Not Mercury
</P>
<P>
   People keep the strangest souvenirs. In 1815, an admirer of
Andrew Jackson was given a snippet of the great man's hair, and
those revered strands somehow survived to the present day. They
never blew away in a gust of wind, never got lost in the sock
drawer _ and eventually found their way to the Hermitage, Jackson's
Tennessee home.
</P>
<P>
   But could that long-ago admirer have imagined what the tireless
scientists of 1999 would do to those venerable relics? Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Our seventh president's tale, you see, was set in stone: he was
done in by foolish doctors. Over the course of his life, they gave
him medicines containing mercury that poisoned and finally killed
him.
</P>
<P>
   But with historical revisionism and micro-medicine running amok,
scientists have now cast a fresh eye on that hair, and on an 1839
sample, and now proclaim _ in a study in The Journal of the
American Medical Association _ that it was in fact lead poisoning
that caused Jackson's chronic kidney problems. Neither hair sample
showed toxic levels of mercury.
</P>
<P>
   In an 1813 gunfight, a bullet landed in Jackson's shoulder _ and
stayed there for nearly 20 years. The 1815 sample showed enough
lead to cause problems, but by 1839, years after the bullet was
removed, the lead was down to a safe level. And one expert not
involved with the study said Jackson's symptoms were indeed
consistent with lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   So how far will revisionism go? Now that mercury is off the hook
in this celebrated case, will innovative doctors propose that we
again dose ourselves with Jackson's old remedy, mercury-laden
calomel, which one scientist called ``the aspirin of the early 19th
century''?

   Eichmann, in Memoirs, Tries to Explain His Psyche
</P>
<P>
   Adolf Eichmann, seeking to explain his central role in the
killing of 6 million European Jews by the Nazis, was moved to
organize the mass murders by a visceral sense of duty rather than
hatred, according to memoirs published by the German newspaper Die
Welt. ``Obeying an order was the most important thing to me,''
Eichmann wrote. ``It could be that is in the nature of the
German.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement was contained in 127 pages of handwritten
reflections that Die Welt said it found at the Center for Research
on Nazi Crimes in the southern German town of Ludwigsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Justice Ministry announced that 1,200 pages of notes
by Eichmann would be released to German researchers for scholarly
publication. Eichmann was captured in Argentina by Israeli agents
in 1960 and executed in Israel two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I look back,'' Eichmann wrote, ``I realize that a
life predicated on being obedient and taking orders is a very
comfortable life indeed. Living in such a way reduces to a minimum
one's own need to think.''

   China-Taiwan Tensions
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan are sending military planes flying over the
100-mile-wide straits separating the two rival nations, and the
United States is urging both sides to calm down. The situation is
``dangerous'' and ``very delicate,'' said one official. Washington
fears an accident or a misunderstanding could set off acts of war.
China has considered Taiwan a renegade for 50 years, and refuses to
renounce violence as a means to bring it back under mainland
control.

<P>
   Warren Beatty Hints At a Presidential Run
</P>
<P>
   Eyes rolled when Ronald Reagan first ran for California governor
and when Sonny Bono said he wanted to be a congressman. So it was
probably inevitable that Warren Beatty's toying with running for
president would draw some laughs. But the movie star's hints that
he is weighing a bid either as a Democrat or a Reform Party
contender also drew some praise from liberals who think they are
not adequately represented by Vice President Al Gore or his rival,
former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's involvement in politics is far deeper than his role as
a senator who could not help but speak the truth in the film
``Bulworth.'' He was an early supporter of Robert F. Kennedy, and
he was also a confidant of former Sen. Gary Hart, who has publicly
encouraged a Beatty candidacy. Beatty has said his central issue
would be campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not explained why he showed up this summer at a
Hollywood fund-raiser for Texas Gov. George W. Bush.

   Tax Court Hits U.P.S. With A Huge Bill
</P>
<P>
   A Tax Court judge ruled that United Parcel Service took inflated
tax deductions in 1984 and must pay taxes, penalties and interest.
The company said the total might be close to $300 million for 1984
alone, and it could owe hundreds of millions more for later years.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a rare victory for the IRS in its efforts to
prevent companies from claiming deductions when they move money to
subsidiaries overseas for the sole purpose of avoiding taxes.

   In Iraq, Good and Bad News On Child Mortality
</P>
<P>
   The first large survey of the mortality rates of Iraqi children
living under international sanctions since Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990 produced mixed findings from Unicef. In areas of the country
where President Saddam Hussein controls the distribution of relief
food and medicines, babies and children under 5 are dying at twice
the rate they were in the late 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   Where relief goods are distributed by the United Nations in the
autonomous northern Kurdish areas, child mortality rates are
falling. Unicef urged Iraq to spend more on child and maternal
nutrition and asked the United Nations Security Council to put a
higher priority on getting aid to the youngest Iraqis.

   India Shoots Down A Pakistani Jet

<P>
   An Indian jet fighter shot down a propeller-driven Pakistani
naval surveillance plane, killing its 16 passengers and sending the
subcontinent into yet another moment of nail-biting.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians said the naval aircraft was on a spying mission
above their air space while the Pakistanis insisted that the plane
was on an entirely innocent training mission and had never crossed
the border. Both sides were able to salvage chunks of the scattered
wreckage, parts of which fell into each nation's territory.

   Amnesty for Puerto Ricans
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he would commute the sentences of 16
members of a Puerto Rican independence group if they agree to
renounce violence. Although their group, the FALN, has been linked
to more than 100 bombings of political targets and military
installations in the United States in the 1970s and '80s, none of
the 16 were involved in any deaths, the White House said. The
action followed pressure from human rights leaders, who argued that
the sentences, some as long as 90 years, were out of proportion to
the crimes.

   Customs Announces Changes In Its Search Policy
</P>
<P>
   After years of complaints and lawsuits, U.S. Customs Service
officials said the agency would change the way it conducts personal
searches of thousands of people who arrive in the United States
each year and are suspected of smuggling narcotics. Customs has
adopted tighter criteria to determine who will be subjected to body
searches in place of an unwieldy system that agency officials said
permitted searches of anyone who looked too nervous or too calm.
</P>
<P>
   Black women in Chicago have filed a class action lawsuit
complaining that they were singled out for what they said were
abusive searches, but the agency has denied that it intentionally
targeted any group.

   New Directive on Gays
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department's ``don't-ask, don't-tell'' policy was
supposed to make it easier for gay soldiers to remain in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   But recent criticism that the policy is having exactly the
opposite effect led the Pentagon to announce new guidelines for
enforcement of the five-year-old policy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new directives, troops will receive anti-harassment
training throughout their careers, beginning with boot camp, and
commanders will have to get approval from senior Pentagon officials
before opening certain types of investigations of a soldier's
sexual orientation.

</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan are sending military planes flying over the
100-mile-wide straits separating the two rival nations, and the
United States is urging both sides to calm down. The situation is
``dangerous'' and ``very delicate,'' said one official. Washington
fears an accident or a misunderstanding could set off acts of war.
China has considered Taiwan a renegade for 50 years, and refuses to
renounce violence as a means to bring it back under mainland
control.

   Warren Beatty Hints At a Presidential Run
</P>
<P>
   Eyes rolled when Ronald Reagan first ran for California governor
and when Sonny Bono said he wanted to be a congressman. So it was
probably inevitable that Warren Beatty's toying with running for
president would draw some laughs. But the movie star's hints that
he is weighing a bid either as a Democrat or a Reform Party
contender also drew some praise from liberals who think they are
not adequately represented by Vice President Al Gore or his rival,
former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's involvement in politics is far deeper than his role as
a senator who could not help but speak the truth in the film
``Bulworth.'' He was an early supporter of Robert F. Kennedy, and
he was also a confidant of former Sen. Gary Hart, who has publicly
encouraged a Beatty candidacy. Beatty has said his central issue
would be campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not explained why he showed up this summer at a
Hollywood fund-raiser for Texas Gov. George W. Bush.

   Tax Court Hits U.P.S. With A Huge Bill
</P>
<P>
   A Tax Court judge ruled that United Parcel Service took inflated
tax deductions in 1984 and must pay taxes, penalties and interest.
The company said the total might be close to $300 million for 1984
alone, and it could owe hundreds of millions more for later years.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a rare victory for the IRS in its efforts to
prevent companies from claiming deductions when they move money to
subsidiaries overseas for the sole purpose of avoiding taxes.

   In Iraq, Good and Bad News On Child Mortality
</P>
<P>
   The first large survey of the mortality rates of Iraqi children
living under international sanctions since Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990 produced mixed findings from Unicef. In areas of the country
where President Saddam Hussein controls the distribution of relief
food and medicines, babies and children under 5 are dying at twice
the rate they were in the late 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   Where relief goods are distributed by the United Nations in the
autonomous northern Kurdish areas, child mortality rates are
falling. Unicef urged Iraq to spend more on child and maternal
nutrition and asked the United Nations Security Council to put a
higher priority on getting aid to the youngest Iraqis.

   India Shoots Down A Pakistani Jet

<P>
   An Indian jet fighter shot down a propeller-driven Pakistani
naval surveillance plane, killing its 16 passengers and sending the
subcontinent into yet another moment of nail-biting.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians said the naval aircraft was on a spying mission
above their air space while the Pakistanis insisted that the plane
was on an entirely innocent training mission and had never crossed
the border. Both sides were able to salvage chunks of the scattered
wreckage, parts of which fell into each nation's territory.

   Amnesty for Puerto Ricans

   President Clinton said he would commute the sentences of 16
members of a Puerto Rican independence group if they agree to
renounce violence. Although their group, the FALN, has been linked
to more than 100 bombings of political targets and military
installations in the United States in the 1970s and '80s, none of
the 16 were involved in any deaths, the White House said. The
action followed pressure from human rights leaders, who argued that
the sentences, some as long as 90 years, were out of proportion to
the crimes.

   Customs Announces Changes In Its Search Policy
</P>
<P>
   After years of complaints and lawsuits, U.S. Customs Service
officials said the agency would change the way it conducts personal
searches of thousands of people who arrive in the United States
each year and are suspected of smuggling narcotics. Customs has
adopted tighter criteria to determine who will be subjected to body
searches in place of an unwieldy system that agency officials said
permitted searches of anyone who looked too nervous or too calm.
</P>

   Black women in Chicago have filed a class action lawsuit
complaining that they were singled out for what they said were
abusive searches, but the agency has denied that it intentionally

   New Directive on Gays

   The Defense Department's ``don't-ask, don't-tell'' policy was
supposed to make it easier for gay soldiers to remain in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   But recent criticism that the policy is having exactly the
opposite effect led the Pentagon to announce new guidelines for
enforcement of the five-year-old policy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new directives, troops will receive anti-harassment
training throughout their careers, beginning with boot camp, and
commanders will have to get approval from senior Pentagon officials
before opening certain types of investigations of a soldier's
sexual orientation.

   2. Who lost Russia ? By Hohn Lloyd from The New York Times
Magazine
</P>
<P>
   - For release : Aug. 15 or thereafter-
</P>
<P>
   Russia has spent the nine years since communism spiraling
downward. Who's to blame? That's becoming a highly charged question
in American politics. An increasingly cohesive ``Lost Russia''
lobby now looks as if it will have a powerful mouthpiece: the
Republican front-runner in next year's U.S. presidential race. The
main foreign-policy adviser to George W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice,
former provost of Stanford University, is pressing to make the
charge that the Clinton-Gore administration lost Russia a major
part of the presidential campaign.

chief for The Financial Times from 1991 to 1996.)

   3. ALL THE PRESIDENTS STINK By FRANK RICH FROM: The New York
Times Magazine For release: Aug. 15 or thereafter
</P>
<P>
   With each passing year, Bob Woodward gets less respect. The
reviews of his books have become more dismissive, with this
summer's best seller, ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of
Watergate,'' evencoming in for harsh criticism on the op-ed page of
his own newspaper, The Washington Post. Yet a strong case can be
made for Woodward's value as a chronicler of the capital, and
``Shadow'' can't be topped as a comprehensive, up-to-date, inside
look at the Washington establishment. It reveals the mind-set of
the highest caste of political insiders, Woodward himself among
them, who are hermetically sealed inside the Beltway bubble.

   4. ``Don't Trust Anyone Who Is White'' From Der Spiegel
</P>
<P>
   Child abuse: Organisations looking after neglected children in
the Third World are being used by paedophiles for their own
purposes. The affected relief organisations want to protect
themselves against child abusers by means of a world-wide black
list. In a report by the British National Criminal Intelligence
Service, this national police authority finds that paedophile
offenders are already using relief organisations in Africa on a
scale approaching that of sex tourism to Thailand's Bangkok and
Pataya. There was even some indication that relief workers were not
only themselves sexually abusing the children in their care, but
also procuring them for other paedophiles for pornographic
photographs and videos.

   5. ``Pilots out of Orbit'' From Der Spiegel
</P>
<P>
   Traffic: The Europeans want to go into the navigation satellite
business. The Americans, who dominate the market, are preparing to
fend off these troublesome competitors. The Europeans want to
position 24 of their own satellites right round the globe at the
latest by 2008. But in view of the prospective profits, which are
almost as large as those in the young mobile radio industry, it is
almost inevitable that an economic war will ensue. The USA is
keeping a sharp watch on the entry of the Europeans into the
lucrative navigation business. The Europeans don't have much time
left, though, to resolve the tricky issue of finance and all the
technical details: as of 2005, the Americans plan to put a new
generation of GPS satellites into orbit. (1500 words)

PLAYING TAX-CUT GAMES AT THE FUTURE'S EXPENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two things are fundamentally wrong with the massive $792 billion
tax cut that GOP leaders have rammed through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This is absolutely the wrong time to reduce our national
revenues. And this particular proposal would be the worst and least
economically productive kind of tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   So big and costly a slash in taxes right now would wreck the
debt reduction plan we've finally gotten on track after so many
false starts. It might raise interest rates. And it would give the
glutton's share of the money that it siphons from the Treasury to
people who need it the least.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is an election-year ploy, pure and simple. Its sponsors
know that it will be vetoed. The president has said so plainly.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors, wanting to blame Clinton for being a killjoy, are
advertising their bill as containing something for everybody. A
tiny bit, maybe. But 60 percent of the total tax relief is
earmarked for the wealthiest 10 percent. This leaves only 40
percent for the middle and bottom 90 percent of American taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Under this measure as drafted, the people who need help the most
_ those struggling to get by on jobs with inadequate salaries _
would get virtually nothing ... except a draining away of public
money that could otherwise help improve public education or help
fix Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth year, when the bill's goodies are all in effect, a
working stiff making $35,000 annually would save $280. A taxpayer
with a cool million coming in and enjoying a $30,000 cut in taxes
he'd owe on capital gains from investment profits still would get
about $10,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   It's Robin Hood in reverse. It takes from the poor and gives to
the rich.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst thing about this bill may be its timing.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, tax cuts have been employed during times of
recession as a stimulus to economic activity _ to get things
rolling again for everyone. This ill-timed gimmickry is pushed
forth at a moment of robust economic growth and general national
prosperity. Senate leaders slipped their bill through by only a
one-vote margin after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
warned that heating up an already hot economy with such a huge tax
cut would almost certainly require an increase in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Who'd get hurt by that? Almost everybody _ most of all, the
young parents struggling with car and mortgage payments. What
they'd have to pay in extra interest charges, in most cases, would
more than wipe out the meager reduction in their tax obligations.
</P>
<P>
   What could be dumber?
</P>
<P>
   Current polls show that most voters are not asking for a tax cut
now. They strongly prefer to use our anticipated surpluses to pay
down the debt and build up a cushion to ensure future solvency for
Social Security and Medicare. Isn't it ironic? Most folks don't
want the money given back now; yet everyone recognizes it as an
election-year gambit.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it wouldn't seem a very effective bid for voters. So
what is it? A bid for campaign contributions? A lure for ``Team $1
Million,'' the GOP's newly announced search for 100 elite
contributors who'll give the party $1 million each? The group
that's been giving most generously to campaigns are among the ones
who'd reap the largest immediate benefit from this tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't as if the biggest moneymakers in the corporate world
were needing a break just now. The World Bank issued a stunning
report this summer, stating that 22 percent of all the world's
wealth is now controlled by the 300 biggest corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between richest and poorest in our own country is
widening dangerously. The middle-income sector is shrinking, while
the nether ranks continue to grow in number. This doesn't represent
what we all grew up thinking of as the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone needs a break, it's the working folks on the middle
and the lower end of the economic ladder who are feeling the pinch.
Wages, held down by corporate downsizing and outsourcing and by
increasing competition from low-wage countries, have not kept pace
with either profits or productivity. To tilt the balance further
away from the middle-American's grasp, and then to tantalize him
with an illusory tax cut like this, is just plain wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few good features in this bill. Redressing the
marriage penalty, so that a married couple wouldn't be better off
for tax purposes with a divorce, is clearly overdue. But that's
just a tiny slice of this pie. It can and should be attended to
promptly. That certainly wouldn't cost the government $792 billion!
</P>
<P>
   The saddest thing, however, is what this bill would do to
deficits, debt and discipline. Some supporters are boasting that it
would be the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan's 1981 reduction
in upper income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Recall the outfall of that. It brought on history's biggest
deficits and was a major contributing factor in tripling the
national debt. We're just now working our way out of the fiscal
morass created in part by that temptatious misstep.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly it makes sense to stick to the course of paying down
that debt, freeing ourselves from the burden of interest charges
that take about $280 billion a year from the treasury, and to
building up reserves for Social Security and Medicare solvency for
future generations. That's the right, fiscally prudent thing to do.

WHAT REASON IS THERE TO SPARE ROBISON?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Larry Keith Robison is put to death this week, it won't be
for lack of effort by anti-death-penalty activists, whose sense of
compassion seems weighted far more heavily toward vicious killers
than toward the killers' victims.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Larry Keith Robison, who slaughtered five people
back in 1982, the theory is that this poor soul suffers from mental
illness and therefore should not be executed _ even though juries
in two trials convicted him of capital murder and condemned him to
death.
</P>
<P>
   As usually happens in such high-profile cases, demands to spare
Robison's life have grown increasingly shrill as the scheduled
execution date has drawn nearer. The usual suspects have been
leading the charge: the knee-jerk, anti-capital-punishment crowd;
bleeding-heart pundits; advocates for the mentally ill; and, of
course, the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, who recently foiled an execution in Missouri,
appealed to Texas Gov. George W. Bush last week to have mercy on
Robison _ the stabbing, slashing, shooting multiple murderer who
offered no mercy whatsoever to his victims.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was a letter written to the Board of Pardons and
Paroles by the head of a mental health group and quoted by the
Houston Chronicle:
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of his untreated illness, Mr. Robison eventually
degenerated into a state of violence. The responsibility for the
loss of five precious lives must be shared between Mr. Robison and
the system that failed him long before he turned violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibility ... must be shared between Mr. Robison and
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Here we have an individual who made a calculated and carefully
thought out decision to kill five people _ he beheaded and sexually
mutilated one of them _ and someone has the audacity to claim that
the killer is not solely responsible for his barbarism?
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget what we're talking about when we refer to
``the system.'' We're talking about the people, the hard-working
and law-abiding citizens of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   When these bleeding-heart types blame ``the system'' for the
criminal acts of an individual, they are blaming ``society.'' And
society is the people. ``Society'' is a synonym for all those
uncaring folks whose lack of compassion drives misunderstood
miscreants such as Robison to commit mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Robison's alleged mental illness is debatable, but
let's assume for a moment that he is as sick as his partisans
contend. Why in the world would that be a reason to spare him the
death penalty?
</P>
<P>
   If a murderer is criminally deranged, his condition should be
considered an aggravating circumstance in determining his
punishment _ not a mitigating circumstance. A homicidal maniac who
has murdered five people surely poses a continuing threat to
society _ which is a major consideration when imposing capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Robison deserved the death penalty when he was convicted of
murder, and he deserves it now. It would be shocking if the Board
of Pardons and Paroles recommended otherwise _ and more shocking if
Bush agreed with a recommendation for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Robison is an insult to the very concept of human decency.
Suggestions that he should be treated with compassion are an insult
to his victims and their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Keith Robison is responsible for his crimes. Not society.
Not ``the system.'' It's high time he paid the price.

MEDICAL MISSIONARY THE LINK BETWEEN NURSES IN INDIA, FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It must be close to a miracle _ or a godsend
of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   The first 20 graduates of the Rebekah Ann Naylor School of
Nursing in Bangalore, India, will have new sari uniforms and shiny
pins to start their careers as registered nurses _ thanks to Fort
Worth-area nurses and students who wanted to make the Aug. 21
graduation special.
</P>
<P>
   Serendipity made it happen _ or divine intervention, as Dr.
Rebekah Naylor prefers to call it.
</P>
<P>
   Naylor, a medical missionary who grew up in Fort Worth and
founded the fledgling school, just happened to be back home this
spring, the right place at the right time to meet the right people.
</P>
<P>
   The right people included Ellen Palmer, who teaches advanced
medical-surgical nursing for the University of Texas at Arlington's
School of Nursing, and Martha Hurley, editor of the newsletter
published by the Department of Surgery at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. Hurley had recently written
an article about Naylor, the first female surgeon to graduate from
the school's five-year surgical residency program, when she met
Palmer at a nursing conference.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley told Palmer about Naylor's work and confided that she
wanted to make graduation more meaningful for the Indian nurses.
She asked Palmer for ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Palmer was so excited about what Dr. Naylor is doing, she
wanted to help, too, and she suggested it would be a perfect
project for local chapters of Sigma Theta Tau (an international
honor society in nursing). It worked out great, because I found out
the next day that Dr. Naylor was back home from India to visit her
family in Fort Worth, and I got her together with Dr. Palmer,''
Hurley says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there was some divine intervention,'' Naylor says.
``One thing just led to another.''
</P>
<P>
   The only foreign doctor on a staff of 25 physicians, Naylor has
been at Bangalore Baptist Hospital since shortly after it was
established in 1973 by the International Mission Board of the
Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   No one was surprised when Naylor decided to become a Baptist
missionary.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Dr. Robert Naylor, became president of Southwestern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth about the time she
started high school. His father had been a Baptist minister.
</P>
<P>
   But no one in the family was a doctor, much less a surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wanted to go into medicine first,'' Naylor says. ``I
decided on surgery after I spent a summer working in Thailand
during medical school. The doctor I worked with was a surgeon. Back
in the '60s, women didn't much go into surgery, but I felt sure
that's what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she removes gallbladders, fixes broken bones, delivers
babies and teaches nursing students at the school named in her
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Her hospital has grown to 150 beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat 90,000 outpatients every year and admit 8,800
inpatients,'' she says. ``We had always had the dream of a nursing
school. We raised funds, built the building and opened the school
in 1996 with a focus on underprivileged young women. All but two of
our first class are on full scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   Naylor, Palmer and Hurley came up with the idea for sari-style
uniforms for the graduating Indian nurses. Very quickly, Sigma
Theta Tau chapters from the nursing schools at UTA, Texas Christian
University in Fort Worth, Texas Woman's University in Denton and
Baylor University pitched in to help, ensuring that each graduate
will have two uniforms and an official graduation pin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hurley is buying each a rose, and Palmer and other
nurses are volunteering to go to Bangalore in January to teach a
two-week continuing-education program in critical-care nursing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at all kinds of things. Wherever the need is
greatest, we will try to get something started there,'' Palmer
says. ``I always tell my students whatever time you give away comes
back twofold; whatever money you give away comes back the same way.
It all comes about very easily, but first you have to have a good
project.''

AT LEAST HIP-HOP RAPPERS ARE HONEST ABOUT THE FAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lord knows I'm no huge fan of Limp Bizkit, the currently
white-hot rap/metal group atop the Billboard charts for the past
month, or Kid Rock, the suburban Detroiter who also is making major
money combining the two genres _ and who has never met a
photographer he doesn't want to flip off.
</P>
<P>
   But I will say this much for both: They're honest. And they're
honest about something that's been annoying me for years: the
ridiculous stance of grunge stars in the early '90s regarding their
money and fame.
</P>
<P>
   In recent articles, Bizkit leader Fred Durst and Kid Rock
himself have sung the praises of being successful, rich young rock
stars playing before thousands of people every night and living a
life on the road that includes all sorts of excesses. And both have
gone out of their way to take a swipe at grunge bands and their
oh-woe-is-me complaining about their fame and their success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why sell records to support your lifestyle, touch thousands of
people and then say you don't want fame?'' Durst said recently in
USA Today. ``Those people that whine, like Pearl Jam, it's a joke.
`Oh, I'm so humble and I don't want to be famous.' It disgusts me.
Being a rock star, it's the best! You're so lucky if you really
make it to the big time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same article, Kid Rock was even more succinct: ``It's
hard to believe somebody would work hard for something, achieve it
and then stare at your shoes and complain about how much money they
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, somebody had to say it. For all the great music Pearl Jam
and Nirvana made, their punk/DIY aesthetic sometimes went to
ridiculous lengths as they both pursued worldwide fame (and, let's
make no mistake, the money it would bring) then whined about being
part of the world of major record labels, promotion, fan adulation
and the like.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the funniest passages in modern nonfiction, Bill
Flanagan writes in ``U2 at the End of the World'' of Eddie Vedder
opening for U2 in a huge Italian stadium, but whining that he
wishes he were playing a small club.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's not actually PLAYING clubs, is he?'' says Bono,
watching from backstage.
</P>
<P>
   I howled. Here's Vedder, signed to a major label, his band's CD
on the brink of selling millions of copies and giving them the
financial wherewithal to do whatever they like with the rest of
their lives, living out a dream thousands of musicians would kill
for, and he's complaining about it? What, I'm supposed to believe
that someone put a gun to his head or threatened to shoot his dog
if he didn't undertake a multi-monthlong tour to support ``Ten''?
That somebody forced him to bank those huge royalty checks? On what
planet?
</P>
<P>
   The only funnier thing was when Kurt Cobain posed for a cover of
Rolling Stone wearing a T-shirt that dissed corporate magazines.
Now THAT'S big giggles: Cobain was willing to pose for the Stone
(no doubt realizing how much it would help CD sales, because
appearing on the cover of a national magazine always does), but he
had to tell everyone how distasteful it was to him? Huh?
</P>
<P>
   I admire Durst and the Kid's willingness to admit that they are
trying to be popular, and they're glad to not be working at a
carwash or doing whatever the heck they were doing to put food on
the table and pay the rent before they got over.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is part of the hip-hop tradition: You don't see guys
like Puffy or Master P shying away from making money and being
proud to have some, because they never forget just how many people
haven't been that lucky, and how hard they worked to get where they
are. And that, even for many who do sign major-label contracts,
they will someday have to go back where they came from.
</P>
<P>
   You can participate, and admit that you are _ because the moment
you sign to a major, you're part of a corporation, and make no
mistake. Or you can do what thousands of musicians have to do:
record stuff in an inexpensive home studio, produce a couple of
dozen or hundred copies on a CD burner, sell 'em off the bandstand,
try to get 'em into local record stores, and hope for better days.
</P>
<P>
   Better days that, in so many cases, never arrive.

MEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE SENTIMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve McQueen was moved by poetry. Ponch and Jon of ``CHiPS,''
if they could have been reincarnated, would've come back as Oprah
Winfrey and Judge Judy, respectively. And, don't tell anyone this,
but Evel Knievel cried at ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the motorcycle division of Progressive Insurance
would have you believe, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently released a survey that says men who ride
motorcycles are more likely to cry at romantic movies than men who
stick to automobiles. Cyclists are also more romantic and more
likely to consider their children to be life's biggest thrill,
favor vacations in Venice, prefer ``Ally McBeal'' over ``Monday
Night Football,'' and list Oprah and Judge Judy among the people
they'd most like to be.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a lone cyclist hitting the open road is certainly a
romantic notion, but what happened to the tough, leather-clad,
tattooed Harley man? Isn't he supposed to be, well, butch?
</P>
<P>
   ``The motorcycling community has really changed from that
type,'' says Don Green, service manager at Grapevine Kawasaki in
Grapevine, Texas. ``Now it's more professional types who ride in
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harley crowd is more into the lifestyle; they want to be
like that Hell's Angels image,'' he says. ``It's an escape. They
get to play that character for a while and let go.''
</P>
<P>
   This demographic change has become stronger in the past 10
years. Motorcycling is not a cheap hobby. More and more, lawyers,
doctors and accountants are spending big bucks on the latest model
and going on weekend rides with their local club. But does that
mean motorcycle men are any softer than before?
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what (these men) think of their motorcycles,'' says
Progressive's Ben Sheridan. ``We know that they're passionate about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Passion is one thing. But this survey makes these guys sound
like they got beat up a lot in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The country's largest motorcycle insurer, Progressive polled
bikers at rallies, and at restaurants and bars where motorcyclists
hang out. The study was conducted much for the same reason many
companies poll customers: Knowing what drives your clients is good
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects how anyone who does business with motorcyclists
should deal with them and how they should talk with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning, instead of the ``How about those Mets?'' banter, it
should be ``how about that `Felicity?' ' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to say that I'm fairly sensitive,'' says Green,
28, who counts ``Hoosiers'' and ``The Edge'' among his movie
favorites. ``Although I'm sure that my fiancee'' would disagree.
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH STUFF: William Hollabaugh, 50, and R.J. ``Dusty'' Fryer,
49, are neighbors, best friends and City Council members in
Midlothian, Texas, who ride their cycles almost every evening.
Hollabaugh leans slightly more to the sensitive side than Fryer,
but neither of them really resembles the men described in the
survey. In fact, neither knows any such cyclists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, I would find (the survey findings) hard to
believe,'' says Hollabaugh, a cost analyst for an airplane parts
subcontractor in Grand Prairie, Texas. ``I don't think
(motorcyclists) are any more or less sensitive. We all have
hobbies. Some people choose to ride a motorcycle just like some
choose to play golf. It's a form of relaxation.''
</P>
<P>
   He did however, admit to an occasional bawl. ``I cried at
`Titanic.' And `Old Yeller,''' he says. ``Maybe things affect me
more. I'm the type of person that really thinks things over before
I do something.'' His favorite movie is ``just about anything with
John Wayne.''
</P>
<P>
   The person he'd most like to be is Bob Phillips, the TV
journalist who travels around Texas discovering nature and people
on ``8 Country Reporter.'' That makes sense, considering what
Hollabaugh loves most about hopping on his '98 Harley-Davidson
Sportster. ``We ride around old country roads, smell the flowers
and take in the sights,'' he says. ``It's nice when you're not
cruising down the interstate going 75 mph. It's like in a
convertible. You get to smell the grass. You feel the temperature
change when you go down into a dip.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollabaugh is fairly new to the motorcycle game. Fryer has been
riding for 40 years. He owns a Road King Classic Harley but gets a
new bike almost every year.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the survey, he says, ``if that is the consensus, I'm
the exception.'' A former high school football captain and retired
Marine, he watches CNN and ESPN, and his favorite movie is ``The
Ten Commandments,'' although you won't find him crying over it.
``The Marine Corps conditions you to be tough,'' he says. ``I don't
do much crying. I've probably made some men cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his best friend, he offers, ``He's more sensitive than me,
but he doesn't wear tights or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   LIVING TO THE MAX: Mike Hensley, 44, is the commander of the
Battalion Motorcycle Corps, a 25-year-old gay motorcycle club. He
owns a Honda 1100 Shadow Ace and coordinates food delivery for the
elderly and others who can't get out. His favorite movie is
``Titanic,'' and he watches science-fiction shows such as
``Sliders'' and ``The X-Files.'' He'd love to be Sean Connery. His
interest in motorcycles is more than recreational. He drives his
bike to work and often embarks on cross-country rides. He recently
returned from a drive to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   He finds validity in the Progressive findings. ``If I had to
attribute it to anything,'' he says, ``it has more to do with
living life in the fast lane. There's so much emphasis placed on
motorcyclists ... having a death wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Easy Rider syndrome. The freedom just to get up and
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Many BMC members are white-collar types. Hensley quickly
dismisses the idea of stereotyping motorcyclists into the Hell's
Angel mold. ``I run across some of these elderly folks who are into
bikes as well. That's not the image you think of either.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, being a tattooed Harley dude doesn't mean sensitivity
isn't in the genes. ``Most of those guys are big sweethearts,''
says cyclist Larry Vosberg. ``I've found them to be really
down-to-earth.''
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly does the Progressive study tell us? Besides
being a fun read, not much. It's not like the results will affect
insurance rates. A man who prefers ``Shakespeare in Love'' over
``Terminator II'' is not going to get a special deal. And it's
unlikely we'll start seeing Harley-Davidson advertisements before
every Meg Ryan movie.

REMOVE BARRIERS TO HELP DISABLED STAY AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color drawing of a home keyed to a list of numbered tips 
 By CARY MCMULLEN 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a heartbreaking dilemma for generations: a relative
suffers an accident or a disease and becomes disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the best place for him to live?
</P>
<P>
   Often, a home must be modified or designed with the person's
handicap in mind.
</P>
<P>
   If the home is more than 20 years old, it probably has barriers
that could make daily life with a disability more complicated:
stairs leading into the house, narrow doorways, bathtubs with tall
sides and sinks and shelves that are too high.
</P>
<P>
   About a fifth of the population has some type of disability that
needs to be compensated for in a house and its appliances, says Rex
Pace, coordinator for technology assistance with the Center for
Universal Design in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our lives are dynamic. They change over time,'' he says. ''But
our houses have been designed for a fairly narrow range of life _
if you're healthy and 18 to 35 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   A disability shouldn't mean someone has to lose independence.
Proper building modifications can sometimes make it possible for a
person to remain in his own home.
</P>
<P>
   There are some general principles that apply to making housing
handicapped accessible, Pace says. The key is ''universal design,''
with changes that improve convenience for everyone. Visibility,
space, strategic placement of storage or controls and ease of use
are all taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the kind of changes necessary is the first step.
Shirley Balogh, president and CEO of Polk County Association for
the Handicapped in Central Florida, suggests contacting agencies
that license group homes for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have inspection sheets and a list of standards and can
come out with a light meter, test the temperature of the water and
so on,'' she says. ''And most reputable contractors are aware of
the specifications for handicapped accessibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The three trouble areas that usually need to be fixed in
existing homes are entrances, bathrooms and kitchens, Pace says.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden wheelchair ramp is a common solution to navigating a
set of steps, but such ramps are usually an eyesore. Pace suggests
an alternative: berm up some dirt to create a sloping walkway that
can be landscaped.
</P>
<P>
   Most doors, outside and inside, are a tight squeeze for someone
in a wheelchair. Wider entrances and doors mounted to open out
rather than in make getting into a room easier. Since twisting
knobs can be a problem for people with arthritis or a condition
that makes it hard to grip, lever-type handles can be used.
</P>
<P>
   Adequate lighting is a top priority. Increasing wattage, the
number of fixtures or using spot lighting will help someone who is
unsteady to negotiate his way.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens and bathrooms pose the biggest challenges for
retrofitting, since they may require structural changes or new
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The height of counter tops and sinks is a concern. Generally,
they need to be lower to accommodate a person in a wheelchair. That
means lowering other amenities also, such as mirrors and storage
cabinets. It also means removing the cabinet facings under the
sinks so that a wheelchair can pull up under them.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds unsightly, Pace says, there are ways to improve
the looks, like extending floor material under the sink all the way
to the wall or making retractable panels that can cover the space
when it's not used.
</P>
<P>
   ''Try to make it look good, not institutional,'' Pace says.
''Even things like grab bars in the bathroom can be painted to have
some color.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple cabinet work is one thing, but other major changes may be
needed in the bathroom. If a person can no longer use a tub, it may
need to be removed in favor of a low-lip shower or one without a
lip that a wheelchair can be rolled into. Water control fixtures
may need to be replaced with a hand-held shower, a single-lever
flow control and a temperature-control device.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a new, taller toilet may be needed to aid someone with
limited mobility. Plastic attachments are available to heighten the
existing seat.
</P>
<P>
   If grab bars are needed, some kind of reinforcement is
necessary, since they will pull out of masonry or drywall.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, storage space should be rearranged for lower
reaches and counter space lowered to aid safe food preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Properly designed appliances can be a major expense.
</P>
<P>
   A side-by-side refrigerator unit makes both freezer and
refrigerator easily accessible. Stoves should have front-mounted
controls and the burners should be staggered to prevent reaching
over a hot pan.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, few families would need to make all these changes.
The modifications may be as simple as adding a grab bar to a shower
stall or changing a bathroom sink.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of making several major changes to a home can add
up quickly. Just retrofitting a bathroom can cost $2,000 and making
an entire home handicapped accessible could cost $15,000, Pace
says.
</P>
<P>
   Many people can't afford to pay for such extensive changes, and
insurance may not cover everything. There are sources for grants
and low-interest loans, but finding them can take some detective
work. Contact nonprofit organizations that act as advocates for
people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the confusion and despair of having a loved one
become disabled, help is available so that the most basic need of
all _ a place to live _ doesn't have to become a burden.

SKI TRAILS LURE BIKERS IN WARM SEASON
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of two bikers with mountain in background 
 By KEN McALPINE 
 c.1999 Ken McAlpine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In mid-summer there's no trace of the 15,000 skiers who swarm
the Sierra Nevada slopes of Mammoth Mountain, Calif., during a
typical winter. I'm on the ski lift, and ahead of me empty gondolas
swing up to Mammoth's 11,053-foot summit. Below, if I look closely
between the islands of pine, I can see microscopic mountain bikers
gliding along trails that ribbon the thickets.
</P>
<P>
   Once ski resorts like Mammoth boarded up when the snow was gone.
Not anymore. The transition to a place for summer biking was a
natural. Lifts were already in place to ferry bikers to various
summits. Cross-country ski trails and access roads already ribboned
the slopes, and acres of wilderness provided space for more.
</P>
<P>
   Ski resorts across the country have jumped on the bandwagon,
150-plus to date, grooming ski trails, offering bike rentals and
tossing in niceties like trail maps and bike rangers. Many of the
resorts continue their programs into early fall when bikers can get
the added bonus of the changing autumn colors. Mammoth stays open
until late September.
</P>
<P>
   In my mind mountain biking's real appeal is the chance explore
and see supernatural beauty via two-wheel quiet. And with 70-plus
miles of groomed singletrack trail lacing 3500 acres of slope and
forest, Mammoth offers plenty of opportunity for that.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, like many of the other ski resorts, many of
Mammoth's trails can be negotiated by riders with minimal off-road
skills, and those that can't are clearly marked in black on the
trail map, and anointed with telltale names like Skid Marks, Brake
Through and Kamikaze, the latter being a legendary teary-eyed
4.5-mile fallaway from Mammoth Mountain's summit that sees skilled
riders hit speeds of 60-plus miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to lure more business, many resorts offer attractive
packages. I signed up for Mammoth Adventure Connection's two-night
mountain bike package, roughly $300 for two night's stay at the
Mammoth Mountain Inn, a grand, and in July nearly empty, hotel
conveniently located at the foot of the mountain; a Bike Park pass
for the day; a rental bike that was a spiffy thing with shock
absorption, and assorted other incidentals, including two hours
with guide Chris Hosking, a former member of England's national
mountain bike team.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want all these extras, you can just bring your bike
to the slopes of your choice, buy a trail pass, and ride for as
little as $8 a day.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Hosking long to read my needs and my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Use your brakes as much as you want, and take time to enjoy
the views,'' Hosking said reassuringly when we met in front of the
Bike Center one morning. ''Go slow, and if you get to something
that's too difficult, get off.''
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious Hosking knew teaching, too. Rather than sit in
front of the Bike Center, we immediately set off down an easy
downhill trail called Paper Route so that Hosking might judge his
student's prowess.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that in short order Hosking began reviewing basic off
road dos and don'ts. Don't jam on the front brake or you'll go over
the handlebars. Don't attempt sudden directional changes in soft
dirt or mid-turn or you'll go down. Do move your butt out over your
back tire during steep descents to keep the rear wheel planted
firmly on the ground. Do scan the trail ahead for unaddressed
rocks, tree roots and dropoffs abruptly enlivening a ride. And do
exercise caution.
</P>
<P>
   These things were important, and I tried hard to focus on what
Hosking was saying, but I must confess I found it hard to pay
attention. Singletrack is roughly a foot wide and often narrower.
Fortunately, most of Mammoth's singletrack was well groomed, at
points even cupped into a sort of smooth half-pipe. Riding Paper
Route, a long gradual decline, was like descending a curvy luge
track.
</P>
<P>
   We swooped down through a tunnel of pine, piercing cool shadows
and flickering sunlight. Well, Hosking swooped. But even my liberal
use of brakes didn't dilute the magic.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we found ourselves back at the base of the mountain.
It was time for Chris to go, but before he did he nodded up at the
summit and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone can do it,'' he said, ''and now you know how to use
your brakes.''
</P>
<P>
   He surveyed the dark clouds gathering overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'd ride the Kamikaze now. Those clouds are going to
build. There's a risk of the gondola being closed because of
thunder and lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   I squandered as much time as I could, but the weather refused to
cooperate. Which is how I found myself standing at the summit, my
nose pointed into a black sign proclaiming ''You are at the start
of the Kamikaze, the West's Most Outrageous Ride''.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But the important point is this. No hill is terrifying if
negotiated properly. And so my descent was bereft of the shrieking
of brakes only when I stopped, which I did often. The view was
shockingly wonderful, a head spinning 360-degree panorama of
mountain crags and glinting lakes and great green valleys,
quiltwork squares of pine and forest and grass.
</P>
<P>
   I found it so wonderful that I took the gondola back to the
summit first thing the next day. This time I descended via a tamer
route called ''Off The Top.'' I junked the map _ Mammoth's trails
are well marked with neat wooden signs _ and simply rode where my
nose led me. The sun warmed my face, and a soft wind moved the
pines. I crossed white bright sand and skirted tiny round lakes,
the bike's wheels crunching merrily beneath me. I dropped through
dark corridors of pine, and stopped to look at empty chairlifts
swaying and creaking in the sun. In four hours I saw five other
riders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Chris had told me it would be hard to get lost, but I
did, which is how I happened on a lovely trail, soft with pine
needles and split by streams edged with purple flowered stalks and
forded by mossy wooden footbridges.
</P>
<P>
   Even now I can't find the trail on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely the point.

First Roommate
<TEXT>
<P>
   Isn't leaving high school friends and family to start a new life
in college isn't enough of a panic? Now you have to live with a
randomly selected stranger who will be privy to your phone messages
or how often you floss. This could be your next best friend for
life...or you could find yourself begging to get reassigned after
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for the worst first? Peter Stine, now a 28-year-old lawyer
in Wynnewood, Pa., used to wake up and find his freshman roommate
staring at him, or hear him replaying a song for three hours
straight. But the kicker was his roomie's extensive knife
collection and off-the-wall quip one day: ''What would you do if I
tried to kill you?'' Stine moved out in haste at the end of the
semester.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing your own roommates when you're living off campus or
working and on your own has its own pitfalls. Anyone who has had
roommates will laugh if you ask about the ever-convivial bunch on
TV's ''Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The size of the apartment on the show is not realistic, says
Steve Martin, 26, who shared a New York duplex. ''If you don't have
that large common area for personal space, there's a lot more
tension!''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Kabela, 29, a public relations professional in Orlando,
Fl., had an infuriatingly cheap roommate who used to tally the cost
of every stamp she used to pay their bills. Patrick Panzarella, 31,
a mortgage company financial officer in San Antonio, Tex., lived
with a food bandit. ''We found out he didn't like bologna and we
all started buying it because it was the only thing he wouldn't
chow down.''
 &UR; Learning to Tolerate Differences &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dale Lehrfeld, Ph.D., estimates that one in three students she
used to see as a staff psychologist at Temple University Counseling
Services in Philadelphia raised a roommate issue during the course
of treatment. Many students arrive never having had a roommate
before, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bips, Ed.D., Director of Counseling and Development at
Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., echoes that today's crop of
students seems less willing and capable of coping with even the
pettiest squabbles because most are accustomed to rooms of their
own. Roommate problems tend to be most difficult in college, she
adds, because ''your room is the entire world. You spend more of
your free time there.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Roommates have to recognize that there will always be a level
of discomfort that has to be tolerated in living with another
person,'' Bips says.
</P>
<P>
   To avert explosive situations, Temple University asks students
to sign a roommate agreement _ a voluntary contract requiring that
roommates discuss possible conflicts and misunderstandings. The
topics in the agreement encompass everything from study time and
phone use, to overnight guests and borrowing rules.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing these issues upfront might have saved Stine another
bad roommate during law school. He knew the guy he moved in with,
but didn't count on his girlfriend being there all the time _ a
woman he didn't get along with. Then, there was the mess.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could not see the floor because there was so much junk.
The cat's litter box overflowed and everything smelled.'' Stine's
girlfriend ultimately refused to visit due to the filth.
</P>
<P>
   Stine moved out after five months and shares this advice:
''Don't lock yourself into a lease for a whole year. It might cost
more to get a short-term lease, but it's worth it.''
 &UR; Who Makes the Best Roommate? &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, don't move in with your best friend, declares
Sylvia Bergthold who wrote and published, ''Sorry, the Boa Has
Gotta Go! A Roommate Survival Guide'' last year (see
www.aroommatesurvivalguide.com). Unless you have a very close,
long-standing relationship with a brother or sister, she would
issue the same warning to adult siblings considering cohabitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Best friends know each other too well. They say things to each
other they would normally not say to someone else. They end up
hurting each other and destroying the friendship.'' Panzarella
agrees, maintaining that rooming with a best buddy is pushing the
limit. ''It is tough if there is friction and you usually do
everything together.''
</P>
<P>
   Many who go into the work force after high school and move out
of parents' houses may also need a roommate to make ends meet. How
do you find one? Bergthold has used classified ads to find
roommates for her California house and interviews each promising
candidate twice. Watch for signs of instability, she says. Kabela
recommends the company bulletin board to advertise for a roommate.
''At work, you can ask around and check the person out,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   What about choosing a roommate of another gender? Last fall,
Marlboro College in Vermont became one of a few colleges in the
country to allow students to select opposite sex roommates in
regular dorm rooms. Annette Huffman and Steve Martin said it worked
for them after college. They knew each other from attending Ohio
University, Athens, and shared a duplex after graduation in New
York City until Annette moved back to Ohio. While they had the
classic skirmishes over the toilet seat up or down, Huffman, 24,
now working at a Toledo public relations agency, said she loved
having a guy around to provide a male perspective when discussing
dates.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who still works at Merrill Lynch, in New York, downplays
the gender angle, saying it was their similar lifestyles and ''lots
of respect and compromise'' that made them so compatible.
</P>
<P>
   While Huffman and Martin are not best friends, they did catch a
movie or have drinks together sometimes. Having a roommate in your
mid-20s is different from college, says Huffman, when she then
wanted to do everything with the people she roomed with.
</P>
<P>
   Panzarella concurs that his roommate needs likewise changed when
he started working. ''After college, you want people who are on the
same work schedule as you. I had a bartender roommate who came home
at 3 or 4 a.m. when I was going to sleep at 10:30 p.m. That
roommate was short-lived!''
</P>
<P>
   What if there were no financial concerns? How many would still
elect to share space? ''I come from a big noisy family and like
having a roommate,'' says Huffman. She and her roommate looked
after each other, making her feel safer, she says. While they live
in different states now, they visit each other and remain close.
After her first disastrous freshman roommate experience, Norris is
very happy with her current roommate and assures nervous incoming
freshmen that bad situations can be quickly remedied. She admits,
too, that she might have done a better job of setting clear limits
with her roommates in the beginning
</P>
<P>
   So, take heart! In the end, Lehrfeld says there are more stories
of successful roommates than not. Between borrowing the forbidden
sweater and tying up the phone line, the encouraging word is that
most roommates are able to work it out.
</P>
<P>
   *** (sidebar) Tips for Happy Roommate Living + Find someone with
compatible living habits. You don't need the same interests, you
need similar lifestyles. If you can't agree about cleanliness,
noise, or how to handle 'significant others,' this is a red flag.''
+ Look for someone who has lived with others before and is used to
sharing. Get a reference from a former roommate if possible. +
Interview prospective roommates. Perhaps you are working or living
off campus and seeking a roommate. Ask questions such as why are
you moving? How often have you moved? Watch out for those with a
bad credit history, evictions, lawsuits or abusive ex-boyfriends.
Steer clear of people who have moved frequently due to
unemployment, financial problems or friction with previous
roommates. +Avoid rooming with someone who is possessive of you or
dependent. Also nix those who are totally withdrawn or very
volatile, physically or emotionally. + Establish rules at the
start. You can never have everything 50-50, but you can sit down
and talk about how you want things to be at the beginning. +
Everyone needs space. Get a separate phone line and your own
bathroom if possible. Sharing a room? One man had a privacy code in
his frat house; he and his roommate would tie a sock on the
doorknob if either had female company. + Talk it out. Explain why
something is upsetting you. Present the problem as a need and offer
solutions. Don't let the resentment build until you are too angry
to fix it. + Share and share alike ... but stiffed bills or
freeloading happens. Some roommates put one bill in each person's
name so everyone has a stake.

WANNA SEE YOUR FAVORITE BAND? YOU MAY HAVE TO SHELL OUT THE BUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The asking price for tickets to John Mellencamp's last area
show: $45.75.
</P>
<P>
   Ann and Nancy Wilson's shows at Fort Worth's Caravan of Dreams
this past week? $67.
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync's teen sweat-fest at Texas Stadium? $49.50.
</P>
<P>
   Top price to see teen heartthrob Ricky Martin at Dallas' Reunion
Arena this November? $75.
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Stones' recent arena show in Oklahoma City? Try
$300.
</P>
<P>
   This is why George Johnson doesn't like going to concerts
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to go to a whole lot of 'em, but it's just not in our
budget now,'' says the 43-year-old Fort Worth architect, who has a
wife and two children. ``Big shows are outrageously priced. We've
been to Starplex once in our lives. That was enough. It's just too
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to the rising cost of, well, everything, concert ticket
prices have, obviously, gone up over the years. But this year, more
and more live-music fans are getting as fed up as Johnson: Tickets
aren't just expensive, they say _ they're out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of these folks, the old rule of thumb about rising
ticket prices _ people will complain awhile, then higher prices
will become commonplace _ just isn't flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-five dollars for one ticket is definitely too much, and
that's not even including all the service charges,'' says Dana
Vaughn, 29, a onetime-frequent concertgoer turned
once-in-a-while-concertgoer. ``That's $90, just for two tickets.
That's not even going out to eat or getting a drink at the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Other fans, however, think nothing of paying upward of $70 a
ticket. Take Mitchell Wolfe, who shelled out nearly $140 for two
seats to Tuesday's Ann &AMP; Nancy Wilson show at Caravan of Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I can see (people) getting upset about having to pay
that much for one night of entertainment,'' says the 34-year-old
Hurst, Texas, resident, who took his wife to the show. ``But if
people wanna see someone bad enough _ and I wanted to see Heart bad
enough _ they'll pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   That, industry insiders say, is precisely why ticket prices have
shot up dramatically: Bands like Pink Floyd and the Eagles proved
during their '94-'95 tours that if fans wanted to see 'em bad
enough, they'd pay seemingly ludicrous amounts of money to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Pink Floyd charged $65 a ticket, the Eagles as much as $100. At
a time most concert tickets were no more than $30, those two tours,
both of which were highly successful, revealed something.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, concert tickets were definitely underpriced,
compared to what it cost to go to a hockey game or football game,''
says promoter Mark Lee of 462 Inc. in Dallas. ``And now it's
catching up.''
</P>
<P>
   WHOSE IDEA IS IT?: Industry watchers also say that professional
ticket brokers like Texas Tickets _ who, like scalpers, pay face
value for tickets, then resell them for higher prices _ have driven
artists to raise their ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ticket brokers were charging $100 for seats, and getting
that,'' says Gary Bongiovanni, editor of concert-industry magazine
``Pollstar.'' ``At some point, artists realized this, and thought
to themselves, `We're schmucks for not charging more. The public
obviously thinks our product is worth that, so we should be
charging it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has accepted that pricing now,'' Bongiovanni says.
``It's not just the top-level superstars doing it. Seems like
everybody is, including bands that haven't had a hit in years.''
</P>
<P>
   One such act: Bad Company. This year, the British classic-rock
group re-formed with original singer Paul Rodgers for a farewell
tour. Top price of their July 17 show at Reunion Arena: $65.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, supposedly, was shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That does seem kinda steep, doesn't it?'' he said in a phone
interview a week before the show. ``But that's out of our hands.
Those decisions are made by someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Like who? The promoters? The venues? The band managers?
</P>
<P>
   Dallas promoter Lee says it's a group decision, hashed out among
the artist, promoter, venue and band middlemen, such as managers
and agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mutually agreed-to thing,'' he says. ``It doesn't fall
on one person.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Bongiovanni says, it all goes through the artist, in
one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest misconception is that ticket prices are set by
greedy promoters, and that's just not true,'' Bongiovanni says.
``They're usually set by the artist or someone close to them. A lot
of it depends on how active the artist wants to be in their
business. They can simply tell their manager or agent how much they
wanna make, and ticket prices reflect that. At the very least, (the
artists) have to approve ticket prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason prices seem to be skyrocketing these days, Lee
says, is that it simply costs a lot more to bring in top-name acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more and bigger salaries to pay nowadays to the
artists and their crews,'' he says. ``A lot of the shows out there
are huge, expensive productions, so that's reflected in the ticket
price.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   ALTERNATIVES, ANYONE?: There do seem to be some exceptions to
that bigger-show/bigger price rule. A good example: Garth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   On the country music superstar's 1998 tour, tickets were $21 _
and fans were treated to an elaborate, over-the-top, eye-candy
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're $21 because Garth wants them to be $21,'' Bongiovanni
says. ``He doesn't tour to make a lot of money. He's doing it for
the fans. He delivers such a great live show, people walk away
fully fulfilled and you get a real positive feeling. That loyalty
he's built is gonna pay dividends down the road. When, maybe, radio
isn't playing his records anymore, he'll still have that connection
with his fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Other groups, such as Pearl Jam, Green Day and, most recently,
popular punk rock act the Offspring, have fought to keep their
ticket prices low _ and, for the most part, they've won.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average price of an Offspring ticket on their current tour
is $18, which is very good,'' Bongiovanni says. ``Some of the acts
like the Offspring that appeal to teen audiences are more
price-conscious than acts that appeal to the baby-boomer
generation, who have higher income levels and can afford to pay
premium ticket prices. Then you have an act like 'N Sync, but
they're probably figuring Mom and Dad are buying those tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Music fan George Johnson suggests an alternative to paying high
ticket prices, besides staying home: Support local music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get our live music from the local music scene,'' he says.
``You don't have to pay outrageous prices, the shows are more
intimate. It's a smaller dollar, and we're entertained better.''
</P>
<P>
   For fans who enjoy seeing touring acts such as Mellencamp, the
Stones, Jimmy Buffett and the seemingly endless line of re-formed
oldies acts, there's little hope that ticket prices will taper off
_ at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is gonna continue until artists price themselves out
of the market,'' Bongiovanni says. ``Some tours may have already
done that. Most people want the best seats in the house, and if
they can't have them, they're not gonna pay a lot of money for bad
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be careful that we don't become an elitist
business,'' he says. ``Attending concerts didn't used to be that
expensive. It's not a frivolous expense to go to a show today. On
top of tickets, you've got parking, hot dog or a beer. God forbid
you wanna buy a sweat shirt.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Dining out an enigmatic escapade
 &HT;    (For release Aug. 18, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am sitting in a restaurant in the North Carolina mountains,
looking at the menu. One of the offerings is something called
marinated and grilled pork tenderloin with rosemary-Zinfandel
sauce, goat cheese-chive mash and Carolyn's fresh-picked snap
beans, whomever Carolyn the bean-picker might be.
</P>
<P>
   As I am not big on goat cheese-chive mash, my choice, instead,
is the marinated and grilled leg of lamb with mint aioli, vegetable
marmalade and Tuscan beans. Although I had no idea what ``aioli''
was, it just sounded better than the goat cheese-chive mash.
</P>
<P>
   Passed up, also, was the too adventurous-sounding
chocolate-infused espresso-crusted grilled tenderloin of beef with
Irish cream sauce, French beans and goat cheese-au gratin potatoes.
I thought to myself that if I wanted coffee with dinner, I'd order
it in a cup instead of ``infused'' in a piece of beef.
</P>
<P>
   When my plate arrives, I look down at it, then across to my wife
with my best ``is-that-all-there-is?'' look. She has problems of
her own. Her citrus-soy marinated rare grilled yellowfin tuna with
jasmine rice, stir-fried vegetables and a variety of sauces more
common to Japanese restaurants seems to still be flapping. This is
one big piece of sushi.
</P>
<P>
   She sends it back so that the cook may kill and warm it.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm looking at on my plate are circular-placed,
quarter-sized, thin pieces of lamb; six in all. I could get all six
pieces into one mouthful. Between them are curious-looking dollops
of a light green substance that is identified to me as the aioli
and further defined as mayonnaise flavored with crushed garlic;
infused, I am certain.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the entree has this hockey puck-looking disk of
beans glued together by the vegetable marmalade.
</P>
<P>
   It is then that my wife and I fondly begin discussing the dinner
we had a couple of nights earlier in South Carolina _ a tangy,
filling platter of Memphis-style ribs, baked potato and salad. Note
that each and all of these ingredients are identifiable to the
average American.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that in these recent decades of chi-chi American
gastronomy, presumably foisted upon us by California chefs run
amok, there are becoming just two types of restaurant dining: fast
food and no food. What's in-between is fading from the restaurant
platter.
</P>
<P>
   Try going to one of those restaurants where the kitchen is out
in the open, the chefs considered to be celebrities, and try to get
some meatloaf. Fat chance!
</P>
<P>
   I left the restaurant for my room, still hungry and longing for
that jar of peanuts on my nightstand and a cold Dr Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of enigmatic and paltry main courses reminded me
of a column written by a now-gone colleague who tired of the trend
to fantasy-style dining. He showed up at a 7-Eleven one night, and
foraged the food cabinets of the establishment. ``First, I munched
on an adventurous pemmican appetizer called a Super Jerk Slim
Jim,'' John Keasler wrote. ``It sent my taste buds right into happy
little aerobics!
</P>
<P>
   ``The main course,'' he continued, ``is prepared by a system of
micro (or little-ditty) waves. My companion was overjoyed with her
Red Hot Beef and Bean Burro, an astounding bargain at 79 cents,
while I literally drooled over my Shredded Beef Chimichanga With
Green Chili and Cheese in a Fried Flour Tortilla, at the same
price.''
</P>
<P>
   So, that seems to be our choice: aioli, chocolate-infused
espresso-crusted something, goat cheese-chive mash on one side and
ribs, hamburgers and a plain old steak or fried catfish on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever had to explain a menu to me at Denny's, or even
Shoney's.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what's so great about this country, eh?; the choice.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Harold Henry Reese, 81
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pee Wee Reese was my baseball hero. I picked Pee Wee Reese
because he was nobody else's hero. Kids do that. It was 1940. I was
7.
</P>
<P>
   As years passed, my choice of heroes would have about it a
certain brilliance. Pee Wee was a wonderful shortstop, a Hall of
Famer. He hit .309 in his best year, and ended his career in 1958
with a lifetime .269. How much would they pay a .309 shortstop now?
</P>
<P>
   When he died the other day at 81, Pee Wee Reese was mostly
remembered for having been captain of the Brooklyn Dodgers during
the Jackie Robinson years. Do teams even have captains now? His
support of Jackie Robinson was not without a pause. Pee Wee, after
all, was a Southerner. Then he decided Robinson was good, really
good, and would help the club. On one particularly tough day in
Cincinnati, he publicly embraced Robinson. Harold Henry Reese, like
Jackie Robinson, had transcended mere baseball hero.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for everything, Pee Wee.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks again.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: I don't think Kansas is with us anymore
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stop the world. Kansas wants to get off. In fact, it already has
one foot dragging.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Education has removed evolution from the list
of matters that public school biology students must know.
</P>
<P>
   Local districts may continue teaching evolution if they wish,
but with the state board caving in to religious and cultural
conservatives, local schools have been set up for similar muggings.
Many will be unwilling to hold out against the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The board's 6-4 vote was an appalling example of knowledge by
pressure group, a sure shortcut to boobery. The understanding of
evolution is absolutely central to modern biology. Voting it away
is akin to removing math from physics.
</P>
<P>
   Students in Kansas are left with little to learn in biology but
the names of plants and animals _ toddler stuff. An understanding
of the science's animating dynamic will be denied them. Don't
expect many to go on to science in college.
</P>
<P>
   All this because some Christian literalists can't square the
biblical creation story with the fossil and DNA records that, among
what are by now tons of evidence, confirm the evolutionary process.
Unable to force their contrary pseudo-science of creationism into
public curricula _ the courts quickly saw through that dodge for
slipping sectarian religion into public classrooms _ the
fundamentalists are settling for killing evolution off by political
fiat.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure had grown so intense last year that the National
Academy of Sciences was forced to the distinctly odd act of issuing
an urgent plea for the teaching of evolution _ a pitch that ought
to be as unnecessary as having to plead that grammar or subtraction
be taught.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska and New Mexico have downgraded the teaching of
evolution, and Alabama requires that biology texts carry what
amounts to a warning label. Ohio, Texas, Washington, New Hampshire
and Tennessee have had to fight off anti-evolution crusades.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that grandstanding politicians lend themselves
to this foolishness. Arguably, it was Ronald Reagan, campaigning
for the presidency, who licensed the contemporary activism against
evolution when he told a convention of fundamentalists he doubted
evolution is real. GOP House Whip Tom Delay recently blamed the
teaching of evolution in part for the Columbine High School
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Gov. Bill Graves and several state legislators _ some,
like Graves, moderate Republicans _ are considering either
abolishing the state school board or stripping its authority over
study content.
</P>
<P>
   They and other politicians willing to uphold intellectual
integrity deserve more public support than is usually forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Most Christians have no problem accepting both the science of
evolution and the awe-inspiring sweep and elegance of biblical
creation, but their absence from this little war _ and it has
become one _ is leaving the field to reactionary activists speaking
in the name of their religion.

 &HT;    `Blair Witch' star overnight a new sensation
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She's late. A-list late: 45 minutes and counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really sorry,'' Heather Donahue, star of ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' says the moment she breezes into Barefoot, a restaurant
wedged somewhere in a Bermuda Triangle between Beverly Hills and
West Hollywood. ``My mother led a life of tardiness, and I'm
determined in this life to change that. Usually I'm 15 minutes
early.''
</P>
<P>
   She takes a breath, sits, looks at a menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a real breakfast,'' she announces and then orders one,
Barefoot-style: two eggs and bacon, with goat cheese and black
pepper, served on olive bread.
</P>
<P>
   She removes her yellow-tint sunglasses. One of her fingers
sports a big yellow piece of amber; another a big purply chunk of
glass (``I like big .. . big ... I like big,'' she explains). A
stretchy black top hugs her the way that big muddy parka in the
movie does not.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue, who plays a frumpy, headstrong documentarian in the
low-budget film phenomenon, is your basic 24-year-old overnight
sensation. Raised in Philadelphia, conservatory-trained in theater,
moved to New York. Performed improv stand-up, improv theater,
downtown theater, regional theater (``I played Pontius Pilate's
wife in rural Virginia; it went over really well with the
locals''). Moved with her photographer boyfriend to Los Angeles a
year ago (``It's easier to be poor in L.A. than New York'').
</P>
<P>
   In between, in 1997, she answered an ad in an actors' trade
paper for this crazy movie project that five Florida nobodies had
cooked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get to improvise a full-length feature _ that just
doesn't happen, and it will never happen again. That's why I had to
do it,'' Donahue says of ``Blair Witch,'' the almost entirely
improvised movie that, after being shot in eight days for about
$35,000, has made more than $80 million. It could become the most
profitable low-budget movie ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the part so badly, but every time I went back, they
wanted a saintly Joan of Arc character. Which is not what I gave
them. I figured you have to be a character who can justify keeping
a camera in people's faces 24 hours a day when going through some
deep (stuff). This is not about a saint. This has to be a
borderline unpleasant character. I gave them a more obsessive take
than they were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the movie was great. But when she finished, all Donahue
had was some intentionally amateurish-looking footage of her
improvising her brains out, including the now-famous apology scene
in which her nose runs. Taken out of its ``Blair Witch'' context,
the footage didn't make much sense when she shopped it around to
casting directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, `That's really cute. Hope you had a nice camping
trip with your pals and let us know when you're doing something for
real,''' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Then ``Blair Witch'' was screened at the Sundance Film Festival
in January and things changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people call and want to meet me,'' Donahue says. ``They
send me scripts. Occasionally they even send me good scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living a fantastic sort of life. I have my normal life,
where I clean the apartment and scrub out my toilet. In so many
ways my life is no different at all. Except it's busier and more
stressful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a cell phone yesterday,'' she adds. ``I'd resisted
for so long, but it got so awful trying to find a pay phone that
works in Los Angeles. Because everybody has cell phones, there are
no functional pay phones.''
</P>
<P>
   A photographer arrives; Donahue wasn't expecting one and freaks
in that hey-no-problem way that lets you know it is a bit of a
problem. After having her eight-day schlep around the woods
captured in all its gritty realism in ``Blair Witch,'' Donahue now
tries to be camera ready whenever a camera's around. She slurps
down some coffee and rises from her chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a little glam for press types. Don't worry, I have this
system down. Ten minutes, tops.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten and a half minutes later, Donahue returns from the bathroom,
where she put on some makeup and did something with her hair. She
looks a little more Hollywood than indie-chick. Not a lot. But a
little.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to my life,'' she says, digging into her eggs before
looking up to see if the photographer caught her gulping. ``Now I
have to put on makeup when photographers come, and I think, `Oh,
boy.'''
</P>
<P>
   She moves from the eggs to the bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take it too seriously because it comes fast and goes
fast, especially for women. There is the possibility that I could
make a living doing what I love, and that's all I ever wanted. I
constantly wonder where the next rent check is going to be _ I'm
still in that position _ but at least now it looks like there could
potentially be light at the end of the tunnel. Whether that works
out or not, who knows? I could be flavor of the month this month
and disappear next month.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now she's reading scripts. Mostly horror scripts. Mostly
unbelievably bad horror scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking to do something I like, and not just looking to do
something,'' she says. ``I could be doing something right now, and
believe me, I need the money more than anybody. But when you
struggle for years and then get a little success, why should you
begin to compromise then? That seems backwards to me. I could be
completely shooting myself in the foot, and you know what? It'll
just be another life lesson learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in my control that I'm hot this month, and it won't
be in my control if I'm not the next. The material I choose is the
only thing I have control over, and I'll be damned if I'll let
anybody take that away from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the people around me aren't driving '84 Celicas, so
I don't need to support them.''
</P>
<P>
   We talk a while longer. About her parents (``They give you that
pesky integrity and sense of pride and self-worth that, you know,
hinders you, really''). Problems the movie's success caused with
her boyfriend (``You learn a lot ... you learn a lot ... you learn
a whole lot''). How she wishes she knew more about the business
when she signed her ``Blair Witch'' contract (``It's going to be on
a lot of screens and make a lot of money. I just go to a lot of
meetings and do a lot of press. It's a lesson learned''). She
finishes her brunch. Needs to get going: a celebrity basketball
game (``I'm just watching. I haven't quite got myself to the level
of being invited to play. I'm just invited to sit there and
humiliate myself''). We step outside into Los Angeles' pale warm
light and hand our tickets to a valet.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue says people recognize her now, come up to her and expect
her to be just like the Heather Donahue she plays in the movie.
People think she was just being herself on the screen, not acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is what we wanted,'' she says. ``But it's strange as an
actor. It's your most visible work and people kind of don't think
you're working. It's the highest flattery, really.''
</P>
<P>
   No one recognizes her this afternoon at Barefoot. But the valet
brings her car first. She says goodbye and drives off. In her white
'84 Celica.
</P>
<P>
   It really needs washing.

 &HT;    Kansas goes backward on science
 &HT;    c. 1999 Atlanta Constitution
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week a slim majority of Kansas Board of Education members
blithely discarded the theory of evolution, a cornerstone of the
biological sciences. You might say they thumbed their noses at the
laws of physics, too, by turning back the calendar a century or so.
</P>
<P>
   Their 6-to-4 vote could well plunge science education in the
state into the pre-Darwin past. It would eliminate virtually any
mention of evolution _ or any allied thinking such as the Big Bang
theory _ from the state school curriculum. It also would remove the
subject entirely from state assessment tests required of pupils in
the state's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   While the policy change doesn't specifically outlaw teaching
evolution, it could easily discourage teachers and pupils from
devoting time to the topic. Also, local school boards will likely
feel fresh pressure to adopt creationist textbooks. Kansas could
well become honeycombed with school districts that teach evolution,
some that teach creationism and some that try to duck the furor.
</P>
<P>
   Most ominous from a economic standpoint, such an outcome could
mean high-tech firms will bypass Kansas for states where
prospective workers are likely to be better grounded in
conventional science. That prospect must have been on the mind of
Kansas Gov. Bill Graves, a Republican, who called the board's vote
``a terrible, tragic, embarrassing solution to a problem that did
not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   How did it happen? A year ago a panel of scientists and
professors began drafting a Kansas version of new national
science-instruction guidelines. Submitted for review to the elected
state school board, the draft was rewritten to expunge references
to evolution. (``Not good science to teach evolution as fact,'' one
influential board member harumphed.)
</P>
<P>
   This is an evolving tactic of the creationists. Ever since the
Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that states could not force schools to
teach creationism, its true believers have worked instead to
diminish evolution in the classroom, scoring successes in Alabama,
New Mexico, Nebraska and now in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia Attorney General Mike Bowers did well in 1996 in
ruling that local school systems could not require the teaching of
creationism as a so-called counterweight to instruction in
evolution. Just the same, Georgians need to be on guard to prevent
a Kansaslike relapse here.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic that most biblical literalists maintain the Earth
can't be more than 10,000 years old while men of science put its
age at nearly 4 billion years. The latter view of the universe and
its origin suggests a Creator of infinitely more scope and
grandeur, more complexity and mystery than the comparatively
diminutive figure the creationists believe in.

 &HT;    Bands should forgive Sydney snub
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sydney Olympics officials have treated two Atlanta area bands
shabbily. Bands from Fayette County High School and Cobb County's
Walton High School were among the American high school band members
invited to participate in the Opening Ceremonies for the 2000
Olympic Games, only to be uninvited after folks Down Under raised a
fuss about giving foreigners such a prominent role.
</P>
<P>
   School officials, band members and their parents were
understandably miffed. For some of them, it clearly is a matter of
pride not to accept this bitter insult, even if it is sprinkled
with sugar.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times when pride should be swallowed, and this is
one of them. Seeking to avoid a suit threatened by the company that
booked the American bands for Sydney, officials in Australia say
they're working on reinstating the high schools into the Opening
Ceremony. If the re-invitation is genuine, both metro area schools
ought to put the initial snubs behind them and go. This is a once
in a lifetime chance for the students, and they'll have fun and
learn things they could never learn in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The officials in Sydney showed they were insecure and downright
silly in their decision to boot out ``the foreigners.'' They are
hosting the Olympics, after all, the most international event the
world knows. What's next? Excluding foreign athletes so Australians
can take pride in winning all the medals?
</P>
<P>
   Olympic hosts have to be bigger than such pettiness. And the
bands from Fayette County and Walton high schools should show
they're bigger than that, too. If given the chance, they should go
over, put on a great show and enjoy themselves.

 &HT;    Raccoon close enough outdoors
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Summer nights, Stella and I share a hammock
on the upstairs sleeping porch. We both enjoy the cool breezes and
the night sounds, and an old Pawley's Island hammock is tough to
beat for comfort if there are enough quilts piled on top of the
ropes. Stella is a white cat. She's 15.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy doesn't enjoy the hammock but once in a while she will sit
on the porch rail and yell at us. Sometimes she watches the night
birds through the screen. Mostly she worries about her food dish.
Biddy is a Rubenesque Siamese. She's 10.
</P>
<P>
   Last night Stella and I had just settled in for the evening when
we heard a rustling in the treetops above us. Whatever it was had
obviously lost its grip on a limb and was taking a tumble downward.
It landed with a splash. The girls and I hustled to the screen to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The night was bright enough to make out a shadowy form in the
birdbath, splashing away and slurping up the fresh water. This can
mean only one thing _ our raccoon is back. He's been missing for a
couple of weeks and the girls and I wondered if he'd moved away to
greener pastures, but now we realize he'd just gone on vacation _
probably a cruise of the Lake Erie islands to visit cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't drink where you bathe,'' I whispered softly into
the darkness. He ignored me and went on with his ablutions,
splashing and slurping like he hadn't had a shower or a drink the
whole time he'd been gone.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later as the girls and I watched, he climbed out
of the birdbath and shook himself in that funny rolling motion he
has and went looking for breakfast. His first stop is always the
feeder in the side yard. We watched as he checked out the bits of
stale bread I'd put out earlier for the birds, and the carrots and
celery the rabbit enjoys. He munched a little here and there, kind
of like Goldilocks, looking for just the right porridge, and then
</P>
<P>
   waddled out of sight. Stella and I went back to bed.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon a couple of years ago, a raccoon took a lease on
my neighbor's house while she was at the corner market shopping for
supper. Ann said she knew all was not kosher as soon as she opened
the back door because neither of her dogs came yelping for their
customary ``Mommy's back home'' treat. Worried that they somehow
might have gotten out, she hurriedly dropped her two sacks of
groceries on the kitchen counter and went to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   As she rounded the dining room door she heard a muted growl but
was unable to tell whether it was from Shadow the German shepherd,
or his sidekick, Winston, a yappy Yorkie. The grumble slowed her
down. She edged into the entrance hall and turned to see both dogs
sitting on the first landing of the old staircase, staring fixedly
through the rail into the front parlor. She turned to see what they
were watching.
</P>
<P>
   What Ann saw is best described by the ensuing phone conversation
with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike, there's a raccoon in the living room.'' Apparently Mike
asked what he was doing there. ``Well,'' she replied, ``he's
destroyed the dried cattail arrangement, unstuffed a throw pillow
and right now he's sitting on the couch gutting a bag of potato
chips. And I think he had an accident on your footstool.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike suggested maybe she should turn on the soaps for their
visitor. She suggested Mike should get serious or get a new home.
Mike called the wildlife folks, who captured the interloper and
took him to the woods on early release.
</P>
<P>
   So last spring, when it looked like our raccoon was planning on
having his mail sent here, I had a screen installed inside my
chimney, just in case, because it's pretty much like a friend's
husband used to comment about their two small sons: ``What they
don't tear up, they poop on.''

 &HT;    Time to begin again
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A friend of mine is beginning her doctoral program
this fall. Some 20 years after earning her master's degree, she
once again is entering the halls of higher education and reaching
still higher.
</P>
<P>
   She received her required reading list the other day and, with
the excitement of a kindergartner proudly selecting a new lunch
box, went to the bookstore to purchase her textbooks. That night,
poring over the first one, her enthusiasm waned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reading in the second chapter and not understanding half
of it, when I suddenly said to my husband, `Why am I doing this?
I'm a grown woman, competent and capable. I have a good job, a
wonderful family. Why in the world am I putting myself through
this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Momentarily longing to be watching a sitcom on TV or at least
lounging in a hot bath instead of sifting through academic
mumbo-jumbo, she sighed heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband gave her a moment and then said, ``Just begin again,
honey. A little at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   And so she did. She told me later that by the third chapter, she
was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning again. A little at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Our lives are a constant succession of these new beginnings. All
of nature knows this maxim: Grow or die. There is no in-between.
Growth follows a natural rhythm that is as constant as the Earth's
rotation on its axis.
</P>
<P>
   While that maxim is unchanging, other factors do change. For
instance, people today live much longer than they did even 20 years
ago. Women tend to outlive men. When once a 50-year-old woman was
considered past her prime, she now can reasonably expect to live
another 30 to 40 years, most of them productive and active. What do
we do with all those years?
</P>
<P>
   The pattern for many women of my generation has been marriage in
their 20s, raising children into their 40s, and then . . . what?
Then it's our turn.
</P>
<P>
   I, too, am beginning again this fall, returning to higher
education for a master's degree. I plan to do it one course a
semester while working full time and cutting back my column writing
to every other week. At that rate, I jokingly told a friend, I'll
be 70 years old before I get the degree.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't miss a beat: ``You're going to be 70 anyway, you
might as well have a master's when you get there.''
</P>
<P>
   She's absolutely right.
</P>
<P>
   As I pored over my textbooks for the semester a few nights
later, I asked myself the same question my ``doctoral'' friend had
asked her husband: ``Why am I doing this?'' quickly followed by
``Can I do this?'' At an age where I retain water much more easily
than I do information, I wonder why I'm pushing myself.
</P>
<P>
   Then I changed perspective a bit and asked myself, ``So what if
I can't do it? What would be the worst thing about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, sure, a sense of failure. But does one fail simply because
one doesn't succeed? At the end of this course, regardless of the
grade I receive, I still will have learned many things I didn't
know on the first day of class. Where is the failure in that?
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Always We Begin Again: The Benedictine Way of
Living,'' John McQuiston II sums up that very philosophy:
</P>
<P>
   ``What is wanted is not that we should find ultimate truth, nor
that we should become secure, nor that we should have ease, nor
that we should be without hurt, but that we should live fully.
Therefore we should not fear life, nor anything in life, we should
not fear death, nor anything in death, we should live our lives in
love with life . . . and when we fail, to begin again each day.''
</P>
<P>
   You know what? Today is a new day. Begin again.

 &HT;    Greetings! You have lots of choices
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've been on the Web any time at all, you've sent and
received an electronic greeting card.
</P>
<P>
   These cards started out years ago as crude little images and
some text, but nowadays you can send a card that includes music,
animation or even a photograph that you furnish.
</P>
<P>
   There are sites that charge for the service, but there are so
many free ones that we'll ignore the ``for pay'' sites today.
</P>
<P>
   One of the originals and still a site with one of the best
selections on the Web is called Blue Mountain. You'll find it at
www1.bluemountain.com/.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this is an overwhelming place. You'll find
cards for any holiday or occasion that you've ever heard of and
some that you haven't. Among them: Tartan Day, Lantern Festival,
Seijin-no-hi and the ever-popular Pig Day. But don't worry, there
are the more usual holidays, too, all in abundance, as well as
cards you can send for no particular reason.
</P>
<P>
   The site does a good job of walking you through the process of
making the card, personalizing it with your message, selecting
music and sending it. Each time you send a card here, the
information about the recipient _ name and e-mail address _ is
saved. That way, if you come back to send that same person another
card, you can just select the name from a menu and avoid filling in
all those blanks again.
</P>
<P>
   This site works like most of the rest we'll visit today. Once
you've selected the ``send'' function, your recipient will get an
e-mail notification of the card. To view it, he or she will go to a
special address on the Web and view the card via a browser.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most elaborate cards on the Web are at a site called
Regards.Com at www.regards.com/. Check out some of the animated
cards such as the one with a snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   On this site, you can use your own photograph to create a card.
The only qualification to using a photo _ and it's a big one _ is
that you must have your own Web site to stash the photo on. The
electronic card you send then links to that photo on your site.
</P>
<P>
   If nostalgia is your thing, you'll enjoy a place called
Wanderer's Nostalgic 50s-60s Card Shop. The themes include old soda
fountains and Coke machines, small-town parades, pin-ups (they're
G-rated) and the like. You can also add music to your card here.
Naturally enough you can select from a jukebox list that includes
``Johnny Be Good,'' ``Rock Around the Clock'' and ``Shake Rattle
and Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll find it at www
</P>
<P>
   .wanderers.com/wander
</P>
<P>
   /card/.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how long you've been around the Web, no matter how
many cybercards you've sent and received, you probably haven't seen
a Moose-O-Gram. These animated cards _ found at
www.geocities.com/SoHo
</P>
<P>
   /Coffeehouse/2804
</P>
<P>
   /mooseograms/newmoose
</P>
<P>
   .html _ are really fun. You can send a Skunk Love card that will
never be forgotten. While wacky, all these cards are in good taste.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you want to get a little mushy, take a look at
Lovegrams.com at www.lovegrams.com/postcards/index.shtml. There are
some sweetly sophisticated cards here. And, for those of you who
need a little extra help, some cards come complete with love notes
in the form of poetry.

 &HT;    Slimmed-down, lighter PowerBook
 &HT;    is a big step in the right direction
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to speed and processing power, Apple's laptops are
the equal of any PC counterpart. But one important area where
PowerBooks have lagged is in size and weight.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, bigger is not better. The typical PowerBook weighs
8 pounds _too bulky to comfortably lug through airports.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has started to correct this problem with its latest
PowerBook. The laptop is about a third of an inch thinner than its
predecessors. That not only makes this PowerBook easier to grip but
reduces the weight. This slimmer PowerBook weighs 5.9 pounds with
the battery and CD-ROM drive loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the reduction in weight, the PowerBook is not the
lightest laptop on the market. Not by a long shot. But the new G3
PowerBook does represent a big step in the right direction for
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   While slimmed down, the new PowerBook hasn't surrendered
anything in terms of power and speed. It comes in two souped-up
models, a 333-megahertz G3 microprocessor and a 400-MHz G3
microprocessor. Either is among the fastest laptops out there.
</P>
<P>
   Both models also include a 14.1-inch active matrix color screen
and a 56k modem. They also support the new DVD portable drives.
</P>
<P>
   Another important advance with this PowerBook is longer battery
life. Apple claims the battery will last five hours. Testing by
MacWorld magazine showed the battery lasted three hours under
normal working conditions. That's still an improvement over
previous batteries.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing from the new PowerBook is any kind of portable
storage device such as a floppy or Zip drive. That has become true
even for many of Apple's desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you're already a PowerBook user, don't think you can use
your old portable drives with the new G3. They won't work in the
new, slimmer body. You'll have to buy new drives, available for
around $230.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with the slim PowerBook is the lack of adequate
RAM, or internal memory. You get 64 megabytes, but that is barely
sufficient these days. That figure is about half of what is
standard with most PC laptops.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a new problem. Apple has always included insufficient
RAM with its computers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these problems, the new, slimmer G3 PowerBooks are smart
computers that pack a lot of power. They're selling in the catalogs
for between $2,500 and $3,500.

 &HT;    Brains at MIT dream up gadgets for your kitchen
 &HT;    SIDEBAR TO TECHKITCHEN
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a long way from home ec class in high school, but the Media
Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the way
in the high-tech kitchen realm. Here's a look at some of the work
under way by students and professors who are part of MIT's Counter
Intelligence project:
</P>
<P>
   _ Counter Intelligence: The namesake of the whole project,
Counter Intelligence is a kitchen countertop that walks you through
recipes. The system uses a bar-code scanner, scales, a keyboard and
a computer screen. It ``knows'' recipes, identifies ingredients
from digital tags on the packages and can even suggest
substitutions if you run out of a key ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   _ MicroChef: Originally called ``PC Dinners,'' this is basically
a microwave with a bar-code scanner, controlled by a computer. The
bar code gives the computer cooking information as well as a sound
file. French toast, for example, tells the user, ``Pliz remove zee
toast from zee packet and put it in zee microwave, s'il vous
plait.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mr. Java: This intelligent espresso coffee machine reads
instructions from a chip embedded in your coffee cup, transmitting
the information to a computer to make the appropriate drink. It
also transmits your musical preferences so you can listen to your
favorite radio station while your coffee is perking. Mr. Java keeps
track of how much coffee you drink each week, so you can monitor
your caffeine consumption and plan your purchases.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talking oven mitt: Wired with sensors and a voice microchip,
this mitt can tell when your cookies are done and your bread is
baked just by touching it to the pan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Digital nose: Originally developed for drug enforcement
agencies to help track down illegal substances hidden in baggage,
this nose can suggest what spices to sprinkle in your food.
</P>
<P>
   _ Food laser: Say goodbye to sloppily sliced bagels. This
special culinary laser does the work of a million Ginsu knives, and
it can also be used to write cooking instructions on food.

   `Smart' kitchen appliances are proliferating, with e-mail and
Web access on the horizon
</P>
<P>
   WITH SIDEBAR, PHOTOS and LAYOUT
</P>
<P>
   By Mary Jo DiLonardo
</P>
<P>
   c, 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this.
</P>
<P>
   You walk into your kitchen to start breakfast. You pop eggs into
your indestructible skillet, bread into your computerized toaster
and muffins into your oven, the one that cooks with light bulbs.
While you wait, you pay bills on your microwave, surf the Net on
your refrigerator and check your schedule on the command center
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen has long been the center of activity in most homes.
At every party and family powwow, it seems that most people end up
in the kitchen. That's where the bills gather, the soccer schedules
pile up and the kids' artwork gets stuck on the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers are finally acknowledging the kitchen's importance
by creating high-tech appliances and gadgets that could turn every
home chef into Julia Child.
</P>
<P>
   While many of these products are just prototypes with no
estimated time of arrival in a store near you, some of these
products, such as ``smart'' toasters and dishwashers, are already
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for that bag of microwave popcorn to finish popping?
Now, with NCR's Microwave Bank, you won't have to fritter away
those 2 1/2 minutes. This interesting contraption allows you to pay
bills, transfer money and check your account balances, all while
your microwave is humming away. It'll even let you surf the Net,
e-mail friends and watch TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the PC or TV, the microwave is in the kitchen, where
people get things done,'' says Stephen Emmot, director of NCR's
research center, the Knowledge Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Still only a prototype, the Microwave Bank works by voice
recognition and touch-screen technology. The Microwave Bank will
conjure up recipes and diet information. In fact, the more you use
it, the more the microwave will know about you. If it knows you're
buying low-fat ice cream, it may suggest you try skim milk, too.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd rather surf the Net on your refrigerator, Frigidaire
has developed the ScreenFridge, a prototype refrigerator with a
touch-screen PC monitor and bar-code scanner built into the
appliance door. In addition to surfing, you can use the scanner to
keep a computerized grocery list. When you finish off the last of
the milk, simply scan the bar code before tossing the carton. You
can set up the system to send your completed list directly to your
favorite grocery store, then have it deliver the goods to your
door.
</P>
<P>
   The PC unit can store recipes and household records as well as
function as a home message center with e-mail and household
management tools. The Italian company Merloni has developed a real
command center for home management called the Home Smart Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   It's basically a countertop computer screen in a sleek, silvery
frame. Use it to store recipes and cooking programs, leave messages
for family members and keep track of appointments, as well as send
e-mail and explore the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Smart Monitor also functions as a home network
terminal, keeping track of how well and how often your appliances
are functioning. Not all the high-tech kitchen creations are light
years away. Remember that Easy Bake Oven you had as a kid? That's
close to the concept behind the FlashBake oven from Wolf, due in
stores by early fall. The FlashBake uses a combination of visible
and infrared light to cook food. The oven is filled with halogen
bulbs. Computer-controlled ``thermal pulsing'' selectively projects
light both into and onto the food. The result is food that both
looks and tastes good.
</P>
<P>
   The FlashBake, which comes in both countertop and built-in
models, also includes sensors that can detect and adapt to
different types of cookware and an electronic cooking guide for
more than 100 foods.
</P>
<P>
   The counter model will retail for around $1,750; the wall model,
$1,895.
</P>
<P>
   If George Jetson were a chef, he would probably be sauteing and
broiling on Cybernox cookware. Billed as ``more durable than
steel,'' Cybernox has a special metal surface that is nonstick,
non-scratching and easy to clean. You can use steel wool pads and
metal utensils on the nearly indestructible surface. The cookware
can withstand temperatures up to 1,800 degrees, but the handle will
always stay cool.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor is supposedly enhanced because the cooking surface
heat-sears the food to seal in natural juices with less shrinkage.
Cybernox pans are currently available at specialty shops and sites
(such as www.dvorsons.com). Fry pans start at around $100.
</P>
<P>
   Other products already on the market include high-tech toasters,
refrigerators and dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton Beach has a line of IntelliToast toasters and toaster
ovens that feature microchip ``brains.'' With the microchip, if the
temperature rises faster than expected (if, for instance, you have
only one slice of bread in the toaster, instead of two) the
microchip notes the difference, and the toasting time is shortened.
The toasters range from $30 to $70.
</P>
<P>
   The Sub-Zero 700 Series line of refrigerators ($3,200 to $3,400)
features a microprocessor control panel that lets you program
specific temperatures for specific foods. Freshness is almost
guaranteed. But if your refrigerator door or drawer happens to
open, an alarm will sound to warn you.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag's Intellisense dishwasher (approximately $700) allegedly
senses how dirty your dishes are and sets the water temperature and
cycle accordingly. Outfitted with a computer control, it detects
the amount of food soil in the water every 10 seconds during the
wash. It monitors how well the detergent has dissolved and adjusts
for more time if you didn't add enough soap to begin with.

<P>
   If you thought the leading maker of cellular telephones was an
American company such as Motorola, think again. The leader in this
industry is Nokia _ and, no, it's not a Japanese company. Nokia is
based in Helsinki, Finland. You can learn about this upstart leader
in cellular technology in the August issue of Wired magazine. Not
only is Nokia leading in the sale of phones, it is introducing
wireless services such as Internet access faster than American
counterparts.

   It's finally here, the Mac version of ``SimCity 3000.'' The
eagerly awaited game began showing up in stores last week. The game

   Microprose's battling worms are back for their swan song.
``Worms Armageddon'' is the final title in a series of games in

the dreaded mole bomb. ``Worms Armageddon'' is available only for
PCs with Windows 95 or higher. Later, it will be released in a

 &HT;    Precautions can keep hackers out of your hard drive
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had a sure way of knowing when it was vacation time when I
lived in Oregon. My best friends _ Marcus and Betsy _ would start
looking for the keys to their house.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily they didn't lock the doors. It was that kind of a
town, a small place nestled in a little valley that ought to have
been on a postcard. It was if ``Leave It to Beaver'' were real.
Folks didn't need to lock their doors.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet used to be that way. But it has grown from a little
electronic community of people who either knew each other, or at
least had a lot in common, into a busy world that mirrors the
world, complete with saints, crooks and average folks. Nowadays
it's the sort of place where a person should lock the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Progress _ as it sometimes does _ has made things worse. More
and more of us, me included, are using connections like cable
modems that stay online 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the downside to that progress, you need to
understand how an Internet connection works. When you are logged on
to the Net through your provider, your computer is assigned an
address. Like addresses in the world of ``Leave It to Beaver,'' it
is a way for others to find you.
</P>
<P>
   My sermon for today is: There are some people out there who you
don't want to find you.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of addresses on the Net. One is called
dynamic _ it changes each time you log on. If you connect with a
regular analog modem over telephone lines, chances are that you
have a dynamic address.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a static address. For people who connect over cable
modems or other full-time connections, that's often the kind you
get. That address never changes.
</P>
<P>
   Why should you care?
</P>
<P>
   To break into your computer, a person needs to know your
address. Without it, there's no way. If you have an address that
changes each time you log on, a would-be cracker has only a limited
amount of time to figure a way into your computer. By the time he
does, you're offline. Next time you log on, you have a different
address.
</P>
<P>
   If the computer stays at the same address day and night, that
makes things easier. There are crackers who collect these permanent
addresses and _ sometimes just for the heck of it _ try to figure a
way into your computer.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of someone breaking into your computer are still
slim, but the odds of break-ins are going up.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, there are a lot of ``cookbook crackers'' who find
step-by-step directions for breaking into computers on the Net and
blindly follow them. The odds of a break-in have increased from
roughly the chances of winning the lottery to about the same as
having someone break into your home.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to prevent a break-in is to create a fire wall by
using a program designed for computer networks that provides a
security barrier against break-ins. As more and more of us go
online full time, increasing the chances of computer break-ins,
home fire walls are going to become more important.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of good networking programs are out there; one that seems
popular is called Wingate 3.0. It's also affordable _ about $40 for
three users.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this program _ and others like it _ are really
intended to be used on a network of home computers, they can be
used on a single machine, and have a built-in fire wall that will
help provide protection from invasion.
</P>
<P>
   You can read more about it on the Web at www.wingate
</P>
<P>
   .com/.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, if you decide to use it, it'll add another layer of
complexity to your computing. I wish we could just ignore that
stuff. But then, I also wish that I didn't need to lock my doors at
home.

 &HT;    Poll: Computers positive for kids
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe all those hours glued to the computer monitor are a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   A poll sponsored by FamilyPC magazine, the results of which were
published in the September issue, asked 615 families about the
effects of PC use on their kids. Most of those polled, 68 percent,
felt PC use made their kids smarter, but 13 percent said they
didn't think so. About 19 percent weren't sure.
</P>
<P>
   Most parents polled, 61 percent, said they thought computers
made their kids more creative as well. And 79 percent of the
parents polled said PCs helped their kids develop problem-solving
skills.
</P>
<P>
   One expert cited in the story thinks parents are doing their
kids a disservice by not teaching them how to understand the
intellectual culture computers carry and how to navigate the
digital divide between the haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the story are available at FamilyPC's Web site, www
</P>
<P>
   .zdnet.com/familypc/.
</P>
<P>
   Music on the Web has its own awards
</P>
<P>
   TV, CDs and magazines still dominate the music industry. But the
Internet might change all that.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Internet Life magazine stays a step ahead by conducting an
annual poll looking at the best the music industry has to offer the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1999 version of the magazine's Online Music Awards, the
guy who used to call himself Prince won for Best Net Single. The
former Prince used the Internet to distribute ``The War,'' a
20-minute single that was available from his Web site, www
</P>
<P>
   .love4oneanother.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah McLachlan won Best Net Album for adding ``to the glow of
online commerce to her reflective pop by distributing her live
album `Mirrorball' through an exclusive deal with Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Prince was among six musicians honored for having the
best official sites. The Beastie Boys' site, www.beastieboys.com,
won the category, followed by Tori Amos, www.tori
</P>
<P>
   .com; David Bowie, www.davidbowie.com; Marilyn Manson,
www.marilynmanson.net; and Public Enemy, www.public-enemy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites were noted for their excellence as reference
sources. Ultimate Band List, www.ubl.com, was voted the best for
music news, online radio and links to record labels. All-Music
Guide, www.allmusic.com, is one of the largest online music
reference books, including artist biographies, record reviews and
daily music news updates. International Lyrics Server,
www.lyrics.ch/index.htm, was also included.
</P>
<P>
   The August issue also lists a group of Incredibly Useful Sites.
This month's collection includes a nutrition analysis tool, www.ag
</P>
<P>
   .uiuc.edu/(tilde)food-lab/nat
</P>
<P>
   /mainnat.html, and a way to search for Web broadcasts,
realguide.real.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dissecting those cell phone pricing plans
</P>
<P>
   Have cellular phone prices dropped enough for you yet? Are the
inexpensive phones and even-less-expensive calling plans starting
to make you think about buying one?
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.point.com, is a way to cut through the details
of a multitude of calling plans out there and find one that suits
you.
</P>
<P>
   The site lets visitors sort plans by phone and by calling plan.
It searches both categories based on your ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   Point.com, formerly Wireless Dimension, searches 200 phone
models and 3,000 calling plans in 50 markets.
</P>
<P>
   New radar detector has its own compass
</P>
<P>
   Radar detectors are not quite as popular as they were in their
1980s prime, but the product keeps evolving. Precision Navigation
has developed what it claims to be the first radar/laser detector
with a built-in compass.
</P>
<P>
   The RX5000, which sells for about $200, weighs 6 ounces. The
device alerts drivers to all forms of radar. It has 360 degrees of
laser protection and warns drivers of road hazards, including
approaching emergency vehicles, roadwork and upcoming train
crossings, using a eight-digit text display.
</P>
<P>
   The compass displays direction with digits and cardinal points.

 &HT;    Gizmos 98 may have a useful one for you
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gizmos 98 is another one of those packages which, we are led to
believe, contain all the good stuff that Microsoft forgot to put
into Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. Depends upon what you want out of life, what you
want out of your computer, and whether you, like Play Inc., which
published this program, are chiefly interested in graphics. But to
take Microsoft's view, you've got to stop somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, there is one thing, or group of things, in this
package which Microsoft might well have put into the Windows
accessory package, and that's a calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Gizmos gives us a bunch of calendars _ weekly, monthly, yearly
and a single day. (Why a single day? Well, because that's how you
make and save your appointments.) My problem with the calendars is
my main problem with the whole thing _ they're ugly. But then, what
do I know?
</P>
<P>
   All right, let's enumerate all the things that Play Inc. thinks
Microsoft cheated us out of with Windows:
</P>
<P>
   _ Picture Explorer, which displays in thumbnail form all the
pictures in your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   _ A programmable CD music player.
</P>
<P>
   _ Four different clocks, each fancier and uglier than the last.
</P>
<P>
   _ All those calendars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six different card games, including ``Freecell'' and
solitaire. I prefer Windows' versions. I never heard of the other
four.
</P>
<P>
   _ A stupid jigsaw puzzle game. All jigsaw puzzle games are
stupid, by definition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Four calculators, each more complicated than the last. Not too
ugly, though.
</P>
<P>
   _ A program called Performer, which you can use to turn all
those pictures in your computer into a slide show, with fancy
effects and sound. Neat if you like that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   _ An incredibly annoying screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   _ A much-less-annoying screen saver that sends 360-degree
scenics scrolling across your screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ A color organ screen saver that adapts its incredibly annoying
pulsations to whatever music your programmable CD player is
playing.
</P>
<P>
   _ A video cube screen saver which will rotate a cube covered
with photographs of a young lady who is billed as the co-founder of
Play Inc.
</P>
<P>
   _ A security device called a Vault, into which you may drop
files and then password-lock the vault. Could be useful.
</P>
<P>
   _ A file shredder.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you think all that might be worth $50, go to
www.play.com and check it out further.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail: jwarner(at)ajc.com

   We want to hear from you but can't acknowledge every message.

 &HT;    Greetings! You have lots of choices
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've been on the Web any time at all, you've sent and
received an electronic greeting card.
</P>
<P>
   These cards started out years ago as crude little images and
some text, but nowadays you can send a card that includes music,
animation or even a photograph that you furnish.
</P>
<P>
   There are sites that charge for the service, but there are so
many free ones that we'll ignore the ``for pay'' sites today.
</P>
<P>
   One of the originals and still a site with one of the best
selections on the Web is called Blue Mountain. You'll find it at
www1.bluemountain.com/.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this is an overwhelming place. You'll find
cards for any holiday or occasion that you've ever heard of and
some that you haven't. Among them: Tartan Day, Lantern Festival,
Seijin-no-hi and the ever-popular Pig Day. But don't worry, there
are the more usual holidays, too, all in abundance, as well as
cards you can send for no particular reason.
</P>
<P>
   The site does a good job of walking you through the process of
making the card, personalizing it with your message, selecting
music and sending it. Each time you send a card here, the
information about the recipient _ name and e-mail address _ is
saved. That way, if you come back to send that same person another
card, you can just select the name from a menu and avoid filling in
all those blanks again.
</P>
<P>
   This site works like most of the rest we'll visit today. Once
you've selected the ``send'' function, your recipient will get an
e-mail notification of the card. To view it, he or she will go to a
special address on the Web and view the card via a browser.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most elaborate cards on the Web are at a site called
Regards.Com at www.regards.com/. Check out some of the animated
cards such as the one with a snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   On this site, you can use your own photograph to create a card.
The only qualification to using a photo _ and it's a big one _ is
that you must have your own Web site to stash the photo on. The
electronic card you send then links to that photo on your site.
</P>
<P>
   If nostalgia is your thing, you'll enjoy a place called
Wanderer's Nostalgic 50s-60s Card Shop. The themes include old soda
fountains and Coke machines, small-town parades, pin-ups (they're
G-rated) and the like. You can also add music to your card here.
Naturally enough you can select from a jukebox list that includes
``Johnny Be Good,'' ``Rock Around the Clock'' and ``Shake Rattle
and Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll find it at www
</P>
<P>
   .wanderers.com/wander
</P>
<P>
   /card/.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how long you've been around the Web, no matter how
many cybercards you've sent and received, you probably haven't seen
a Moose-O-Gram. These animated cards _ found at
www.geocities.com/SoHo
</P>
<P>
   /Coffeehouse/2804
</P>
<P>
   /mooseograms/newmoose
</P>
<P>
   .html _ are really fun. You can send a Skunk Love card that will
never be forgotten. While wacky, all these cards are in good taste.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you want to get a little mushy, take a look at
Lovegrams.com at www.lovegrams.com/postcards/index.shtml. There are
some sweetly sophisticated cards here. And, for those of you who
need a little extra help, some cards come complete with love notes
in the form of poetry.

 &HT;    Slimmed-down, lighter PowerBook
 &HT;    is a big step in the right direction
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to speed and processing power, Apple's laptops are
the equal of any PC counterpart. But one important area where
PowerBooks have lagged is in size and weight.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, bigger is not better. The typical PowerBook weighs
8 pounds _too bulky to comfortably lug through airports.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has started to correct this problem with its latest
PowerBook. The laptop is about a third of an inch thinner than its
predecessors. That not only makes this PowerBook easier to grip but
reduces the weight. This slimmer PowerBook weighs 5.9 pounds with
the battery and CD-ROM drive loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the reduction in weight, the PowerBook is not the
lightest laptop on the market. Not by a long shot. But the new G3
PowerBook does represent a big step in the right direction for
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   While slimmed down, the new PowerBook hasn't surrendered
anything in terms of power and speed. It comes in two souped-up
models, a 333-megahertz G3 microprocessor and a 400-MHz G3
microprocessor. Either is among the fastest laptops out there.
</P>
<P>
   Both models also include a 14.1-inch active matrix color screen
and a 56k modem. They also support the new DVD portable drives.
</P>
<P>
   Another important advance with this PowerBook is longer battery
life. Apple claims the battery will last five hours. Testing by
MacWorld magazine showed the battery lasted three hours under
normal working conditions. That's still an improvement over
previous batteries.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing from the new PowerBook is any kind of portable
storage device such as a floppy or Zip drive. That has become true
even for many of Apple's desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you're already a PowerBook user, don't think you can use
your old portable drives with the new G3. They won't work in the
new, slimmer body. You'll have to buy new drives, available for
around $230.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with the slim PowerBook is the lack of adequate
RAM, or internal memory. You get 64 megabytes, but that is barely
sufficient these days. That figure is about half of what is
standard with most PC laptops.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a new problem. Apple has always included insufficient
RAM with its computers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these problems, the new, slimmer G3 PowerBooks are smart
computers that pack a lot of power. They're selling in the catalogs
for between $2,500 and $3,500.

 &HT;    `Blair Witch' horror spreading rapidly
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are several ways to know when you've hit the Internet big
time. The first is when Yahoo creates a separate category of
collected stories and links. Then come the online shopping
opportunities. When you've really made it, the third element, fan
pages and parodies, start popping up.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's cult horror film sensation ``The Blair Witch
Project'' has all three, in quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you've been lost in the woods for the last month or so,
you'll know that the low-budget horror flick ``The Blair Witch
Project'' has virtually taken the country by storm. It's the story
of three college students, Heather, Mike and Josh, who head into
the Maryland wilderness in search of the legendary ``Blair Witch.''
We all know they don't come back, but they live on all over the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, you can read reviews online. There isn't a Web
site out there from Salon to the Canadian Broadcasting Co. that
doesn't have an opinion. The New York Times' Janet Maslin says the
overabundance of profanity makes the film hard on the ears. Salon's
Mary Elizabeth Williams calls the film a ``fascinating and
unforgettable mystery'' but wonders in her review: ``Why does
Heather pack a book called `How to Stay Alive in the Woods' and
then never use it? And why, even when they're running away in
terror, do they take their cameras everywhere?''
</P>
<P>
   Good questions all, but totally beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' is all about the Internet. It's
about dinner parties that grind to a halt when someone mentions
there is a Web site for the movie that's ``scary as hell.'' Imagine
a house full of party guests all hunched over a personal computer
waiting for the ``Blair Witch'' movie trailers to load. Imagine the
silence as a room full of people watch _ for the first time and
without the benefit of commentary from The New York Times or Salon
_ the now-famous shot of Heather's tear-filled eyes apologizing to
Josh and Mike and whispering ``I love you, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Better than any in-theater trailer, better than any review,
better than any cover story in Entertainment Weekly, this
voyeuristic peek into the ``Blair Witch'' story (www
</P>
<P>
   .blairwitchproject.com) evokes the eerie feeling you get when
you stumble onto the personal Web page of someone you don't know.
The ``Blair Witch'' site brings out that same ``I don't know who
this girl is, but I can't stop watching'' feeling.
</P>
<P>
   In the trade, they call this guerrilla marketing. As the saying
goes, ``You tell two friends and they tell two friends and so on
and so on ...'' And boy, if you do it right, it sure does work.
Just take a look at the box office receipts. But that's not where
the Internet story ends. Not by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   As if the movie's own Web site didn't leave you feeling more
than a little creeped-out, there are many more sights devoted to
what is not only a movie but a bona fide Internet phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The official site will show you all the audiotapes, film cans
and other miscellaneous items left by the vanished students, but
once the filmmakers knew they had a hit on their hands, they
amazingly recovered one more piece of valuable material _ the
compilation tape left in Josh Leonard's car. Available to order or
just listen to at www.chapteriii.com
</P>
<P>
   /blairwitch/music.htm, it's a pretty gloomy collection of tunes.
Perhaps Josh was just trying to get into the mood for his
supernatural and ultimately doomed adventure.
</P>
<P>
   There are many fan sites devoted to the movie, and it's not hard
to find them. One site, Camorgan's Cabin in the Woods
(camorgan.freeservers.com), includes a plea from the Frederick
County Sheriff's Office asking fans to stop looking for souvenirs
in the local graveyards, wooded areas and so on. The site redirects
you to blairwitchdirect
</P>
<P>
   .com/shop/catalog.asp, where you can buy everything from a
``Heather close-up magnet'' to a missing persons poster.
</P>
<P>
   But while the official sites for this movie are very good, you
really won't get the Web experience until you start investigating
some of the fan pages built to talk about or elaborate upon the
movie's premise. Many ``Blair Witch'' fans have spent a lot of
creative time and energy working on sites to complement the film.
Eileene Coscolluela has a terrific list of links on her beautifully
designed if sparse site, www
</P>
<P>
   .woolgathering.net/blairwitch
</P>
<P>
   /links.html.
</P>
<P>
   So much attention to the movie on the Web and the hordes of
people taking it seriously leaves the movie wide open to Web
parodies. Children of the '70s will especially like the campy
``Blair Warner Project'' (www.geocities
</P>
<P>
   .com/SunsetStrip/Lounge
</P>
<P>
   /3027/Blair.html). The site chronicles the disappearance of
Blair Warner, the rich, blonde, preppy character on the '70s sitcom
``The Facts of Life.'' It's a clever takeoff on the original movie
and worth checking out if just to see how much of an Internet event
this movie really is.

 &HT;    Brains at MIT dream up gadgets for your kitchen
 &HT;    SIDEBAR TO TECHKITCHEN
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a long way from home ec class in high school, but the Media
Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the way
in the high-tech kitchen realm. Here's a look at some of the work
under way by students and professors who are part of MIT's Counter
Intelligence project:
</P>
<P>
   _ Counter Intelligence: The namesake of the whole project,
Counter Intelligence is a kitchen countertop that walks you through
recipes. The system uses a bar-code scanner, scales, a keyboard and
a computer screen. It ``knows'' recipes, identifies ingredients
from digital tags on the packages and can even suggest
substitutions if you run out of a key ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   _ MicroChef: Originally called ``PC Dinners,'' this is basically
a microwave with a bar-code scanner, controlled by a computer. The
bar code gives the computer cooking information as well as a sound
file. French toast, for example, tells the user, ``Pliz remove zee
toast from zee packet and put it in zee microwave, s'il vous
plait.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mr. Java: This intelligent espresso coffee machine reads
instructions from a chip embedded in your coffee cup, transmitting
the information to a computer to make the appropriate drink. It
also transmits your musical preferences so you can listen to your
favorite radio station while your coffee is perking. Mr. Java keeps
track of how much coffee you drink each week, so you can monitor
your caffeine consumption and plan your purchases.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talking oven mitt: Wired with sensors and a voice microchip,
this mitt can tell when your cookies are done and your bread is
baked just by touching it to the pan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Digital nose: Originally developed for drug enforcement
agencies to help track down illegal substances hidden in baggage,
this nose can suggest what spices to sprinkle in your food.
</P>
<P>
   _ Food laser: Say goodbye to sloppily sliced bagels. This
special culinary laser does the work of a million Ginsu knives, and
it can also be used to write cooking instructions on food.

   `Smart' kitchen appliances are proliferating, with e-mail and
Web access on the horizon
</P>
<P>
   WITH SIDEBAR, PHOTOS and LAYOUT
</P>
<P>
   By Mary Jo DiLonardo
</P>
<P>
   c, 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this.
</P>
<P>
   You walk into your kitchen to start breakfast. You pop eggs into
your indestructible skillet, bread into your computerized toaster
and muffins into your oven, the one that cooks with light bulbs.
While you wait, you pay bills on your microwave, surf the Net on
your refrigerator and check your schedule on the command center
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen has long been the center of activity in most homes.
At every party and family powwow, it seems that most people end up
in the kitchen. That's where the bills gather, the soccer schedules
pile up and the kids' artwork gets stuck on the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers are finally acknowledging the kitchen's importance
by creating high-tech appliances and gadgets that could turn every
home chef into Julia Child.
</P>
<P>
   While many of these products are just prototypes with no
estimated time of arrival in a store near you, some of these
products, such as ``smart'' toasters and dishwashers, are already
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for that bag of microwave popcorn to finish popping?
Now, with NCR's Microwave Bank, you won't have to fritter away
those 2 1/2 minutes. This interesting contraption allows you to pay
bills, transfer money and check your account balances, all while
your microwave is humming away. It'll even let you surf the Net,
e-mail friends and watch TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the PC or TV, the microwave is in the kitchen, where
people get things done,'' says Stephen Emmot, director of NCR's
research center, the Knowledge Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Still only a prototype, the Microwave Bank works by voice
recognition and touch-screen technology. The Microwave Bank will
conjure up recipes and diet information. In fact, the more you use
it, the more the microwave will know about you. If it knows you're
buying low-fat ice cream, it may suggest you try skim milk, too.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd rather surf the Net on your refrigerator, Frigidaire
has developed the ScreenFridge, a prototype refrigerator with a
touch-screen PC monitor and bar-code scanner built into the
appliance door. In addition to surfing, you can use the scanner to
keep a computerized grocery list. When you finish off the last of
the milk, simply scan the bar code before tossing the carton. You
can set up the system to send your completed list directly to your
favorite grocery store, then have it deliver the goods to your
door.
</P>
<P>
   The PC unit can store recipes and household records as well as
function as a home message center with e-mail and household
management tools. The Italian company Merloni has developed a real
command center for home management called the Home Smart Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   It's basically a countertop computer screen in a sleek, silvery
frame. Use it to store recipes and cooking programs, leave messages
for family members and keep track of appointments, as well as send
e-mail and explore the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Smart Monitor also functions as a home network
terminal, keeping track of how well and how often your appliances
are functioning. Not all the high-tech kitchen creations are light
years away. Remember that Easy Bake Oven you had as a kid? That's
close to the concept behind the FlashBake oven from Wolf, due in
stores by early fall. The FlashBake uses a combination of visible
and infrared light to cook food. The oven is filled with halogen
bulbs. Computer-controlled ``thermal pulsing'' selectively projects
light both into and onto the food. The result is food that both
looks and tastes good.
</P>
<P>
   The FlashBake, which comes in both countertop and built-in
models, also includes sensors that can detect and adapt to
different types of cookware and an electronic cooking guide for
more than 100 foods.
</P>
<P>
   The counter model will retail for around $1,750; the wall model,
$1,895.
</P>
<P>
   If George Jetson were a chef, he would probably be sauteing and
broiling on Cybernox cookware. Billed as ``more durable than
steel,'' Cybernox has a special metal surface that is nonstick,
non-scratching and easy to clean. You can use steel wool pads and
metal utensils on the nearly indestructible surface. The cookware
can withstand temperatures up to 1,800 degrees, but the handle will
always stay cool.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor is supposedly enhanced because the cooking surface
heat-sears the food to seal in natural juices with less shrinkage.
Cybernox pans are currently available at specialty shops and sites
(such as www.dvorsons.com). Fry pans start at around $100.
</P>
<P>
   Other products already on the market include high-tech toasters,
refrigerators and dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton Beach has a line of IntelliToast toasters and toaster
ovens that feature microchip ``brains.'' With the microchip, if the
temperature rises faster than expected (if, for instance, you have
only one slice of bread in the toaster, instead of two) the
microchip notes the difference, and the toasting time is shortened.
The toasters range from $30 to $70.
</P>
<P>
   The Sub-Zero 700 Series line of refrigerators ($3,200 to $3,400)
features a microprocessor control panel that lets you program
specific temperatures for specific foods. Freshness is almost
guaranteed. But if your refrigerator door or drawer happens to
open, an alarm will sound to warn you.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag's Intellisense dishwasher (approximately $700) allegedly
senses how dirty your dishes are and sets the water temperature and
cycle accordingly. Outfitted with a computer control, it detects
the amount of food soil in the water every 10 seconds during the
wash. It monitors how well the detergent has dissolved and adjusts
for more time if you didn't add enough soap to begin with.

 &HT;    Finland's Nokia pacesetter in cellular
 &HT;    By. Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you thought the leading maker of cellular telephones was an
American company such as Motorola, think again. The leader in this
industry is Nokia _ and, no, it's not a Japanese company. Nokia is
based in Helsinki, Finland. You can learn about this upstart leader
in cellular technology in the August issue of Wired magazine. Not
only is Nokia leading in the sale of phones, it is introducing
wireless services such as Internet access faster than American
counterparts.

   It's finally here, the Mac version of ``SimCity 3000.'' The
eagerly awaited game began showing up in stores last week. The game
was released for the Windows platform a year ago. ``SimCity 3000''
is the latest in the series of city-building simulations. This
version features enhanced graphics, hundreds of new buildings and a
close-up view that lets you view a city at street level.

   Microprose's battling worms are back for their swan song.
``Worms Armageddon'' is the final title in a series of games in

the dreaded mole bomb. ``Worms Armageddon'' is available only for
PCs with Windows 95 or higher. Later, it will be released in a
version for Sony PlayStation.

 &HT;    Precautions can keep hackers out of your hard drive
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had a sure way of knowing when it was vacation time when I
lived in Oregon. My best friends _ Marcus and Betsy _ would start
looking for the keys to their house.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily they didn't lock the doors. It was that kind of a
town, a small place nestled in a little valley that ought to have
been on a postcard. It was if ``Leave It to Beaver'' were real.
Folks didn't need to lock their doors.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet used to be that way. But it has grown from a little
electronic community of people who either knew each other, or at
least had a lot in common, into a busy world that mirrors the
world, complete with saints, crooks and average folks. Nowadays
it's the sort of place where a person should lock the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Progress _ as it sometimes does _ has made things worse. More
and more of us, me included, are using connections like cable
modems that stay online 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the downside to that progress, you need to
understand how an Internet connection works. When you are logged on
to the Net through your provider, your computer is assigned an
address. Like addresses in the world of ``Leave It to Beaver,'' it
is a way for others to find you.
</P>
<P>
   My sermon for today is: There are some people out there who you
don't want to find you.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of addresses on the Net. One is called
dynamic _ it changes each time you log on. If you connect with a
regular analog modem over telephone lines, chances are that you
have a dynamic address.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a static address. For people who connect over cable
modems or other full-time connections, that's often the kind you
get. That address never changes.
</P>
<P>
   Why should you care?
</P>
<P>
   To break into your computer, a person needs to know your
address. Without it, there's no way. If you have an address that
changes each time you log on, a would-be cracker has only a limited
amount of time to figure a way into your computer. By the time he
does, you're offline. Next time you log on, you have a different
address.
</P>
<P>
   If the computer stays at the same address day and night, that
makes things easier. There are crackers who collect these permanent
addresses and _ sometimes just for the heck of it _ try to figure a
way into your computer.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of someone breaking into your computer are still
slim, but the odds of break-ins are going up.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, there are a lot of ``cookbook crackers'' who find
step-by-step directions for breaking into computers on the Net and
blindly follow them. The odds of a break-in have increased from
roughly the chances of winning the lottery to about the same as
having someone break into your home.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to prevent a break-in is to create a fire wall by
using a program designed for computer networks that provides a
security barrier against break-ins. As more and more of us go
online full time, increasing the chances of computer break-ins,
home fire walls are going to become more important.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of good networking programs are out there; one that seems
popular is called Wingate 3.0. It's also affordable _ about $40 for
three users.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this program _ and others like it _ are really
intended to be used on a network of home computers, they can be
used on a single machine, and have a built-in fire wall that will
help provide protection from invasion.
</P>
<P>
   You can read more about it on the Web at www.wingate
</P>
<P>
   .com/.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, if you decide to use it, it'll add another layer of
complexity to your computing. I wish we could just ignore that
stuff. But then, I also wish that I didn't need to lock my doors at
home.

 &HT;    Poll: Computers positive for kids
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe all those hours glued to the computer monitor are a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   A poll sponsored by FamilyPC magazine, the results of which were
published in the September issue, asked 615 families about the
effects of PC use on their kids. Most of those polled, 68 percent,
felt PC use made their kids smarter, but 13 percent said they
didn't think so. About 19 percent weren't sure.
</P>
<P>
   Most parents polled, 61 percent, said they thought computers
made their kids more creative as well. And 79 percent of the
parents polled said PCs helped their kids develop problem-solving
skills.
</P>
<P>
   One expert cited in the story thinks parents are doing their
kids a disservice by not teaching them how to understand the
intellectual culture computers carry and how to navigate the
digital divide between the haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the story are available at FamilyPC's Web site, www
</P>
<P>
   .zdnet.com/familypc/.
</P>
<P>
   Music on the Web has its own awards
</P>
<P>
   TV, CDs and magazines still dominate the music industry. But the
Internet might change all that.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Internet Life magazine stays a step ahead by conducting an
annual poll looking at the best the music industry has to offer the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1999 version of the magazine's Online Music Awards, the
guy who used to call himself Prince won for Best Net Single. The
former Prince used the Internet to distribute ``The War,'' a
20-minute single that was available from his Web site, www
</P>
<P>
   .love4oneanother.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah McLachlan won Best Net Album for adding ``to the glow of
online commerce to her reflective pop by distributing her live
album `Mirrorball' through an exclusive deal with Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Prince was among six musicians honored for having the
best official sites. The Beastie Boys' site, www.beastieboys.com,
won the category, followed by Tori Amos, www.tori
</P>
<P>
   .com; David Bowie, www.davidbowie.com; Marilyn Manson,
www.marilynmanson.net; and Public Enemy, www.public-enemy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites were noted for their excellence as reference
sources. Ultimate Band List, www.ubl.com, was voted the best for
music news, online radio and links to record labels. All-Music
Guide, www.allmusic.com, is one of the largest online music
reference books, including artist biographies, record reviews and
daily music news updates. International Lyrics Server,
www.lyrics.ch/index.htm, was also included.
</P>
<P>
   The August issue also lists a group of Incredibly Useful Sites.
This month's collection includes a nutrition analysis tool, www.ag
</P>
<P>
   .uiuc.edu/(tilde)food-lab/nat
</P>
<P>
   /mainnat.html, and a way to search for Web broadcasts,
realguide.real.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dissecting those cell phone pricing plans
</P>
<P>
   Have cellular phone prices dropped enough for you yet? Are the
inexpensive phones and even-less-expensive calling plans starting
to make you think about buying one?
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.point.com, is a way to cut through the details
of a multitude of calling plans out there and find one that suits
you.
</P>
<P>
   The site lets visitors sort plans by phone and by calling plan.
It searches both categories based on your ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   Point.com, formerly Wireless Dimension, searches 200 phone
models and 3,000 calling plans in 50 markets.

   New radar detector has its own compass
</P>
<P>
   Radar detectors are not quite as popular as they were in their
1980s prime, but the product keeps evolving. Precision Navigation
has developed what it claims to be the first radar/laser detector
with a built-in compass.
</P>
<P>
   The RX5000, which sells for about $200, weighs 6 ounces. The
device alerts drivers to all forms of radar. It has 360 degrees of
laser protection and warns drivers of road hazards, including
approaching emergency vehicles, roadwork and upcoming train
crossings, using a eight-digit text display.
</P>
<P>
   The compass displays direction with digits and cardinal points.

COMMENTARY: DAWDLING ON JUDGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (gm) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Saturday Aug. 16:
</P>
<P>
   A year has gone by since Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
deploring the backlog in untried cases, pleaded with the Senate to
act in a timely and orderly way on President Clinton's nominees for
the federal bench. In response, the Senate began to make progress
in reducing judicial vacancies. But its recent record is
indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   Since January Clinton has nominated 61 judicial candidates. Yet
the Senate in that time has confirmed only 11 judges, and reported
only 13 more out of committee. This record is all the more
dismaying in that Clinton has bent over backward _ too far,
arguably, in certain instances _ to accommodate the preferences of
GOP senators for district court slots. The result is that dozens of
qualified candidates have been left dangling, including a
disproportionate number of women and minority candidates, and the
court system's ability to deliver justice continues to be impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to assertions by the Judiciary Committee chairman,
Orrin Hatch, that he is moving rapidly, the record shows that the
Republican Senate has approved many fewer judges than a Democratic
Senate did during the comparable phase of George Bush's Presidency.
Clinton has promised to press the Senate to act on his judicial
nominees in an expeditious fashion when it returns from the August
recess. He must do so, of course, but the real problem lies with
Hatch and his obstructionist colleagues. Somebody ought to tell him
and other Republican leaders that they are embarrassing their
party.

 &HT;    Gizmos 98 may have a useful one for you
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gizmos 98 is another one of those packages which, we are led to
believe, contain all the good stuff that Microsoft forgot to put
into Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. Depends upon what you want out of life, what you
want out of your computer, and whether you, like Play Inc., which
published this program, are chiefly interested in graphics. But to
take Microsoft's view, you've got to stop somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, there is one thing, or group of things, in this
package which Microsoft might well have put into the Windows
accessory package, and that's a calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Gizmos gives us a bunch of calendars _ weekly, monthly, yearly
and a single day. (Why a single day? Well, because that's how you
make and save your appointments.) My problem with the calendars is
my main problem with the whole thing _ they're ugly. But then, what
do I know?
</P>
<P>
   All right, let's enumerate all the things that Play Inc. thinks
Microsoft cheated us out of with Windows:
</P>
<P>
   _ Picture Explorer, which displays in thumbnail form all the
pictures in your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   _ A programmable CD music player.
</P>
<P>
   _ Four different clocks, each fancier and uglier than the last.
</P>
<P>
   _ All those calendars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six different card games, including ``Freecell'' and
solitaire. I prefer Windows' versions. I never heard of the other
four.
</P>
<P>
   _ A stupid jigsaw puzzle game. All jigsaw puzzle games are
stupid, by definition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Four calculators, each more complicated than the last. Not too
ugly, though.
</P>
<P>
   _ A program called Performer, which you can use to turn all
those pictures in your computer into a slide show, with fancy
effects and sound. Neat if you like that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   _ An incredibly annoying screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   _ A much-less-annoying screen saver that sends 360-degree
scenics scrolling across your screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ A color organ screen saver that adapts its incredibly annoying
pulsations to whatever music your programmable CD player is
playing.
</P>
<P>
   _ A video cube screen saver which will rotate a cube covered
with photographs of a young lady who is billed as the co-founder of
Play Inc.
</P>
<P>
   _ A security device called a Vault, into which you may drop
files and then password-lock the vault. Could be useful.
</P>
<P>
   _ A file shredder.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you think all that might be worth $50, go to
www.play.com and check it out further.

 &HT;    TALL TALES &AMP; SHORT STORIES: Hungary's place in the world
 &HT;    (Eds: Ninth in a series. Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
reported from Eastern Europe during a visit 10 years ago, just
before the fall of the Berlin Wall. This summer he returned to
write about the changes that have led three former Eastern Bloc
countries _ Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland _ to become the
newest members of NATO. At the end of the series, CoxNet will

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ To hear Robin Marshall tell it, Hungarians don't know
beans about bangers and beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to get the good English-style sausage,''
lamented Marshall, managing editor of the British-owned weekly
Budapest Sun, Hungary's only English-language newspaper. ``What
they call sausage is a frankfurter.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's pretty much the extent of his complaints as a Brit in
Budapest. Otherwise . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very smart, and they like people to know it,''
Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the old states of Christendom, Hungarians think of
themselves as European _ not Central European or Eastern European,
but what Marshall calls ``Old Europe, what Europe is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Being designated Central or Eastern doesn't offend them. Still,
he advised, ``Be careful of the word you use.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're `discovering themselves,' that's OK. Just don't tell
them they're `emerging.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for ``developing'' and, Marshall said, ``anything
that suggests that they were in any way backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, they have been `held back during the period of
communism.' That's perfectly acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Political correctness on the Danube, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, 32, who has been here 1 1/2 years, has a fondness for
three-piece suits and is blessed with Hugh Grant good looks. He
finds plenty to like about Budapest. It's not at all what
first-time visitors may have envisioned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though Budapest has a reputation for its stunning
architecture, at the same time people expect it to be drab, gray
and grim due to the communist era, with food lines and lots of
goulash.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so. ``Pretty much anything you could get in the U.K. you can
get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall has adjusted. So has his dog, a greyhound he brought
from England. And well the dog should feel at home. In this city of
2 million people, its canine population amounts to more than
200,000, one of the highest concentrations in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Good people, good dogs. Good allies, too, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   During the Kosovo war, ``the paper was actually criticized for
not being totally pro-NATO. We ran some stories from the Serb
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was an unsettling period for Hungarians, and they were
less enthusiastic the longer the campaign went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially the older generation who has memories of communist
tanks rumbling through the streets. At the same time you had the
possibility of NATO tanks rolling across the border from the
direction of Germany. It's not an image that fits comfortably for a
country trying to make a place for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that Hungary, unlike any other NATO country,
borders Yugoslavia, and the Hungarian minority in Serbia numbers as
many as 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Historical note: Hungary has never won a war. With Hungary as a
member of NATO, the joke among Hungarians was, ``Well, that cinches
the war for Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   So why should the U.S. care about Hungary? Why should it be
important to the West?
</P>
<P>
   Three good reasons, he said:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hungary is the gateway both for goods into the old Soviet bloc
and also for cheap labor flooding into Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is the country that has to guard the borders, and globally
it has to set the example for such countries as Romania, Yugoslavia
and Ukraine that a market economy does work.
</P>
<P>
   _ And it has to disseminate those ideas about democracy, about
peace and about living together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will become important,'' he said, ``whether you like it or
not.''

 &HT;    Spy, run _ capture the flag
 &HT;    By Theresa Walsh Giarrusso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer's almost over, but there's still time for some excellent
games of capture the flag. We're not talking about the lazy-man
computer version. We're talking about the get-outside,
run-hard-and-sweat version.
</P>
<P>
   But first you need some basic rules.
</P>
<P>
   You need at least six people, who will split up into two teams,
and two rags to use as flags. Feel free to add additional players;
the more the merrier.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the game is to run behind enemy lines and bring
the other team's flag back to your side. While you're trying to
capture the other flag, your teammates will defend your own flag,
as well as rescue players put in ``jail'' on the enemy's side.
</P>
<P>
   You need a space at least 30 feet long, divided across the
middle into two sides. Woods are best, because they make it harder
to find the flag.
</P>
<P>
   The flag, however, must be placed out in the open. It can't be
tied to a tree limb or buried. But it doesn't have to be really
easy to spot. (Kind of like a hidden Easter egg.)
</P>
<P>
   After both sides have placed their flags, you're ready to start.
Some players should go in search of the other team's flag. You must
be fast or quiet, because once you cross the center line, the other
team can tag you and send you to ``jail.'' The jail can be anywhere
on your enemy's side of the field. Your teammate will have to tag
you to set you free.
</P>
<P>
   You should leave some players on your side to guard the flag. If
someone grabs the flag but then gets tagged before he crosses the
center line, the flag goes back to its original spot.
</P>
<P>
   The game is over when somebody steals the flag and takes it
across the center line.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to change the rules if you'd like _ but you shouldn't
change them in the middle of a game.

 &HT;    NEWSFLASH
 &HT;    Do your favorite programs show kids of different races?
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many people, television is like a mirror. When they watch
their favorite shows, they expect to see characters who look like
them.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, a civil rights group called the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) said that
many programs on the big TV networks do a bad job of showing people
from different races and backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP said the actors on TV shows for grown-ups should be
more diverse _ they should reflect the different kinds of Americans
who watch television.
</P>
<P>
   The group noticed that there are very few black people or other
minorities on ``prime-time'' programs. Prime time is between 8 p.m.
and 11 p.m. on weeknights, when the most adults watch television.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the shows for kids? How diverse are cartoons and
live-action programs aimed at children?
</P>
<P>
   News For Kids found that, out of 165 shows on nine of the major
broadcast and cable TV networks, 45 of them have diverse casts.
That's about 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Besides presenting characters of different races, networks can
reflect diversity in other ways. Some team up different animals,
such as ``Cow and Chicken'' on the Cartoon Network. Some present
actors who speak with accents, such as the Southerners in ``The
Famous Jett Jackson'' on Disney. And others use fantastic creatures
that no one has seen before (``Pokemon'' on Kids' WB!).
</P>
<P>
   We talked to the men and women in charge of children's programs,
and they all agreed that showing different kinds of people is a
good idea that's also good for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to reflect the world of kids,'' says Herb Scannell,
the president of Nickelodeon. The cable network's shows include one
starring a teenage Asian-American private eye (``The Mystery Files
of Shelby Woo'') and ``Kenan and Kel,'' which stars two
African-Americans. ``Kids live in a more diverse world than the one
most adults grew up in,'' Scannell says.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Poindexter, vice president for programming at Fox Kids,
says that showing diversity can help people learn to live together.
``People need to see that others who are different ethnically and
racially are just as much Americans as they are,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Friedman, a vice president at Kids' WB!, says she always
looks for shows that give the network a chance to reach different
types of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detention,'' a new cartoon on the WB this fall, is about a
racially mixed bunch of not-so-perfect students who keep getting
into trouble at school.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Langasch, 12, of Cobb County says it doesn't matter to her
what the actors and cartoon characters on her favorite shows look
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like characters who are always happy and nice to people,''
says Julia, a seventh-grader at McCleskey Middle School. ``One of
my favorite shows is `Doug,' and he's a tan color but his friend is
green.''
</P>
<P>
   But Herman Cannon Jr., 10, who lives in southwest Atlanta, says
he wishes there were more black people on the shows he likes to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see some, but not a whole lot,'' says Herman, a fifth-grader
at Peyton Forest Elementary School. ``It doesn't make me feel bad,
but it makes me think why they aren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Simensky, who is in charge of original animation at the
Cartoon Network in Atlanta, said she wants diverse shows that
appeal to viewers like Herman, and all children his age. For
example, the Cartoon Network's ``Waynehead'' is about a black kid
with a disability, and ``Dexter's Lab'' is about a boy scientist
who speaks with a German accent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Simensky says the network has a hard time finding people
who want to make cartoons about racially diverse communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the people who are the creators of the cartoons to be
diverse, but most of the animators today are white,'' she says.
``There are not many African-Americans, and few Asian-Americans.
But I think that's going to change as more young people get into
this business.''

 &HT;    Don't blame Big Bird for PBS list scandal
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stop picking on Big Bird! He's a toddler, for crying out loud,
as are all the Muppets on ``Sesame Street.'' They're too young to
vote, and they don't belong to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The latest fracas surrounds the report last month that some PBS
stations have sold their donor lists to the Democratic Party. This
prompted an immediate attack from U.S. Rep. W.J. Tauzin, R-La.,
chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shakes the foundation of public broadcasting and
undermines the integrity of PBS,'' Tauzin said in a recent Los
Angeles Times article.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really. As a matter of fact, it has nothing to do with
the integrity of PBS. It's a bogus controversy that will be used
against PBS when Congress reconvenes in the fall to mull the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   First, a quick look at the facts. In mid-July, Tauzin's
subcommittee was told that several PBS stations, including WGBH in
Boston and WNET in New York, had passed their donor lists to the
Democratic National Committee. An investigation found that about 25
to 30 of PBS's 349 stations had done the same thing, but two
important mitigating factors were not immediately revealed.
</P>
<P>
   All of the stations in question were using third-party list
brokers, as many nonprofit organizations do, and weren't aware that
the lists were being shared or rented. Perhaps the most important
factor, however, is the nonpolitical nature of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ill-advised but bipartisan behavior,'' PBS president
Ervin S. Duggan said. ``No station should do anything that would
call into question its independence or impartiality, but this was
not about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The first revelation concerned list-sharing with the Democratic
Committee, but it was later learned that the Dole '96 campaign, the
conservative think-tank Heritage Foundation and other Republican
organizations were involved, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any attempt to make this seem like a one-party affair would be
a distortion of reality,'' Duggan said. ``List brokers and
fund-raisers in public TV have been quite indifferent to political
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, public television's sometimes desperate search for
money, prompted by the ever-dwindling federal support, has nothing
to do with programming. Fund-raising departments at PBS and major
producing stations like WGBH and WNET, according to Duggan, are
separate from production and editorial operation.
</P>
<P>
   Citing shows like Armistad Maupin's ``Tales of the City,'' a
popular miniseries that included gay characters, critics have long
harped at PBS's supposedly left-leaning, liberal bias.
</P>
<P>
   But these critics fail to mention that former Reagan and Bush
(the elder) speechwriter Peggy Noonan has a PBS show, as does
conservative John McLaughlin. ``Great Performances'' and
``Masterpiece Theatre'' have no political agenda; nor does ``Nova''
or ``Rumpole of the Bailey.'' Is David Attenborough a Democrat or a
Republican? Nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the actions of the stations' list
brokers were ill-advised, but the scandal shouldn't cast a
permanent pall over PBS.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the scandal broke, PBS told its stations that the
practice must stop. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which
oversees federal money for public TV, said no funds will be given
to any station unless they certify they are not exchanging or
renting their lists. Stations also were told they must put in place
privacy policies that assure donors there will be no unauthorized
use of their names.
</P>
<P>
   Some people argue that PBS should wean itself of federal
support. PBS has made strides in producing revenue beyond corporate
grants. Last year it raked in almost $85 million in sales of videos
and catalog merchandise, and next year it will enter the audio
recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   But now is not the time to end federal funding, which only
accounts for a meager 14 percent of the overall PBS budget anyway.
Right now, PBS stations are struggling with the huge expense of
readying themselves for digital transmission. To do that, they need
federal support.
</P>
<P>
   Will the donor list flap cause damage to public perception and
government support?
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin's subcommittee undoubtedly will raise questions, but
Duggan, PBS's eternal optimist, doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we put this issue in perspective and understand the
arm's length nature of list broker relationships, if we reform and
ban this practice, and if we make it clear that this does not touch
the editorial or production operations of our stations, we will
maintain the trust and esteem that is so important to us,'' Duggan
said. ``There is no need to punish by restricting the funding of
this national educational and cultural institution.''

<P>
   EDs: This is the CoxNet PTECH page for the current week. This
layout is available Tuesday after 2 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   COXNET PTECH 0817 _ It has been slow going, but Internet
companies are realizing that small business can mean big business
on the Web. A growing number of companies are developing new ways
to bring small businesses online, with small price tags to match.
(Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes 4-column color
photo of a taxi riding on the information highway.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY _ All electronic devices are born to die, but
there are some really easy things you can do to postpone that day.
(Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) Art includes 1 column color
sig of columnist.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS _ Web sites help people make plane
reservations, buy cars, order best sellers. Now a Web site is
putting the act of designing and ordering wedding announcements on
the Web. (Clothier, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) Art includes
2-column color photo of Web site.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: GADGETS _ If you've been wanting to enjoy the summer
months by bicycling along bike trails, but you're not sure you're
physically able to pedal long distances and up hills, you might
want to check out a bike with an electric motor. (Cummings, Dayton
Daily News) Art includes 18-pica color photo of motorized bike.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-KITCHEN _ Imagine this. You walk into your kitchen to start
breakfast. You pop eggs into your indestructible skillet, bread
into your computerized toaster and muffins into your oven that
cooks with light bulbs. While you wait, you pay bills on your
microwave, surf the Net on your refrigerator and check your
schedule on the command center monitor. The kitchen has long been
the center of activity in most homes. At every party and family
powwow, it seems that most people end up in the kitchen. That's
where the bills gather, the soccer schedules pile up and the kids'
artwork gets stuck on the fridge. Manufacturers are finally
acknowledging the kitchen's importance by creating high-tech
appliances and gadgets that could turn every home chef into Julia
Child. (DiLonardo Atlanta Journal-Constitution freelancer, not for
use by NYTNS clients). MOVED. WITH PHOTOS and LAYOUT. MOVED.

</P>
<P>
   TECH-KITCHEN-SIDE _ It's a long way from Home Ec class in high
school, but the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology is leading the way in the high-tech kitchen realm.
Here's a look at some of the work under way by students and
professors who are part of MIT's Counter Intelligence project.
(DiLonardo Atlanta Journal-Constitution freelancer, not for use by
NYTNS clients). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY_ Popular column about personal computing written for
the average user. This week: I had a sure way of knowing when it
was vacation time when I lived in Oregon. My best friends _ Marcus
and Betsy _ would start looking for the keys to their house.
Ordinarily they didn't lock the doors. It was that kind of a town,
a small place nestled in a little valley that ought to have been on
a postcard. It was if ``Leave It to Beaver'' were real. Folks
didn't need to lock their doors. The Internet used to be that way.
(Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-TOOLS _ Software reviews. This week: Gizmos 98 is another
one of those packages which, we are led to believe, contains all
the good stuff that Microsoft forgot to put into Windows. Well,
maybe. Depends upon what you want out of life, what you want out of
your computer, and whether you, like Play, Inc., which published
this program, are chiefly interested in graphics. But to take
Microsoft's view, you've got to stop somewhere. (Warner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 12. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ Unless you've been lost in the woods for the last
month or so, you'll know that the low-budget horror flick ``The
Blair Witch Project'' has virtually taken the country by storm. The
story of three college students, Heather, Mike and Josh, who head
into the Maryland wilderness in search of the legendary ``Blair
Witch.'' Even though they don't come back, they live on all over
the Web. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE _ If you've been on the Web any time at all, you've
sent and received an electronic greeting card. These cards started
out years ago as crude little images and some text, but nowadays,
you can send a card that includes music, animation or even a
photograph that you furnish. There are sites that charge for the
service, but there are so many free ones that we'll ignore the
``for pay'' sites today. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
MOVED
</P>
<P>
   TECH-MEDIA _ If you thought the leading maker of cellular
telephones was an American company such as Motorola, think again.
The leader in this category of technology is Nokia and, no, it's
not a Japanese company. Nokia is based in Helsinki, Finland. You
can learn all about this upstart leader in cellular technology in
the August issue of Wired magazine. Not only is Nokia leading in
the sale of phones but it is introducing wireless services such as
Internet access faster than American counterparts. (Haddad, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 12. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MAC-REPORT _ When it comes to speed and processing power,
Apple's laptops are the equal of any PC counterpart. But one
important area where PowerBooks have lagged behind is in size and
weight. (Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   TECH-REPORT _ Maybe all those hours glued to the computer
monitor are a good thing. A poll sponsored FamilyPC magazine, the
results of which are published in the September issue, asked 615
families about the effects PC use on their kids. Most polled, 68
percent, felt PC use made their kids smarter. But 13 percent said
they didn't think so. About 19 percent weren't sure. (Clothier,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   GADGET-COLUMN _ When it comes to figuring out ways to keep
things together, nobody takes a back seat to 3M, the Scotch tape
people. Among their newest wrinkles are removable adhesive pads for
hanging things on the wall and pop-up tape strips. (Cummings,
Dayton Daily News).
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE
</P>
<P>
   NFK-CHECKITOUT _ A brief on a new web site, TV show or event for
kids. This week: We have a book written by a 10-year-old girl who
tells us about her eccentric family, we have a Web site where you
build a rocket, and we direct the kids to the premiere of the
latest Nickelodeon cartoon ``Rocket Power!'' (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 7. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NFK-NEWSFLASH _ A national news item written for kids to
understand. This week: After the NAACP denounced prime-time
television for not being diverse enough, we wanted to examine how
kids' TV does. Lyle Harris examined kid shows on all the major
networks and also talked to the network big wigs. He found that
children's TV is far more diverse than adult TV. He also talked to
kids about whether they care or not that the shows are diverse.
(Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 11. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NFK-FEATURE _ Boredom Buster: We teach the kids the classic
outdoor game CAPTURE THE FLAG! We give them some strategy tips
(Always leave someone guarding the flag) and option plays for rules
(Freeze tag instead of jail). (Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 11.
MOVED.

American-Statesman) (l, a) MOVED.

<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS
</P>
<P>
   HOLLOWAY-TVCOLUMN _ Stop picking on Big Bird! He's a toddler,
for crying out loud, as are all the Muppets on ``Sesame Street.''
They're too young to vote, and they don't belong to political
parties. (Holloway, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ BUDAPEST _ Robin Marshall, a British editor

Hungarians. ``Be careful of the word you use. They're `discovering

Certainly, they have been `held back during the period of

days growing fewer in 1999, investors soon will have to place their
bets on Y2K, the software bug that some believe will cause massive
computer disruptions Jan. 1. Will they put their money in the

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ Last spring, when it looked like our raccoon
was planning on having his mail sent here, I had a screen installed

they don't tear up, they poop on.'' (Schuett, Cox News Service)

TAKING THE GOBBLE OUT OF GOBBLEDYGOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 22)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(Patricia T. O'Conner is the author of a grammar guide, ``Woe Is
I,'' and a new book about writing, ``Words Fail Me.'' William
Safire is on vacation.) 
(lb) 
 By PATRICIA T. O'CONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where do you go if you need help ``re-engineering communications
processes'' or ``contextualizing expertise''? What if you want
``improved system efficiencies'' and other ``value-added
communications components''? Why, you go to a plain-language
consultant, of course.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have no trouble finding one. In recent years, the
plain-language movement has spawned a small industry of consulting
firms, both large and small, for showing people in business and
government how to use clear, simple English.
</P>
<P>
   But be warned. Some of the ``proactive'' folks who want to
``modify your long-term business-development strategy to include
plain language'' haven't quite mastered it themselves, if the
writing on their Web sites is any indication.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, simple language isn't so simple to use. ``Simple
English is no one's mother tongue,'' Jacques Barzun said. ``It has
to be worked for.'' And the defenders of clarity, including plenty
of plain-spoken consultants, are making some progress, however
fitful, in the war against jargon, bureaucratese, technobabble,
pomposity and gobbledygook.
</P>
<P>
   It is an old fight, going back at least as far as Aristotle, but
one fought with particular fervor lately. The results are mixed,
but an optimist may be forgiven for thinking that things are
looking up _ if not navigating an upward trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   In the private sector, some hard-nosed business types have
concluded that intelligibility is good for the balance sheet. Ford,
for instance, recently demystified its auto-leasing contract. Among
other things,  &UR; lessee &LR;  has become  &UR; you &LR; , and there's nary a  &UR; shall &LR; 
in sight. Linguists at General Motors have developed what they call
a controlled language for use in service manuals. The idea,
according to Kurt Godden, GM's translation manager, is to eliminate
the ambiguities of English. And the aerospace industry has invented
another controlled language to standardize the vocabulary of
airplane maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   On the medical front, we have the plain-language version of the
venerable Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, the forbiddingly
technical reference book physicians have been thumbing for 100
years. Take  &UR; hangnail &LR; , for example. ``Acute or chronic
inflammation of the periungual tissues'' became ``an infection
around the edge of a fingernail or toenail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a simple matter,'' says Dr. Robert Berkow, who has
been editor in chief of the Merck Manual for 25 years. It took five
years to produce a twin version of the Merck for lay readers, with
virtually the same information but in everyday language. ``Most of
that first year was spent practicing writing in plain English,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the government, it has always provided the kind of warm,
moist environment, undisturbed by fresh air, that's ideal for the
incubation of verbal monstrosities. But Washington's anti-gibberish
brigade got a break in early 1997 when it enlisted Vice President
Gore in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a presidential memo last summer directing federal
agencies to write in ordinary English _ everyday words, short
sentences and the active voice. It was a tall order for bureaucrats
used to expressing themselves in language that only another
bureaucrat could understand.
</P>
<P>
   Similar campaigns fizzled out in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, but
this one may be different. ``It could really work,'' says Bryan
Garner, a plain-language consultant and the editor of Oxford's new
Dictionary of Modern American Usage. ``It's making more official
writing accessible.'' But don't expect overnight results. ``It's a
never-ending battle, and you can only change things
incrementally.''
</P>
<P>
   So it may be a while before every agency's  &UR; preliminary planning
strategy &LR;  becomes a  &UR; plan &LR; . Even the Clinton administration's
clarity guru, Annetta Cheek, has a fussy-sounding title:
 &UR; plain-language coordinator &LR; . (She prefers to say, ``I'm the one
who's supposed to make the government write better.'') She has no
illusions about the difficulties of getting an entrenched
bureaucracy to change its ways, but she says it will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customers are going to demand it,'' she says. ``It's the
right of the American people to get clear communication from their
government, and they should insist on it. There's absolutely no
reason for this bloated language.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a psycholinguist to understand the allure
of officialese. It can make a lousy idea look good or an
unpalatable one easier to swallow. It lets an insecure writer sound
impressive or helps a writer with nothing to say hide the fact that
the emperor has no clothes. But sheer habit may be the biggest
factor of all. Old customs die hard, especially in government.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Florman, deputy director of the office of public affairs
at the Justice Department, finds some of the writing in her agency
simply ``frightening.'' Why? ``Not only are we a bureaucracy, but
we're a bureaucracy populated by lawyers,'' she says. ``They just
don't write in English.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Lutz, a Rutgers University English professor who
writes about plain language, says his vote for worst writing goes
to the Internal Revenue Service. ``Lawyers are a piece of cake,''
he says. ``You haven't lived until you've gone one on one with an
accountant.''
</P>
<P>
   Some agencies, though, have distinguished themselves in the
battle against incomprehensibility. Every month, the administration
gives its No Gobbledygook Award to the employees who produce the
most readable document. The star of the effort has been the
Securities and Exchange Commission, for getting companies to cut
the jargon out of financial-disclosure statements.
</P>
<P>
   But plain English is nothing if not humble. An Agriculture
Department worker won the award for rewriting consumer tips on
safely cooking a stuffed turkey. Her summation was clarity itself:
``Measure the temperature of both the turkey and stuffing! Don't
just trust a pop-up indicator!''

   PARTY _ In 1992, Ross Perot led an impassioned following of
angry, disaffected voters that caused fits for the campaigns of
President Bush and then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. His independent
candidacy won almost 20 percent of the vote, the best showing for
an independent or third party presidential candidate in more than
half a century. And it sparked a debate that continues today about
whether he might have sealed Bush's defeat, even though exit polls
show that he probably drew almost equally from Democrats and
Republicans. Flash forward to 2000. Could a third party candidate
wield that kind of political clout again? 30. David Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   BOMB _ For more than 80 years, chemical weapons and other
ordnance from a World War I-era research project have lay buried
beneath a cozy upscale D.C. neighborhood. They're even digging up
the backyard of the South Korean ambassador. 27. David Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   BIO _ Gary Anson worries that even today's chicken manure ain't
what it used to be. He struggles mightily to keep his corn,
soybeans and wheat pristine _ free of chemicals and
laboratory-tinkered genetics. When he succeeds, his crops earn
organic status and fetch a premium price. But keeping his fields
unspoiled by high-tech agriculture is a chore without end. Anson
belongs to a growing class of farmers trying to sell food in a
lucrative market even as the planting of genetically engineered
crops explodes across the American bread basket _ threatening to
spoil the organic fun. 40. Mugs. Scott Canon.

   FAIR: One of the biggest traditions at the 97th State Fair is
that people here don't get what they pay for _ they get a lot more.
And much of it is absolutely free. Dozens of exhibitors offer
souvenirs, food samples to nibble, free entertainments and other
carrot-and-stick enticements to lure the hordes of ``Show Me''
Missourians to their booths, and hopefully to purchase or use their
products. Lee Hill Kavanaugh. 30. Photos.

   BEAUT. New bridge projects going up around the area _ from
Antioch over I-35, to the Bruce Watkins project, to a new
interchange near Independence Center _ include beautification
elements not seen in traditional steel and concrete interstate
highway construction; a law passed in the early '90s called for a
small percentage of construction costs to go for dressing up these
utilitarian structures, and they ARE prettier; but there is some
grumbling that the money would be better spent on additional
projects. Robert A. Cronkleton. Photos
</P>
<P>
   BUREAU. Johnson County, where the numbers of county employees
have soared, shows what's happening nationally: a new Census Bureau
study, released today, finds that the total state and local
government workers in the U.S. has grown. In Kansas, the numbers
have grown, and on a per capita basis the state has the
sixth-highest number of government workers in the country. Missouri
is in the middle. 25. John A. Dvorak. Chart

   CHURCH. As new churches sprout up across the metropolitan area,
Congress is considering a law that some local] leaders fear will
curtail their ability to regulate zoning for religious

claim the law will exempt religious practices from an array of
local laws pertaining to things such as child abuse, drug
enforcement and employee safety. Brad Cooper. 38.

   Jewel-profile: Millions deem her a folkie prophet whose music
and lyrics constitute a guide for living. They revel in being her
EveryDay Angels, as she refers to them in her fan-club newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   For others it's a case of pure, unadulterated lust.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a shortage of naysayers who dismiss her as the
poster girl for pretentiousness. They wish she'd just go away.
</P>
<P>
   That's one wish not likely to come true. The phenomenon known as
Jewel seems to be a pop-culture juggernaut that slows for no
critic.
</P>
<P>
   The guitar-strumming former waitress apparently acknowledges no
boundaries on her artistic ambitions. Having become a best-selling
folk//pop recording artist with her triple platinum debut CD,
``Pieces of You,'' Jewel went on to become a best-selling poet with
A Night Without Armor. Its sales of 2 million copies have made it
the hottest book of poetry in U.S. history. By Robert W. Butler.

   Health-hepb: KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Gloria Squitiro would sooner
home-school her children than subject them to the hepatitis B
vaccine. And in two years, it may just come to that.
</P>
<P>
   A Missouri state health regulation that took effect July 30
requires that students entering the seventh grade be inoculated
against hepatitis B, a severe and often fatal liver disease.
Squitiro's son, Andrew Funkhouser, is to enter seventh grade in the
Kansas City School District in the fall of 2001, and she is
concerned about the lack of information available about the vaccine
and about possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The hepatitis B vaccine is becoming ever-more mandatory as more
states require it along with the now-standard childhood
vaccinations such as pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria. According
to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 38 states
now require it. By Karen Uhlenhuth. Has art. 1,637 words.
</P>
<P>
   Music-noise: Back in the 1950s, much was made of the fact that
people were losing their individuality. The ``man in the gray
flannel suit'' was to be pitied as a poor soul who had lost his
way.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the century, the game has changed. Dare to
question the corporate agenda, and you just may find yourself out
on the street. No matter that, as humorist Lenny Bruce observed,
the individualist may be the only one with the guts to warn the
system of impending disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians have always known this. In fact, that's often why
they're musicians. And you can hear that sort of integrity in the
musical individualism of Alison Krauss, Salif Keita and Charlie
Haden. By Calvin Wilson. 616 words.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One world, two fates.
</P>
<P>
   Of children who die before their fifth birthday, 98 percent are
in the developing world. Of people who are HIV positive, some 95
percent are in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Of the millions who die prematurely of tuberculosis, malaria,
measles, tetanus and whooping cough, all but a few thousand live in
the poor world. Indeed, tuberculosis alone kills more people each
year than lung cancer, the most prevalent cancer and the terror of
the West.
</P>
<P>
   The gap is widening between rich and poor countries, especially
between the very richest and the very poorest. Although that has
happened for a century or more, the continued early deaths of the
poor and their children are a reproach to us all.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be done to save those millions of young lives?
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that there is some new thinking about ways to
respond to this challenge. Aid agencies and drug companies are
talking to each other in more constructive ways than they once did.
</P>
<P>
   For donor countries, this is not mere altruism: as international
travel grows, rich-world governments acquire a direct interest in
halting diseases such as tuberculosis, which may otherwise infect
their own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But affordable drugs are only part of the cure.
Developing-country governments can do more to improve the health of
their people than simply getting hold of western money and
ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the new thinking lies in the application of economics to
what has too often been a purely emotional pitch for aid. Since it
published an influential report on health in 1993, the World Bank
has consistently advanced the argument that unhealthy countries are
condemned to slow growth.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that ill health reinforces poverty is less familiar
than the view that poverty causes ill health, but equally true.
</P>
<P>
   However, one of the main virtues of the World Bank's argument is
that it allows multinational aid donors to talk straight to
developing-country finance ministers, who typically have more clout
in the allocation of resources than do their colleagues in the
health ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, economists are tackling _ or struggling with _ another
aspect of the health of the poor: their lack of access to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist, has drawn attention to the
scale of the problem: poor countries cannot afford expensive
medicines, and drug companies naturally tend to focus their
research on finding cures for the ills of the rich rather than the
afflictions of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Americans and Europeans rarely suffer from schistosomiasis,
which afflicts 200 million people worldwide, or lymphatic
filariasis, which makes life miserable for another 120 million. So
the market is said to be too small to attract research.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when Jonas Salk refused to patent polio
vaccine, saying that to do so would be ``like patenting the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   When a drug company spends millions to develop a vaccine, it
wants an economic return. The machinery that might guarantee such a
return is now taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank, the World Health Organization and other
do-gooding bodies have formed alliances with the pharmaceutical
industry to promote research on affordable drugs for neglected
tropical ailments. Legislation under consideration in the American
Congress and to be proposed by the European Commission would also
give a helping hand.
</P>
<P>
   All this talk still needs to be backed by money, though. Others
need to emulate Bill Gates's medical philanthropy. Important though
such initiatives are, they are not enough to heal the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable fall in mortality rates in Europe and North
America a century ago owed little to drugs and almost everything to
improved nutrition and better public health arrangements: reliable
water supplies, safe drains, regular garbage collection.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one in six of the world's people lack safe drinking water;
most of the giant cities of Africa and Asia have no sewerage
system; and garbage collection is so disorganized that between a
third and half of their garbage lies uncollected.
</P>
<P>
   The main answers lie in making local government more efficient
and more accountable. Another is money _ although appropriate
technology can cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   It is quicker to help the poor by ensuring that the water
sellers on whom they rely have access to safe water than by
struggling to install expensive piped supplies to the home; and
wiser to arrange for septic tanks to be emptied promptly than to
build waterborne sewerage systems.
</P>
<P>
   With some of the diseases that kill the poor, the surest answer
is to change habits.
</P>
<P>
   No single change would save more lives than if people routinely
washed their hands before touching food. They need, too, to filter
what they drink, to feed babies hygienically, to use mosquito nets,
to avoid drunken driving _ and to practice safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   One success story is sex education in Senegal: along with condom
distribution and prompt treatment of other sexually transmitted
diseases, this has helped to keep HIV infection rates in Dakar
below 2 percent, compared with 20 percent in Kenya's Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading such messages needs government enthusiasm. But
education ministers may not think it their job to teach personal
hygiene, while politicians may prefer building hospitals to
preaching the virtues of hand-washing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, good health care also entails reorganizing national
systems so that they concentrate on primary care for the poor,
rather than five-star clinics for those, like the president and his
cronies, who ought to pay for their own care.
</P>
<P>
   Even drug-buying could be done more effectively. Poor-country
governments need to make existing cheap medicines, such as oral
rehydration salts and childhood vaccines, more available.
</P>
<P>
   They also need to care better for those drugs they get: all too
often part of the consignment ends up on the black market or
spoiled by bad storage. Foreign aid for malarial drugs in Kenya was
recently withdrawn by donors exasperated by corruption, inertia and
political chicanery.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub. As Professor Sachs says, getting good
government is not the whole answer. But of all the ills that kill
the poor, none is as lethal as bad government. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates quaffs Diet Coke like James Bond sips dry martinis.
But Microsoft, the world's most valuable company, and Coca-Cola,
the most valuable global consumer brand, have more in common than
the planet's most valuable bladder.
</P>
<P>
   Both have fallen foul of a new wave of antitrust activism. A
verdict is awaited in the lengthy court battle between Microsoft
and America's Department of Justice (and various states).
</P>
<P>
   As for Coca-Cola, antitrust objections in Europe, Australia and
Mexico recently prompted the Atlanta-based fizz-maker to scale down
by half its acquisition of assorted brands from Cadbury-Schweppes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, the European Commission has said it is
investigating Coca-Cola and the firms that bottle and distribute
its brands, for allegedly abusing a dominant position in Germany,
Denmark and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Now, an unpublished report by Italy's competition authority
concludes that Coca-Cola has committed a ``grave violation'' of
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both Microsoft and Coca-Cola protest their innocence.
Windows is the operating system used in most of the world's
personal computers. Coca-Cola's various brands (the ``real thing,''
plus Fanta, Sprite and a few others) account for 51 percent of
global carbonated soft-drink sales.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two firms claim to operate in fiercely competitive
markets. Microsoft says it faces intense competition from other
operating systems (actual and potential), older versions of Windows
already in use, and piracy. It has less than 10 percent of world
software revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Coca-Cola says it has a paltry 2 percent share of the
liquids poured down people's throats. That puts it well behind
rivals such as water, tea and fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, both Microsoft and Coca-Cola grew into big,
profitable corporations largely because they were better at
competing than their rivals were. That sort of competition brings
welcome energy and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   But how should the two firms behave towards competitors now that
they are successful? The answer, it turns out, involves more art
than science.
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable economists can usually disagree on the proper way to
define the relevant market in which to assess the degree of power
exercised by a firm.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, to prove market power usually requires evidence that
it would be hard for a more efficient rival to capture market
share; and evidence, too, that the incumbent has the ability to
raise prices significantly _ say by 5 percent _ and keep them there
for a longish period of time, say a year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's and Coca-Cola's broad definition of their markets is
clearly self-serving, but cannot be dismissed out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   In Pepsi, Coca-Cola faces a big, aggressive competitor.
Microsoft operates in a rapidly changing business, where past
innovation has undermined apparently dominant firms. Even so,
analysis presented in the Microsoft trial, and to the Italian
investigation of Coca-Cola, suggest that both do enjoy a degree of
market power.
</P>
<P>
   Because the evidence is finely balanced, the authorities are
right to focus on the most egregious aspects of the way the two
firms treat their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to stop Coca-Cola battling Pepsi. The Department of
Justice has not tried to stop Microsoft pitting its Internet
Explorer browser against Netscape's Navigator. It merely wants
Microsoft to include Netscape Navigator alongside Explorer on its
Windows system.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates has compared this to ``telling Coca-Cola to include
three cans of Pepsi in every six-pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, to do that would be absurd. However, the analogy is
misleading. A better parallel would be a requirement that consumers
be given ready access to Pepsi as well as to Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Is that so absurd? Strikingly, in most of the countries in which
Coca-Cola and its bottlers are under investigation, it is accused
of trying to stop retailers (and wholesalers) making Pepsi
available.
</P>
<P>
   It is allegedly doing this through a mixture of financial
incentives and bullying _ possible because in these countries Coke
has a much higher market share than it does in America where Coke
and Pepsi are fairly evenly matched.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Microsoft nor Coca-Cola has offered any compelling
economic arguments for depriving consumers of the chance to choose
easily between their product and its main rival. That is why, on
balance, both deserve to lose. After all, the burden of proof in
such cases should lie on those who wish to be allowed to deprive
consumers of reasonable choices.
</P>
<P>
   If the Microsoft and Coke cases establish that as a principle,
celebrate by cracking open the fizzy stuff. And no, that need not
mean Diet Coke &QL;

<P>
   Bill Gates quaffs Diet Coke like James Bond sips dry martinis.
But Microsoft, the world's most valuable company, and Coca-Cola,
the most valuable global consumer brand, have more in common than
the planet's most valuable bladder.
</P>
<P>
   Both have fallen foul of a new wave of antitrust activism. A
verdict is awaited in the lengthy court battle between Microsoft
and America's Department of Justice (and various states).
</P>
<P>
   As for Coca-Cola, antitrust objections in Europe, Australia and
Mexico recently prompted the Atlanta-based fizz-maker to scale down
by half its acquisition of assorted brands from Cadbury-Schweppes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, the European Commission has said it is
investigating Coca-Cola and the firms that bottle and distribute
its brands, for allegedly abusing a dominant position in Germany,
Denmark and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Now, an unpublished report by Italy's competition authority
concludes that Coca-Cola has committed a ``grave violation'' of
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both Microsoft and Coca-Cola protest their innocence.
Windows is the operating system used in most of the world's
personal computers. Coca-Cola's various brands (the ``real thing,''
plus Fanta, Sprite and a few others) account for 51 percent of
global carbonated soft-drink sales.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two firms claim to operate in fiercely competitive
markets. Microsoft says it faces intense competition from other
operating systems (actual and potential), older versions of Windows
already in use, and piracy. It has less than 10 percent of world
software revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Coca-Cola says it has a paltry 2 percent share of the
liquids poured down people's throats. That puts it well behind
rivals such as water, tea and fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, both Microsoft and Coca-Cola grew into big,
profitable corporations largely because they were better at
competing than their rivals were. That sort of competition brings
welcome energy and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   But how should the two firms behave towards competitors now that
they are successful? The answer, it turns out, involves more art
than science.
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable economists can usually disagree on the proper way to
define the relevant market in which to assess the degree of power
exercised by a firm.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, to prove market power usually requires evidence that
it would be hard for a more efficient rival to capture market
share; and evidence, too, that the incumbent has the ability to
raise prices significantly _ say by 5 percent _ and keep them there
for a longish period of time, say a year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's and Coca-Cola's broad definition of their markets is
clearly self-serving, but cannot be dismissed out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   In Pepsi, Coca-Cola faces a big, aggressive competitor.
Microsoft operates in a rapidly changing business, where past
innovation has undermined apparently dominant firms. Even so,
analysis presented in the Microsoft trial, and to the Italian
investigation of Coca-Cola, suggest that both do enjoy a degree of
market power.
</P>
<P>
   Because the evidence is finely balanced, the authorities are
right to focus on the most egregious aspects of the way the two
firms treat their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to stop Coca-Cola battling Pepsi. The Department of
Justice has not tried to stop Microsoft pitting its Internet
Explorer browser against Netscape's Navigator. It merely wants
Microsoft to include Netscape Navigator alongside Explorer on its
Windows system.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates has compared this to ``telling Coca-Cola to include
three cans of Pepsi in every six-pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, to do that would be absurd. However, the analogy is
misleading. A better parallel would be a requirement that consumers
be given ready access to Pepsi as well as to Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Is that so absurd? Strikingly, in most of the countries in which
Coca-Cola and its bottlers are under investigation, it is accused
of trying to stop retailers (and wholesalers) making Pepsi
available.
</P>
<P>
   It is allegedly doing this through a mixture of financial
incentives and bullying _ possible because in these countries Coke
has a much higher market share than it does in America where Coke
and Pepsi are fairly evenly matched.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Microsoft nor Coca-Cola has offered any compelling
economic arguments for depriving consumers of the chance to choose
easily between their product and its main rival. That is why, on
balance, both deserve to lose. After all, the burden of proof in
such cases should lie on those who wish to be allowed to deprive
consumers of reasonable choices.
</P>
<P>
   If the Microsoft and Coke cases establish that as a principle,
celebrate by cracking open the fizzy stuff. And no, that need not
mean Diet Coke &QL;

   AMES, IOWA _ Bikers are becoming a tradition. On Aug. 14, a
leather-clad cavalcade of motorcyclists will roar up to the Iowa
State University basketball court, headed by the governor of
Wisconsin and Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Republican senator from
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   They are Bikers for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a line of female bikers accompanied the car and the
presidential ambitions of an unknown Illinois businessman, Morry
Taylor. Now there is even an eco-friendly, homespun version of the
event, arranged by one of America's most persistent presidential
campaigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try for 200 bicyclists,'' Lamar Alexander told
the New Yorker. The caravan is going to start ``with bagels and
coffee at the Mamie Eisenhower birthplace in Boone.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the first (un)real event of America's endless
presidential campaign, the Republican straw poll in Ames, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The local campaign director of another candidate, Steve Forbes,
calls it ``Disneyland in Iowa'' (he means that as praise).
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the ten Republican hopefuls will pitch their tents
around the basketball arena and offer free barbecue, gospel
singers, movie stars, corn-on-the-cob and T-shirts in the hope of
attracting votes from registered Iowans.
</P>
<P>
   This is no government-approved election. No delegate will be
chosen, no assembly influenced. It is an opinion poll combined with
a fund-raising event for the state's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Voters must pay $25 for the privilege of casting their ballots,
or may get the money from candidates' campaign chests.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter two hoots? Not to Senator John McCain of Arizona,
the one hopeful to boycott the event. This enthusiast for
campaign-finance reform calls the poll a ``scam.''
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to be a Republican to vote for that party's
candidate. It was once not necessary even to be from Iowa. Some
polls were won by the expensive expedient of flying or busing in
electors from other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we are not putting up with double voting,'' says
Kayne Robinson, the chairman of the Iowa Republicans, ``or with
people from out of state coming here to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the history of the event has been, to put it politely,
mixed. It has, for example, been a lousy predictor of voting
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's father won the poll in 1979, shortly before
Ronald Reagan became president. In the year Bush senior himself
became president, Pat Robertson, a televangelist, won the straw
poll. Last time, Phil Gramm of Texas tied with the candidate
eventually defeated for the presidency, Bob Dole. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 425) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is because Iowa, in common with every other state,
is a most atypical place.
</P>
<P>
   In myth, it is the heartland of America, a place of honest,
hard-to-fool farmers where (to quote a book on its political
culture) ``those who pursue public service are expected to serve
honestly and in the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is 95 percent white (against 72 percent for the national
average). Voter turnout is unusually high. And the large number of
farmers means that candidates are judged on policies _ such as
support for ethanol subsidies _ that no one else cares much about. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At best, the poll is one of those second- or third-order
indicators, like the acceleration rate of inflation _ a rate of
change in a rate of change.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, it is an opinion poll designed to show candidates'
strength before a vote next year in which Iowans will choose the
man or woman they want to be their party's presidential candidate.
It is therefore a poll about a vote for a party conference before
the presidential election itself: a vote about a vote about a vote
about a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this multiple reflexivity is part of what makes the poll
significant now. An event so far removed from any real ballot
nicely sums up the state of a campaign which, with 15 months to go,
lies beyond the horizon of most voters.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the poll's other function, as a fund-raiser, reflects
a stage of a campaign in which money is vital.
</P>
<P>
   Aptly, the term ``straw poll'' derives, according to William
Safire, a journalist and lexicographer, from the 17th-century
English author, John Selden, who wrote: ``Take a straw and throw it
up into the air...More solid things do not show the complexion of
the times so well.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ames still matters at least one hoot, if not the whole owl.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the candidates (except McCain) care about it very
much. Bush has spent around $1 million on the poll (including
$43,000 for the parking lot nearest the voting arena). Forbes has
spent a reputed $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   And the press will flock around, turning the poll into a grand
television event, raging before an indifferent public.
</P>
<P>
   The poll ``shouldn't be significant, but it has become so,''
says Hugh Winebrenner of Drake University, the author of the study
on Iowa politics referred to above.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the candidates and for the media this is the first real
indicator of a candidate's ability to bring out supporters. It's
clearly a contrived event, but has taken on a life of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, quite a lot of people will show up: Robinson expects
10,000-35,000 to cast their votes. That is the size of a national
convention (and would garner $250,000-875,000 for his party).
</P>
<P>
   ``The straw poll is...the biggest political event in America
this year,'' says Forbes's Iowa campaign director, Steve Grubbs.
</P>
<P>
   It may just be a poll in an atypical state, but it is still an
unusually large one, ten or more times larger than the 1,000 people
canvassed for an ordinary opinion poll. ``It's the only real ballot
test this year of any kind,'' says Grubbs.
</P>
<P>
   Third, it is likely to winnow the field. ``I think the grim
reaper's going to be waiting right outside the field house for a
number of candidates,'' says Pat Buchanan, a fire-eating
protectionist who has been admiring the Reform Party (though he
denies thoughts of defecting).
</P>
<P>
   At least three hopefuls may have to pull out if they do poorly
in Iowa: Alexander, Dan Quayle, the former vice-president, and
possibly Elizabeth Dole, whose womanly gloss is fading.
</P>
<P>
   They are the people who should have appeal in the state. If they
do not do well there, they cannot do well anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, those left in the chase could pose more of a
challenge to the front-runner, George W. Bush. And that could prove
the true significance of the event. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,100. SECOND TRIM FOLLOWS TO 1,325) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The poll itself is unlikely to be the first real test of Bush.
The Texan is expected to win handsomely (indeed, it will be a
disaster for him and the Republicans if he does not do well). But
it could be the prelude to such a test.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is coasting towards a coronation. Even his enemies are
mostly being polite about him. That is helping in one way: he can
run the sort of centrist campaign needed to win a country-wide
election. But it contains a danger.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has not yet been tested nationally, there is a risk
that Republicans will crown him as their contender next year only
to discover too late that he cannot withstand the rigors of a
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the makings of the dirty war are discernible. The
leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Tom Daschle of South Dakota,
has become the first national politician to call for more scrutiny
of Bush's colorful past.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has so far refused to dignify questions like ``When
did you stop taking cocaine?'' with an answer. But this calm
silence may be hard to maintain in the heat of a long election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The real question about Iowa, therefore, is whether it will
provide Bush with a challenge. A crushing victory will not do that.
A strong showing by a few of his opponents _ or merely one _ just
might. &QL;

   Third, it is likely to winnow the field. ``I think the grim
reaper's going to be waiting right outside the field house for a
number of candidates,'' says Pat Buchanan, a fire-eating
protectionist who has been admiring the Reform Party (though he
denies thoughts of defecting).
</P>
<P>
   At least three hopefuls may have to pull out if they do poorly
in Iowa: Alexander, Dan Quayle, the former vice-president, and
possibly Elizabeth Dole, whose womanly gloss is fading.
</P>
<P>
   They are the people who should have appeal in the state. If they
do not do well there, they cannot do well anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, those left in the chase could pose more of a
challenge to the front-runner, George W. Bush. And that could prove
the true significance of the event. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,100. SECOND TRIM FOLLOWS TO 1,325) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The poll itself is unlikely to be the first real test of Bush.
The Texan is expected to win handsomely (indeed, it will be a
disaster for him and the Republicans if he does not do well). But
it could be the prelude to such a test.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is coasting towards a coronation. Even his enemies are
mostly being polite about him. That is helping in one way: he can
run the sort of centrist campaign needed to win a country-wide
election. But it contains a danger.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has not yet been tested nationally, there is a risk
that Republicans will crown him as their contender next year only
to discover too late that he cannot withstand the rigors of a
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the makings of the dirty war are discernible. The
leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Tom Daschle of South Dakota,
has become the first national politician to call for more scrutiny
of Bush's colorful past.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has so far refused to dignify questions like ``When
did you stop taking cocaine?'' with an answer. But this calm
silence may be hard to maintain in the heat of a long election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The real question about Iowa, therefore, is whether it will
provide Bush with a challenge. A crushing victory will not do that.
A strong showing by a few of his opponents _ or merely one _ just
might. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Few things are more subject to historical revisionism than
cultural change. Everybody likes to celebrate torches being passed,
though only when he is part of the generation that is doing the
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   It is an item of faith for Hollywood's ruling caste of
baby-boomers that a glorious revolution took place in the 1970s. It
was a time when Jack had more hair, Clint rode tall and Warren's
fingertips were the things that Woody most wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   A brash young group of directors with names like Coppola,
Scorsese and Lucas reinvigorated Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   Truthful historians might record a few protests from the
preceding generation about a sudden increase in violence (the
horse's head in the bed; that rather unpleasant taxi driver). But
that was simply the noise of an old scene which did not ``get it''
quietly disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems that a similar ``youthquake'' is under way in
America's dominant medium.
</P>
<P>
   A trend which began with movies like ``Scream'' and ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer,'' and television shows such as ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' now seems unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   While Stanley Kubrick's final oeuvre, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' was
crawling its way to $60 million at the box office, teen flicks made
for a fraction of the cost have sprinted past that number.
</P>
<P>
   The old guard at Warner Bros. has resigned; middle-aged TV
actors are being shown the door to make way for twenty-somethings
or teenagers. Rather than slyly adding years to their age on their
CVs to bestow gravitas, screenwriters now subtract a decade to
appear young.
</P>
<P>
   And now America has ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a horror
mockumentary made for $35,000, which has captured the all-important
``13-25 demographic,'' soared to the top of the box office, made
the covers of Time and Newsweek _ and could end up being the most
profitable film ever produced (in terms of return on capital).
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair Witch'' (which, alas, has nothing to do with Britain's
prime minister) is mostly shot with a handheld camera and rose to
fame via Internet chat rooms. It is the brainchild of a couple of
young directors who boast about their contempt for all that ``movie
s--- (crap).''
</P>
<P>
   If American parents wince when they hear that phrase, it will be
because it seems symptomatic not only of youth culture but of youth
in general.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Blair Witch haunts the eponymous movie, the homes of
baby-boomers are now possessed by an equally pathological figure _
``our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   When politicians talk about ``our kids,'' they either mean a
lonely alienated boy bent over a computer screen, or a teenage girl
who begins each sentence with ``like'' and is planning her first
cosmetic operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids,'' goes the conventional wisdom, are the reason why
``American Pie,'' a film where the title became a temporary love
interest, was a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Our kids recorded that racist, sexist rap over our old Joni
Mitchell tape. Our kids vote less and smoke more than their
predecessors; they are worse at maths than Czech kids.
</P>
<P>
   And, as every documentary about ``our kids'' reminds you, they
were the killers in the classroom in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Is this fair? Worrying about children is nothing new. But the
current bout of hysteria seems particularly open to correction. The
problems begin with definition.
</P>
<P>
   When people talk about ``kids'' they now seem to mean anybody
between toddlers and early middle age; and, by infantilizing
teenagers, adults make their behavior even worse than it sometimes
is.
</P>
<P>
   As Jonathan Rauch recently argued in the National Journal, the
fuss about ``children killing children'' in the wake of Littleton
was absurd: the two killers were 18 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Put it another way: the older ``child,'' Eric Harris, was old
enough to drive a car, vote, join the Army and (in most states) get
married _ though not old enough to buy a drink.
</P>
<P>
   Some consistent distinction needs to be made, not just in the
law but also in political debate, between genuine children and
young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Next, it is not clear from the statistics that our kids, however
you define them, are indeed getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the latest figures show that adolescent sex is
decreasing. Many of the worthiest nonpolitical groups report a
surge in young membership. And in culture at least there is the
suspicion that they are getting a bad rap.
</P>
<P>
   As James Wolcott argues in the current issue of Vanity Fair, the
present bout of virgin-seducing and slasher movies seems to be the
work of an older group of producers who have made teens this year's
``designated sinners, camera fodder for jaded appetites and
projected desires.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, he points out, something distinctly odd about Brett
Easton Ellis, the author of ``American Psycho,'' one of the most
gratuitously violent novels ever, complaining about ``teens running
roughshod over this country _ murdering, raping, gambling away the
nation's future _ and we have the bills for counselling and prison
to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from some angles the argument that American youth is
less responsible than its self-obsessed and self-indulgent boomer
parents seems downright laughable.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has gone on about the problems with ``our kids'' more
than the Clintons; yet their daughter Chelsea is by some way the
most dignified member of their family.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, the creation that most people bring up in the
context of kids, has so far proved for the most part a miracle of
youthful inventiveness. Even ``Blair Witch'' is not just another
slasher movie, but something recognizably different from its
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one gory moment in the whole film, which uses
psychology rather than special effects to terrify you. True, the
dialogue is a little lame: ``This is so not cool'' is hardly
Shakespearian. On the other hand, ``Goodfellas'' is not exactly
Proust.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the longer you look at ``our kids,'' the more you can
trace back the problems and any possible solutions to the
baby-boomers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, America's schools are worse than they should be, but that
is because the boomers have refused to reform them (witness the
resistance even now to the idea of mild experimentation with
vouchers).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, children do not vote, but that is because the boomers have
turned politics into a moneyed husk.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they do shoot each other, but that is because the boomers,
once so moralistic about nonviolence, have allowed gun ownership to
soar.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than worrying about ``our kids,'' the real horror movie
still seems to be ``Mom and Dad.'' &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ A boomlet is going on in America's cities.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Brookings Institution and the Fannie Mae
Foundation examined 26 cities and found something that would have
been inconceivable a decade ago: every one of them expects its
downtown population to grow by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Houston projects that its central-city population will
quadruple; even Philadelphia, which has lost 600,000 people since
1950, foresees a 13 percent growth by 2010. Chicago expects a
whopping 32 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   The data tell only part of the story. The survey asked about
projected population growth in and around the central business
districts. Most American cities still have deeply blighted pockets
and many are losing population overall.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of job growth is still in the suburbs, as Bruce Katz,
director of the Brookings Institution Center on Urban and
Metropolitan Policy, points out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most desirable parts of many American cities are
thriving, and therein lies one recipe for dealing with urban
sprawl: keep people in cities and entice suburban residents to move
back.
</P>
<P>
   Why are more Americans abandoning their love affair with
far-flung suburbs and shopping malls?
</P>
<P>
   Demographics is one reason. Young professionals are marrying and
having children later, allowing them to live in the city longer
before buying a minivan and moving out.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``empty nesters,'' couples who no longer have
children living at home, are rediscovering the appeal of urban
life. Indeed, the very excesses of the suburbs _ big houses on big
plots _ make them less attractive for older couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who don't want to mow yards,'' says Paul
Helmke, mayor of Fort Wayne, Ind., and former head of the country's
Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Urban living also has a new lustre because crime has plummeted.
``People will not expose themselves to danger,'' says John
Norquist, mayor of Milwaukee and author of ``The Wealth of
Cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee has not had a single homicide downtown in seven years.
The ten largest American cities have seen an average drop in
violent crime of 34 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Brown, a perennial Californian politician, once called
America's incarceration binge ``a strategy to control the surplus
population in a capitalist system that is breaking down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has been elected mayor of Oakland and is trying to
turn the city around, he has a different view. He told the Wall
Street Journal recently that more criminals must go to jail and
stay there.
</P>
<P>
   The labor market has also changed the urban-suburban dynamic.
Companies fled to the suburbs on the assumption that an endless
supply of white-collar workers would find their way to the office,
wherever it happened to be.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, urban planners pronounced that technology would
render the density of cities obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Both those assumptions have proved wrong, particularly in the
high-tech industry. Silicon Valley is proof that there is an
advantage to being close to customers, suppliers and other firms in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   As for workers, the young programmers and executives who make up
the information-technology sector prefer an urban lifestyle that is
only a skateboard-ride away from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Ubid, an on-line auction company, has announced plans to move
its headquarters from a suburb outside Chicago back into the city
to ``attract the right kind of talent.''
</P>

   Indeed, developers who have made a fortune building subdivisions

   Milwaukee has built 2,000 new housing units downtown in the past
three years. Mayor Norquist tells the story (admiringly) of a
developer who bought a downtown warehouse for $1 million, turned it
into 40 apartments, and sold all of them for $500,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago issued more than 25,000 residential and commercial
building permits in 1998, up from 10,000 in 1993. The price of
existing houses in Lincoln Park, one of the city's best
neighborhoods, has climbed 26 percent in two years.

<P>
   This is sustainable, market-driven development, says Katz. But
in many cases, he points out, the government made the first

</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee spent $9 million to build a riverside walk that had
been designed in 1904 by a famous urban architect but never

   Brookings has promulgated a list of ``10 steps towards a living
downtown.'' Most of the suggestions are common sense: save historic
buildings, protect open space, make housing a priority, put things

</P>
<P>
   But what about families with children? Cities have the potential
to be child-friendly, says Norquist. They are designed around
blocks with pavements; they can support museums, libraries, parks.
</P>
<P>
   But schools matter more than any of that. Milwaukee has a
path-breaking school-choice program, but only poorer residents can
take part. Norquist would like to see those income caps lifted
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   A number of mayors, including Richard Daley in Chicago and
Dennis Archer in Detroit, have wrested control over their schools
away from independent school boards in the hope that reforms will
keep middle-class residents from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these systems have made impressive gains, but better is
not necessarily good enough for keen parents.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Park High School, one of the best public high schools in
Chicago, offers 13 advanced placement courses (classes that allow
bright students to work towards college credit). New Trier, a
suburban high school, offers nearly twice as many. &QL;

   Environmental laws make the new owner liable for toxic chemicals
that may have been left behind on the property 50 years ago. ``You

Helmke explains.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ A boomlet is going on in America's cities.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Brookings Institution and the Fannie Mae
Foundation examined 26 cities and found something that would have
been inconceivable a decade ago: every one of them expects its
downtown population to grow by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Houston projects that its central-city population will
quadruple; even Philadelphia, which has lost 600,000 people since
1950, foresees a 13 percent growth by 2010. Chicago expects a
whopping 32 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   The data tell only part of the story. The survey asked about
projected population growth in and around the central business
districts. Most American cities still have deeply blighted pockets
and many are losing population overall.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of job growth is still in the suburbs, as Bruce Katz,
director of the Brookings Institution Center on Urban and
Metropolitan Policy, points out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most desirable parts of many American cities are
thriving, and therein lies one recipe for dealing with urban
sprawl: keep people in cities and entice suburban residents to move
back.
</P>
<P>
   Why are more Americans abandoning their love affair with
far-flung suburbs and shopping malls?
</P>
<P>
   Demographics is one reason. Young professionals are marrying and
having children later, allowing them to live in the city longer
before buying a minivan and moving out.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``empty nesters,'' couples who no longer have
children living at home, are rediscovering the appeal of urban
life. Indeed, the very excesses of the suburbs _ big houses on big
plots _ make them less attractive for older couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who don't want to mow yards,'' says Paul
Helmke, mayor of Fort Wayne, Ind., and former head of the country's
Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Urban living also has a new lustre because crime has plummeted.
``People will not expose themselves to danger,'' says John
Norquist, mayor of Milwaukee and author of ``The Wealth of
Cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee has not had a single homicide downtown in seven years.
The ten largest American cities have seen an average drop in
violent crime of 34 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Brown, a perennial Californian politician, once called
America's incarceration binge ``a strategy to control the surplus
population in a capitalist system that is breaking down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has been elected mayor of Oakland and is trying to
turn the city around, he has a different view. He told the Wall
Street Journal recently that more criminals must go to jail and
stay there.
</P>
<P>
   The labor market has also changed the urban-suburban dynamic.
Companies fled to the suburbs on the assumption that an endless
supply of white-collar workers would find their way to the office,
wherever it happened to be.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, urban planners pronounced that technology would
render the density of cities obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Both those assumptions have proved wrong, particularly in the
high-tech industry. Silicon Valley is proof that there is an
advantage to being close to customers, suppliers and other firms in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   As for workers, the young programmers and executives who make up
the information-technology sector prefer an urban lifestyle that is
only a skateboard-ride away from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Ubid, an on-line auction company, has announced plans to move
its headquarters from a suburb outside Chicago back into the city
to ``attract the right kind of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers everywhere have made it clear that they are tired of
sitting in traffic on their way to offices that are nowhere near
public transport.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cities have rediscovered their comparative advantage:
they are the natural hub of culture, the arts, good dining, sports
and entertainment. Successful downtowns are ``24-hour cities,''
says Katz. ``These are fun places to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, developers who have made a fortune building subdivisions
on farmland now smell a profit in the city.
</P>

   KATHMANDU _ The recruitment of Gurkhas by the British army has
long provided a tough but lucrative job for some people in the
hills of Nepal with unproductive land and no other source of
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Harka Gurung, a former government minister in Nepal, recalls
that his father could educate four of his children on his pension
of 75 rupees (less than Pounds1 these days) that he received for
his 21 years of service in the British army. His father retired in
1926.
</P>
<P>
   There are many like Gurung who could not have attended school,
let along entered the professions, without their father's pension.
But what seemed a fair deal in the old days may not seem so fair
now.
</P>
<P>
   The service of Gurkhas in the British army dates back to 1817.
Their bravery in numerous battles has brought fame to themselves
and to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   When the British left the Indian subcontinent in 1947, they
continued to employ Gurkhas. Britain created a special status for
them in its army, which protected them from being regarded as
mercenaries, a sensitive matter for Gurkhas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, a number of retired Gurkhas sought to draw
attention to the fact that Gurkha pay had fallen behind that of
other soldiers in the British army. But in the days of Nepal's
absolute monarchy nothing was done to further their claims. Those
who protested were often jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the establishment of multi-party democracy in Nepal in
1990, the campaign has been revived. At its head are two groups,
the Nepal Ex-Servicemen's Association and the more radical Gurkha
Ex-Servicemen's Organization (GESO).
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has had some success. In 1997, the British
government raised the Gurkhas' pay to that of other soldiers. But
their pension remains far lower than a British soldier's.
</P>
<P>
   GESO wants Gurkhas who have served in the British army to get
pension rights equal to other British soldiers. It also seeks
employment opportunities for Gurkhas' children in Britain, and for
Gurkha ex-soldiers to be allowed to work there.
</P>
<P>
   The British say that the formula used for working out the Gurkha
pension was laid down in the treaty it signed with Nepal and India
in 1947, which was based on Indian army rates. That treaty is still
in existence, and Britain seems disinclined to update it.
</P>
<P>
   The British also observe that living costs in Nepal are low
compared with those in Britain and other rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``But things are different now,'' says Harka Gurung. The 1947
agreement was drawn in haste, he believes, and was only temporary
in nature. The agreement should be scrapped or renegotiated, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The death in June of two Gurkha officers who were defusing bombs
in Kosovo, the first NATO casualties of its peacekeeping operation,
has added strength to their campaign for better pensions.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of one of the officers has been much interviewed by
British newspapers. It has been pointed out that, had her husband
been a British soldier, she would have received a lump sum of more
than Pounds64,000 ($103,000) and an annual pension of about
Pounds15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Nepali widow has received Pounds19,000 and a pension of
Pounds940, which under present rules will be reduced after five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Gurkhas blame the Nepali government even more than the
British for not pressing their claim. But government in Nepal has
been in a wobbly state for years.
</P>
<P>
   Both the ruling Congress party and members of the opposition
have in fact spoken in support of the Gurkhas' case. Backing the
Gurkhas, who are well regarded in Nepal, wins votes. But perhaps
their voices have not carried weight in London.
</P>
<P>
   Militant-minded Gurkhas point out that there are some 30,000
former Gurkha soldiers in Nepal. What would happen if they took up
arms against the government, as have the Maoist guerrillas who have
fought in the border country for years?
</P>
<P>
   A more rational suggestion being canvassed by former Gurkhas is
that they should bypass their own government, and file a legal
claim for better pensions against the British government in London.
</P>
<P>
   The Gurkhas, however, first plan to parade and thunder through
the streets of Kathmandu in September, hoping to catch the
attention of the world.
</P>
<P>
   They are organizing an international conference in Kathmandu
starting on Sept. 18, which they say will highlight their unfair
treatment by the British government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the biggest ever gathering of the Gurkhas,'' says
GESO's president, Padam Bahadur Gurung, who is under attack in his
movement for its lack of success. &QL;

been a British soldier, she would have received a lump sum of more
than Pounds64,000 ($103,000) and an annual pension of about
Pounds15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Nepali widow has received Pounds19,000 and a pension of
Pounds940, which under present rules will be reduced after five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Gurkhas blame the Nepali government even more than the
British for not pressing their claim. But government in Nepal has
been in a wobbly state for years.
</P>
<P>
   Both the ruling Congress party and members of the opposition
have in fact spoken in support of the Gurkhas' case. Backing the
Gurkhas, who are well regarded in Nepal, wins votes. But perhaps
their voices have not carried weight in London.
</P>
<P>
   Militant-minded Gurkhas point out that there are some 30,000
former Gurkha soldiers in Nepal. What would happen if they took up
arms against the government, as have the Maoist guerrillas who have
fought in the border country for years?
</P>
<P>
   A more rational suggestion being canvassed by former Gurkhas is
that they should bypass their own government, and file a legal
claim for better pensions against the British government in London.
</P>
<P>
   The Gurkhas, however, first plan to parade and thunder through
the streets of Kathmandu in September, hoping to catch the
attention of the world.
</P>
<P>
   They are organizing an international conference in Kathmandu
starting on Sept. 18, which they say will highlight their unfair
treatment by the British government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the biggest ever gathering of the Gurkhas,'' says
GESO's president, Padam Bahadur Gurung, who is under attack in his
movement for its lack of success. &QL;

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a secret war. At least 500 Anglo-American air strikes
against Iraq this year. More than a hundred dead. Well over a
thousand sorties. And yet scarcely a headline.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we have become immune to NATO bombing in Yugoslavia.
Allied jets bombed Iraq again over the past fortnight. Eight dead
on July 29, nine dead the following day, according to the Iraqis.
And yet each British or American raid produces little more than a
paragraph in the western press. There is no political debate in
Washington, no questions in the House of Commons in London.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing Iraq has become routine, an ``acceptable'' war. In the
first five weeks of this year, there were 70 air strikes against
Iraq, inflicting more damage than the pre-Christmas ``Desert Fox''
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Americans and British received new rules of
engagement _ to attack Iraqi military installations even if they
were not directly threatening the RAF or the U.S. Air Force _ the
bombings went on unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   Yet eight months later, President Saddam Hussein's vicious
regime appears to be as impregnable as ever.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubting the facts of the air strikes. On Feb. 1,
U.S. and British aircraft attacked an Iraqi missile site and two
``communications sites'' at Al-Amarah and Talil.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, American jets _ in one of the heaviest raids on Iraq
in two months _ dropped more than thirty 2,000-lb. and 500-lb.
laser-guided bombs on ``communication sites, radio relay sites and
anti-aircraft artillery sites'' near Mosul ``in response to radar
threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi oil pipelines were bombed, provoking condemnation from the
U.N.'s ``oil-for-food'' program director in Baghdad, Benon Sevan.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Iraq claimed that bombs had been dropped on a
farm near Basra. By March 14, Allied spokesmen were reporting ``an
unspecified number of bombs'' dropped on ``Iraqi radar posing a
threat to coalition aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   While NATO was bombing Yugoslavia, Iraq experienced a brief lull
in bombing. By April 5 _ at the height of the bombardment on
Yugoslavia, the raids on Iraq had recommenced.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman announced that an American F-16CG aircraft,
a U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet and an RAF Tornado had attacked
surface-to-air missiles sites 110 miles south of Baghdad while
other planes had bombed ``communication sites'' near al-Salman and
Nukayeb.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Iraq said two people were killed when
planes bombed surface-to-air sites south of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglo-American offensive has infuriated both the Russians
and the French _ again with little reporting or public reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The French were deeply troubled when an American AGM-130 missile
exploded in a Basra housing complex in February, killing 17 people
and wounding almost 100, according to the United Nations. Six women
and 10 children were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman said _ in words that would become familiar
during the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia two months later _ that
``we are not targeting civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on Feb. 4, when the Americans claimed that British and U.S.
aircraft had destroyed 40 missile batteries, not a single
dissenting voice was heard in Congress or the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   On May 8, Iraq said that three people had been killed when 18
bombs were dropped on Iraqi ``civilian and military (sic)
targets.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, Iraq said 12 people had been killed in civilian areas
of Mosul after U.S. and British aircraft had fired air-to-ground
missiles at farmers' tents around the ancient city of Ninevah. By
the end of the month, the Americans were recording attacks on
``Iraqi air defenses near Mosul.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that Saddam Hussein was an even more brutal man than
Serbia's president-cum-ethnic-cleanser Slobodan Milosevic, it was
inevitable that the U.S. government would use the same mantra to
excuse civilian casualties in Iraq as it had in Yugoslavia, where
all ``collateral damage'' was blamed upon Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, on July 19, James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, said that ``every effort is taken to avoid any
casualties to civilians... Ultimate responsibility for these events
(sic), however, lies with Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other disturbing parallels with the NATO bombardment
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO said it was bombing the Serbs because they were
``ethnically cleansing'' hundreds of thousands of Albanians from
Kosovo _ most of whom were still in their homes when the NATO
bombardment began _ so U.S. and British spokesmen at the Turkish
base at Incirclik, from which many of the fighter-bombers are
taking off, say that they are trying to protect the Iraqi Shiites
and Kurds from Saddam Hussein's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Yet statements from the Iraqi opposition make it clear that
dozens of Iraqi opponents of Saddam Hussein are being tortured and
summarily executed in the areas which British and American jets are
daily overflying.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have meanwhile resorted to the usual economy with
the truth _ as have the Iraqis. According to Rear Admiral Craig
Quigley on Aug. 5, only 108 attacks had been made against Iraqi
targets this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant General Shaheen Yassin, the commander of Iraqi
anti-aircraft defenses, said that U.S. and British planes had
carried out 10,977 sorties.
</P>
<P>
   The catch, of course, is that each raid recorded by Quigley
could constitute at least a dozen separate air strikes. And
``sorties'' include transport, refuelling and surveillance aircraft
on a single mission.
</P>
<P>
   Figures calculated for the past eight months suggest that
British and American aircraft have individually undertaken more
than 500 bombing missions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   It is also worth recalling that two prominent British defense
magazines _
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft Illustrated and Jets _ concluded that even the ``Desert
Fox'' bombardment of last December had no effect on Saddam
Hussein's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft Illustrated said that 25 percent of the attacks missed
their targets and that ``all but one of the Weapons of Mass
Destruction (the supposed target of coalition jets) escaped severe
damage'' in an operation which ``achieved little more than
face-saving.''
</P>
<P>
   So what are we doing bombing Iraq? &QL;

STUDENTS FROM OVERSEAS HELP PARK BEAT WORKER SHORTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN WOOD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Faced with a shrinking pool of local job
seekers, Six Flags Over Texas began fishing overseas, hiring
foreign students as seasonal employees.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 100 foreign students were hired at the
park, helping it get through the waning days of its summer season,
when it typically loses almost 10 percent of its 2,500 seasonal
employees at the start of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are excellent employees with great attitudes and fill the
staffing void that typically arises in late summer,'' said park
spokeswoman Nancy St. Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   The park started using foreign students as an employment
stopgap. But, according to restaurant supervisor Kenny Braxton, the
influx of students from France, Poland, Costa Rica and other
countries has had an unexpected bonus. Park patrons like
encountering people from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   With the success of the program, the number of foreign students
hired at Six Flags has steadily grown, from 50 in 1997 to 80 last
year and 103 this year.
</P>
<P>
   The park also began using an Atlanta-based company, Global
Staffing, to help find employees this year, after working
previously with an international council for foreign employees.
</P>
<P>
   Global, which has placed foreign students in a number of parks
in the Six Flags chain, is like an overseas temporary agency for
foreign students. Foreign embassies contact Global with names of
residents who are coming to the United States on visas. Global
hooks those people up with places like Six Flags where they can
work and earn money for their travels here.
</P>
<P>
   ``These students are coming here for a cultural exchange,'' said
Joseph Cipperoni, regional vice president for Global. ``The visa
allows them to travel and allows them to work to help them with
pocket money while they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Global arranges accommodations for the workers, provides them
with on-site supervision and arranges transportation to and from
work.
</P>
<P>
   Students at Six Flags Over Texas earn $7 an hour, which is about
average for local employees, and typically work an eight-hour day.
They stay at a nearby Ramada Inn at a reduced rate of $8 a day,
which is deducted from their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Braxton said the students work all over the park, from rides to
guest relations, but most of the job openings are in food service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who work (in USA Food Court) are
international,'' said Marialaura Rojas, 25, of San Jose, Costa
Rica.
</P>
<P>
   The students come for a variety of reasons. Rojas said she had
some free time before starting her studies this fall for a master's
degree in industrial psychology back in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like to practice my English, meet people and earn
money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothee Palluy, 20, of Lyon, France, said she came to the
United States for school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very good experience for me,'' Palluy said. ``I am in
business school. I have to have an internship in foreign country.
Here I learn about the ability of finding a job. It is very easy
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really eager to work,'' Braxton said. ``We have them
either shadow someone or work with someone from here. It's already
embedded in their minds that they help from opening to close.''

MAMMOTH AREA OFFERS SPLENDOR IN THE WILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the time comes for a vacation, I will be
heading straight to Mammoth in the eastern Sierra to hike, fish,
boat, backpack, sit in hot springs and stay in a cabin. And for the
next day? Maybe I'll just watch the squirrels play beneath the
aspens.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth is often overlooked as a great destination for those in
Northern California. That is because Yosemite, Tahoe and Monterey
compete for recreation time, and to a lesser extent, so do the
Redwood Empire, Shasta-Cascade, Clear Lake and so many other
destinations, including some 300 lakes within driving distance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the length of the drive, Mammoth is a primary vacation
area for people from Southern California, with lodging bookings at
about 90 percent now through Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   But come Sept. 6, and this place is all but abandoned, with
bookings down to 20 to 30 percent through October. I try to get
back here every year, either in September or October, when there is
no better place or time.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra beauty is spectacular. A hundred years ago, whenever
John Muir wanted a change of scenery from Yosemite, this is where
he came. Fifty years ago, Ansel Adams took many of his prized
photographs here. Today, it still offers the public a place to make
its own magic.
</P>
<P>
   The greater Mammoth area has more than 100 lakes, most of them
gorgeous, including 20 you can drive to. There are about two dozen
drive-to campgrounds, several near trailheads that provide jumpoff
points into the Ansel Adams Wilderness, the Minarets and the John
Muir Wilderness. It is in these mountains where Muir counseled with
heaven. As for me, well, I'd like some counseling with a trout.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a rundown of the best of the eastern Sierra:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hiking: A great easy hike starts at Devils Postpile National
Monument, passes the Postpile and then extends in a mile to
beautiful Rainbow Falls on the San Joaquin River. An even easier
stroll is at Mono Lake, walking in a moonscape amid the tufa
spires. A great all- day adventure is at Convict Lake, where a
trail is routed alongside the back of the lake, then up the back
river canyon for panoramic views across the desert of the White
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sightseeing: The best sideshows are Bodie, a genuine ghost
town, Mono Lake and its bizarre tufa spires, and Devils Postpile
National Monument, the world's best example of columnar-formed
rock.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hiking/backpacking: A spectacular hike starts at the Agnew
Meadows Trailhead near Devils Postpile. You head north on the River
Trail along the San Joaquin River to Thousand Island Lake, an
awesome setting below Banner and Ritter peaks in the Minarets.
</P>
<P>
   It's a 15.6-mile round trip on moderate mountain grades.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fishing: The biggest brown trout in state history have been
caught at Lower Twin Lake, Convict Lake, Bridgeport Reservoir and
Crowley Lake. Flyfishing for small trout in low water conditions is
available on the San Joaquin River, upstream of Agnew Meadows; the
farther you walk away from the campgrounds, the better the fishing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hot springs: There are several hot springs in the vicinity of
the Mammoth airport. The best is on Hot Creek, where cold stream
water is mixed with hot spring water, an unforgettable sensation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lakes/boat access: Convict Lake is set at 7,583 feet, always
full with clear, blue water, and framed by a back wall of
wilderness mountain peaks, with boat rentals available. You can
also reach Lake Mamie, Lake George, Lake Mary, Gull Lake, Silver
Lake, Grant Lake and more than a dozen others by car. Most have
boat ramps and small marinas.
</P>
<P>
   _ When the aspens turn color: The aspens start turning gold in
mid-September and are incredible by the first week of October, best
seen at Convict Lake and Rock Creek Lake.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lodging/restaurants: The town of Mammoth, population 5,000,
has 50 restaurants, 80 rental condominiums, and 34 hotels and
lodges, phone 800-367-6572. The best cabins are at Convict Lake
Resort, 800-992-2260, Crystal Crag at Lake Mary, 760-934-2436, with
12 others available.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Paging all back-to-school shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Please drop your cinnamon buns and kick off your metal foot
measurers. Exit the fitting rooms and come out from behind the
pagodas.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to get on your knees and fan your hands over your
heads in a deep bow to the merchandise. Yes, it is time to declare
your unworthiness. The latest back-to-school gear _ from pens to
wireless phones to clothes _ is just too cool.
</P>
<P>
   Browse through the fashions sprawled out on store racks and
coolness abounds. Granted, items are low on academic content but
they sure make up for it extracurricularly _ attracting the
adventurous and spiritual sides of students from pre-K to college.
</P>
<P>
   What's great about gear this season is that it seems former
smart kids and jocks, introverts and class clowns alike, conspired
to create it. There are indestructible pieces with pockets cropping
up in the strangest places and legs that zip off. School bags that
look engineered by the kid with perfect SATs. And soothing accents
of the Far East _ from delicate India-print flowers spreading along
sleeves to shiny pouches with Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
   While most apparel embraces a millennial feel, feet seem to be
stuck in the past. Footwear, especially for teen-agers, is just now
going retro with old-school designs prepped to hit the pavement.
Sneakers are stocked in bright shades _ ready to mix and match with
colored pagers or kick up on a glowing inflatable ottoman.
</P>
<P>
   What follows here is a crib sheet for some of what's new and
popular for back-to-schoolers of all ages. The good news is that
Mom and Dad don't seem opposed to most of the stuff out there.
</P>
<P>
   So ask your parents to go out early. And it might be nice to
thank them for their schlepping and paying _ or at least pass along
a slice of all this cool.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOOK BAGS
</P>
<P>
   _ RAK Gear backpack (CVS, $39.95). If your child looks like he's
carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders it might be time
for a RAK pack. On the outside it looks like your standard
backpack, but the inside is equipped with slanted plastic shelves
that distribute the weight of textbooks. Keeps kids' backs straight
and books from getting bent as well. Kid-tested,
chiropractor-approved.
</P>
<P>
   _ Messenger Bag (The Gap, $29.50). College guys especially are
willing to brave possible dog attacks for the postman look. The
messenger bag is simple and sleek with a big flap and occasional
stripes and plastic buckles. Girls also like it in shiny vinyl.
Sling it across your chest while biking around campus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DORM
</P>
<P>
   _ GEAR Inflatable leisure lounger (Spencer Gifts, $50). Disco
balls and neon stars have been dorm-room staples for years, but the
lounger is this year's contribution to the decor. It's not 100
percent practical but it's cheap dorm furniture that looks like it
just toweled off from the pool. For the full effect: Get out the
air compressor, pop in the Austin Powers sequel soundtrack and turn
on the black lights for glow-in-the-dark.
</P>
<P>
   _ Samsung microwave (Kmart $79), Sanyo refrigerator (Kmart,
$99). Not really new or jazzed up, but compact versions are selling
like hotcakes. No need to say more.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Harry Potter Prisoner of Azkaban,'' (Waldenbooks, $17.95).
The third book in the popular Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling
will be released Sept. 8, but some people are already trying to buy
copies in Britain. The protagonist of this children's series is
none other than an orphan named Harry Potter, who has captured the
imagination of adults and held his own on bestseller lists.
Rowling's first two books have echoes of Roald Dahl and the appeal
of Dr. Seuss at graduation time. The writing draws on popular
legends like werewolves and goblins without diving into science
fiction. A good bet to read to third-graders and up. Also an
entertaining read for sixth-graders on up to adults.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ACCESSORIES
</P>
<P>
   _ Motorola LS550 pager (Bell Atlantic Mobile, $99.99), Startac
Digital Cell Phone (Bell Atlantic Mobile, $200). Aside from the
trusty spiral notebook, back to school is all about wireless.
Pagers are popular for male and female high school students. The
hottest sellers: those in blue, green and purple that play
different beeps, Christmas tunes and a rendition of ``Happy
Birthday.'' Parents appreciate that kids are accessible _ and no
longer have an excuse not to call. Digital cell phones with
features like voice mail, caller ID and three-way calling are
hottest for the college crowd, which makes sense because you must
be 18 or older and have good credit to purchase the service.
Students take advantage of the long-distance capabilities and good
deals with free nights and weekends in lieu of costlier college
phone plans.

   CLOTHING
</P>
<P>
   Embroidered Arizona Tank Top with matching shrug (JCPenney,
$24-$28). Asian motifs have been diffusing over skin thanks to the
Mendhi craze, but because you can't walk around baring all in the
fall, the designs have migrated to everything else. There are
dragons that breathe fire down your lapel and screen-printed
buddhas that sit on your chest and may lead to inner peace. You can
also set the mood using candles printed with Chinese symbols.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trek Pants, also known as flight pants or utility pants
(American Eagle, $40-42). OK, so maybe you have never been
parachuting or hang-gliding. At least your pants can look like they
have. Come winter, a pair of thermal underwear just might do the
trick for snowpants transformation. Pair it with a quilted or
fleece vest (Old Navy, $25) and you're in business.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ FOOTWEAR
</P>
<P>
   _ Nike Air Force Ones, also known as Up-Towns (most footwear
stores, $75 for high-tops). The white Up-Towns with a colored
swoosh conjure up the '80s basketball look but don't really have
the support to score anything more than fashion points. Nike hopes
guys buy more than one pair to complement different outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Skechers lookalikes (PayLess Shoe Source, $10 on sale). Skechers
_ or pretty much anything that looks chunky _ are popular for young
girls on up to teen-agers. Sneakers, boots or oxfords will do _ the
only thing you gotta have is lots of sole.

AMERICANS LOOK NORTH FOR EYE SURGERY BARGAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Lured by a favorable exchange rate and cheaper
costs, people from upstate New York and other areas along the
northern border are heading to Canada for the latest in laser eye
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   While the 15-minute, out-patient procedure on both eyes here
costs about $5,000, the going rate in Canada ranges from $999 in
Halifax to $1,500 in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my first questions was, `How can you do it so much
cheaper than in the United States?''' said Matthew Hunt of Albany,
who paid $1,500 last month for surgery on both eyes in Montreal to
correct his nearsightedness.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the savings is the exchange rate. For
every U.S. dollar, a visitor to Canada gets about $1.48 Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   Another is a complex pricing structure in the United States that
adds to the expense with doctor referral fees, and a $260 premium
that doctors must pay to the laser manufacturer every time they use
the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are currently being ripped off,'' said
Michael R. Henderson, president and chief executive of the Lasik
Vision Corp., Canada's largest laser eye surgery company. ``I would
classify it as gouging.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, some surgeons say they aren't bothered by the Canadian
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not threatened by it,'' said Dr. Michael Belin, medical
director of LCA Vision in Albany, where the surgery costs $2,500
per eye. ``I think there will always be enough people who want
quality care and a sub-group who wants the cheapest care.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the laser most commonly used in Canada is not the type
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and that
Americans who choose surgery in Canada don't have the same
malpractice protection as in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson said the lasers used in Canada are more advanced
than those currently in use in the United States and that only
protectionism, not safety, has prevented their approval here.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Americans do have the right to sue for malpractice
in the Canadian court system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors charging $5,000 for both eyes are anxious to hold onto
that,'' he said. Henderson's company has been marketing to U.S.
customers with newspaper ads and seminars.
</P>
<P>
   The company estimates that about 30 percent of the customers at
its 11 Canadian clinics come from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Lemza of Warrensburg, N.Y., said cost was only one
factor when she chose to have her eyes corrected with laser surgery
in 1995, the same year the procedure was approved in the United
States by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time it was the experience factor,'' said Lemza, since
laser surgery had already been approved in Canada several years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, Dr. Stephen Fichman, an ophthalmologist who
runs Laser Image Center in downtown Montreal, had nine patients
from the United States scheduled for surgery. He estimated that
about a third of his practice is Americans from Vermont, New York
and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more expertise here, we've been doing it longer,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And surgeon experience is key, according to the American Academy
of Ophthalmology.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sandra Belmont, a spokeswoman for the Academy and an
ophthalmologist in New York City, has advised prospective patients
to look not only at surgeons' credentials but at the volume of
procedures they perform.
</P>
<P>
   As with many operations, including open heart surgery, doctors
who perform laser eye surgery get better with practice.
</P>
<P>
   With most insurance companies no longer covering the cost of
cataract surgery, health specialists say there is a financial
incentive for doctors to get into the booming business of laser eye
surgery as a way to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Recent federal approval of laser eye surgery for farsightedness
has added millions potential patients. There are 90 million or so
nearsighted people in this country.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost a month after his eye surgery, Hunt has no regrets about
his decision to travel to Montreal. Having worn contacts since he
was a teen-ager, Hunt, 29, said he was tired of the hassles
involved with caring for them.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said he was seeing better as soon as he got up from the
operating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out to dinner that night,'' said Hunt, a sales
specialist for Fleet Bank. ``I could read the menu.''
</P>
<P>
   He heard about Canada and the $1,500 option after seeing a
newspaper ad and attending a 45-minute seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the $250 he's paying to get the required follow-up
visits done with a local doctor, Hunt said he got his money's worth
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``There are better deals out there to
be had.''

 THE ABCs OF HOME DECORATING  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ So often we set out to decorate but the results
don't work as well as rooms in magazines, designer show houses or
professionally designed homes.
</P>
<P>
   Interior designers will tell you that many people tend to build
on their decorating mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one line from `The Matchmaker,' which is the story
`Hello Dolly' was based on, that always comes to mind when I see a
bad room,'' said interior designer George W. Orton III of Orton &AMP;
Orton in Lenox, Mass. ``The line goes, `This hat is not ugly
enough. I've got to put more on it.' It's the same with decorating.
Most people don't know how to edit a room. They try to put
everything they like all together in one room. Unless you have a
trained eye, simplicity is the best way to go. It really is.''
</P>
<P>
   International designer Mario Buatta confirmed the bon mot that
``less is more.'' ``That's what killed chintz in the first place,''
said Buatta (also known as The Prince of Chintz). ``People were
doing whole rooms in chintz, which was overkill. One of my favorite
quotes that I heard is, `We all need a bit of vulgarity in our
lives and a splash of bad taste. But no taste is absolutely
unacceptable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Building a good-looking room is actually tantamount to dressing
yourself. You need a starting point (shape and size). A room is no
different, according to interior designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fashion, the job is easy if you are fortunate enough to
have good bones and proportion,'' said Michel Patterson, co-owner
of Hudson River Fine Interiors in Loudonville, N.Y. ``It's the same
with a room that has nicely appointed moldings, windows or other
focal points such as a fireplace or built-ins. From there you stay
focused on the purpose of the room and its intended use by choosing
things that are appropriately formal or casual.'' Buatta said that
the more you doubt yourself, the worse the room gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When decorating a room, you have to balance the weight and
size around,'' said Carol Dexter, co-owner of Hudson River Fine
Interiors. ``You don't want things spit out around the room, where
your eye is constantly going up and down from piece to piece. Your
eye should move through the room, like it would through a good
painting.''
</P>
<P>
   The designers offer their advice to create a comfortable and
well-designed room:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STARTING OUT
</P>
<P>
   _ Begin with a small room, to build up your confidence. You
don't even need a room full of furnishings; just a few things in a
room can be stunning, if the proportion is right.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give the room a lot of thought before you begin. Figure out
what the needs are to make the room a livable working space. Then
it can start looking good._
</P>
<P>
   Weed out everything that you can live without. Keep only the
pieces you really love, or start out fresh. Sometimes buying a new
chair or sofa is less expensive than reupholstering.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FURNITURE AND ACCESSORIES
</P>
<P>
   _ Plan your furniture design on graph paper. Try various
layouts, establish the function of the room and how you plan to
live in it. Always allow at least three feet for primary traffic
flow. Leave the floor plan in the open and look at it frequently to
help you develop an eye for planning a room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tape together pieces of newspaper the same size as your
furniture to see the actual floor space that the piece will take
up. Move the pieces around the room until you come up with a
comfortable arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Large pieces, such as a fireplace or home entertainment
center, will guide you in the layout of the room. Or create a focal
point such as a grouping of furniture or works of art.
</P>
<P>
   _ Picture groupings can create a real architectural feeling.
Unify a group of pictures, especially family portraits, by using
the same matting material and frame style. A few pictures
side-by-side on each wall around the room look like postage stamps,
not a group.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scale and proportion are everything. All too often fabric
patterns are out of scale, colors aren't balanced and tables or
lamps are either too short or too tall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lighting is critical for the function and ambience of the
room. Be conscious of what you're trying to illuminate. Utility
lighting, which shines downward, is much softer in a room than
lighting that shines upward. Think of lighting as something that
helps create a mood, like stage lighting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TEXTURE AND COLOR
</P>
<P>
   _ Textures should work in harmony with the style of furniture.
Buy large swatches of fabrics, rather than tiny ones, so you can
mix and match and see whether they will work together.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go with more drama on your painted walls, instead of costly
fabrics or furnishings. It's easier to change the paint color than
to reupholster. If you find a paint that works, you can always
switch to a wall covering in the same color.
</P>
<P>
   _ Color intimidates many people. Stick with neutrals and use
accessories for added color. Try using only three or four shades of
your favorite color, chosen from the carpeting or a painting that
you are planning to use. Once you learn the rules, you can become
more daring.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't try to buy everything at once. Give the room time to
evolve, but always keep focused on the result.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you keep clippings of your favorite rooms from magazines,
don't try to combine them into just one room. Instead, use the
magazine pictures when you go shopping to help you and the trained
staff decide what is best for you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay away from trends and status symbols, as they change with
each year. Classic, basic design is timeless.

PUT A CHILL IN THE HEAT OF SUMMER

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ People seem to do more entertaining during the
dog days of August, when the weather is just screaming for
something cold to wet the whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Ice cubes are pretty easy to have on hand, but when you want to
make something a little extra special, you'll need something more
specialized to handle the job.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to make iced coffee or tea, a Margarita, snow cones,
a grape sparkler, health drinks, frosty fruit dessert and other
frozen treats, consider an ice grinder, for making frosty shaved
ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Snow Shaver Ice Grinder by the Progressive International
Corp. in Kent, Wash., sells for approximately $14.99 and can be
found in most kitchenwares departments and specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Ice Grinder is also handy for making beds of ice for hors
d'oeuvres, appetizers, salads, shrimp, clams, oysters and cracked
crab claws, among other uses. Use pre-chilled glasses, mugs, bowls,
trays or dishes to keep the shaved ice frozen longer.
</P>
<P>
   You also can freeze your favorite juice, tea, coffee, soft drink
or other flavored beverage to shave up and put in your drink so it
doesn't get diluted.
</P>
<P>
   To make a smoother texture, process all ingredients, including
the shaved ice, in a blender for one minute.
</P>
<P>
   Snow cones can be made by shaving ice and adding a flavor
packet. Freezing dulls the flavor of most anything, so be sure to
add enough sweetner, seasoning or flavoring.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is easy to use. Start by filling the four enclosed
plastic freezing cups with water or flavored beverage and place in
your freezer.
</P>
<P>
   After the ice is frozen, remove the ice and place in the manual
grinder with a bowl or cup underneath to catch the ice shavings.
Secure lid on top and turn the handle clockwise to shave ice.
</P>
<P>
   Like any product that does cutting, always keep hands and
fingers away from the sharp blades and refrain from engaging in ice
snowball fights.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanup is easy with just soap and warm water, rinse and dry.

SWEPT AWAY BY RICKY'S LOCO MOTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a crucial question. The Wall Street Journal asks: Is
Ricky Martin more than just a teen idol?
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee, our all-purpose advice columnist, was surprised to see
the details of this debate in the news columns of the Journal. But
the paper is, after all, the Daily Diary of the American Dream, and
who is more dreamy than the Divine Ricky, His Hotness, beloved idol
of millions?
</P>
<P>
   But who are these millions? Are Ricky's admirers callow
adolescents? Or are they vibrant, mature women of taste, women much
like Dee Dee herself?
</P>
<P>
   According to the Journal story, this question is at the heart of
a lawsuit. The publisher of a teenage magazine, Tiger Beat, is
suing the publisher of a soap opera magazine, Daytime Digest, for
producing a Ricky Martin issue, in alleged violation of a
``noncompete'' agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee thinks this suit seems a bit frivolous when every
publication short of the Episcopal Times has Ricky Martin on its
cover. But there it is. So, is Ricky Martin primarily a teen idol?
Can we shed any light on this question by looking into Dee Dee's
mailbag? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The title of my PhD thesis is ``A World Without War: Livin' La
Vida Loca.'' Currently, a Ricky Martin recording is being played
somewhere in the world every 40 seconds. Think about the
ramifications. Obviously, women of all cultures are united in their
adoration of Ricky. I believe international strife would cease if
we had even more Ricky and less traditional diplomacy. He is just
so hot. What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   _ Burning Up, Shadbush, MA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee agrees that Ricky is really hot, but also incredibly
cool. She, too, feels strongly that his extraordinary powers should
be used for good, not evil. In a recent interview, Ricky revealed
an inclination to be an international peacemaker, saying that his
``dream dinner'' would include Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,
Albert Einstein, the Dalai Lama, and Pope John Paul II. Dee Dee is
sure they'd all be simply thrilled to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may surprise you to learn that I was married to Ricky Martin
for almost two whole days. During that time, I came to realize that
he is the reincarnation of Elvis. This comes straight from the
horse's mouth, because I was married to Elvis, too, for the better
part of a week. Anyway, Ricky/Elvis is here to lead us to a higher
plane. I would appreciate your help in getting the word out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two-Time Winner, Peachbottom, CT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done. Dee Dee is ready to follow Ricky anywhere. In
her expert opinion, his appeal transcends ethnicity, geography,
language, age, and, apparently, rationality.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It makes me sick, sick, sick to think of Ricky and Madonna
together. She is old enough to be his mother. Shouldn't he be
involved with somebody closer to his own age? Somebody who'll be 15
in November?
</P>
<P>
   _ Disgruntled, Pingo, R.I. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Ricky and Madonna is strictly
professional, for the most part, at least. She did say she thinks
he's ``really, really cute,'' but she's only human, in spite of
everything you might hear. Dee Dee would like to point out that
Ricky is 27 years old, too old for the likes of you, young lady. He
has been known to date ``older'' women of 35. Dee Dee is certain he
would prefer the company of a woman mature enough to look beyond
his obvious physical appeal and appreciate his mind, a woman with
whom he has something in common. Dee Dee understands that, like a
certain all-purpose advice columnist, Ricky eats Raisin Bran for
breakfast every day. So why hasn't he called?

DON'T DEPEND ON AN EXHAUSTED STOCK MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What steps can I take to make the most of my retirement funds
over the next five years until age 70, when I plan to retire and
start living on these funds? I have about $230,000 in bank CDs,
having always taken a very conservative approach with these funds.
However, given the continued economic growth predicted over the
next several years, I would be willing to take a somewhat more
aggressive stance.
</P>
<P>
   P.U., Huntington Beach, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe we are somewhere near the end of the longest growth
spurt in recent economic history, so I wouldn't change my investing
habits very substantially based on a hunch that these good times
will last another five years.
</P>
<P>
   I also think you're taking a reverse approach.
</P>
<P>
   Most people maintain a fairly risk-oriented portfolio during
their working years, and then begin to moderate the risk level at
just about the point where you now are _ five years before
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   I'm always fairly leery of people who want to change
long-established financial habits, and particularly when the change
comes once retirement is looming. I think that they've realized
they haven't saved enough, and then look to riskier investments in
hopes of catching up. It is frequently a formula for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   I usually advise people at your stage is to begin moving their
portfolio toward the configuration it will have once they do retire
and begin calling upon it for an income stream.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you plan to have the majority of your money in
bond funds to provide that income stream, you might now begin to
slowly transfer from the CDs to the bond funds over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're thinking of moving into the stock market for the
next half decade and then returning to CDs once you retire, I'm
dead against it: Five years is simply too short a period for
predictable growth on the equity side.
</P>
<P>
   If you are hell-bent for equities despite my warnings, I suggest
you tiptoe very gently, going no further than investing a small
amount of the savings _ certainly no more than a third _ in proven
balanced funds such as Fidelity Puritan or Vanguard Wellington,
which usually maintain about a third of their assets on the
fixed-income side.
</P>
<P>
   But I'd be much happier to see you inch toward a solid
income-oriented portfolio. What I usually recommend is about half
of the money in a good GNMA fund; a quarter of it in a well-managed
high-yield bond fund; and the rest very conservatively invested in
a short-term bond fund, a money market fund, or bank CDs.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to move to such a portfolio and those achieved a
yield of 6.89 percent, your $230,000 would grow to $320,951 over
five years, and at that stage the pool would produce an annual
income stream of $22,133. Such a course strikes me as much more
prudent than hoping for great things from an exhausted stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 57 and plan to semi-retire at age 59 1/2 and begin
drawing on my tax-deferred accounts, which now amount to $451,923.
Can I replace about $50,000 of earned income with (mostly) earnings
from this portfolio, a listing of which is attached?
</P>
<P>
   J.H., Newton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the portfolio is left alone for the next 30 months and
grows at an average annual rate of 9 percent for that period, you
would enter retirement with $561,290.
</P>
<P>
   To support a sequence of $4,166 monthly withdrawals without
depleting the principal would require average portfolio returns of
9.285 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem a reasonable expectation in view of the
stock-market returns of the past few years, but I think it's a very
dicey proposition to rely on such gains for an income stream.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown of your holdings shows just 19.3 percent of the
portfolio on the fixed-income side, and the yield from stocks and
stock funds is very low at this point.
</P>
<P>
   So what you're really counting on is living on continued capital
gains from your stocks and stock funds. Your portfolio is nicely
balanced (aside from the scarcity of holdings on the fixed-income
side), but I think you're asking more than the markets are likely
to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   I think you could withdraw funds at an annual rate of $40,000,
or $3,333 a month. This would call for a 7.34 percent average
portfolio return to support the withdrawals without erosion of
principal.
</P>
<P>
   Why am I so studiously ignoring the parenthetical word you
included when you asked whether the portfolio's earnings would
(mostly) support the withdrawal sequence you propose? That's
because age 59 1/2 is a pretty early age to retire.
</P>
<P>
   People who retire comfortably at such an age usually try to have
some savings in excess of what they need for their living expenses,
with these savings left in a growth portfolio to protect them from
the ravages of inflation during retirement.
</P>
<P>
   There are your options: Rebudget for your retirement; embark on
an aggressive saving campaign for the final 30 months before
retiring; or delay retirement a little bit longer. If you decide on
the first option, I suggest you begin building a substantial
fixed-income side to this portfolio right now.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to add substantially to the portfolio during the
next 30 months, put all new money into fixed-income holdings, and
move some of your current holdings to bonds and similar
investments.
</P>
<P>
   And if you decide to delay your retirement a bit, you could move
a little slower, but you still should begin adding to the
fixed-income side.

HUNTER'S TOWN PITCHES IN 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERTFORD, N.C. _ Each day, they offer up prayers to the heavens,
that courage and grace might continue to rain down, that their old
friend might continue to get soaked with those blessings. Most
evenings, they travel for nearly two hours to visit him, driving
along a trail of state highways, threading through pastoral towns
resembling their own, sometimes getting stuck behind slow-moving
traffic when the summer heat is virtually unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what you do for an old friend. You close your eyes
and bow your head and petition on his behalf. You go to the
hospital to see him. Even when you can't see him, when you know
that after two hours of driving you won't get any farther than the
intensive care unit waiting room, you go, again and again. You
offer comfort and support to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Surely they will tell him you're right outside. He'll enjoy
hearing that, knowing that while he's fighting the battle of his
life, you're right there. And, if you could, you'd get in a couple
of licks, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Hunter has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an incurable
neuromuscular disease that causes the nervous system to collapse
and the muscles to atrophy. It is also known as Lou Gehrig's
disease, named after the New York Yankees Hall of Famer who died of
it in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Hunter, 53, also played for the Yankees. He won two of his
five World Series rings with the Bronx Bombers, in 1977 and 1978.
You might know him as Catfish Hunter, the Hall of Famer who also
won three World Series titles with the Oakland Athletics (1972-74),
finished with 224 career victories, and pitched a perfect game for
Oakland in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   For the folks in this town of 2,500, he's Jimmy Hunter. They've
known him all their lives; their lives have been touched by his,
and his by theirs. This is where he grew up, a farmboy playing
baseball, hunting, and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   This is where he lured pro scouts with his awesome talent. This
is where he retired following his 15-year baseball career and
replanted his roots, unchanged by the glamour and fame of big-city
life.
</P>
<P>
   And, sadly, this is where Hunter slowly has deteriorated since
being diagnosed with ALS last November, losing the ability to move
his arms, shoulders. and hands. His friends and neighbors watch
helplessly as he drifts farther and farther away from the days when
he was the best pitcher in major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Hunter was unconscious and in intensive care after
falling backward and hitting his head while climbing steps outside
his home. Because he cannot move his arms, he was unable to cushion
his fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he was transferred from a hospital near his home to
Pitt County Memorial Hospital, which serves the East Carolina
University Medical School. His condition was downgraded from
serious to critical. He regained consciousness Monday, and on
Wednesday, he was alert and responding to doctors' commands and
indicated that he wanted the ventilator tube removed from his
throat.
</P>
<P>
   According to Vaughan, Hunter was able to lift his leg and wiggle
his toes Saturday, but he's still in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   His friends began going to Pitt County Wednesday. Upon arrival,
they meet with Jim's wife, Helen, or other family members in the
waiting room, offer prayer and support, and receive progress
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be the charm of 2,500 people,'' said Rev. Keith
Vaughan, the Hunters' pastor and family spokesman. ``This is
family. They're going knowing they're not going to be able to see
Jimmy, but they can see Helen and let her know they're praying for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when people leave, everyone says, `If there's
anything I can do for you, please call me.' In a lot of places, you
may think that sounds trite. Here, when they say that, they
literally mean it, even the smallest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Vaughan released a statement saying that though
Hunter's condition remained critical, he ``continues to make slow
progress and continues to respond to doctors and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the release was a statement from Helen: ``Our family
truly appreciates the love and support that we have felt during
this past week. Prayer works, and we believe that Jimmy's progress
thus far is largely due to the many people who have been praying
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The street in front of Perquimans County High School, which
Hunter led to a state title in 1964, is named for him. His name is
on a sign just off Highway 17 leading into town. It also graces one
of two four-foot stone monuments in the downtown area (the other
honors a prominent dentist).
</P>
<P>
   But the signs say, ``Jim Hunter,'' not ``Catfish.'' You won't
see much ``Catfish'' around town. That nickname was bestowed on
Hunter by former Athletics owner Charlie O. Finley for publicity
purposes. Finley concocted a story about a young Jimmy Hunter
coming home late with catfish after fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I heard it, I said, `Well, that's what they're
calling him out there,' '' said longtime friend Paul Gregory.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter began drawing notice after that state championship and a
stellar stint in American Legion baseball. Gregory said townsfolk
filled the school stands when Hunter worked out for scouts of the
then-Kansas City Athletics in the mid '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we realized how good he was until Charlie Finley
saw him,'' said childhood friend Ed Nixon, the uncle of Red Sox
outfielder Trot Nixon, whose father, William, also grew up with
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was better than anything that ever been around
here,'' Nixon said. ``But knowing the caliber of the players we
watched on TV, we said, `Can Jimmy play with those guys?' And he
showed us he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter never played minor league baseball. After being signed by
the A's and placed on the disabled list in 1964 because of a foot
injury, he posted an 8-8 mark as a 19-year-old rookie the following
year. He went on to have five consecutive 20-win seasons, from
1971-75, with his best season coming in 1974. His 25-12 record and
league-leading 2.49 earned run average that year won him the Cy
Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter had a 4-3 mark in the American League Championship Series
and a 5-3 mark in the World Series, but his greatest single-game
feat was the perfect game he threw on May 8, 1968, against the
Minnesota Twins.

 HERTFORD, N.C.: ... Minnesota Twins.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I remember when we got into the seventh, he called me to the
mound and said, `We've got a no-no going,' '' said Jim Pagliaroni,
who caught the perfect game. ``That broke the ice for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never mention it. But he still went out and got the
perfect game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagliaroni said Finley tried to seize the moment by presenting
Hunter with a check for $5,000 on the field the following Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked Finley, `What about my catcher?' '' Pagliaroni said.
``Finley said, `The catcher doesn't get anything.' And Jim said,
`My catcher does, or I don't.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So Finley gave Pagliaroni a check for $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very next start, he pitched against the Twins again, and
gave up seven runs in an inning and a third,'' said Pagliaroni.
``Then he came up to me and said, `I'm the same guy who threw a
perfect game to these guys.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter also will be remembered as baseball's first big-money
free agent, signing with the Yankees in 1974 for a reported $3.75
million. He retired in 1980 and was inducted into the Hall of Fame
seven years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with or against 49 future Hall of Famers,'' said
Pagliaroni, ``and they all played with a sense of dignity and
grace. Jimmy was that way.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since returning here, Hunter has been the community salve, often
spearheading efforts to help families in crisis. He held
fund-raising dinners and, before being afflicted with ALS,
autographed baseballs and donated them to the local Lions' Club,
which would sell them at fund-raisers for $5 each. He also coached
his son's Little League teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small town, and you have your best friend when you grow
up, and he's like the town's best friend or your best neighbor,''
said Charles Woodard, pharmacist and owner of a drugstore, who has
known Hunter since elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Both men married their high school sweethearts. Their close
friendship continued even when Hunter was in the majors; for years,
if you wanted to reach Hunter, you contacted Woodard. The
pharmacist's mother, Helen, is like a second mother to Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The two were together when Hunter initially complained of
symptoms that eventually were diagnosed as ALS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were riding out to play golf, and Jimmy says, `Charles, my
hand's been kind of numb and tingling lately,' '' said Woodard. ``I
told him maybe it was a pinched nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   When the numbness and tingling grew worse, Woodard said, Hunter
visited Pitt County and the Duke University Medical Center. Neither
hospital diagnosed the ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, he was signing his signature and I noticed it was
getting smaller,'' said Woodard, who had heard that that was an
early sign of ALS. He encouraged Hunter to go to Johns Hopkins
Medical Center, where a battery of tests revealed the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had not signed any baseballs until October,'' said Woodard.
``He would come into my store to sign and would have to hold the
ball between his legs. Then he would go to the bathroom and run hot
water on his hands, and come out and say, ``Charles, can't you give
me something? I ain't worth two cents.' ''
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 Americans have the disease, which eventually is
fatal because of the failure of respiratory muscles; death usually
occurs within three years of diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Woodard, Hunter was relieved to finally know
what was wrong, after nearly six months of watching his limbs
slowly deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `At least I know what I got now, let's try to find
something to help,' '' said Woodard. ``It was a big load off his
mind. Even though it was bad news it was worse not knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been difficult for Hunter's friends to watch his
deterioration. The arm that once hurled pitches with pinpoint
accuracy now hangs lifelessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so surprised the first time that he couldn't pick a
sandwich up and eat it,'' said Helen Woodard. ``(His wife) would
have to put it up to his mouth so he could bite it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few days ago, he sat down and his arm was hanging down. He
told me to put his arm on the table. I told him, `I'm scared I'm
going to hurt you.' He said, `How you going to hurt something that
don't have any feeling in it?' I could see him getting worse all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``His wife has been wonderful to him, because everything that
has been done for him, she does. Now when I say everything, I mean
everything, from clothing to feeding to bathing, all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's family and friends remain hopeful that he will recover
from the fall and will be able to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What disturbs me,'' said Charles Woodard, ``is that I've had a
lot of these folks come in the last few days since he's got hurt,
and they say, `He's got ALS, what's there to do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had several folks say the best thing to happen would be
for Jimmy to die, so he wouldn't have to suffer down the road. But
in this business I'm in, you see people with cancer, you see it for
years. The thing is, we don't know what the future will bring us.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Hunter was diagnosed, Ed Nixon helped create the
Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter ALS Foundation, which raises money for the
national ALS foundation. His son, Nick, designed the organization's
logo, a baseball with Yankees and A's insignias and the numbers
Hunter wore (29 with the Yankees, 27 with the A's).
</P>
<P>
   ``We started it around Thanksgiving,'' said Nixon. ``He had just
been diagnosed, and we said he has done so much for the community
and us, we should do something for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation kicked off with a fund-raiser in May. Among the
3,000 people in attendance were eight former major leaguers,
including Pagliaroni, Tommy John, and Gaylord Perry.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is slated to hold a celebrity golf tournament
Nov. 6. An area McDonald's recently gave a portion of its day's
proceeds to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan called Hunter's ailment one of the most devastating
things to happen to this small town. Yet he said the family's
courage has been an inspiration to everyone, and the town's support
likewise has been an inspiration to the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sal Bando was at our ALS foundation kickoff, and he said to us
that he believed that when God had a special job to do, He chose a
special person for that job,'' said Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he believed that Jimmy was chosen by God for this time
to draw awareness to ALS to help people who have ALS to cope with
it. And that has really helped me deal with this, to help answer
the why question. I can't think of anybody any more special to be
chosen for anything. And he's handled it very well.''

NEW PARLIAMENT FURTHER EMBOLDENS NATIONALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURGH _ Last month, as officials planned the ceremony to
mark the opening of the first Scottish Parliament in nearly 300
years, an aide to Queen Elizabeth II suggested the monarch sit in
the speaker's chair.
</P>
<P>
   A Scottish official leaned over and discreetly informed the
queen's aide that her majesty might want to sit elsewhere, given
that there had been a war over a similar seating arrangement a few
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was a classically awkward moment for the English and the
Scots, and it was one that would only feed the perception here that
the British establishment in London knows little and cares less
about Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   But while the sitting of a Scottish Parliament for the first
time since 1707 has not convinced most Scots that the English are
any less indifferent toward them, it has forced independence-minded
nationalists to rethink their position.
</P>
<P>
   The devolution of power from London to Edinburgh is part of
Prime Minister Tony Blair's attempt to give local government more
authority. But it is also part of the government's strategy to
weaken the independence movement in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   There are two schools of thought about what the new Parliament
means. One, adhered to by the Blair administration, holds that it
has made the independence movement irrelevant because devolution
gives Scotland's 5 million people most of the autonomy they want.
The Scottish Parliament has limited tax-raising power and will
oversee health, education, housing, and the criminal justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   But the other school holds that by leaving to the British
Parliament in Westminster ultimate control over how much money
Scotland gets to spend _ not to mention control over foreign
affairs, defense, social security, and taxation _ the new
Parliament will only whet the appetite for greater autonomy and
ultimate independence.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a nondescript four-story Victorian building just off
Charlotte Square, Alex Salmond is decidedly in the latter camp. As
leader of the Scottish National Party, Salmond believes the new
Parliament will be a steppingstone to independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll get there in six or seven years,'' said Salmond,
a 45-year-old economist who hasn't worn a kilt since he was 4 and
considers national sovereignty more a matter of economics than
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the National Party uses popular appeal in seeking
converts. In the hallway of its headquarters is a portrait of actor
Sean Connery, who is an outspoken party supporter and who was
applauded more warmly than the queen the day Parliament opened. In
several offices, there are posters of the Oscar-winning film
``Braveheart,'' about the Scottish rebel William Wallace, who
united Scotland's fractious clans and made life miserable for the
English who colonized them.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that the new Parliament may produce an
initial period of complacency, Salmond believes the the
independence movement is inexorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, our party had 14 percent of the vote. Now, we
have 30 percent of the vote. And we've done that with a powerful
government in London that had every gun trained against us, and
with a press that is totally hostile to us,'' said Salmond, whose
party is often dismissed in the London-based national newspapers as
hopelessly idealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only two things can happen,'' he said. ``One, the Parliament
won't work. More likely, the Parliament is seen to work. But that
raises the question: If it can run education, why can't it run the
economy? It should be a real Parliament, not a hamstrung one.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Dewar, the new Parliament's first minister and a former
top aide to Blair, points out that 70 percent of voters cast
ballots for parties opposed to independence. While that is true,
there also has been a resurgence of Scottish pride in the almost
two years since the Scots voted overwhelmingly to set up their own
Parliament. While Salmond has an aversion to kilts, a growing
number of Scottish men wear them at their weddings.
</P>
<P>
   What angers Salmond and other nationalists is that while Blair
has spent so much time trying to end the politically motivated
violence in Northern Ireland, he will not consider Scottish
independence. They believe their strict adherence to democratic
methods, their fostering of the quietest revolution of the 20th
century, has been underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one got so much as a nosebleed over Scottish independence,
and Blair treats the subject with utter contempt,'' Salmond said.
``Wouldn't it be wonderful if those who conducted themselves
democratically were accorded the same attention and respect as
those who don't?''
</P>
<P>
   While polls show a hefty majority against independence, what is
striking in conversations here in the month after Parliament opened
is how many people who oppose independence have nonetheless
concluded that it is probably inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   At 18, James Gallagher is studying astrophysics at the
University of Edinburgh. He believes there will be independence
within 20 years, and that it will be a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Scotland goes independent, I'm out of here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Gallagher acknowledged he had never felt more proud
to be Scottish than on the day Parliament opened. ``It was also the
first day I ever remember hearing more Scottish accents in
Edinburgh than American ones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Macrae, a native Highlander who captains a tour boat on
the Firth of Forth, said the opening of Parliament has boosted
confidence among Scots. ``A lot of people are afraid of
independence because there has been this assumption we can't run
our own affairs. I think Parliament will show we can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly in a country that produced Adam Smith,
the 18th-century economist, most people believe the market will
ultimately decide whether Scotland becomes independent. Most Scots,
even those who oppose independence, believe they are subsidizing
the rest of the United Kingdom, and want the rights to North Sea
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor of independence point to other small European
countries, such as Ireland, Sweden, and Denmark, that have
prospered in a European Union where national borders increasingly
are becoming less relevant. Denmark, with about the same population
as Scotland, has the highest standard of living in Europe. The
Irish, with 3.6 million people, have had the fastest-growing
economy in Europe for the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Barber, director of Business for Scotland, a group
affiliated with the National Party that touts the economic case for
independence, said the British government does not promote Scotland
well when attracting investment. She said the government's attitude
about Scotland as a place to do business reflects a wider English
attitude toward Scots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not malicious. It's ignorance. At conferences, they'll
sell tins of shortbread, as if that's how to attract investment in
Scotland,'' she said. ``We can't market ourselves because we aren't
in control of our own identity.''
</P>
<P>
   The days of big factories with jobs for hundreds are gone. About
98 percent of Scottish businesses employ 50 people or fewer. Like
their fellow Celts in Ireland, the Scots believe the quality of
life here will help them attract software, design, and other
industries that require educated workforces and are not as
vulnerable to shifting economics.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cunningham is an engineer from Glasgow. He never thought of
himself as a nationalist, but after turning 40 this year he
realized something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people I went to school with left Scotland. I
thought about it, too. But I never did, and now I realize that
there's something about the place that's kept me here. Call it the
quality of life, or feeling tied to the land, but it's real,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cunningham spends much of his time recruiting young
engineers to stay in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotland produces 2,500 engineer and science graduates a year,
and 85 percent of them leave the country,'' he said. ``A lot of it
is about self-confidence. If we can turn that around, if the best
and the brightest stay, I think you'll see a much different
Scotland in 10 years.''

FOOD SURPLUSES SPURRING FARM CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa &UR;  &LR; _ The 13 metropolitan Des Moines
Republicans, gathered in a basement room in a shopping center, were
asked the other evening by GOP pollster Frank Lutz to hold their
right fists out. Thumbs up, he said, if you think things are going
all right in Iowa; thumbs down, if not.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve thumbs quickly went up among the office workers,
professionals, and small business people. The one thumb that went
down belonged to a middle-aged man who farms part-time.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty miles northeast in the ``other'' Iowa, state agriculture
secretary Patty Judge had a different request for a hundred
residents gathered on a farm outside of town. Don't sit idly by,
she said, if you notice a neighbor start to withdraw or utter dark
thoughts. Intervene, use the rural hotlines, visit more, don't
leave your friends to feel alone. Her plea was anything but
alarmist. Paramedics say they are responding to a huge increase in
daily calls stemming from family trouble _ abuse, alcoholism,
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Back east and out west, city and suburban folk think the problem
is drought, a self-centered impression, because there is a very bad
drought in the East right now _ but not here. Here, the corn is
high, the bean bushes are full, the fields are green, and the
animals are fat. That is a clue to the problem _ which is not
simply Iowan, but worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, commodity prices have been falling steadily and
alarmingly, to where they now rest well below the cost of producing
them. In one commodity or another, that's anything but unheard of.
Boom and bust may be an overstatement, but up and down certainly
defines the very nature of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   But this is different. This time around, the price of everything
is on the basement floor. Around here, corn is going for around
$1.60 a bushel, fully 80 cents below the basic costs of production
(land and machinery debt, fertilizer, seed, and insurance).
Soybeans locally can be sold at $4.40 a bushel, or way under the
roughly $6 cost of production. Same for hogs, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the official news got even worse. Back in
Washington, the Agriculture Department forecast possibly the third
largest domestic corn crop on record and the largest ever in
soybeans. The problem isn't costs, it's the dramatically changed
nature of worldwide supply. Vice President Al Gore, who uses the
word crisis appropriately, noted last week that you have to go back
to the 1920s preceding the Depression to see prices below costs
across the board.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he also noted, is large, and growing surpluses
affect all commodities all over the world. Countries that had been
net importers of foodstuffs are now dumping their own surpluses on
a bursting world market. Short-term, the Asian financial crisis and
recessions have added to the strain, but protectionism restricting
US exports remains a major irritant.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, all this is occurring in the face of a
three-year-old American ag policy that is making the situation even
worse, especially for the smaller family operations on which so
much of rural and small-town life depends. The misnamed 1996
Freedom to Farm Bill, like the welfare reform of the same year, was
a close call for President Clinton, and in the end he signed both;
but while the results from drastic welfare changes are so far
mostly positive, the results from the ag policy lurch stink.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's purpose was to gradually end, via transition
payments, the system of subsidized supply-limiting policies
(set-asides, conservation reserves, low-interest rate loans, and
direct payments) that existed in various forms since FDR's time. As
Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack says, it was a measure that in many
respects made sense with worthwhile goals, but was designed for
good times and based on the assumption of relatively stable, at the
time high, prices. Instead, Congress has had to step in with
Band-Aids of ``emergency'' aid each year, with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in an example of how rapidly the family farm crisis
is affecting politics, Gore said the bill, and by extension
Clinton's signature, was a mistake: ``It isn't working; it needs to
be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   What's missing is a safety net, more of sounder policies than
simply money, much of which is still going to the big shots who
need it least. That should mean support for farmer-owned reserves,
as well as for disastrously low prices. It should mean far more
aggressive moves to bust open foreign markets, no more
self-defeating food embargoes, and more purchase of foodstuffs for
donation to people who are starving. It should mean more support
for processing businesses closer to the farms and tougher use of
the antitrust laws against the agribusiness giants.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's forceful advocacy has helped solidify his political
position here and evoked belated me-tooism from challenger Bill
Bradley. It also frames a helpful contrast with George W. Bush's
mushy nonpositions and with the central-bank bashing of pols
further to his right. But this is bigger than politics. The crisis
out here is real and spreading, and the quarter-measures now before
Congress don't come within a country mile of it.

CAN THERE EVER BE A GOOD REASON TO TAKE A LIFE _ EVEN MERCY? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.M., Ariz.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk to legal experts about the likely fate of Raffi Kodikian,
who slew his close friend in what he claims was a mercy killing in
the New Mexico desert, and you eventually find yourself back in
1884, bobbing in a small lifeboat in the storm-tossed waters off
the Cape of Good Hope.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that two British sailors, in the desperate days
after being shipwrecked, made a horrifying choice to kill and eat a
suffering crew member.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the way the English legal system handled that murder
case shapes the way American jurisprudence deals with killings when
the facts meet the definition of murder but circumstances argue for
a lesser punishment.
</P>
<P>
   It's particularly relevant at a time when society seems torn
between a legal recognition of the sanctity of life and an
increasing feeling that certain exceptions should be made.
</P>
<P>
   Although Oregon has a functioning physician-assisted-suicide
law, there is no general legal right of mercy killings in the
United States. Even if Kodikian could prove David Coughlin, his
longtime friend and traveling companion, asked to be killed after
allegedly becoming lost and dehydrated in the desert heat, that
doesn't excuse the killing or protect Kodikian from prosecution.
Nor would it in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no euthanasia on our law books,'' says Martha
Coakley, Middlesex (Mass.) County district attorney. ``This set of
facts does not fit any concept that the law recognizes to say it is
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if such a general right did exist in this country, it's
equally clear no reasonable law would cover Kodikian's case. For
example, Oregon's law, under which at least 15 people have chosen
to end their lives, requires that a patient be terminally ill with
less than six months to live. That diagnosis must be made by the
primary-care physician and confirmed by a second doctor. Even then,
a patient must make multiple requests and be counseled about
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in reality, the American legal system has found a way to
take a motive of mercy into account. It has come to treat genuine
mercy killings _ which the Kodikian case may or may not prove to be
_ far differently from other slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murder is murder, but an elderly man who kills his terminally
ill wife of 60 years because he can't stand to see her in great
pain is different from someone who holds you up and blows you away
just for the fun of it,'' says John Hasnas, a professor at George
Mason University School of Law. ``What usually happens is that
there is a conviction, but at sentencing there is very little real
jail time.''
</P>
<P>
   With feelings mixed about mercy killing and the facts uncertain
and troubling in his case, and a victim who was neither terminally
ill nor close to death, what can Kodikian expect from the justice
system?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not a decision against prosecution; legal experts say
murder or manslaughter charges seem all but inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Although a judge's discretion is severely limited by strict
sentences for first- or second-degree murder, one obvious
possibility would be a plea bargain to a lesser charge, which would
allow more sentencing discretion; such plea bargaining is another
way that true mercy killings are unofficially acknowledged in
today's courts. A second, of course, would be the unwillingness of
a jury to convict on the most severe charges.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails? Well, then the governor could use his powers
of clemency to modify a sentence he deems too dire for a murder or
manslaughter mitigated by motive. If so, Kodikian would be the
beneficiary of the principle that the ordeal of the shipwrecked
sailors helped establish more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was in July 1884 that the yacht Mignonette, carrying Captain
Tom Dudley and mate Edwin Stephens, was capsized by a gale-driven
wave en route to Australia. Two others were in the lifeboat with
them: seaman Edmund Brooks, 39, and Richard Parker, a 17-year-old
cabin boy.
</P>
<P>
   Adrift with no water and only two small tins of turnips, the
four at first survived by killing a turtle. That sustained them
temporarily, but after several weeks adrift the situation had
become extreme.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, it was common practice for stranded seamen to
survive by cannibalism, sometimes by drawing lots for who was to
die. In this case, however, the cabin boy, who had been driven by
thirst to drink substantial amounts of seawater, had been ill for
three days, and, the others believed, would soon die.
</P>
<P>
   On their 20th day adrift, Stephens and Dudley killed the boy
with a knife. The three men drank his blood and consumed his flesh.
Four days later, they were rescued by a sailing ship and
subsequently returned to England.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had followed standard and accepted practices: Wait as
long as you can, and when you can't wait any longer, sacrifice the
weakest person closest to death,'' said Hasnas, who has studied the
case closely. ``Had the case been done in a normal way, they
probably would have been acquitted.''
</P>
<P>
   English authorities, however, wanted to set a precedent that
would end the practice of shipwreck cannibalism, and so tried the
two men for murder, with the expectation, and perhaps tacit
agreement, that clemency would be forthcoming after the sentence.
Which it was: After her home secretary pressured a reluctant Queen
Victoria, the death sentence was commuted to six months'
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Parallels exist between the two cases. In both, the killers
(assuming their stories to be true) believed the person they killed
would soon perish anyway. In both cases, thirst and dehydration
were the threats.
</P>
<P>
   A significant difference, of course, is that while Parker's
death helped the other three live, Coughlin's death doesn't seem to
have aided Kodikian's quest for survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of Regina v. Dudley and Stephens is that we
are not going to call this something other than murder,'' says
Boston defense attorney Harvey Silverglate, ``but when there is a
murder conviction in a case that people are uneasy about, there are
fail-safes for smoothing the rough edges of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what Kodikian may have believed, Coughlin, though
dehydrated and likely in some discomfort, was hardly terminally ill
or in severe pain. Nor was Kodikian, as a nonphysician, competent
to judge his friend's prospects for survival.
</P>
<P>
   And a request to die, even assuming one believes Kodikian's
account, isn't a justification for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person can want to die, or thinks he wants to die, even when
it is not in his best interest to have that wish fulfilled,'' notes
Michael Sandel, a Harvard government professor who teaches a course
on justice and ethical dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   The same message comes from a key prosecutor in the Kodikian
case. Stressing he is speaking only generally, and not about this
case, Chief Deputy District Attorney Les Williams, who is in charge
of the Kodikian case, says: ``The law doesn't let you kill people
because they ask you to.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, New Mexico investigators are treating Kodikian's claims
with healthy skepticism. Meanwhile, the fact that Kodikian, a
former Boston Globe editorial assistant, was questioned, however
routinely, as part of the investigation of the 1996 murder of
Swedish nanny Karina Holmer adds another bizarre twist, and some
further reason for skepticism, to his tale.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if investigators can't find signs of a fight or violence,
then Kodikian's case would fall into that troubling gray area where
the punishment stipulated for the crime _ in this case, the
possible penalties for first-degree murder are death or a minimum
of 30 years in prison _ doesn't seem to fit the facts of the
circumstance. (The relatively low $50,000 cash bail set for
Kodikian, and the judge's decision on Friday to let him leave the
state, seems to suggest that prosecutors are not viewing him as a
cold-blooded murderer.)
</P>
<P>
   Although motive matters at sentencing, it is intent that will
eventually determine what crime was committed. ``The law is real
simple,'' says Williams. ``If you think about killing a person, and
you weigh the pros and cons of killing them, and decide to kill
them, that is first-degree murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Some possible defenses, Williams says, are if a person kills
another in self-defense or was insane at the time of the killing,
or was so diminished in capacity that he couldn't form the
deliberate intention to take away the life of another. There,
possible delusions brought on by dehydration could come into play.
</P>
<P>
   Williams says New Mexico prosecutes killers of terminally ill
patients as well. Still, in many parts of the country, an informal
policy of euthanasia has evolved, with doctors or nurses subtly
informing the terminally ill or their families about how to end a
life, information usually cloaked in the guise of a warning that a
certain dosage of pain killer will lead to death.
</P>
<P>
   One person whose family experienced that tacit help in ending
the life of a relative in terrible pain with bone cancer said that
the message they received was clear. ``The nurse said, `Here are a
bundle of syringes (of pain-killing drugs). We will leave the room
now. You can deliver one per hour whenever she shows signs of
discomfort, but I have to warn you, if you double the dose, it
could be fatal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that sort of assistance is fairly common occurrence
in this country. ``I know there are many such cases of
physician-assisted suicide,'' says Arthur Caplan, PhD., director of
the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. Most of
those cases either go unreported, Caplan says, or ``the prosecutor
looks at it and says I can never win that, so let's let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, whose high-profile crusade for
euthanasia made him impossible for prosecutors to ignore, had been
acquitted three times (with another prosecution ending in mistrial)
for assisting with suicides. He was finally convicted of murder in
April because he himself administered a fatal dose of drugs to
Thomas Youk, a 52-year-old man who suffered from Lou Gehrig's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian has just as clearly crossed a legal line. Yet, if his
story holds up, though he may well be convicted as a murderer, it's
unlikely that he'll be punished as one.

WHAT CAUSES BODY ODOR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why do different places on our bodies smell differently when
we perspire?
</P>
<P>
   D.M., Hudson, N.H. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This one's no sweat. Our skin has two glands that generate
secretions when we warm up. Different bacteria that live all over
us feed on the nutrients in those secretions. The byproducts of
that bacterial digestion are the olfactory offenders we produce on
a warm day, giving us the aromatic range that is the human bouquet
of summer.
</P>
<P>
   The most common of the two glands is the eccrine gland. There
are three million of them on the average person, according to
Hermes van der Lee, manager of the Gillette Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The eccrine glands produce sweat, which is mostly water, ``one
to three pints a day for the average person not engaged in
strenuous physical activity,'' van der Lee says. ``When the water
on our skin evaporates, it cools us down.''
</P>
<P>
   Eccrine glands are most common on our palms and the soles of our
feet. In the dark moist environment of our shoes, bacteria can make
quite a happy living. The byproduct of their digestion is what
keeps Odor Eaters in business. Given how feet can smell, it's
fortunate that our hands are a tough place for bacteria to survive.
So are our head, trunk, arms and legs. That's why those areas don't
produce their own distinct odors. The sweat is there, but not the
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the moist dark space of the axillae (science-speak for
armpits) a different kind of bacteria dwells. That's part of the
reason why this area of the body has earned its unique aromatic
reputation. The other reason, is those other glands we were taking
about.
</P>
<P>
   They're called apocrine glands, and they don't sweat. They
secrete a milky fluid into the hair follicles, through which the
fluid rises to the surface. When it gets there, bacteria hungrily
munch the proteins, steroids and fats in the fluid, giving off that
special ``Eau de B.O.''
</P>
<P>
   When we're warm, or experiencing certain emotional conditions,
the apocrine glands secrete more of that fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Most lower animals have apocrine glands all over their bodies.
We don't. They're apparently evolving away along with the hairs
they're attached to. They cover the developing human embryo until
22 weeks gestation, then disappear except in our external ear
canals, armpits, genital surfaces, navel, and nipples.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the eccrine glands, though, we have it all over
the rest of the animal kingdom. We're the only animal that's
covered with them. As you travel down the evolutionary tree to
simpler and simpler animals, the number of eccrine glands goes
down, and the number of apocrine glands goes up.
</P>
<P>
   So how does Odor Meister van der Lee do his olfactory vanishing
act with products like Right Guard and Soft 'N Dry? He explains
that deodorants use an antimicrobial agent, usually triclosan, to
kill the bacteria on our skin. Antiperspirants use aluminum salts
to plug up the pores at the top of the eccrine glands. The sweat
produced by the gland can't get out. No sweat, in this case, means
no bacteria food, which means no offending aromas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dr. Sharon K. Inouye's 73-year-old father underwent surgery
last year, she found herself helpless to stop doctors and nurses
from inadvertently doing what she knew were the wrong things.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave him all these medications we know can lead to
delirium,'' recalls Inouye, who studies the mental disturbance.
``They left the urinary catheter in too long. They didn't get him
out of bed. And there I was, an expert on delirium, sitting at his
bedside, and I couldn't prevent it from happening. He had about 12
different doctors, and I couldn't get to all of them every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the elder Inouye, a physician himself, developed a
severe case of delirium, becoming agitated, not recognizing his
family, and fighting against caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   Inouye, a Yale University geriatrician, is perhaps the leading
authority on delirium among elders.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disturbance can result in confusion, disordered
speech, and hallucinations in people of any age (it can be a
reaction to alcohol withdrawal), delirium in older, hospitalized
patients is often triggered by a number of surprising factors.
These include common illnesses _ even urinary tract or other
infections _ and a wide range of medications including
over-the-counter cold remedies and prescription sleeping pills.
Perhaps even more surprising is that one in three hospitalized
elders suffer from delirium at some point during their stay.
</P>
<P>
   From Inouye's research, she knows that elders who develop a bout
of delirium have higher mortality rates, experience longer
convalescence (if, indeed, they ever fully recover), are far more
likely to end up in a nursing home, and generally impose far more
burdens on families and the health care system. Such patients
account for more than $4 billion in additional Medicare costs each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Her father's experience has galvanized Inouye to bring delirium
to the forefront of awareness among elders _ who occupy almost half
of all hospital beds _ their caregivers, families, and health care
institutions. ``It just made me realize that our whole health care
system is failing older people,'' Inouye says.
</P>
<P>
   But drastically reducing the incidence of delirium is an
achievable goal. Inouye and her colleagues at Yale recently
reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that delirium can
be cut by 40 percent through a series of simple environmental
interventions _ including such things as warm milk and backrubs to
reduce the need for sleeping pills, which can trigger delirium, and
gentle but persistent ``orienting'' so patients literally know
where they are in time and space.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment involved 852 patients between the ages of 70 and
97 randomly assigned to ``usual care'' or targeted, but low-tech,
interventions. The usual-care patients had 64 new episodes of
delirium, while the others had 42 episodes. (The study participants
had about half the usual delirium rate as other hospitalized elders
because it excluded those who had delirium or any degree of
cognitive impairment upon admission.)
</P>
<P>
   The patients who got special treatment also had more cognitive
improvement, required significantly fewer sleeping pills, and had
improved mobility.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the backrubs and warm milk, the Yale researchers
made sure patients had their eyeglasses and hearing aids, and
ingested enough food and liquids to prevent dehydration and muscle
atrophy. Several times a day, trained volunteers read the newspaper
to patients, took them on walks, played word games, and showed them
``reminiscence'' cards of familiar scenes and situations to jog
their memories.
</P>
<P>
   Inouye's delirium-reducing measures are so effective that
Yale-New Haven Hospital has adopted them as routine for elderly
patients _ apparently the only hospital to make such a concerted
effort to avoid delirium. The interventions cost $327 per patient,
but a preliminary analysis shows that the program has saved the
hospital money by preventing delirium.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many caregivers, delirium is just a routine expectation,''
says Dr. Edward R. Marcantonio of the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center
for the Aged in Boston. ``For the elderly patient who is very ill
or has undergone surgery, they sort of expect them to go bonkers or
have hallucinations. We try to educate the staff that delirium is
not a normal thing. It should be diagnosed, and it should trigger
therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business is to foster understanding of what
delirium is _ and what it's not.
</P>
<P>
   It is completely different from Alzheimer's disease or other
types of dementia, disorders that also affect memory and thinking
ability. Although elders who already have some degree of dementia
are at greater risk for delirium if they become ill or undergo
surgery, dementia is a very gradual, slow-onset loss of cognitive
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   The hallmark of delirium, by contrast, is its suddenness. ``It's
a sudden change in the ability to think,'' says Dr. Jonathan M.
Flacker, another Hebrew Rehab researcher. ``Delirium can also
fluctuate over minutes to hours, which distinguishes it from
dementia.''
</P>
<P>
   Mental confusion has been recognized as a manifestation of
physical illness for at least two millennia. The first-century
Roman encyclopedist, Aulius Cornelius Celsus, noted that sick
people sometimes ``lose their judgment and talk incoherently. . .
When the violence of the fit is abated, the judgment presently
returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this antiquity, delirium wasn't listed as a diagnosis in
psychiatry's bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM),
until 1980. That partly accounts for its lack of attention as a
subject of medical training and research.

 UNDATED: ... and research.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As any third-year medical student soon learns, delirium can be
disturbingly dramatic, with paranoia, extreme agitation, and
hallucinations. These prototypical delirium cases are ``impossible
for nurses to take care of,'' Flacker notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nurse will put in an IV or urinary catheter and they will
rip it out,'' he continues. ``They'll pick at the bedsheets and
clothing. They often won't recognize family and friends. They'll
strip naked in the hallway. They're almost invariably incontinent.
They'll fight the nurses when they try to give routine care. They
often end up in restraints, which makes their delirium worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, such hospital dramas are nightmares for the
patient's family and friends. To them it's obvious that something's
terribly wrong. But delirium researchers say doctors and nurses too
often don't recognize it, don't explain it, or they say, ``It's
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients often aren't aware what's happening to them, but
families can get very, very distressed,'' Inouye says. ``Patients
either don't recognize their family, or they say things like, `Why
did you put me in here? They're experimenting on me!' '' However,
patients suffering such florid delirium may actually be in the
minority. As many as two-thirds of cases, Marcantonio estimates,
are a ``quiet delirium,'' a subtle ``out of it'' confusion,
noticeable only to close family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quiet delirium may have a worse prognosis because no one picks
it up,'' says Dr. Terry Rabinowitz, a psychiatrist at Fletcher
Allen Health Care, the University of Vermont teaching hospital in
Burlington. ``The agitated patient may strike out at someone, try
to leave the hospital, or do something goofy that brings attention.
The subtle cases just sit in bed, quietly confused.''
</P>
<P>
   What causes delirium? Rabinowitz lists what he calls the top
three causes: ``Drugs, drugs, and drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Anesthesia is often thought to be the culprit by health
professionals and laypeople alike. But ``anesthesia is only one
small part of it,'' says Inouye, and there is some controversy
about whether general anesthesia is more likely to precipitate
delirium than local anesthesia combined with sedatives.
</P>
<P>
   The trauma of surgery itself, apart from anesthesia, is a major
risk factor for delirium, although no one understands exactly why.
About half of all hip fracture patients suffer delirium, but hip
replacement carries a lower risk, probably because the procedure is
elective and involves younger and healthier patients.
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of medications can touch off serious mental
confusion in elders. That includes sleeping pills _ which is why
the Yale group goes to great lengths to minimize their use. Pain
medication is also a culprit, but so is untreated pain, raising a
difficult ``tightrope'' issue of under-treatment versus
over-treatment of pain. Walking the line involves attention to
medication type, dose, timing, and interaction with other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking care of a lovely, lovely 90-year-old lady who came
in with arthritis and supposed dementia,'' Flacker says. ``But her
`dementia' was really delirium, caused by 5 milligrams of Valium
three times a day. After we got her off all that medicine, she's
sharper than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes intuitive sense that sleeping pills and pain relievers
could induce confusion. Less obvious is the fact that delirium
often can be traced to other common drugs, such as the allergy drug
Benadryl, antihistamine-containing cold remedies, and stomach
acid-blockers such as Pepcid, available now over the counter.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, researchers are finding, is that delirium results
from an imbalance in neurotransmitters, the chemicals that transmit
signals from one nerve cell to another in the brain. Delirium can
result from too much or too little of a number of
neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin.
Many drugs alter one or another of these brain chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   But the list of delirium-inducers doesn't end with medication.
Infection of any kind is one of the most common causes, and
delirium can be the only sign of the underlying physical illness.
</P>
<P>
   Flacker tells of a call he got from a woman whose elderly
husband had locked himself in the bathroom, convinced people were
out to kill him. ``I said, `You've got to bring him in,' and called
the ambulance,'' he says. ``Lo and behold, he had pneumonia.''
Others say the first thing to do in diagnosing an elderly nursing
home patient with delirium is to check her urine for signs of
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Once delirium occurs, it's not entirely clear how to treat it,
beyond identifying the likely causes and doing everything possible
to remove them. The interventions in the Yale study didn't seem to
reduce the severity of delirium episodes, but the Yale study was
aimed at prevention, not treatment. Inouye and others are just
beginning to study treatment measures.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it's clear that doctors and nurses are only part of
the delirium problem. Those who know the patient best are crucial
in flagging the sudden change in mental status and behavior that
marks delirium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families need to know they should report these problems and be
adamant that they should be followed up,'' says Katharine M.
Murphy, a Hebrew Rehab researcher who had to cope with serious,
infection-related delirium in her 70-year-old mother, Rosemary
Murphy of Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   It took a long time, but the elder Murphy is back to her
pre-delirious state of good health. ``I had dealt with delirium a
lot as a geriatric nurse-practitioner,'' Murphy said. ``But when
it's someone close to you, it's a much more emotional and
frightening experience.''

OUTRAGE VOICED AS STATE STERILIZATIONS COME TO LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   State-sanctioned sterilization, which has sparked new outrage in
the wake of advance publicity for a book on Vermont's eugenics
program, was never a secret in the middle decades of the century,
when states from California to Maine allowed the sterilization of
people whose genetic material was considered inferior.
</P>
<P>
   But while historians have established that at least 60,000
Americans were sterilized _ some who had been coerced, and others
who had not given their consent _ the voices of people who fell
victim to these programs have not been heard.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, however, three people have contacted the
Vermont historian Nancy Gallagher, the author of ``Breeding Better
Vermonters: The Eugenics Project in the Green Mountain State,''
saying that they were sterilized and that they never expected to
read about what happened to them in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The new witnesses could add to historians' understanding of the
scope of sterilization efforts this century in the United States,
in Vermont and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the publicity surrounding Gallagher's book has shed
new light on the largely forgotten story of Vermont's sterilization
program. Some in the state are calling for an official inquiry;
others, especially those from Abenaki Indian families singled out
by the eugenicists, are asking questions about their family
histories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vermont is abuzz'' over the long-dormant issue of
sterilization policy, said Fred Wiseman, a professor of humanities
at Johnson State College and the director of the Abenaki Tribal
Museum. ``People in the governor's office are thinking about it.
I've gotten all kinds of calls about it. Just about everybody in
the (Abenaki) Nation that has ever had this happen is thinking
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a government response may not be farfetched. In
other countries that have had sterilization programs, victims have
demanded reparations. Canada and Sweden, which had their own
race-purifying programs at work through the 1970s, have both
recently paid millions of dollars in compensation to people who
were sterilized by government order.
</P>
<P>
   But there have never been cash settlements in the United States,
where even the process of gathering information on what happened _
mostly behind the closed doors of state institutions _ has been
tortuous.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the majority of those sterilized move into their late
70s and 80s, it may be too late. They do not have much longer to
live, and, as researchers on the topic point out, they leave no
descendants to demand historical vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you this _ the clock is ticking,'' said Dr. Philip
R. Reilly, who is director of the Shriver Center for Mental
Retardation and author of ``The Surgical Solution,'' a 1991 history
of involuntary sterilization. ``It won't be long before you won't
be able to find anyone alive who was sterilized.''
</P>
<P>
   But the response to Gallagher's Vermont research has raised the
possibility of a breakthrough, and shows that information about
eugenic history still has the power to shock. After her series of
telephone conversations, Gallagher is increasingly certain that
sterilization is a topic worth addressing _ if not by her, then by
the victims themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they ought to redress that type of thing. I mean, what
kind of country are we if we can't do that?,'' said Gallagher, who
began her research for a master's thesis. ``Sometimes I think I've
opened Pandora's Box. And other times I think, there are stories
out there . . . That's a pain that we need to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's sterilization law came within the context of an
international push for eugenics _ the idea that traits such as poor
health and bad character could be bred out of the race by
preventing ``inferior'' genetic material from being passed on.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the passage of a series of laws, beginning in
Indiana in 1907 and continuing until mid-1970s, some states
provided for the sterilization of upwards of 60,000 epileptics,
alcoholics, those considered discipline problems, and retarded
people. Some subjects consented, and others were coerced or had no
knowledge of what was being done to them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, Vermont became the 24th state to pass a sterilization
law, according to Gallagher, and the number of sterilizations
performed there was a fraction of those performed nationwide. The
only official data on sterilization _ a report by the eugenics
survey mastermind, Henry Perkins, in the late 1940s _ put the
number of procedures at around 200. John Moody, an independent
ethnohistorian from Sharon, Vt., says the real number is much
higher, perhaps in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, unlike Sweden and Canada, the policy was
upheld by the Supreme Court, Reilly said. The court sided with
Virginia state law in the 1927 case of Buck v. Bell, which
permitted the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and the
Feebleminded to sterilize 18-year-old inmate Carrie Buck.
</P>
<P>
   In his written opinion on the case, Justice Oliver Wendell
Holmes wrote, ``It is better for all the world, if instead of
waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or letting them
starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are
manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been only one attempt in this country to
secure compensation for forced sterilization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit in
Lynchburg, Va., on behalf of 7,200 state mental patients who were
sterilized without their knowledge until the practice was ended in
1973. The suit sought damages and notification of people who had
been sterilized, as well as a ruling that the sterilizations were
unconstitutional. The ACLU and the state settled the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlements in Canada and Sweden suggest that the public
mood may have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Moody, who has worked extensively with the Abenaki, has pressed
the state to open up records from the eugenics survey and from two
``training schools'' that frequently sterilized young inmates. He
would like to see the state begin to contact families and inform
them what occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Vermont Governor Howard Dean, he said, ``I'd love
to see the Dean administration take a proactive stance.'' Failing
that, Moody said, he could imagine filing a class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Informing those who have been sterilized is an initiative that
has never been undertaken on a national scale, said Reilly, and
probably never will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now many of them are very old people, and there is the ethical
issue of letting sleeping dogs lie,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   And among the more angry of the Abenaki, sterilization simply
seems like another aspect of a multi-faceted campaign to destroy
them.
</P>
<P>
   Homer St. Francis, a longtime chief of the Abenaki, reels off
the names of childless family members who he assumes were
sterilized. He sees sterilization as part of a larger government
conspiracy to eliminate his family _ a campaign that he said
includes generations of abduction and outright murder.
</P>
<P>
   When historians in Vermont first discovered crates of Henry
Perkins's eugenic surveys, St. Francis said he found names of
people he knew on the list of research subjects, people who had
been singled out as ``degenerate'' by Perkins's researchers. It
confirmed everything he had already believed about the state and
the Abenaki.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me sick,'' he said. ``How would you feel if people
were trying to kill you?''
</P>
<P>
   And while there was some talk about seeking a legal remedy, it
faded among the tribe's long list of grievances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any money for attorneys, so we just grit our
teeth and bear it,'' he said.

A TOUCH OF GRAY _ A LIFE OF JERRY GARCIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
GARCIA 
An American Life 
By Blair Jackson. Viking. 498 pp. Illustrated. $34.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before he died, on Aug. 9, 1995, Jerry Garcia rarely spoke in
public. He was never comfortable with the ``leader of the band''
role and the fascist potential it automatically bestowed on him.
Onstage with the Grateful Dead, he sometimes managed a warm
``thanks,'' but most of his direct communication with fans came
through his guitar playing, his seemingly endless fireworks of
notes. He never tried to sway people to his way of thinking (not
even to the peace 'n' love-ism that John Lennon took up) or make
himself into a self-consciously hip icon like Michael Stipe;
Garcia's passion was for taking listeners on an intellectual,
sensual, and at times acutely emotional musical journey. His goal
was to provide cosmic accompaniment, what lyricist Robert Hunter
called ``a smile on empty space.''
</P>
<P>
   But a predictable media story has unfolded in the four years
since he checked into a rehab center called Serenity Knolls and
checked out for good, a smile stiffened on his lips. With the same
``he's hot, he's sexy, and he's dead'' ballast that has built
industries around Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, journalists have
been disassembling Garcia's mystique and creating a portrait of the
man behind the quick fingers, the grandfatherly beard, and the
round glasses. They've been going ``behind the music,'' as VH1 has
so tactfully put it, and deprivatizing ``Captain Trips'' for public
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is that the loyal breed known as Deadheads have
finally been getting to know the man with whom they've had an
intimate relationship for decades. While they imagined him to be
their friend, and pledged to him unlimited devotion, most knew next
to nothing about his life while he was alive _ that he was the
mostly absentee father of four daughters, for instance, or that he
had a pattern of ending romances as coldly and evasively as his
guitar style was red-hot and in-the-moment.
</P>
<P>
   The newest posthumous glimpse of Garcia is a responsible and
heartfelt biography called ``Garcia: An American Life,'' written by
Blair Jackson, a journalist whose extensive writing on the Dead has
included his own magazine, ``The Golden Road.'' The book falls at
the opposite end of the reliability spectrum from Rock Scully's
1995 ``Living with the Dead,'' a factually questionable account
that dwelled on details of Garcia's drug problem. It's free of the
tabloid tone that marked both an egregious Garcia profile on ``The
E! True Hollywood Story'' and the extensive catfight coverage of
the 1996 suit brought by Garcia's second wife against his third.
Don't get me wrong: In his effort to consider the whole Garcia,
Jackson does eventually move from Garcia's asthmatic, rebellious
youth and his early hippiehood to the more disturbing image of an
older, recessive figure falling in and out of heroin and cocaine
abuse and half-baked love affairs. Jackson is well-behaved, but
he's not deluded. But with diligent research to back him up and an
undimmed love for Garcia's art, he protects his readers from
getting dirt on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The most original sections in ``Garcia'' portray the young
Jerry, before he made his way to the 1960s San Francisco music
scene and into American countercultural history. Jackson clarifies
the circumstances around the death of Garcia's father, who was 45
when he drowned while fishing in Northern California in 1947. Jerry
was 5, and his father's death _ which he said he witnessed, but
which his brother, Tiff, says Jerry didn't see _ had what Garcia
called a ``crushing'' effect on him. He went to live with his
grandparents while his mother ran a bar, and he and Tiff had a few
rascal adventures with the cops on the San Francisco streets.
Later, after his mother's third marriage, he moved with her to the
suburbs, where his teen alienation was punctured only by a few
unconventional teachers who encouraged him to read and channel his
creativity. At 15, he tried pot _ a pivotal moment in his life, he
said _ and he made his way into art school in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1960s, Garcia lived through the
optimistic-folky period that is the subject of ``The Days
Between,'' the last song he wrote. He put in a comically disastrous
stint in the Army; left a marriage to Sara Rupenthal that failed
beside his greater love for music; and romanced the cliques of
bohemian San Francisco, where he met Hunter and formed one of
rock's most enduring songwriting duos. Naturally, ``Garcia'' pivots
on the Haight-Ashbury in the mid- and late 1960s, as he gets swept
up in the Acid Tests and communal living that we've already heard
so much about. (May the muse give special blessings to any writer
who, in the course of his or her book, is obliged to lead us once
again through some of the most over-chronicled days of the
century.) Jackson clearly maps out the Dead's interactions with Ken
Kesey's Merry Pranksters, as well as Garcia's relationship with
girlfriend and future wife Carolyn Adams, who was given the
nickname Mountain Girl by Neal Cassady. He also captures the end of
'60s idealism, when the neighborhood around the Dead expanded from
an extended family into a dangerous mob and the band dispersed
around the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   As the last third of the book explores Garcia's heavy drug
years, ``Garcia'' becomes less vivid and intimate, possibly because
Garcia became somewhat lost to himself. For the 1980s-1990s
material, Jackson relies on more familiar information _ the
up-and-down effect of Garcia's drug problem on the band's
performances, for instance, and the chaos and pressure caused by
the popularity of 1987's ``In the Dark.'' He doesn't seem any
closer to the haggard Garcia than the concertgoers who watched the
guitarist sleepwalk through his last years on stage, forgetting the
lyrics to his songs. What remains consistent throughout the book,
though, is Jackson's ability to elucidate Garcia and the Dead's
already overanalyzed musical style with an extraordinary freshness.
His pages on songs like ``The Other One'' are impassioned and
definitive.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, when a famous person passes on, so-called friends come
out of the woodwork to have their own 15 minutes. It's the Brush
With Greatness Brigade. And so it is hard to assess the reliability
of Jackson's sources for ``Garcia,'' except to say that he has
talked to many, many people, and balanced or supported quotes with
other quotes. The always articulate Mountain Girl sheds much light,
as do bassist John Kahn (whom Jackson spoke to a week before Kahn
died in 1996), Tiff Garcia, Sara Rupenthal, Dead author and
musician David Gans, and girlfriends Barbara Meier and Manasha
Matheson. Not to mention Garcia himself, whose common sense is
always linked to intellectual wit and modesty. As if anticipating
the challenges of pinning down a life in words and books, he told
an interviewer in 1975: ``You can go hear me play _ that's me,
that's what I have to say.''

THE TRUTH ABOUT THE `BLAIR WITCH PROJECT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is nothing finer than a horror movie that makes you sleep
with your bedroom lit up like a night game at Fenway. Despite its
astonishing buzz, ``The Blair Witch Project'' is not it.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 minutes into this infuriating film, people in one
recent afternoon audience began to squirm. Some chatted amiably,
while others checked their watches and examined their cuticles. A
lot of aisle activity took place.
</P>
<P>
   There was not a peep, let alone a scream _ unlike the symphony
of shrieks one hears during any screening of ``The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre.'' There were no sudden movements in the dark of the
theater as one person clutches another in terror, the way countless
men and women did during the first ``Halloween.'' There were no
hands splayed tightly across faces to block bloodcurdling images,
such as those of Hannibal Lecter noshing his way through ``The
Silence of the Lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there were only the comforting sounds of popcorn being
chewed like cud and overpriced drinks being slurped. One left the
theater with the same relief felt after three hours of college
boards. More than a few people looked at each other with raised
eyebrows as if to say, ``You've got to be kidding me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' is a profoundly unscary movie.
Nothing much happens, and what does happen unfolds like fingernails
on a blackboard. There is no there there. It is tiresome and
burdened with one of the flatter endings in horror history. Did
they simply run out of film, or what?
</P>
<P>
   Heather, Josh, and Mike, the unattractive trio of characters,
begin to aggravate the audience almost as quickly as they bug each
other, and this happens awfully early in the movie. Heather is
every man's ex-girlfriend from hell: the obsessive control freak
who makes everyone else's life miserable until she becomes
hysterical. Off to MacLean with her and a sturdy DYS facility for
her two dumb male companions.
</P>
<P>
   What passes for suspense amounts to low-grade Cub Scout fare. We
hear a lot of Sounds in the Night, and then strange piles of wood
and stones appear the next morning in front of the tent of our
trio. So what? Josh mercifully disappears at one point. Mike and
Heather later find some unidentifiable body organ, presumably his,
wrapped in a piece of his shirt. Or is it tandoori chicken? Again,
so what? And no one has a clue what is going on during the chaotic
ending. All in all, this is hardly the stuff of nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   As we know by now, ``The Blair Witch Project'' was made for the
price of a low-end BMW, and it looks it. Auteurs Daniel Myrick and
Eduardo Sanchez force hapless audiences to endure ill-lit,
vertiginous sweeps of sky and fuzzy closeups of branches and leaves
for well over an hour. This exercise takes us nowhere. Dennis
Hopper shot the same kind of lunatic footage when he filmed the New
Orleans graveyard sequence in Easy Rider, but he was trying to
approximate an acid trip. The three turkeys in this flick
presumably were straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Blair film cannot even be called a valiant effort by earnest
neophytes because of its slick marketing. They're going to be
studying this one in business schools for years to come. Myrick and
Sanchez must be pinching themselves as their baby moves inexorably
toward $100 million. This is cinematic Lotto. But while there is no
stopping their commercial success, the pair know its artistic
pallor better than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shame in making a bad movie. It is a perfectly
honorable thing to do in the pursuit of something better. A bad
movie without pretentiousness is a treat on a 95-degree afternoon.
Take ``Lake Placid,'' a charming hour and a half involving a
40-foot alligator that lives in a lake and eats a man, a grizzly
bear, and a blindfolded cow. This film harbors no longing for
greatness and laughs at its own mediocrity. Now that's class.
</P>
<P>
   The American public has been seduced by the Blair hype largely
because it is desperate for an alternative to the Pillsbury
doughboys coming out of Hollywood studios. In this case, the
packaging has completely overshadowed the content of this film. A
well-marketed set of test patterns would also probably sell well
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The media has no excuse for hyping this movie. That Time and
Newsweek put it on their covers last week simply means that editors
in midtown Manhattan contracted the summer vapors, as they
invariably do this time of year, and that their children went to
the same rainy-day afternoon screening in the Hamptons and returned
ashen.

`EDTV,' `ANALYZE THIS' WORTH A RENTAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``EDtv'' _ Ron Howard's TV satire came too hard on the heels of
Peter Weir and Jim Carrey's ``The Truman Show'' to generate much
interest. But it's a solid movie that deserved better. Definitely
worth a rental.
</P>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' _ This pretentious, ill-advised Generation X
melodrama tosses away a cast headed by Ben Affleck, Courtney Love
and Christina Ricci. A carton of tar, nicotine, and ill-will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' _ According to conventional wisdom, an idea
developed for the movies is generally superior to one developed for
television. Not in this case. The idea of a crime boss going to a
psychiatrist is done much better on HBO's ``The Sopranos.'' That's
not to say this film isn't worth renting. It is: Robert De Niro's
performance is wonderfully comic.

   DVD UPDATE: The sales of DVD players in June were up more than
800 percent from the same time last year. The availability of
additional titles, combined with a price drop and the death of
DIVX, led to a jump from 16,000 in June 1998 to 145,434 this June,
according to the Consumer Manufacturers Association.

day, but here the juice never falters. Not since a cold day in
early 1997, when power flickered briefly at the headquarters of the
First National Bank of Omaha, causing a computer crash that
executives vowed would never happen again. The bank's approach
draws interest for another reason: it uses fuel cells, a technology
that shows promise for reliability, flexibility and cleanliness,
but has so far failed to catch on because of cost. But people will

   DRUGS-YOUTH (SEATTLE) _ In the 1960s and early '70s, marijuana,
LSD and mushrooms were thought of as the undoing of the youth. But
these aren't the love-drugs of the boomer generation. To today's
teens and twentysomethings who do drugs, those vices just don't cut
it. They prefer the less organic highs of Ecstasy, ketamine, GHB
and inhalants _ the party drugs of the late '90s. WITH SEVERAL
SIDEBARS.
</P>
<P>
   All stories by D. Parvaz. (All stories will move in the ``a''
category.)
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS-EXPERIENCES (Undated) _ Nothing speaks like experience.
That's why we asked young drug users and abusers in Seattle _ from
the sidewalks of Fremont to the needle exchange center on Capitol
Hill _ to share their personal trips. While their ages and physical
descriptions are accurate, their names have been changed.
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS-DOSE (Undated) _ Short list of tips on avoiding unwanted
trips.
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS-HARM REDUCTION (Undated) _ Harm reduction is probably the
dirtiest term in drug prevention circles. Its proponents assume
that even though users know drugs are bad for them, they will
continue to use them. They believe that to prevent overdoses and
other disasters, it is best to inform users on the safest possible
way to use drugs, and to provide clean syringes and needles.
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS-TEST (Undated) _ Information about tests for drug
contents.
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS-ECSTASY (Undated) _ As long as there are late-night and
all-night parties, various forms of stimulants will be widely used:
Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA for short) and
MDA and MDEA, two others that are similar in structure.
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS-HALLUCINOGENS (Undated) _ Everything at a rave is geared
to trip you out: the digital displays on the walls, the way the
repetitive beats are synchronized with the lasers and lights to put
you in a trance state. This atmosphere explains the popularity of
hallucinogenic drugs at raves.
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS-INHALANTS (Undated) _ Among younger kids _ 14 and under _
``huffing'' (or inhaling) freon, benzol-based emolients, solvents,
aerosols, adhesives and other solvents is nothing new. But as more
expensive drugs such as ketamine and Ecstasy grow in popularity,
the use of these solvents increases because kids see them as a
cheap high.
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS-NEUROTRANSMITTERS (Undated) _ One of the most common
sedatives ingested at parties has been GHB (gamma-hydroxybuterate).
Its use as an anesthetic was discontinued because of the high
incidence of seizures and vomiting.

SPRINGSTEEN MEMORIES: LITTLE BITS OF HIS DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- My favorite Bruce Springsteen concert memory?
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen in 1978 at Boston Garden _ a site he loved because
it was ``low rent'' and ``sweaty.'' He leaps into the crowd during
``Spirit in the Night,'' tears through the aisle, and jumps onto
the chair next to mine. It's like sitting next to an electric
generator. His eyes are wild and possessed, as he lifts them, along
with his fist, toward the far balcony.
</P>
<P>
   It's a primal moment that lasts an instant in linear time, but
no doubt a lifetime for anybody in that row of seats.
</P>
<P>
   Such close encounters have occurred many times when Springsteen
has played the Boston area _ and, combined with a charisma that
leaves most of his peers flat-footed, helps explains why all
tickets to his upcoming five FleetCenter shows were sold in a
single day.
</P>
<P>
   My Bruce baptism came shortly before that Garden show in 1978,
when he played the Music Hall (now the Wang Center). He dashed
around in a three-piece black suit (yes, this from the man who
would later define the jeans-and-T-shirt look) and again jumped
boldly into the crowd. He was unafraid because he always saw his
fans as brothers and friends, rather than pawns to be fleeced in a
marketing scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen opened that Music Hall show with ``Badlands'' _ the
cornerstone of his ``Darkness on the Edge of Town'' album. Then, a
few months later at the Garden, he opened with a complete change of
pace _ the Wynonie Harris hit ``Good Rockin' Tonight.'' (On the
West Coast during that tour, he opened with Buddy Holly's ``Rave
On.'')
</P>
<P>
   The point is, Springsteen is always changing in concert _ not to
the extent that the Grateful Dead did from night to night, but
enough to give the faithful more reasons to believe _ and more
reasons to make him the Boss of the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen's new reunion tour with the E Street Band is a
blockbuster, but he's been building a fan base ever since his first
Boston date at the now-defunct Paul's Mall in 1973. He followed
with shows at Oliver's, Joe's Place and Charlie's Bar (see
accompanying timeline), where his future biographer, Dave Marsh,
then living in Somerville, saw him for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and the band did everything from originals to Fats Domino
to a classical prelude to `New York City Serenade,' '' Marsh
recalled last week in a phone interview. ``And the next day, my
thighs were sore. I realized I had pounded them so hard in my
clumsy, honky kind of way, because I had never experienced that
kind of intensity before at a concert.''
</P>
<P>
   I never saw Springsteen in a club, but have been an ardent
convert since since the '78 Music Hall date. There simply is no
one, Mick Jagger included, who can match his endurance (he played
for three hours and 30 minutes at one Worcester Centrum show in
1984) and physical athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen, now 49, has jumped on and off more stages, and more
speakers, than most artists could count. As fellow performer and
friend Bruce Hornsby, said this week: ``He's always worked hard and
been willing to give up his body for the people. His energy level
is way above everybody else's.''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen departed from his rock-as-Olympic-decathlon approach
during a solo acoustic tour to back his more somber ``Ghost of Tom
Joad'' album in 1995-96. At one of his Orpheum shows on that tour,
Springsteen even asked fans to be silent during his softer songs.
It was a philosophically nourishing if not physically liberating
show, though Springsteen flashed echoes of his old self when he
pulled out a 12-string guitar and wailed through ``Darkness on the
Edge of Town.'' That moment alone was worth the price of admission
for most Springsteen diehards.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic Springsteen is back on this new tour, judging from
the opening night this writer caught at the Meadowlands in New
Jersey last month (the first of a record 15 nights at the
Continental Airlines Arena). Springsteen wore out the rest of the
band _ especially saxophonist Clarence Clemons, who was sweating
profusely as he tried to keep up. Springsteen poured on the
classics _ from ``Thunder Road'' to ``10th Avenue Freezeout'' _ and
played for three hours, reminding fans of the glory days of the E
Street Band.
</P>
<P>
   Those glory days date back 20 years, to when the Springsteen
legend was cemented in Boston. Some of the many high points came
during another series of shows at Boston Garden, in December 1980,
backing his album ``The River.'' During the song ``Promised Land,''
he jumped to the front of the stage, shook his hands in the air,
and screamed to fans, ``What are you waiting for?''
</P>
<P>
   That night began with his signature anthem, ``Born to Run.'' And
before it was over, he ranged from an R &AMP; B roadhouse style
(``Cadillac Walk''), to country (``Wreck on the Highway''), acid
rock (``Because the Night,'' complete with his own nerve-shredding
guitar solo) and the sensitive parlor music of ``4th of July,
Asbury Park (Sandy),'' featuring E Streeter Danny Federici on
cafe-style accordion. Then there was the moment when Springsteen
pulled a woman up to dance during ``Sherry Darling'' _ a gesture
that would often be repeated a few years later when he sang his
radio hit, ``Dancing in the Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   At that 1980 Garden show, Springsteen also delivered the
between-song raps that were becoming a trademark. He talked a lot
about his father, whom he said was ``afraid to dream, afraid to
think that things could ever get better.'' Such soul-baring would
eventually become as important to fans as Springsteen's athletic
and musical feats. He even gave long-in-advance hints of his future
domesticity (he now has three children with Patti Scialfa, once a
backup singer in the band). ``Your dreams remain dreams until you
take a chance with people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Worcester Centrum in 1984, during the tour that
celebrated his 12-million-selling ``Born in the U.S.A.'' disc,
Springsteen talked about dreams again. He said that, as a child,
listening to Elvis Presley had first set his mind free and allowed
him to dream. ``I'm real lucky,'' he said. ``I get to live a little
bit of my dream every night.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Springsteen and the E Street Band hit the Centrum in
1988 (augmented by La Bamba Horns), he was asking the audience to
think as much as to boogie. It was the ``Tunnel of Love'' tour,
framed around a pensive album that was a reaction to the
mega-celebrity breakthrough of ``Born in the U.S.A.'' He did only
two songs from the earlier album, instead adding four obscure
B-sides _ a sign that he was asking to be judged as a songwriter,
not a hit machine.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen also indulged in more cabaret at that show than he
has before or since. He pretended to buy tickets from a tuxedoed
carny barker at a counter marked ``Tunnel of Love Express Tour.''
He was dressed in a white shirt and cream-colored vest, and at one
point he sat on a park bench on stage, reminiscing with Clemons
about the days when they would stare at passing girls and discuss
their romantic hopes. It was a little strange, but he still rocked
home with the Bo Diddley beat of ``She's the One'' and the Lloyd
Price-like New Orleans sound of ``You Can Look.'' An acoustic
``Born to Run'' was another highlight.
</P>
<P>
   The magic was less apparent in 1992 when, after breaking up with
the E Street Band (he wanted to do something different after so
many years together), Springsteen returned to the Centrum with a
pasted-together group of players that included Shane Fontayne on
guitar and R&AMP;B great Bobby King on vocals. The sole E Street
holdovers were Scialfa (by then his wife) and keyboardist Roy
Bittan.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen the opening night of the '92 tour in New Jersey and
was not overly impressed, but the group had coalesced by the time
it hit the Centrum and then Boston Garden, where J. Geils Band
singer Peter Wolf joined Springsteen for an encore one night.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was not enough to make diehards forget the E Street
Band, which is why this summer of '99 reunion tour _ the first in a
decade with his E Street comrades _ is a welcome jolt for fans
looking to get their batteries recharged once again.

THE ANNENBERGS AND THEIR WORKS

LEGACY 
A Biography of Moses and Walter Annenberg 
By Christopher Ogden. Little, Brown. 624 pp. Illustrated. $29.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billions in philanthropy ensure that many monuments to Walter
Annenberg will remain when he dies, befitting someone who has
achieved what he has. At 91, Annenberg is not only perhaps the
greatest philanthropist of the century, but also one of its most
accomplished figures.
</P>
<P>
   Upon a base of insolvency, he built an impressive publishing
empire anchored by TV Guide, which sprang from instinct and became
a near monopoly in its field. Annenberg was no saint, but in
``Legacy,'' Christopher Ogden's biography of Walter and his father,
people attest to the son's strong moral center.
</P>
<P>
   He had a knack for recognizing talent in those who would go far,
ranging from Dick Nixon to Dick Clark. Near the end of his service
as President Nixon's ambassador to the Court of St. James's, he
arranged for his friend of 30-plus years, Ronald Reagan, to meet
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, spawning one of the century's
great political alliances. He is the only US envoy to have been
knighted.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, only one monument to Moses Annenberg. It is a
big one, though: all of his son's life. Doted on, mercilessly
ridiculed, and finally admired by his father, Walter was driven by
the twin motivations of proving his worth to his father and
vindicating him.
</P>
<P>
   Moses Annenberg also was a publishing titan, who started with
nothing and built a vast fortune _ but his life ended in tatters,
with a conviction for tax evasion and a mountain of debt. Walter
believed, with ample reason, that his father had been hounded into
prison by the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt because Moses
Annenberg had used his newspaper to rail against FDR's policies in
the late '30s.
</P>
<P>
   There is one more monument in this story, and it is the story
itself. Ogden has created a great work distinguished by the breadth
and depth of its research, and by its evenhandedness; it leans
toward the positive, but it doesn't fawn, and there is plenty that
is uncomplimentary.
</P>
<P>
   From typically humble immigrant beginnings, the elder Annenberg
rose through the newspaper trade, going in 20 years from street
brawling for readership to managing circulation for all of William
Randolph Hearst's publications. He maintained side interests as
well, chief among them the Daily Racing Form, which dominated its
field much as his son came to dominate television magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Moe Annenberg made his home with the former Sadie Friedman, and
together they had nine children. Walter arrived in the middle, in
March 1908, but he was the only male and immediately became his
parents' favorite. Ogden says Sadie, who outlived her husband by
decades, was a very strong influence in Walter's life, but does not
devote space commensurate with that role.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by the family fortune, Walter grew up the carefree
playboy. He started college, but dropped out to play the Roaring
'20s stock market. He built himself a seven-figure stake but lost
it in the crash, and had to be bailed out by his father for
$350,000. His father's Hollywood scandal sheet gave Walter entree
into show biz circles, and he dated Ethel Merman and Ginger Rogers,
among others. For a time he wrote a gossip column, ``Boy About
Town,'' learning the ropes from Damon Runyon, who ``just happened
to like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Moses left Hearst, and in the 1930s bought his own
newspaper, which he deemed a more suitable career for Walter than
the gambling-tainted Racing Form. Walter sat at his father's side,
but had little input. His father loved him, Ogden says, but didn't
respect him, and would often dress him down viciously in public.
``What do you know?'' Moses would thunder. ``You have no idea what
the hell you're talking about!'' Later, Walter would rhapsodize
about his father, conceding only that he ``could be firm.'' ``I
wasn't worth a damn in those days,'' Walter told Ogden in an
interview. (The Annenbergs cooperated unconditionally with the
author, allowing free access to voluminous archives. In addition,
Ogden interviewed more than 200 people, and his bibliography
stretches over nine pages.)
</P>
<P>
   When the Internal Revenue Service, sent by FDR, came calling,
Walter was forced to change overnight. ``Until all the legal
troubles, Walter didn't even come in until 10 or 10:30 a.m.,''
Moses' secretary told Ogden. Power transferred absolutely when
Moses, in part to spare his son, who also had been indicted,
accepted a plea bargain that included time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Few believed Walter could succeed, but he began to, almost
immediately. He also worked diligently to win his father's freedom,
without success until his father was dying with a brain tumor.
Moses' final, whispered words to Walter: ``My suffering has all
been for the purpose of making you a man.''
</P>
<P>
   And a very particular man he was. He was paying millions
annually in back taxes, but one wonders if even that explains
Walter's penuriousness. Here is a typical missive to his first
wife: ``For pure unadulterated waste, the enclosed Western Union
telegram to The New York Times cost $1.81. You could have sent all
this in a letter with a three cent stamp.'' Their marriage ended in
1949 after 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Walter expected not servitude from a wife, but devotion, which
he alluded to in an early-'50s Mother's Day card to Sadie in which
he said her example had taught him that ``the essence of motherhood
is submission and sacrifice.'' He found such a woman in Lee
Rosentiel in 1950, and they remain partners to this day. Together
they have lived an epic life, indulging in luxury and suffering in
adversity, as when Walter's only son Roger (from his first
marriage), who suffered a personality disorder, committed suicide.
Walter communicated with his children mostly through letters, and
sometimes would correct their grammar while exhorting them to live
up to their good fortune of birth.
</P>
<P>
   His stewardship of the Philadelphia Inquirer, Moses' chief
bequest, was uneven. He fought injustice where he saw it, sometimes
intervening personally, and yet he maintained a capricious
blacklist of names whose mention was allowed only disparagingly, or
not at all. When his Triangle Corp. couldn't agree on a stadium
lease with the hometown '76ers basketball team, he banned their
mention for the rest of the season (attendance plummeted).
</P>
<P>
   When President Kennedy was slain, most publishers sent a
reporter to Dallas. Walter didn't, but he did send a check for
$12,500 to the widow of J. D. Tippett, the Dallas police officer
slain by Lee Harvey Oswald, to pay off her mortgage. (His editors
were miffed when AP scooped them on this story, but Walter didn't
want to break the news in his own pages; he didn't want to be seen
as seeking credit.)
</P>
<P>
   Walter made fabulous amounts of money through his publications,
but he will most be remembered for giving it away, a pursuit he
credits to Sadie. Early on, he would help individual employees who
had suffered a loss, or respond to a tragedy he'd read about, but
his giving has grown far beyond that. Add up his gifts to
educational institutions, for example, and include only those of $2
million or greater _ and they would exceed $1.3 billion. He donated
another billion when he gave his art collection to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York. Ogden's selected list of donations runs
three pages.
</P>
<P>
   At 624 pages, ``Legacy'' can appear imposing, particularly for
summer reading, but Ogden, a staff member at Time magazine, writes
in an inviting, accessible, and unassuming manner. He has found
subjects worthy of in-depth treatment, and produced a work worthy
of his subjects.

YOUNG AND HIGH: NEW GENERATION OF DRUG USERS FACES A CHEMICAL
ONSLAUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the 1960s and early '70s, marijuana, LSD and
mushrooms were thought of as the undoing of the youth.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Age of Aquarius is over. The undoing is undone. Many
baby boomers experimented and most survived. They tuned in, turned
on, dropped out, then dropped back in and bought Volvos. Some of
them voted for Reagan. Twice.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton _ the guy who ``didn't inhale'' _ is slogging
through his second term in office, and the next big threat to the
youth of America changes every week.
</P>
<P>
   It's rock music. It's goths. And, yes, it's still drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But these aren't the love-drugs of the boomer generation. To
today's teens and twentysomethings who do drugs, those vices just
don't cut it. They prefer the less organic highs of Ecstasy,
ketamine, GHB and inhalants _ the party drugs of the late '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Most young adults who use these drugs have no idea what they're
getting, where the drugs come from, or what the effects might be on
their bodies. Plus, they indiscriminately mix and match them.
</P>
<P>
   People seldom know what they're getting into with these party
drugs. It's a bit like ordering a green salad at a restaurant,
being served meat loaf instead, eating it, and not being sure why
the salad tasted funny. The disparities ought to be obvious, but
because some users aren't educated about drugs, vital differences
go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the really scary part: If users don't know what they're
taking, how can they determine how much of it to take?
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide statistics provided by the Drug Awareness Warning
Network list 637 Ecstasy-related emergency room episodes in 1996
(the latest available data). That's a significant increase from the
68 recorded just three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The network recorded 20 GHB-related emergency room episodes in
'92. By '96, the number had jumped to 629.
</P>
<P>
   Local statistics are sketchier.
</P>
<P>
   A December report on drug use in Seattle and King County issued
by the Department of Public Health says deaths involving
depressants such as Rohypnol and GHB are up 63.2 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which includes data from the Drug Enforcement
Administration, has ample statistics on the use of drugs such as
heroin and marijuana. But there are few official statistics on GHB,
ketamine and Ecstasy _ only statements that Ecstasy and GHB are
``reported to be commonly used.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to take drugs should never be made lightly, but
that's exactly what happens. New-generation drug users hear stories
about what could go right during a drug trip _ euphoric stories
filled with spiritual epiphanies.
</P>
<P>
   What they may not hear is what could go wrong. The person
selling them the stuff at a party or club isn't going to tell them.
Yet, for a person faced with the decision to use or refuse these
drugs, having accurate information can be vital.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Wilkie Wilson, a Duke University professor of
pharmacology, comes in. Wilson is making it his mission to spread
unbiased, scientific information on drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Co-author of ``Buzzed: The Straight Facts on the Most Used and
Abused Drugs, from Alcohol to Ecstasy,'' (Norton, 304 pages,
$14.95), Wilson is concerned about the lack of information on drug
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really on a campaign to help institutions come to the
realization that we have to teach respect for the brain,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we teach so much respect for the heart _ we eat
low-fat diets, lower stress, exercise. We never talk about keeping
our brains healthy in our society. ... You don't poison what you
have a sense of respect for.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's voice is heavy with frustration as he talks about how
we routinely poison our brains with drugs, alcohol and cigarettes.
But he makes it clear he is appealing to the intellect of drug
users rather than resorting to the conventional scare tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than saying `Just say no,' say `Respect your brain,'''
says Wilson. ``When you try to warn about dangers that are
improbable, you lose your credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   If Wilson's method of informing rather than preaching seems
controversial, it shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge is power. It's the lack of it that puts so many young
drug users in vulnerable situations.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Drug Enforcement Administration, a federal body with a
clear anti-drug stance, has a Web site _
www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/straight/cover.htm _ dedicated to providing
teens with information about drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent Juliana West, with the DEA in the Seattle field
division, scoffs at the idea that giving youth information about
drugs is a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who believes that is way off,'' says West. ``We believe
in informing kids on what drugs do to them. The `Just say no'
method just doesn't work. They don't listen to that.''

users and abusers in Seattle _ from the sidewalks of Fremont to the
needle exchange center on Capitol Hill _ to share their personal
trips. While their ages and physical descriptions are accurate,
their names have been changed.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah, a 15-year-old pixie of a girl, knows it all.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed like a Japanese anime cartoon character _ all glitter
and pigtails _ she's excited about an upcoming party. She doesn't
know exactly where it is or how she's going to get there. She
doesn't even know who the DJs will be.
</P>
<P>
   What she knows for sure is that a couple of her friends will be
bringing some Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what, as long as there's music and E and your
friends, it's all good,'' she says, standing outside the Taco Del
Mar eatery in Seattle's funky Fremont neighborhood. She seems to be
dancing in place even though there's no music playing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her experiences with Ecstasy, she shrugs, saying
she's only done it about a dozen times, in various forms: ``liquid,
pill, powder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This one time, we got some E that you're supposed to inject,''
she says, ``but I couldn't do it. I totally freak around needles.''
It didn't stop her friends, who injected the drug directly into
their leg muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah is certain she was taking Ecstasy, not another party drug
such as GHB or ketamine, despite the fact that GHB is often sold as
``Liquid E'' and that Ecstasy, when injected, is shot
intravenously, not in one's muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends know what they're getting and you just have to
trust your friends,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like she hasn't heard of the depressant GHB, or
ketamine, a hallucinogenic barbiturate. She's just sure she's never
tried them.
</P>
<P>
   But not all her trips have gone smoothly. There was that time
she passed out for about five hours after taking ``Liquid
Ecstasy.'' Nothing her friends did could revive her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was strange, but a whole bunch of us had done
the same thing and I was the only one who crashed, so it was just
me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Will she be more cautious at the next party?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to be careful,'' she says. ``I mean, like, I'd
need to be worried if I was just buying it off some guy. I have
these two friends and they know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah admits she has no idea who her friends buy the drugs from.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is quite so naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ecstasy is overplayed,'' says Nathan, ``and the
Ecstasy out here is no good.''
</P>
<P>
   He ought to know. The 19-year-old from the north Bronx in New
York City used to be an Ecstasy dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out in a Capitol Hill needle-exchange/harm reduction
center, Nathan takes a break from putting together a stash of
supplies (fresh needles, cookers, cottons and water bottles) to
talk. Nathan's drug of choice right now is speed, which he injects
about three times a day.
</P>
<P>
   He's looking faded, as if he's weighed down by his compact,
muscular build. He attributes his exhaustion to a long day of
skateboarding in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids out here will buy (Ecstasy) and f--- it up. ... They'll
put a bunch of garbage in it. They might put GHB, a little bit of
speed _ I've seen people put motion sickness pills in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he says he started selling Ecstasy when he was 14,
Nathan says at first he wasn't too keen on using the drug himself.
``There was this whole `Oh, it's so sexual, and so lovey-dovey,'
it's like: No. ... I just don't think that whole vibe behind sex
and drugs should mix.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he stopped doing Ecstasy about six months ago because
he's ``over it,'' and because most kids buying drugs such as GHB,
ketamine and Ecstasy have no idea what they're getting. ``A lot of
kids, they don't care. ... It's kind of messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some take a more cavalier attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Jay, 32, jokes that doing Ecstasy makes him feel like
``destroying the state and not maintaining a normal, Republican
work ethic.'' He says it also fills him with a sense of peace and
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although, it's definitely a chemical peace and love ...,'' he
adds, his voice trailing off.
</P>
<P>
   He's tall and slim, and despite his standard issue
jeans-and-T-shirt attire, Jay has an air of elegance about him.
</P>
<P>
   Although he says a host of other drugs are being sold as
Ecstasy, he doesn't believe in the existence of what he calls the
``mythical'' H-Bomb: heroin sold in place of Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like somebody's going to sell you heroin by mistake,'' he
says, sardonically. ``I could throw a rock and hit 10 junkies out
there that are dying for heroin, and someone is going to sell you
heroin when you don't want it?''
</P>
<P>
   Jay also has a lot to say on the topic of GHB.
</P>
<P>
   He considers it a hormone, not a designer drug. He's not even
convinced it's a neurotransmitter, as researchers claim. He calls
it a ``wonder drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve, 26, definitely considers GHB a drug _ right along with
nicotine, alcohol and television. He says he did a lot of Ecstasy
but felt maybe it wasn't the drug for him because an experience
left him with ``an abstract feeling of impending apocalypse.'' He
experimented with it twice more before stopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I passed out and my friends were opening my eyelids, shining
lights into my eyes, trying to wake me up. I have no recollection
of it,'' he says, adding that it wasn't real GHB he was on, but 1,4
butanediol _ a drug often sold as GHB.
</P>
<P>
   GHB is very dose-sensitive and most people have no idea how much
to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you increase the dosage,'' says Jay, ``it becomes more like
alcohol _ you become clumsy, you fall over, you black out, that
sort of thing. ... Not too much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Ketamine tales are a bit more colorful.
</P>
<P>
   For Nathan, who says he last used ketamine four days before this
interview, the drug gave him ``kinda ... like a euphoric feeling.''
He quotes what Timothy Leary said about the drug, that it brings
users in contact with their eighth chakra _ ``and that's the
gateway to seeing God.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan isn't sure if he has seen God. He did, however, fall into
what is commonly known as a ``k hole'' _ a deep, unconscious state.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't do it as much as he used to because ketamine is
expensive in Seattle (about $100 a gram; Nathan says one-tenth of a
gram can be split between three people).
</P>
<P>
   Steve's experience with ketamine was somewhat spookier. ``It was
almost like floating around a big, empty place, looking at various
things, thinking about various ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Explaining it sounds silly now,'' he says, ``but I was trying
to find some way to talk to my dead grandfather.'' He was bummed.
He felt he was on the threshold of talking to his grandfather when
his trip ended. And he felt violently ill the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Jay dismisses ketamine with a ``Star Trek'' analogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If mushrooms are a play and LSD is a film, ketamine is the
holo deck.''

   Deciding to take a drug is one thing. Having someone slip
something in your drink _ or ``dose'' you _ is quite another.
There's no need to be paranoid, but if you don't like surprises,
here are some ways to avoid trouble: _ Politely refuse drinks
(alcoholic and otherwise) from strangers, and avoid leaving your
drink unattended.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even if you're buying bottled water at a rave, make sure the
seal on the cap is not broken.
</P>
<P>
   _ The same goes for food. Take pre-packaged snacks with you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go with a buddy _ an extra set of eyes never hurts.

ACTIVISTS FIGHT FOR INFORMATON, NOT INTOLERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
 REDUCTION-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harm reduction is probably the dirtiest term in drug prevention
circles.
</P>
<P>
   Its proponents assume that even though users know drugs are bad
for them, they will continue to use them. They believe that to
prevent overdoses and other disasters, it is best to inform users
on the safest possible way to use drugs, and to provide clean
syringes and needles.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Nyrop, director of Seattle's Street Outreach Services
(SOS), says he deals with a great deal of misinformation about
drugs, even within the community of users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the unintended consequences of the war on drugs and
the mentality of absolute prohibition is that when you have
something that's in a black market rather than in a regulated
market, you have absolutely no control, so you end up causing more
harm,'' says Nyrop.
</P>
<P>
   His group's focus is to ``reduce the harm associated with
substance use through outreach and education.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach is a controversial departure from traditional drug
prevention models of forced rehabilitation and incarceration. (For
details, see www.harmreduction.org)
</P>
<P>
   In the SOS center in downtown Seattle, Nyrop and a group of
volunteers deal mostly with older users who are addicted to heavier
drugs such as heroin and cocaine. In needle-exchange centers on
Capitol Hill and the University District, Nyrop says he sees mostly
young, white teens dropping in.
</P>
<P>
   He says most of those teens are part of the distinctive
rave/nightclub subculture and favor GHB and Ecstasy _ drugs that
aren't classified as street drugs like marijuana and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time someone ends up in the hospital and it's classified
as a GHB overdose, I would bet the farm that 99 percent of the time
the person has also been using alcohol,'' says Nyrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of confusion, both among professionals and among
users, about some of these drugs. If you ask people if they're
using GHB, a lot of times they'll look at you and go, `Huh? What
are you talking about?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you ask them if they've used Liquid X, they'll say yes.
And Liquid X is GHB ... so they're not aware that Liquid X is not
liquid Ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   MindBodyLove is a group pushing the harm reduction envelope even
further. Bill Hayley, 28, is a member of the Vancouver, B.C., group
that distributes an Ecstasy testing kit.
</P>
<P>
   Hayley wants to make three things clear:
</P>
<P>
   _ He believes providing information is the key to preventing or
at least reducing harm.
</P>
<P>
   _ The tests are not meant to facilitate use.
</P>
<P>
   _ He does not take Ecstasy. He says he used the drug a few times
but stopped after learning the facts about Ecstasy use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not telling anyone to do what I'm doing,'' he says. ``It's
a choice that I've made based on the information that I have. ...
My personal experience with Ecstasy was that it is the lie that
cocaine was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cocaine was the lie of the ego, and Ecstasy became the lie of
love. It's all chemically induced.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, he says, a person opting to take the drug can
take precautions, like making sure to be properly hydrated (he
recommends lots of water and sports drinks) and taking vitamins C,
E and B12 (for their detoxifying qualities).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the parties organized by drug dealers with little else
in mind than pushing drugs, MindBodyLove members have found
responsible event organizers who not only welcome them to their
parties, but ensure there is a source of free water and set up
concession stands selling fruit smoothies and healthy snacks.
</P>
<P>
   MindBodyLove, started just over two years ago, focuses on
disseminating information to teens and young adults. Members go
into schools, community centers and raves, where they answer
questions on drug use and provide unbiased pamphlets (regularly
updated as the group gathers more information). They also provide
information on sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Because it has been included under the umbrella of Vancouver
Area Network of Drug Users (a highly controversial network of
active drug users focusing on harm reduction), MindBodyLove
receives some indirect financial and administrative support from
the government. Health Canada and the Vancouver-Richmond Health
Board provided some resources to the network.

REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ARE TENDER TOWARD THE NEEDS OF THE WEALTHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's been a long time since a good five-cent
cigar was deemed to be what this country needed. Instead, what is
required today is for the sliver of the wealthy in our population
to be further enriched.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans in Congress have seen easing the life of the
rich as their mission. Especially the members of the House of
Representatives, the part of the national legislature designed to
closely reflect the popular will, relentlessly have championed
increasing the pelf controlled by the richest.
</P>
<P>
   Their wish manifested itself in their recent tax-cut bill. It
was such a giveaway that even the Republican-led Senate took steps
to rein in the House's largess. Nevertheless, at the end of the
day, with senatorial restraint added to the mix, the tax package
emerged as a bald attempt to further imbalance the already
maldistributed wealth in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that is just what is needed, as can be plainly seen.
The extravagantly rich simply don't have enough to satisfy the
compulsions that constitute their inner selves. You only need to
look around our own Empire State to discern the reasons for their
continued shortage of satiety.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, the financiers of Wall Street and their army of
investment brokers have managed to drive up the price of housing so
that a two-bedroom apartment in an okay neighborhood fetches close
to three-quarters of a million dollars. Of course, in a stellar
part of town that figure can easily double.
</P>
<P>
   So now we understand that the people who could afford these
prices in the first place need more disposable income to make their
way in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The wealth already in their grasp has distorted the price of
housing, freezing out ordinary people with down-to-earth incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in tony environs outside the city, the buccaneers
from Wall Street are not satisfied simply with their ability to
live the very good life. One chap bought a pricey house, and was
impatient to make use of it. He hired interior designers to fulfill
his urgent desires. The New York Times account informs us that ``He
wanted it done _ spare no expense _ in six weeks: 10 bedrooms, a
pool house, stables, tennis courts and two three-car garages _
overhauled, outfitted and furnished, right down to a selection of
clothes hangars.'' And all that cost only ``in the low millions,''
The Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if this particular hedge-fund manager was special;
others have launched similar undertakings.
</P>
<P>
   Now this requires a lot of loot, and the Republicans are
inclined to keep the economy humming by providing jobs and overtime
pay for the armies of painters, carpenters, electricians,
gardeners, merchants _ you name it _ needed to feed the pretensions
of people who live in $10 million houses.
</P>
<P>
   If sprucing up the abode weren't enough, in another part of the
realm of the extremely well-to-do, the Hamptons on Long Island,
some of the princes of the market couldn't abide the lay of the
land. So they hired earth movers to shove the dirt around to create
soft hills and upgrade their once-flat and obviously boring real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Thorstein Veblen, economist and sociologist, writing 100 years
ago about behavior in the Gilded Age, characterized this as
``conspicuous consumption.'' That trenchant phrase endured because
it captured what happens when excess wealth is concentrated to the
extent that squandering it defines having it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would abet such consumption by cutting even more the
capital gains tax on investments, already drastically reduced a
couple of years ago. They would do this also by decreasing
inheritance taxes, which clearly favor those who have most.
Finally, they would give the biggest tax cut to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are right when they proclaim that surplus tax
money is the property of the people and do not automatically belong
to the government. That should mean that tax cuts make the system
more fair for more people. Eliminating the marriage penalty, for
example, is an act of fairness which the Republican tax cut
includes.
</P>
<P>
   There are other tidbits for anyone not wealthy, but they are
trifles compared to what is intended for those who need it least.
</P>
<P>
   But any tax cut, for any purpose, has to be based on an existing
surplus. Don't spend or give away what you don't have. One would
think that would be a principle dear to the kind of conservatives
whose ideas used to govern the GOP.

TESTS HELP FIGURE OUT IF YOU'RE GETTING ECSTASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ecstasy users might think they know what they're getting, but
chances are they're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study done on Ecstasy samples in various U.S. cities by
the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies
(www.maps.org) found that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Only 14 percent of the samples contained 100 percent pure
MDMA.
</P>
<P>
   _ 36 percent contained no MDMA.
</P>
<P>
   _ 77 percent of samples contained unidentified substances.
</P>
<P>
   _ 50 percent contained a mixture of unidentified substances with
some MDMA (the percentage of MDMA ranging from 16 to 85).
</P>
<P>
   EZ-Test is one way to test pills sold as Ecstasy. The kit is
manufactured in the Netherlands, the source of most Ecstasy
smuggled here. Using a few drops of a pre-mixed solution, the test
determines whether a pill contains Ecstasy-like chemicals,
amphetamines or a drug called 2C-B.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hayley of MindBodyLove, a harm reduction group, distributes
EZ-Test. He says he's concerned about the availability of drugs _
especially hard drugs _ on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing with Ecstasy is that it can be made in boot
(clandestine) labs, and you never know what you're going to get. A
lot of people try to sell things like PCP, ketamine, crystal forms
of GHB.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayley says the profits from selling the drug test kits also
fund MindBodyLove's efforts.
</P>

AMID TEEN VIOLENCE, AN EVENT TO HELP THE HEALING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; America is holding strong in its moral battle against the
rising tide of hate and violence that is killing too many of us,
especially our children.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the nation last week, a racist sprayed bullets in
a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, wounding two adults and
three children, and later killing a postal worker because of his
color.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the other end of the nation, in the Atlanta area, a
group of churches, African-American and white, prepared to embrace
a white victim of the hate-driven teenage shooting rampage at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The churches are raising funds to help pay the medical expenses
for Lance Kirklin, who miraculously survived a shotgun blast to his
face, as well as wounds on his legs and chest, in the Littleton
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   He will visit Georgia over the next two weekends, largely at the
invitation of Harry L. Ross, an Atlanta-based pollster and former
schoolteacher. Ross is coordinating the Aug. 28 ``Crime Prevention
Summit'' in Atlanta that will focus on teenage violence in the
nation's schools. Kirklin accepted Ross's invitation to speak at
the summit, which will include appearances by area law enforcement
officials and other experts on violence.
</P>
<P>
   A group of African-American ministers contacted by Ross agreed
to help raise money for Kirklin's medical bills, which will include
surgery to reconstruct the left side of his face. He is scheduled
to visit more than a dozen churches in Atlanta, Decatur, Macon, and
Gainesville during the next two weekends.
</P>
<P>
   But the summit conference _ which will bring together clergy,
judges, law enforcment officials, mental health professionals,
school officials, and others who work with children and teenagers _
has another purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summit is important to us because we have to reach our
youth before they commit the kinds of offenses that escalate into
murder and other serious crimes,'' said Ross. ``We need to prevent
the kind of deadly violence that we have witnessed in Georgia,
Alabama, California, and other states.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the churches that are helping Kirklin are Cascade United
Methodist Church in Atlanta and the Beaulah Baptist Church in
Decatur. They have a combined predominantly black congregation of
nearly 15,000 members. Other churches, including those belonging to
the predominantly white liberal wing of the Southern Baptists, the
Cooperative Baptist Fellowship of Georgia, have also joined the
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he got the idea of inviting Kirklin to the Atlanta
area when he saw an African-American high school track star, Rashad
Williams of San Francisco, on television discussing his
fund-raising effort to help pay Kirklin's medical bills, which
total around $230,000 so far. Williams's efforts, which included a
7.5 mile race, have helped raise about $40,000. Other
organizations, such The Mile High United Way's ``Healing Fund,''
has contributed $150,000 toward the medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hope to get out of the fund-raising effort is a
bringing together of black and white and Jewish communities. I hope
that our efforts will make it possible for people to want to cross
racial lines toward racial healing,'' said Ross.
</P>
<P>
   The event is bringing a spiritual healing to the Atlanta area
and, through the media coverage, to a nation emotionally wounded by
the alarming number of teenage shootings and hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   As Ross said about Kirklin, ``He is a miracle child because he
lived to give us a message from God _ a wake-up call for all of us
as adults to be attentive and alert. This conference will focus on
prevention and intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Children need our protection. More than 75,000 were killed by
guns between 1979 and 1996, according to the most recent report of
the Children's Defense Fund. Every day in America, 13 children are
killed by guns. More children under 10 are killed each year by guns
than police are in the line of duty or US soldiers are by hostile
action, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it says, there are more gun-related child deaths in
America than American battle casualties during the entire Vietnam
war.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings across the nation should have been a wake-up call
for all of us, wherever we live.
</P>
<P>
   And if God kept Kirklin alive for a reason, it just may be to
remind us that this nation has a lot of work to do _ especially for
its children. And we'd better get to it.

CONTROVERSY ABOUNDS OVER MDMA EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Entactogens
</P>
<P>
   As long as there are late-night and all-night parties, various
forms of stimulants will be widely used: Ecstasy
(3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA for short) and MDA and
MDEA, two others that are similar in structure.
</P>
<P>
   If there were any question on the rising popularity of these
drugs, check this out: Over 1 million MDMA pills were seized by
customs officials at New York's Kennedy Airport over the last nine
months alone. MDMA pills are manufactured in the Netherlands for
about $2 each and are sold for $25 to $40 per pill. This makes
smuggling and dealing Ecstasy big business.
</P>
<P>
   Usually available in powder and pill form, Ecstasy _ also known
as ``E'' or ``X'' _ is a massive part of the party scene,
especially raves. Although MDMA is definitely a stimulant, its
somewhat hallucinogenic effects set it apart from other drugs in
that family. It can also fill the user with a sense of empathy.
</P>
<P>
   MDMA's uncommon combination of effects has led researchers to
put it in a category by itself _ the category entactogen.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of MDMA _ once known as the ``love drug'' _ are
meant to amplify the generally positive atmosphere at techno
parties, which are based on the concepts of unity and acceptance.
Interestingly enough, the rave culture has made fashionable
allowances for some of MDMA's negative side-effects. One of those
side-effects is grinding one's teeth, the reason pacifiers have
become standard party gear.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to MDMA, pharmacology professor Wilkie Wilson
doesn't mince any words. He describes the drug as ``the most
neurotoxic drug out there. By that I mean killing nerve cells. It
is a bad drug, and unfortunately, it makes people feel wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of liberal middle-class people that use this
drug and they don't like the fact that I say it's not a good drug,
despite the fact that the evidence is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson says MDMA damages the brain's serotonin, the
neurochemical through which anti-depressants such as Prozac work.
Wilson's description of MDMA's damage to the serotonin system is
dramatic: He says it kills the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Users) can't see these bad things happening ... because it's
slow, and it's insidious ... so that's even more of a reason for
those of us who can remain credible to get out there and talk about
this drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with Wilson's view. Some researchers and
drug users argue that there are too many random variables in the
research labeling MDMA a neurotoxin. A list of these arguments can
be found on the Web at: www.ecstasy.org
</P>
<P>
   What remains disconcerting _ no matter what the drug's effects _
is the fact that so many different drugs are sold on the street as
MDMA. It might be substandard MDMA prepared by an inept
biochemistry major, or it might not be MDMA at all.
</P>
<P>
   MindBodyLove's Bill Hayley has also come across a certain group
of dealers selling the ``date-rape drug'' Rohypnol and PCP as
Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   The damage: Can you say ``cognitive dysfunction?'' Research done
at London's Imperial College School of Medicine concludes that MDMA
damages your memory. As in, you'll have a hard time recognizing
people, remembering lists and phone numbers, etc. It won't kill
you, nor will it turn you into a blithering idiot (MDMA doesn't
touch the frontal lobes of your brain, which control verbal fluency
and such).
</P>
<P>
   So how do you know if you've done enough MDMA to damage
yourself? Wilson gives a list of behavioral cues: Clinical
depression, irritability and anxiety between uses, sleeping and
eating problems.
</P>
<P>
   He says these problems are the result of impaired serotonin
function. A deficit in serotonin is why some depressed patients
require Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-existing risk factors: Some health conditions make taking
this drug a very bad idea. Wilson targets anyone with
cardiovascular problems, including hypertension, any mental health
problems and epilepsy. He worries about the effects combined with
the atmosphere of some of the more poorly organized parties _ a
packed warehouse with little ventilation and no source of water,
for example. Because MDMA is a stimulant of sorts, Wilson's advice
is hardly surprising but well worth repeating.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous combinations: There's not much in the way of
conclusive research here, but Wilson nonetheless warns that it's
never a good idea to mix alcohol with anything. Because alcohol is
not part of the rave scene, this is more of a concern at clubs and
house parties.

KETAMINE RESONATES AT RAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hallucinogens
</P>
<P>
   Everything at a rave is geared to trip you out: the digital
displays on the walls, the way the repetitive beats are
synchronized with the lasers and lights to put you in a trance
state.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are several hybrids of electronic dance music
that fall under the umbrella of trance music _ deep trance, dark
trance, Goa trance.
</P>
<P>
   This atmosphere explains the popularity of hallucinogenic drugs
at raves, where the idea is to have an out-of-body, spiritual
experience while having the energy to dance all night.
</P>
<P>
   Hallucinogens _ a family of drugs made popular by '60s beatniks,
hippies and musicians _ have more chemical edge to them in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   While it doesn't always cause hallucinations, ketamine (also
known as ``Vitamin K'' or ``Special K'') has become increasingly
popular among the high-school raver set.
</P>
<P>
   A barbiturate, ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic _ it can
make users feel their mind is detached from their body. The drug
blocks a certain neurotransmitter (glutamate) at its receptors.
</P>
<P>
   Ketamine is used by veterinarians to sedate cats and monkeys.
It's also used on humans in conjunction with Valium-like compounds
(benzodiazepines) for anesthetic purposes. The combination of the
two drugs suppresses the hallucinogenic effects of ketamine.
</P>
<P>
   Ketamine _ a white, powdery substance often mixed in drinks,
taken in pill form or administered through intramuscular injection
_ also acts as a stimulant on the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Although ketamine seems innocuous _ especially with those cutesy
street names _ it's not. It's in the same family as the animal
tranquilizer PCP (a.k.a. angel dust), although it's milder in its
effects on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The damage: No conclusive information here, so you're flying
blind.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-existing risk factors: Pharmacology professor Wilkie Wilson
says that if you suffer from epilepsy or any sort of mental health
problems, including depression, you should avoid this stuff. This
warning also stands if there's any family history of mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous combinations: Because ketamine works on the same
receptor as alcohol, Wilson says combining these two increases the
chance of dying through respiratory depression, which means your
brain forgets to tell your lungs to breathe.

EMPTY CAMPAIGNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sensation of the 1896 presidential campaign was William
Jennings Bryan, the Democratic nominee. At his party's convention
in St. Louis, he electrified the delegates with a speech about
inflation _ specifically, about increasing the nation's money
supply by abandoning the gold standard and permitting the coinage
of silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have entreated, and our entreaties have been disregarded;
we have begged, and they have mocked when our calamity came. We beg
no longer; we entreat no more; we petition no more. We defy them. .
. . ! We will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to
them: You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of
thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold!''
</P>
<P>
   The speech set the convention aflame. For nearly an hour,
frenzied delegates cheered, parading Bryan around the floor on
their shoulders. And that was just the start. Bryan barnstormed the
country, talking incessantly about monetary policy and national
prosperity. He traveled 18,000 miles, and gave more than 600
speeches. The passion he ignited was astonishing. ``A fanaticism
like the Crusades,'' Kansas editor William Allen White (a
Republican) called it.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to imagine a modern audience being swept away
by a speech on currency. But then, it is impossible to imagine a
modern presidential candidate delivering such a speech. To run for
the White House today is to sedulously avoid talking about issues,
and to resort instead to catchy themes and focus-group-tested
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Look around. George W. Bush wants Americans to know that he
believes in ``compassionate conservatism,'' but he deflects all
calls to explain what that might mean. He has no interest, he tells
an interviewer, in ``sitting down and reading a 500-page book on
public policy or philosophy or something.'' To Bush, it would seem,
policy is for wonks.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole would like to be the first woman president, but
says little to distinguish herself from the guys. She speaks from
an unvarying script. ``Doonesbury'' has lampooned her for
robotically answering questions with bromides. If she has any new
ideas, she isn't telling. Mostly, she dishes up cliches. ``Our
people are looking for leaders.'' ``I am not a politician.'' ``I
have the vision.''
</P>
<P>
   In virtually every public appearance, Vice President Al Gore
ominously utters the words ``risky tax scheme.'' He has been
chanting that mantra since 1996; in his debate with Jack Kemp, he
chanted it eight times. Then, it was a put-down of Bob Dole's
proposed 15 percent tax cut; now it's a put-down of the tax cuts
pending in Congress. The budget deficit that made tax relief
``risky'' in 1996 has turned into a budget surplus today, but Gore
sees no need to change his tune. Nor does he see a need to lay out
his own views on taxation. His pollsters tell him to say ``risky
tax scheme.'' So he says it, over and over and over.
</P>
<P>
   All presidential campaigns have policy advisers, but policy is
less and less a part of presidential politics. Its place has been
taken by poll results, advertising, and fund-raising. ``Campaigns
rarely make or propose policy these days,'' writes Daniel Casse,
who worked for Lamar Alexander and Dole in 1996. ``It is considered
too risky an undertaking. Ideas still have consequences, but that
may be the reason presidential campaigns keep a safe distance from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Casse's article, ``The Quadrennial Fear of Ideas,'' appears in
the new issue of Policy Review. Looking back at 30 years of
presidential races, he remarks how rare it has become for a
presidential nominee to run on a clear and forceful agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Polling has changed everything. The media demand specifics from
candidates, but polls never show that those are what the public
wants. Voters ``invariably list `the economy,' `drugs and crime,'
or `education' as the most important issues facing the nation,''
says Casse. Instead of treating this data as mere sentiment,
campaign gurus take it as a mandate, concluding ``that their
candidate must run as `the education president' or mention the
nation's `moral crisis' prominently in every speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideas have all but vanished from national campaigns, supplanted
by atmospherics and polished catchphrases. In 1980, as Jimmy
Carter's reelection effort foundered, pollster Pat Cadell wrote a
long memo on how to reverse the downward drift. ``People must be
given a positive reason to vote for Jimmy Carter,'' it said. Yet
nowhere did Cadell suggest what that positive reason might be.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, President Bush's strategist Robert Teeter charted a
reelection course that steered clear of forthright policy
initiatives. He proposed to beat Bill Clinton with themes, such as
``leadership'' and ``trust,'' that did well in the polls. At one
meeting, Teeter distributed a chart explaining the Bush campaign
strategy. At its center was a box titled `message.' The box was
empty.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns don't have to be empty _ Ronald Reagan's 1980 run was
packed with policy ideas, from supply-side economics to hemispheric
trade. But it was a one-time exception. In 1984, the Reagan
campaign steered clear of substance, relying on ``Morning in
America'' and feel-good TV spots to win reelection.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't going to change, no matter how many pundits urge the
candidates to stop being so vague. And really, who can blame them?
In 1896, William Jennings Bryan lost. He was vanquished by
Republican William McKinley, who spent the campaign on his front
porch in Canton, Ohio, reciting empty platitudes.

INHALANTS ARE A CHEAP HIGH, AND VERY DANGEROUS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Inhalants
</P>
<P>
   Among younger kids _ 14 and under _ ``huffing'' (or inhaling)
freon, benzol-based emolients, solvents, aerosols, adhesives and
other solvents is nothing new. But as more expensive drugs such as
ketamine and Ecstasy grow in popularity, the use of these solvents
increases because kids see them as a cheap high.
</P>
<P>
   ``With inhalants (solvents), those chemicals just get everything
in your body,'' says pharmacology professor Wilkie Wilson. ``I mean
they get your liver, your heart, your kidneys. Those things are
just horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense not to inhale something that cleans bathroom
tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Older users have access to a far safer class of inhalants,
including amyl nitrate and nitrous oxide _ although teens often
inhale the nitrous oxide from whipping cream cans, known as doing
``whippets.''
</P>
<P>
   These drugs have been widely used in the underground club scene
for at least three decades, but are now being used among the more
mainstream party crowds in clubs.
</P>
<P>
   A King County Public Health Department report on drug trends in
the Seattle and King County area contains reports of raves where
nitrous oxide balloons were sold for $5 each.
</P>
<P>
   These inhalants, which increase blood flow to the heart and give
a ``rush,'' are often referred to as ``poppers'' and ``thrust.''
They are also used to heighten sexual experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The damage: Of all the drugs discussed in ``Buzzed,'' the
section on inhaling solvents carries one of the heaviest warnings:
``The authors take the position that these compounds are so toxic
to both the first-time user and the long-term user that they should
never be used under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as amyl nitrate and nitrous oxide _ which is sometimes
used as an anesthetic agent by dentists and surgeons _ are used as
intended (inhaled with oxygen, not swallowed), the risk is
relatively limited.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-existing risk factors: It's never safe to inhale solvents.
Avoid amyl nitrate if you have blood circulation problems or have a
weak immune system.

GHB, ROHYPNOL TAKE SEDATIVES INTO THE PARTY SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neurotransmitters
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common sedatives ingested at parties has been
GHB (gamma-hydroxybuterate). Its use as an anesthetic was
discontinued because of the high incidence of seizures and
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   A central nervous system depressant, GHB is sold as a clear
fluid with a slightly salty taste (often with some black specks
floating through it). It is sometimes called Easy Lay and Liquid X
(GHB is often sold as Ecstasy, and it goes undetected by some users
even though GHB is a depressant and Ecstasy is a stimulant).
</P>
<P>
   Why would a depressant be used as a party drug?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a depressant,'' explains pharmacology professor
Wilkie Wilson. ``It is a remarkable compound because it is actually
a chemical that is present normally in the brain, and is perhaps
used to signal information between nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the very few chemicals that actually can cross
from the blood into the brain. ... This makes it especially
interesting and dicey.''
</P>
<P>
   Kits for making GHB can be purchased online, where _ not
surprisingly _ recipes for making the drug are also provided. The
drug is also pushed online as a steroid, a claim Wilson says is
unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
   Things can and do go wrong during these at-home synthesis
sessions. A common result: Instead of ending up with GHB, you end
up with a mixture of GHB and sodium hydrochloride. If you take
this, not only will you vomit, but the sodium hydroxide will burn
everything it touches on its way out your esophagus, throat and
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   GBL (gamma-butyrolactone) is often offered as GHB. Used in many
things, including industrial cleaning agents, GBL is transformed
into GHB by the liver.
</P>
<P>
   GHB is notoriously hard for doctors and police officers to trace
and is easily concealed. The body metabolizes the drug relatively
quickly, and it may be undetectable in blood samples as little as
12 hours after ingestion.
</P>
<P>
   The use and abuse of benzodiazepines, a family of sedatives, are
on the rise in dance culture.
</P>
<P>
   When most of us think of sedatives (or downers), we think of
common brands such as Valium and Xanax. Included in this family of
drugs is Rohypnol (flunitrazepam), a drug often compared to Valium
(although the DEA says it is about 10 times stronger). Rohypnol is
also known as ``roofies'' or ``Mexican Valium.'' It's commonly
referred to as ``the date-rape drug'' because of numerous sexual
assault cases where the drug was slipped into victims' drinks _
usually at parties or nightclubs _ leaving them incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
   The damage: No physiological harm, although users run the risk
of passing out and not remembering what happened. Taking large
amounts of GHB (and/or mixing it with alcohol) could cause you to
end up comatose for a few hours. There's also the slight
possibility of ``fecal incontinence.''
</P>
<P>
   Pre-existing risk factors: Wilson warns those who have
cardiovascular problems, hypertension, epilepsy or any sort of
mental illness not to experiment with GHB and Rohypnol.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous combinations: Never mix benzodiazepines with other
sedatives (this includes anything from opiates and nitrous oxide to
cold medication). This combination carries the risk of respiratory
and cardiovascular failure. Wilson lists these symptoms: drowsiness
and muscular uncoordination with slurring of speech; deep sleep
from which a person cannot be aroused; loss of reflexes such as eye
blink, gag and withdrawal from a painful stimulus; suppressed
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   If you spot people with these symptoms, they're not tripping
out, they're dying.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Steven and Barbara Grossman have reached a rare
milestone in American politics. In the fund-raising frenzy of the
1990s, the Newton businessman and his wife, a Tufts University
professor, have given more than $1 million to the Democratic Party
and its candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Grossmans, heirs to the Massachusetts Envelope empire,
embody the stereotype of Massachusetts as a bastion of affluent
liberals bankrolling the Democratic machine.
</P>
<P>
   But several wealthy Republicans are burying that image under a
crush of campaign dollars. In a struggle for political supremacy
that has pitted neighbor against neighbor and business partner
against business partner, the state's top GOP contributors are
racing Grossman and his Democratic allies to help finance the
multimillion-dollar campaigns for the White House and Congress in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Republican backers are little known. But behind the
scenes, some of them are playing major roles in national politics,
including:
</P>
<P>
   --John W. Childs, a Boston investor who has effectively served
as the Republican counterbalance to Grossman. Childs and his wife,
Marlene, have contributed more than $820,000 to the GOP cause in
the 1990s, and the Republican Party is counting on them to
contribute an additional $1 million over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   --John A. Kaneb, an oil magnate who owns H. P. Hood Inc. and
part of the Boston Red Sox. Kaneb and his wife, Virginia, have
given Republican candidates and committees more than $520,000
during the decade, including $340,000 in 1997 and 1998 to help the
GOP maintain control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   --Herbert F. Collins, chairman of Boston Capital Partners Inc.,
who has made the largest single political donation in Massachusetts
this year, $40,000 to the Repubican Party. In the 1990s, Collins
and his wife, Sheila, have donated nearly $440,000 to the GOP and
and its candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Unswayed by the failed push in Congress to ban ``big money'' in
politics or by the referendum in Massachusetts last year to
establish public funding for campaigns for state offices, the
state's titans of political giving are emerging among the nation's
most prolific contributors of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the explosion of large, unregulated contributions known as
soft money, many of the top Massachusetts donors are giving more
than ever in this year of record-setting political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless small groups of passionate Democrats like myself and
many others are prepared to step up and be significant funders of
the party, we risk creating such an imbalance in the system that it
would have a negative effect on our ability to get the job done
politically,'' said Grossman, the former chairman of the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Childs gave the GOP more than $515,000 in soft money in 1997 and
1998, more than any other Massachusetts donor gave either party.
Only four individuals in the country donated more soft money than
Childs over the two years, including Richard M. DeVos, the Amway
founder, who gave the Republican Party $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Grossman, an ardent public advocate for the Democratic
cause, Childs shuns public attention. He and the state's other top
Republican contributors did not respond to requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory has generally been: Don't talk to people and they
won't write about you,'' Childs said in a rare interview in 1995
with the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Childs and Thomas H. Lee, his former business partner,
apparently had no trouble working together and financing rival
political parties. Childs split from Lee's investment firm in 1995
to start his company.
</P>
<P>
   While Childs was providing financial fuel for Republicans in the
early 1990s, Lee was donating part of the $520,000 that he has
given the Democratic Party and its candidates over the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the current business partners with clashing
political interests are Collins and John P. Manning, the president
of Boston Capital Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Six months before Collins gave his $40,000 check to the
Republican Party in February, Manning hosted President Clinton at a
$25,000-per-person fund-raiser for the Democratic Party at his
Beacon Street townhouse near the Public Garden. Manning donated
$50,000 to the event, boosting his personal contributions to the
Democratic Party and its candidates above $600,000 for the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to Manning's townhouse are the headquarters of Thomas
A. Kershaw, owner of the Hampshire House. While Clinton was dining
at Manning's townhouse, Kershaw's business interests were providing
Kershaw with the income to help fund the Republican attack against
the president's party.
</P>
<P>
   That week, Kershaw wrote checks for $8,500 to various GOP
candidates and committees, part of his $351,000 in personal giving
over the decade. Kershaw's companies also have given nearly $30,000
to the Republican cause.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the fund-raising free-for-all, some of the state's biggest
donors have decided the current campaign finance system is broken
beyond repair. Prominent among them is Arnold S. Hiatt, retired
chairman of the Stride Rite Corp., who gave the Democratic Party a
check for $500,000 three weeks before the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusted with the campaign-finance scandals that followed the
election, Hiatt helped launch a push for publicly funded elections
and funded that effort rather than political parties.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the only contribution that Hiatt or his wife, Anne,
made last year to a political party or candidate was $1,000 to
Senator John F. Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress has rebuffed the push for publicly funded
elections, the initiative has gained momentum or succeeded in
several states, including Massachusetts. ``Contrary to the
conventional wisdom, there is a crescendo of interest in true
campaign finance reform,'' Hiatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman agreed on the need for change. But like donors in both
major parties, he said he is not willing to suspend his giving
``and leave the entire battlefield monopolized by the other side.''

HOPE, BUT NO CURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was 60 years ago last May that New York Yankees
first baseman Lou Gehrig benched himself after playing 2,130
consecutive games, and a few weeks later was diagnosed with the
fatal disease that now bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrig's progressive troubles in playing baseball _ stumbling,
loss of coordination, fatigue, weakness _ were the first signs of
what the medical world calls amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.
The cause is unknown, but the devastating effects result from the
death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord _ nerve cells
that control muscles throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's no cure, Lou Gehrig's disease eventually
incapacitates the person, who is otherwise entirely normal
mentally, and erodes the ability to chew, swallow, and breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Death is unavoidable. On average, people with ALS live about
three years after diagnosis, ``but I always emphasize that there's
huge variability and some people live considerably longer,'' said
Dr. Gilmore O'Neill, a neurologist at Massachusetts General
Hospital. ``There are people living very many years.'' Best-known
is physicist Stephen Hawking, 57, who was diagnosed with ALS when
he was 21 and has carried on a successful career and family life
although he can speak only when using a computerized voice
synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame pitcher Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter was one of an
estimated 5,000 people diagnosed last year with ALS, which
typically attacks people between the ages of 40 and 70. About
30,000 people in the United States have the disease at any given
time. It's more common than Huntington's disease, the
neurodegenerative disease that killed folk singer Woody Guthrie,
and about as common as multiple sclerosis, a disease that attacks
the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who first noticed weakness in his arms while hunting in
May of last year, is battling ALS at a time of unprecedented hope,
though no dramatic way to combat the disease is on the horizon. But
in contrast to the past, when there was no treatment at all (ALS
was first identified in 1869 by French neurologist Jean-Martin
Charcot), there is now one drug that modestly slows the disease and
several others undergoing testing. In 1995, the Food and Drug
Administration approved the drug Rilutek, which can extend survival
by about 20 percent, said O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Another drug, myotrophin, may have a similar effect and is also
in testing. Researchers believe that substances called growth
factors, which nourish nerve cells and combat their degeneration,
could play an important future role in ALS treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A key advance came in 1993 when scientists found a gene mutation
involved in the small minority of ALS cases that are inherited.
That faulty gene causes the body to make an abnormal enzyme _ a
substance that normally helps protect motor nerve cells against
damage by so-called ``free radicals,'' or destructive forms of
oxygen. This may be a clue to treatment, and many patients now take
high doses of antioxidant vitamins in hopes of slowing the damage
to nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that O'Neill is optimistic about future advances
against ALS is that ``there's a huge amount of cooperation (among
scientists) in this disease, and a large number of people are
working on it.''

SLADE GORTON SAYS ENVIRONMENTAL CRITICISM OF HIM IS UNFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Environmentalists seeking to crack down on
gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles have found an unlikely
Republican champion: Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., one of the
environmental movement's favorite bugbears.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's advocacy for increased fuel economy standards for sport
utility vehicles places him in an unusual alliance with the Sierra
Club and other environmental groups, which consider the senator a
prime target for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Some days, the Sierra Club in Seattle hands out mock baseball
cards at Safeco Field, criticizing Gorton for ``striking out'' on
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Other days, the Sierra Club in Washington, D.C., holds its nose
and allows Gorton to pose in front of its new prop, a 24-foot-long
inflatable sport utility vehicle nicknamed the Exterminator.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton says the situation reflects the unfairness of the
environmental movement's repeated castigation of him as a raper and
pillager of Mother Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say a few good deeds _ and they
acknowledge that Gorton has done some positive things _ are not
enough to erase the lengthy anti-environmental record they say
Gorton has amassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put his one or two modestly good efforts on behalf
of the environment in the context of his lifetime batting average,
and when you look at his lifetime batting average, it's very
consistent and consistently bad,'' says Bill Arthur, Northwest
director of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's basically putting on the green lipstick to try and get a
date with the voters, and we're not going to let him get away with
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton says the rap is unfair and is driven by competition among
environmental groups that try to outdo one another with radical
ideas to attract more members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself to be an environmentalist or
conservationist, but I differ with the environmental groups in
their whole series of absolutes,'' Gorton said. ``Those groups
would impose severe economic penalties on people other than their
own members. These issues require much more nuance or balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's environmental record is certain to play a major role in
his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   His position on auto-emission standards notwithstanding, there
is tremendous ill will between Gorton and the environmental
movement. Gorton's aides list environmentalists, along with trial
lawyers, Indian tribes and labor unions, as the four groups they
expect to bankroll their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment will play an important role in this race
because we're at a crossroads in protecting the environment,'' says
state Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn, a Democrat running
against Gorton. ``There are a lot of interests to be balanced, but
it's important to try to balance those interests and not divide
them. We've had a lot of division from Gorton.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton cites several things as evidence of his conservationist
sympathies, including support for wildlife refuges and some forms
of salmon recovery, particularly efforts in the central Puget Sound
area.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton was one of the key players in putting together the 1984
Washington Wilderness Act, which preserved 1 million acres of land
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But the environmental movement says Gorton has a long record of
anti-environmental votes and a history of attaching
anti-environmental provisions to unrelated spending measures.
</P>
<P>
   The League of Conservation Voters gave the senator a zero in its
last ranking period, meaning that Gorton never voted according to
the group's wishes. Gorton says the league is a politicized group
whose rankings are unfair.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats are to be believed, Washington state residents are
particularly riled up about Gorton's use of a legislative rider to
overturn a Clinton administration decision blocking a proposed gold
mine in Okanogan County. Sen. Patty Murray, Rep. Jay Inslee and
Senn all claim that they are regularly accosted by voters upset by
Gorton's action.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton insists that the Crown Jewel mine was not an
environmental issue at all, but an issue of fairness to a mining
company and economic development for an impoverished county. The
mine's owners, who had spent millions of dollars and won dozens of
regulatory and legal skirmishes, had been granted approval from
state environmental regulators but were blocked late in the process
by federal officials citing a provision of an 1872 mining law that
the mining industry claims has rarely been enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their many disputes, Gorton and environmentalists are
somehow managing to work together on fuel economy standards. For
Gorton, who has been interested in this issue for decades, the
timing of the current debate allows him to demand a more nuanced
review of his environmental record. For environmentalists, Gorton's
support gives them a much-needed Republican champion in a Senate
controlled by the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gorton says he supports higher fuel economy standards
because they work, his support comes at little political cost _ the
main opponents of higher fuel economy standards are automobile
manufacturers, who have little presence in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have rarely seen a regulatory scheme that was more
successful than the change in fuel efficiency standards from the
late '60s to 1980,'' he said. ``This is one of those social and
regulatory experiments that works. Most don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton blames his own party, and President Reagan in particular,
for halting the nation's gradual increase in fuel efficiency
standards, and he says the Clinton administration has been no
better. Since 1995, Congress has blocked the Department of
Transportation from even studying an increase in the so-called CAFE
standard, an acronym that stands for corporate average fuel
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has opposed that congressional prohibition in the past,
but this year, allied with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. and Sen.
Richard Bryan, D-Nev., and formulating strategy with the Sierra
Club, he is leading a renewed charge for a relatively modest step.
The three, supported by a large group of senators including Murray,
want the Senate to pass a resolution expressing the sense of the
Senate that the Department of Transportation should be allowed to
study higher fuel economy standards.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government regulates the average fuel economy of the
fleet of cars and trucks sold by U.S. manufacturers. If the
standards were raised, manufacturers would have to increase the
fuel efficiency of their fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles are regulated as light trucks. According
to Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., a large increase in standards
would mean sport utility vehicles and light trucks would have to be
``dramatically re-engineered. Automakers would be forced to
implement and design radically new engine and autobody change. Such
changes would be enormously challenging and would be reflected in
decreased power and carrying capacity coupled with an increase in
price. The result would be a less desirable automobile.''
</P>
<P>
   However, environmentalists claim that consumers want more
fuel-efficient sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the standard for cars is 27.5 miles per gallon, while
for sport utility vehicles it is 20.7 miles per gallon. As the
popularity of sport utility vehicles rises, the average fuel
economy for motor vehicles drops.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton cites the same arguments as environmentalists in pushing
an increase in fuel economy standards: they reduce U.S. dependence
on oil imports, contribute to cleaner air and save consumers money
in gas purchases. Environmentalists claim raising fuel economy
standards would also reduce global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The automobile industry, along with its allies in Congress,
opposes the increase. The Ford Motor Co. says CAFE standards have
failed because, even though cars are more fuel efficient, consumers
are driving more. Abraham says higher emissions standards ``would
spell the doom of the line of vehicles which are largely
responsible for the resurgence and continued success of the
American automotive industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some think tanks have even argued that higher CAFE standards are
dangerous. The National Center for Policy Analysis and the
Competitive Enterprise Institute have both published papers arguing
that higher emissions standards encourage the manufacture of
lighter vehicles that fare less well in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton rejects those arguments, saying that the automobile
industry predicted doom when the federal government first imposed
fuel economy standards, and their predictions were proved false.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that what was a success in the past can be a
success in the future,'' Gorton said.

BIDIS SMOKES MAY TASTE SWEET BUT THEY'RE FAR FROM SAFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIKA HAYASAKI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They come in an assortment of mouth-watering flavors
including strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, cherry, raspberry and
mango.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like jelly beans, but they're cigarettes from India that
appear to be natural, herbal and safe.
</P>
<P>
   But these non-filtered smokes _ called bidis _ are far from
safe.
</P>
<P>
   They contain more cancer-causing agents than regular cigarettes,
according to Samira Asma, an epidemiologist for the Atlanta-based
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their candylike flavors and cheap prices, it's 18- to
21-year-olds who flock to smoke shops to buy them. And under-agers
are getting their hands on them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Wu, a 15-year-old high school sophomore from Seatac, Wash., who
asked that his last name not be used, said he first tried
strawberry-flavored bidis when he was in the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different, better than cigarettes. It was sweeter. I'll
smoke them again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Lin, owner of Tom's University Smoke Shop in Seattle's
University District, said the bidi phenomenon is a fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have always been bidis, but three or four years ago they
suddenly became very popular,'' he said. ``There were only three or
four brands; now there's a whole bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing trend is attracting kids. A survey in San Francisco
last year found 58 percent of students at four high schools had
tried them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are definitely aware of them,'' said Michael
Leon-Guerrero, health educator for the King County Public Health
Tobacco Prevention Program. ``We do health fairs and community
outreach programs and it comes up. They want to know about bidis.''
</P>
<P>
   From the downtown streets of Seattle to suburban Renton and
Lynnwood, most teens and young adults interviewed had either tried
bidis or had friends who tried them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried it a year ago through some friends,'' said Heather
Shanor, a 21-year-old department store employee at Southcenter Mall
in Tukwila. ``My friends smoked them instead of cigarettes. They
smelled better and didn't stink like most cigarettes. I think
that's why girls smoke them.''
</P>
<P>
   While bidis contain less tobacco than regular cigarettes, they
have three times more nicotine and five times more tar, according
to Asma, the CDC epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Health effects may include respiratory problems, mouth, throat,
stomach and lung cancer, heart disease and nicotine addiction, Asma
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young people and young adults tend to look at it as a
natural form of tobacco,'' she said. ``They think it is healthy. It
has an earthy feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bearing a striking resemblance to marijuana joints, bidis are
skinny cigarettes made with pure tobacco that is sun-dried and
wrapped in a tendu leaf, a plant grown in India's forests. The leaf
is more dense than paper and smokers must inhale deeper and more
frequently to keep a bidi cigarette lit.
</P>
<P>
   Bidi smoke has a pleasant, scented fragrance, much different
from the odor of regular cigarette smoke. And some say the taste is
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tastes like incense,'' said Trina Kuan, 21, who puffed on a
strawberry bidi in front of Southcenter Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Bidis have been imported to the United States for the past 40
years. Known as the ``poor man's cigarette,'' they account for
nearly 40 percent of tobacco consumption in India.
</P>
<P>
   Bidis are hand-rolled by women and children and, according to a
1996 report by Human Rights Watch of New York, Indian bidi
manufacturers employ nearly 325,000 children as underpaid ``bondage
slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   The cigarettes come in bright-colored, cone-shaped packages of
20 that sell for about $2.50 in this country, about a dollar less
than a regular pack of smokes.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience stores, specialty shops, smoke shops, herbal stores
and Web sites sell bidis. Some grocery stores and gas stations
carry them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Eric LeLand, owner of the Beverage Mart in Renton, said he
started carrying strawberry bidis, the most popular flavor, about
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough people started asking for them,'' he said. ``I carried
them off and on. They're mostly sold to 18- to 21-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger patrons try to buy bidis, LeLand said, but he won't
allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Lin said bidi sales in his University District tobacco shop have
declined lately because they have become available in many places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, it was crazy,'' he said. ``(But) not too many are sold
here right now, probably because there is more competition. They
are easier to get. Three years ago they were only sold in smoke
shops. Now even gas stations sell them.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Bruett, a 17-year-old Redmond High School student and a
member of the Teen Coalition Against Tobacco for the King County
Public Health Department, said she's afraid kids will become hooked
on cigarettes at an early age after smoking bidis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you hit 16 you are more interested in the adult way to
smoke, like Camel Lights and Marlboros,'' Bruett said. ``(Bidis)
will appeal to younger teens who are still in the candy phase. They
will naturally move up to other products and get hooked for life
until they die.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael, a 17-year-old from Seattle who asked that his last name
not be used, said all his friends smoke bidis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cigarettes are disgusting and bidis are not as bad because of
the strawberry smell and taste,'' Michael said. ``It looks like
weed but it's not, so more younger kids smoke them than older
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven out of 10 bidi packages do not have a surgeon general's
warning on them, according to a study by the Booker T. Washington
Community Service Center in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ostheimer, a staff attorney for the Federal Trade
Commission in Washington, D.C., said bidi packages are required to
have health warnings on them, but some packages are illegally
imported and distributed without them.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC is reviewing distribution plans with four of the largest
bidi importers _ including Colorado's Quintin USA and California's
Smoker's Choice _ to make sure distribution is done legally. Some
smaller companies and individual travelers who import bidis are not
aware of or do not comply with regulations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three major importers _ Quintin USA, Kretek International and
Smoker's Choice _ did not reply to interview requests from the P-I.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Hewett, a tobacco prevention coordinator for the King
County Public Health Department, said he doesn't think Washington
state has experienced the bidi craze like other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not seeing any impact where retailers are selling them
in Washington like in New York, Connecticut and Arizona,'' Hewett
said. ``Every year we do a teen smoker survey and it hasn't been an
important issue at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Most youths claim to smoke Camels, Newports, Cools and Marlboros
_ the heaviest advertised brands, said health educator
Leon-Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, next year's annual teen smoker survey by the King
County Tobacco Prevention Program will include specific questions
about bidis for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to monitor trends among young people using
bidis,'' Asma of the CDC said. ``The public should be made aware as
to the harmful effects of this product. This is not a safe
alternative to other tobacco products.''

<P>
   In New York, and later Los Angeles, the tall, slender blonde
found what she had been seeking. She won modeling contracts and TV
jobs, including an eye-catching stint in a national commercial for
Brut cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, she married William Shatner, a Hollywood star
known worldwide as the dashing Captain James T. Kirk from the
``Star Trek'' TV series.
</P>
<P>
   For the bride, the marriage had fairy-tale elements: fame,
wealth, a mansion with a pool, and a handsome leading man for a
husband who, before their wedding guests, pledged his life to
``Nerine, my queen.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a dark side, too: tabloid reports that she drank
too much, made repeat visits to substance-abuse treatment programs,
and was recently threatened with divorce by her powerful husband.
</P>
<P>
   Nerine Kidd Shatner's life among the rich and the beautiful
ended abruptly Tuesday, when she was found dead in the swimming
pool behind her mansion in Studio City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a preliminary investigation indicates that Kidd
Shatner, 40, drowned, apparently by accident. Toxicology reports
and a full autopsy may not be relased for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But her relatives and friends in Boston are puzzled by the
circumstances of her death.
</P>
<P>
   They said the vivacious woman they knew was an experienced,
lifelong swimmer, someone too well-adjusted to lose control despite
her fast-paced Hollywood lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems kind of odd,'' said one relative, who asked not
to be named. ``I mean, Nerine grew up in a lake. She water-skied,
and she was an excellent swimmer. It's just very odd that she would
die in a pool . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Though she blazed a path from Boston to Los Angeles, the details
of Kidd Shatner's life in Los Angeles are not clear. Those who knew
her well in California have declined to speak publicly about her
since her death.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, her marriage hit a rough patch, and Shatner filed for
divorce last October, but friends said the couple had reconciled,
according to reports. Indeed, Shatner, apparently shattered by her
death, gave a tearful statement before reporters and TV cameras
after the body was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has their ups and downs,'' said the relative. ``I
thought she was happy, but I don't know about her Hollywood life.''
</P>
<P>
   The second oldest of five children, Nerine Kidd grew up in
Boston's Roslindale neighborhood. Each summer, from the time she
began to walk until she graduated from high school, she and her
siblings would climb into the family's dark green Chevy Impala and
head to their vacation cottage near a lake in Sandown, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd spent her summers in and around the water, boating,
water-skiing, and taking long lakeside walks. Her brother Warren,
two years younger, said he often tried to tag along with his
sister, who ``always had pretty girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Family was her source,'' he said, fighting back emotion during
an interview last week. ``Nerine always took care of us. She was
the one who held us together. That was Nerine's way. She made all
of us feel special.''
</P>
<P>
   She had gifts of character in addition to the gift of good
looks. From an early age she displayed a bold, almost fearless
personality. When she was still in high school, she saw a Filene's
television commercial, but was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called them up and said, `I've seen the girls you use as
models. I think I'm better, if you want to give me a try,' '' said
her father, also named Warren Kidd, a retired lumber worker who now
lives in Boston suburb Quincy. ``Apparently, they liked her.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Chute, a Boston modeling agent, was also impressed when
the slender teenager with ``this cute little nose'' walked into her
office with a handful of snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   She was unusual looking, raw, and unrefined, Chute said. In a
Boston accent as thick as chowder, Kidd asked if Chute would look
at her ``pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   With a laugh, Chute said, she gently corrected the girl: models
call them ``photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd quickly learned the ropes, mastering the terminology and
losing her Boston accent. Soon, she was doing photo shoots and
walking the runways in fashion shows. She based her career in New
York, but traveled to Europe for months at a time, and took jobs in
Boston, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd had an attractive personality, Chute said, adding that she
was a wisecracker who made people laugh and could laugh about
herself. She was a respected model, too, and scored at least one
commercial that caught people's attention: the Brut cologne ad
known as ``Scent of a Man.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spot, Kidd is in a man's bedroom, examining his
belongings. She pulls a dress shirt from the closet and puts it on,
smelling the cologne on the fabric. She answers the telephone,
cooing seductively, ``Oh, honey _ I was just thinking about you.''
</P>
<P>
   Her modeling success brought financial rewards, and Kidd was
generous toward her family, her brother said. She sent gifts,
money, and clothes to her siblings and her parents, who divorced 11
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She ``was full of energy,'' the younger Warren Kidd recalled
with a laugh. ``She was like a windup doll that never wound down.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been that energy that attracted Shatner when they
met in Los Angeles at a party in 1995. Shatner would later say that
``Nerine pummeled her way into my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's brother said the courtship grew gradually after his
sister returned to New York. Long-distance phone calls led to
dates, and Kidd eventually moved to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the modest recognition Kidd had achieved, Shatner
_ twice divorced and 28 years her senior _ has legions of fans.
``Star Trek,'' the late-1960s TV series that made him a star, is
broadcast in more than 100 countries in 50 languages.
</P>
<P>
   And Shatner's romantic life has long been tabloid fodder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a former personal assistant sued him, claiming he fired
her after he ended their two-year affair. A month later, an actress
demanded $9 million, alleging Shatner had been her secret lover for
six years. When Shatner and his second wife split in 1994, he was
ordered to pay her $23 million.
</P>
<P>
   The stories did not seem to bother Kidd, who shuttled between
New York and Los Angeles, both for work and to visit her beau, her
brother said. Still, when she arrived in Los Angeles, she kept her
own apartment until she and Shatner were married.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd once asked her father what he thought about her marrying
the famous, wealthy man her family had come to know as Bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Jeez, I don't know. It's your life,' '' the elder
Warren Kidd recalled. ``If you love him, then go ahead. Do you love
him?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   They were wed in November 1997 in Pasadena, a black-tie ceremony
attended by some of Nerine's relatives. The best man was Leonard
Nimoy, Shatner's co-star who played Mr. Spock in the ``Star Trek''
series.
</P>
<P>
   As a wedding gift, Shatner, who owns a California horse ranch
and stud farm, gave his new bride a $50,000 horse, her brother
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the wedding, the couple traveled the world, both for
business and pleasure. Though she kept her career and dabbled in
acting, the younger Warren Kidd said, Shatner was his sister's
first priority.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she would visit Boston with husband in tow. In 1998,
when her brother invited the couple for a home-cooked meal, Shatner
asked Warren if he could bring an old friend: Nimoy. Over dinner,
the two actors regaled the family with behind-the-scenes stories
from the ``Star Trek'' set.
</P>
<P>
   Nerine Kidd Shatner seemed comfortable bridging her low-key
Boston upbringing with her flashy Los Angeles life, as effortlessly
as she consumed both organic food and junk food, her brother said.
And she always seemed excited to see her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go to the airport to pick her up and she would run to
me, screaming, `Oh, Warren, I love you. I miss you,' '' Kidd said.
``She ran to me like I was someone special.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she returned to Los Angeles, all was not well in the
Shatner home, and the tabloids reported it with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd Shatner struggled with alcohol and drug abuse, the papers
wrote, and the wedding date had been postponed after her arrest for
driving while drunk. She spent the days before her first
anniversary in the Betty Ford rehabilitation clinic, again
undergoing treatment for substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Chute, who helped launch Kidd Shatner's modeling career, said
she was surprised to hear those reports. One of her relatives, who
asked not to be named, also expressed disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody drinks. She was not like a drunk or a lush,'' the
relative said. ``Sometimes she might have gone overboard, but maybe
that's the kind of life she got used to.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of her death was reported this week with a cinematic
flourish. Her famous husband, surrounded by reporters, stood
outside their majestic home and choked out a brief, emotional
eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My beautiful wife is dead,'' Shatner said, tears welling in
his eyes. ``She meant everything to me. Her laughter, her tears,
her joy will remain with me for the rest of my life.''

COMPUTER NOVICES FLOCK TO INTERNET REBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBY McGILL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Internet service providers are offering $400
rebates on new personal computers to harvest the untapped market of
consumers who have yet to go on the Internet, but have considered
doing so. The strategy seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by PC Data, an independent research group
based in Reston, Va., the rebate programs are largely responsible
for a 35.4 percent unit increase in personal computer sales in June
1999 compared with the same month a year earlier. More recent
figures were not available.
</P>
<P>
   The rebates, currently being offered by CompuServe, Prodigy, and
Microsoft, require a three-year Internet subscription at the
standard rate _ which is either $19.95 per month for both Prodigy
and Microsoft, or $21.95 per month for CompuServe, which is owned
by America Online.
</P>
<P>
   That brings the overall cost for 36 months of Internet use to
$718.20 or $790.20, respectively. If a consumer cancels the service
prior to the 36-month commitment, they must pay a $50 cancellation
fee as well as the remainder of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The rebate process is fairly simple: Consumers pick a computer
from an assortment of low-to high-end models manufactured by
companies such as Compaq, IBM or AST.
</P>
<P>
   They then submit to a credit check, and if approved, receive a
rebate at the time of purchase, or a few months later in the mail.
Depending upon the computer model, the cost of the new machine
after the rebate runs from $299 on up.
</P>
<P>
   The report found a majority of those computers purchased with
rebate incentives were low-end machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In excess of 75 percent (of sales) have been on PCs under
$600,'' said Stephen Baker, director of hardware analysis for PC
Data. That figure represents the price of the machine after the
rebate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the preponderance of low-end machines points to
novices moving into computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attractive offer to people who haven't participated in
the computer revolution at this point and who aren't yet on the
Internet,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Audrey Weil, senior vice president and general
manager for CompuServe, the rebate programs are banking that novice
Web surfers will bring their wallets with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to encourage the next big wave of consumers to
come into computing and on to the Internet for the first time,''
Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   The main source of revenue for the Internet service providers,
or ISPs, is advertising, specifically, what are known as
click-throughs. When a user clicks on a merchant's banner, or link,
on an ISP's Web page, they are automatically taken to the
advertiser's site. If they make a purchase, the ISP gets a
percentage of the sale. While not disclosing the exact percentage,
Weil said that click-through customers are a big part of ISP
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``These customers are great for us. They are clicking through
and buying products from our merchants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Levine, spokesman for White Plains, N.Y.-based ISP Prodigy,
acknowledged the hope that new customers being drawn in by
Prodigy's rebate offers will spend money on his company's
advertisers, but was quick to note that revenues from monthly
access fees will suffice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even without that (click-through revenue) we'll do OK. It is
not going to be a problem from a revenue standpoint,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   Levine added that Prodigy will not bombard its users with
advertisements, or e-mails in an effort to recoup their $400
investment. CompuServe's Weil promised the same.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Anderson, a consumer protection attorney with the San
Francisco-based law firm Kemnitzer, Anderson, Barron, and Oglive,
advised consumers to shop around before buying an ISP rebated
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's $400 off the actual computer, but what is the initial
price of that computer? What is the initial price before they take
the $400 off? Consumers should be looking at that,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Kasylen, a spokeswoman for IBM, which offers computer
rebates with the CompuServe, said there was no change in the price
of the computers, and that the rebate is funded by CompuServe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire rebate comes from CompuServe, they cut the check,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson additionally warned consumers to be certain that they
are willing to be locked in to today's technology for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years is two lifetimes in the computer business,''
Anderson said. ``Are you locking yourself into obsolete
technology?''

YO-YOS ARE SEEING MANY HAPPY RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D.PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Behold the yo-yo _ the humble five-and-dime standby,
the toy of the working class, the comeback kid of the toy industry.
</P>
<P>
   If you doubt this, you probably weren't at the all-day punk-rock
Warped Tour at Seattle's Kingdome last month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a yo-yo contest, there were free yo-yos up for
grabs. Thousands of local teens, who looked as though they had won
the lottery when they spotted the boxes of freebies, walked off
saying things like, ``Whoa! Yo-yos! Right on!''
</P>
<P>
   The toy even made it onto the stage, where the Hippos had
someone doing tricks during their set.
</P>
<P>
   Yo-yos made a comeback with the young'uns about a year ago. So
much so that some Seattle schools banned yo-yos because kids
couldn't help but play with them during class.
</P>
<P>
   But it's summer, so there's no harm in a little yo-yo fun.
</P>
<P>
   While sitting at the Nordstrom cafe in downtown Seattle,
Jennifer Gardiner, 10, rips open the F.A.O. Schwarz bag holding her
new toy: a yo-yo.
</P>
<P>
   ``She even borrowed a book from the library on how to do all
kinds of tricks, but she couldn't do them with her old yo-yo,''
says mom Pamela Gardiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do them,'' says Jennifer, not looking up from her new
gizmo. ``But I needed one of these springy ones ... they work
better.''
</P>
<P>
   You can even find yo-yo goods online at sites like www.etoys.com
</P>
<P>
   Check out the yo-yo merchandise _ everything from Mattel's line
of ``Totally Yo-Yo'' dolls (Totally Yo-Yo Nikki, Totally Yo-Yo
Skipper, etc.) to Pokemon yo-yos. There also are sites for big-time
yo-yo manufacturers like Duncan (www.yo-yo.com) and Yomega
(www.yomega.com).
</P>
<P>
   The toy has moved into the hipster market and is showing up in
fashion ads and glossy magazines (Ben Stiller poses with one inside
the cover of the current issue of George magazine). There's even a
slick Web zine, ``Fiend'' (www.fiendmagazine.com). Its manifesto
says the magazine is dedicated to achieving ``the real State of
Yo.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Chan, 18, doesn't know what the ``State of Yo'' is, but he
sure likes playing with his yo-yo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to do tricks or anything, but I kind of like
having it in my pocket,'' says Chan, looking every bit the cool kid
outside Westlake Center.
</P>
<P>
   He's wearing jeans _ rolled and cuffed _ with a tight T-shirt
and fashionably messy hair. There's some techno-rap hybrid blasting
from the headphones resting on his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like, I can just pull it out if I'm bored at the bus stop and
just play,'' he says, spinning a worn red yo-yo with a dirty
string.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps my hands busy and it beats smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   John Stangle, president of the American Yo-Yo Association
(www.ayya.pd.net) isn't surprised that the yo-yo is back in the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yo-yo will make a comeback with everyone. It's the world's
most famous toy,'' says Stangle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works for everyone. It's skill-oriented, it's fast ... it's
challenging. It's macho for the guys, and the girls can smoke the
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Macho?!?
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kind of competition sport where you get awards and
trophies and titles seems to really attract guys,'' says Stangle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls are closet yo-yo players. They're not quite as
interested in the trophies and the recognition as they are in just
having fun, so we don't see as many girls participating out in the
big contests,'' he explains, just in case you had noticed a gender
gap at yo-yo competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Telling Stangle that teens generally prefer high-tech toys like
home video game systems and virtual what-nots instead of the
low-tech yo-yo is a quick way of getting schooled in yo-yo
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would disagree with that comment,'' he says firmly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo-yos are not low tech. In fact, there's modern yo-yos right
now called `transaxles' that have metal ball bearings, speed rings,
adjustable gaps, different types of weighted parts that can be put
in to modify it for different tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The yo-yo has come a long way from a string and a piece of
wood. The new-model transaxles sell for as much as $150. ...
They're very high-tech and that's what the kids are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the century, the yo-yo has quietly spun and woven
itself into cultural trends. Witness the names and descriptions of
Duncan yo-yos and the years they were introduced to the market:
</P>
<P>
   The O-Boy, made of maple, 1929; the Pony Boy, plastic (with a
rattling BB inside), 1954; the Velvet, with a fuzzy, nylon finish,
1972; the Midnight Special, black with silver stars, 1989; and this
year, the ultramodern-looking ORB (part of the new hard-core series
that includes the Avenger and the Ballistic).
</P>
<P>
   The history of the toy itself is as quirky as the subculture
that embraces it.
</P>
<P>
   The word yo-yo came from the Tagalog (language of the
Philippines) word for ``come back.'' It's theorized that the toy
made its way from China to the Philippines, where the locals named
it yo-yo.
</P>
<P>
   Filipino entrepreneur Pedro Flores brought the yo-yo craze with
him to the United States, where he ultimately sold his business to
Duncan, a toy manufacturer. before that, the yo-yo was generally
referred to as a ``badnalore'' or a ``quiz'' by the Brits and a
``jou-jou'' by the French.
</P>
<P>
   The toy was marketed as a yo-yo by Duncan. In fact, the word was
a registered trademark of the company from 1929-65.
</P>
<P>
   Yo-yo history
</P>
<P>
   The yo-yo has long had a rich history. It's theorized that the
first yo-yo was invented in China, but the oldest evidence of the
yo-yo (paintings on vases) places it in Greece at around 500 B.C.
The toy made its way to India, where European travelers picked up
on it and took it back home.
</P>
<P>
   At first considered a toy for the aristocracy, yo-yos were made
of glass, ivory and other pricey materials.
</P>
<P>
   The French seemed to have appreciated the value of the yo-yo as
a relaxation tool; prisoners were allowed to play with them on the
way to the guillotine and Napoleon is said to have played with his
to relax before the battle of Waterloo.

NO GREEN THUMB NEEDED FOR DROUGHT-RESISTANT PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine if you went on vacation for a month _ in the middle of
the driest summer on record _ returned to your parched, beaten-down
lawn, turned on the hose, and watched the brown expanse turn green
before your eyes. It could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose scientists could engineer drought-resistant crops so
that farmers in arid regions of the world could grow corn in the
midst of desert conditions. Not only could it happen, scientists
want to make sure that it does.
</P>
<P>
   The eastern United States, not normally thought of as one of the
world's most arid regions, is suffering from the worst drought in
decades. This makes research into drought-resistant plants of even
greater interest to US scientists than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are focusing their efforts on common mosses, which
can dry up and live years without a drop of water, then transform
themselves into a lush green carpet after a light rain.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Oliver, a plant physiologist for the USDA's Agricultural
Research Service in Lubbock, Texas, is trying to locate specific
genes in the star moss _ a common moss in southwestern
Massachusetts and other parts of North America _ that enable it to
recover quickly from drought-like conditions. Oliver and his
colleagues hope to soon engineer common crops with these genes so
that they will be able to withstand weeks to months without rain.
</P>
<P>
   They have already isolated some of the star moss' ``recovery''
genes and have put them in tobacco and cotton plants to see how
they react.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a couple genes we are very excited about. Within the
next six months to a year. . . we are going to make some major
advances,'' Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have known these tiny mosses have genes that are
very important for human use?'' said Brent Mishler, a professor of
integrative biology at the University of California at Berkeley.
``Even the most insignificant plant that may seem to be useless
still has a use.''
</P>
<P>
   Although desert plants such as the cactus, with its waxy skin
that holds in moisture, can tolerate long periods without water, it
cannot survive once its water storage is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The star moss, which shrivels up to a brown rod-like shape when
dry, can lose up to 99 percent of its body water in drought
conditions, yet, amazingly, it doesn't die. Brittle and nearly
dead, the moss, Tortula ruralis, can remain desiccated, or dry, for
years. But once it tastes water, it springs back to a green star
formation, without any damage. The record for survival of a
desiccation-tolerant organism, is the Riccia macrocarpa, a
liverwort, that has survived 23 years without water, said Peter
Alpert, a plant ecologist and an associate professor of biology at
University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, scientists believe, all plants came from the
water. When algae and other plant-like organisms made their way
onto land, they had the trait of drought resistance. Mishler
pointed out that mosses, one of the first plants to climb onto
land, were exceedingly resistant to drying, and still are.
</P>
<P>
   Early plants had to be drought tolerant because they were unable
to change their water content; they would die if they didn't have
the trait, said Mishler of UC Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   As the simple mosses and algae evolved into bigger, more leafy
flowers and trees with complex root and internal plumbing systems,
virtually all land plants lost the ability to tolerate drought
because they learned how to create a higher water content inside.
``If you cut a leaf, it's juicy inside,'' Mishler said.
</P>
<P>
   Plants' loss of desiccation tolerance was a trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver noted that one cost of being desiccation-tolerant was
that they didn't grow very big. Scientists are not sure exactly how
desiccation-tolerant plants avoid death, but they all contain large
amounts of a simple sugar in their cells and produce special
proteins in response to drought.
</P>
<P>
   The mosses have to spend a lot of energy to make the sugars and
proteins, which is probably why they are never very big, said
Oliver. Once plants evolved to retain water with their tubing
systems, most shedded the trait of being drought resistant. But
most mosses and a lot of algae have kept the trait, which has also
re-evolved in a few grasses and flowering plants, though only in
very few species.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good evidence that it's been lost and regained several
times in the plant kingdom,'' said Andrew Wood, assistant professor
of plant biology at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   As land plants spread across continents, Oliver said, they
started to hit adverse environments, and in certain cases, regained
the ability to be drought tolerant. Most of the flowering plants
have been found in southern Africa and Australia, but a
desiccation-tolerant grass does exist in western Texas, Oliver
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The southern African plants don't even want their
photosynthesis apparatus around, so they dismantle it and go
brown,'' he said. They can last more than two years without rain.
Some of the plants include the African resurrection plant
Craterostigma plantagineum, the African grass Sporobolus
stapfianus, and the fern Polypodium virginianum.
</P>
<P>
   Mishler believes the genes involved in desiccation tolerance in
mosses were reused for something else in the land plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution is not an engineer; it doesn't build things from
scratch. It tinkers with a garage full of parts, reusing
something,'' Mishler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rare in evolution to see genes totally lost,'' said
Oliver. ``So we feel the genes are still retained in the plants,
but they are just doing different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood, of Southern Illinois University, who is working on
improving stability and yield of crops, particularly soybeans, said
he wants to engineer crops that are more tolerant of droughts, but
not make them completely drought-proof, because then, like desert
plants, they would be scrubby and small.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers don't need a corn plant that can live in a desert,''
Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Mishler believes that it may one day be possible to turn back
the clock on the dormant drought-tolerant genes in plants such as
corn. But Oliver is not so sure. ``We still have to prove that the
genes are around'' in common crops and plants, he said.

MORE JOIN DEBATE OVER PLACEBO USE IN STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When migraine sufferers enroll in a study of a potential new
medication, is it ethical to give some of them a placebo, or dummy
sugar pill, rather than a drug that is already known to be
effective? How about patients with high blood pressure? Or
depression? Or schizophrenia?
</P>
<P>
   In all those situations, the US research ``gold standard'' calls
for new drugs under study to be compared with a placebo, an
inactive sugar pill.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing and vocal minority of critics _ ethicists,
scientists, and patient advocates _ say the US method is outmoded
and unethical, violating the spirit of international codes designed
to protect human research subjects after the horrors of the Nazi
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   With so many medications available, therapies should be judged
against each other, not against inactive pills, the critics say.
They point to European and Canadian regulatory agencies that call
for an alternative to the placebo-controlled trial _ a so-called
active-controlled trial _ in which patients who don't get the
potential new drug instead receive a medication already shown to be
effective.
</P>
<P>
   What doctors and patients really want to know, critics say, is
how the potential new drugs compare with existing medications, not
a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The placebo is just an easy out. It's an intellectually lazy
approach to the evaluation of drug efficacy,'' said Kenneth J.
Rothman, professor of epidemiology at Boston University School of
Public Health, who co-authored a 1994 study in the New England
Journal of Medicine that helped spur the debate. ``We cannot
deprive patients of effective treatment and live up to our ethical
guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreed Harvard epidemiologist Karin B. Michels, Rothman's
co-author: ``It is just not necessary to put patients into the
position of having to suffer for science.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``placebo effect'' _ derived from the Latin word placere,
meaning to please _ describes the well-known but inexplicable
phenomenon in which a patient often feels better after getting an
inert sugar pill or undergoing a sham procedure. Amazingly, in some
cases, up to 30 percent of patients who get a placebo experience a
reduction in symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But because of this, most researchers say that the
placebo-controlled trial is the most rigorous way to test new drugs
because it establishes whether a medication works at all.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if 25 percent of research volunteers who get a
placebo feel better, while 60 percent of those taking the active
pill get relief, only then could researchers conclude that the
active pill really works.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are no placebo controls, we would put ineffective
drugs in the marketplace. Nobody wants that,'' said Dr. Robert
Temple of the US Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the ethics of placebo-controlled trials has
taken on international proportions, with the World Medical
Association, the International Conference on Harmonization, and the
Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences now
considering new policy statements or revisions to existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   The latest volley appeared in last Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine, with opposing views aired over proposed
revisions to the World Medical Association's Declaration of
Helsinki, an international set of guidelines on medical ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the declaration recommends the use of placebo in a
study only if there are no proven therapies for the condition and
states that physicians should ``obtain the subjects' freely-given
informed consent, preferably in writing.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed revisions would call for a placebo whenever
``justified by a scientifically and ethically sound research
protocol'' _ even if there are already proven therapies for the
condition under study _ and would allow a waiver of written
informed consent if a research ethics committee found the risks
slight, or if the procedures used are routinely used in medical
care without consent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Troyen A. Brennan of Harvard Medical School opposed the
revisions, saying they ``weaken the principle of the researcher's
moral commitment to the research subject.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Robert J. Levine of Yale University School of Medicine
favored the changes because the document, as currently written, is
``seriously out of touch,'' considering that the placebo-controlled
trial is standard scientific practice.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate rages on, there is broad agreement that
placebo-controlled trials are unethical in the case of bacterial
infections, which can be treated with antibiotics, or cancer, which
can be slowed or stopped with chemotherapy and other methods.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere were the sides of the debate more clearly drawn than at
a scientific symposium held a few months ago by the US Food and
Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   On one side were Drs. Sidney Wolfe and Peter Lurie of Public
Citizen's Health Research Group, who believe that a placebo should
not be used in clinical trials when there are medications already
proven to be effective, and that the Declaration of Helsinki should
not be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, we need to protect patients,'' Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side was Temple of the FDA, saying that the use of
placebo was ethically justifiable in the study of drugs for
everything from panic disorder to a form of chest pain known as
angina. Temple acknowledged that ``there's a debate'' over the
current use of placebo in patients with schizophrenia. Medications
that work for all these conditions are on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FDA has not changed its stance on
placebo-controlled trials in a major way, it has moderated it in
some cases, according to Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in February, the FDA issued guidelines to
researchers stating that patients with ``mildly active'' rheumatoid
arthritis, who are doing poorly on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) and other therapies, ``are usually not appropriate
candidates for placebo-controlled trials.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is also reviewing previous studies, involving a total of
about 100,000 patients with high blood pressure, to assess whether
people on a placebo suffered higher rates of adverse events than
normally expected, said the FDA's Temple during the symposium.
</P>
<P>
   But Public Citizen's Lurie said he has already found in a
separate analysis of high blood pressure studies that patients
given a placebo had an additional 1 out of 1,000 risk of stroke.
While that may seem small, Lurie said during the FDA symposium, an
extra 1 out of 1,000 risk of cancer as a result of long-term
exposure to workplace chemicals would prompt action by occupational
health and safety officials.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of placebo-controlled trials point out that such
research is scientifically necessary and can be ethically designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is that before we can test one drug against
another, we have to be sure that each one works,'' said Dr. Steven
C. Schachter, medical director of the office of clinical trials for
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to do that is through a placebo-controlled study.
The challenge is to design (one) that is ethically sound and does
not put patients at unreasonable risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a trial of a potential new epilepsy drug, published by
Schachter and colleagues in a recent issue of the journal
Neurology, he said they only enrolled patients who needed to go off
of existing medications as part of a pre-surgical work-up. Hospital
staff continuously monitored the patients' safety, and patients
gave informed consent, said Schachter, who is chairman of the
advisory board for the Epilepsy Foundation of America.
</P>
<P>
   But those circumstances don't convince critics that the placebo
trial should continue to be used. An editorial that criticized
Schachter's study design in the same issue of Neurology was
pointedly titled: ``Placebo-controlled studies in neurology: Where
do they stop?''
</P>
<P>
   While the editorial welcomed the safety measures taken by
Schachter and colleagues, it questioned the researchers' argument
that the study was ethical because it only enrolled patients who
went off medications for a pre-surgical work-up.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to the editorial by Dr. David Chadwick of the
University of Liverpool and Dr. Michael Privitera of the University
of Cincinnati, some patients have been known to die after being
taken off medications for such a work-up.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Privitera, a professor of neurology, said,
``Scientifically, these studies are very good and tell you exactly
what you want to know.'' But he added, ``No one is asking, `Is this
the right thing for the patient in the trial'?''

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Yo. Hil, Bill. Has John Macaffer got a white
house for you.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't ring a bell? The Albany real estate agent who wrote to
you a week or so ago after hearing you were in the market for a New
York address to go with a Senate race? Surely you got the letter,
addressed to you, personally, at the White House?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard back yet,'' Macaffer concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Word has it you're thinking of Westchester? Oh, come on, how
middle-of-the-fence can you get? Not upstate, not New York City.
C'mon, First Couple: Commit.
</P>
<P>
   Word has it you've been scoping out a $1.7 million, 12-room
Colonial on a measly 2.5 acres just off a busy road in Edgemont.
Not quite Scarsdale. And the tax bill: 25 grand a year.
</P>
<P>
   You could do better for less up here.
</P>
<P>
   For $1,375,000 _ that's a $325,000 savings, something any
budget-conscious Senator could boast about _ Macaffer's got a
14-room colonial on a presidentially-sized 13-acre estate, with
plenty of room for the ex-president to amble with his hands clasped
behind him pondering deep thoughts. It was donated by its last
owner, Dr. Ray Elliot, to Drew University, so buying it would not
only be a personal investment but an important boost for education
and, indeed, the future of our nation.
</P>
<P>
   The 1751 New Scotland Road estate has five bedrooms, a formal
dining room, three-car garage, a clay tennis court with a changing
building, and a 1.8 acre spring-fed pond with a dock and picnic
area. A breakfast nook, a screened-in porch and a small library all
open onto a slate patio and garden. There's no rose garden, but
there is a picket fence, ideal for putting Buddy out.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered around the manicured lawns (Bill will probably want to
get a riding lawnmower with the mulcher) are post-and-rail paddocks
and two barns, one with horse stalls and cow stanchions and a tack
room (when you get here we can explain all those terms), the other
converted into a three-bedroom unit, ideal for several Secret
Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, you'll want to bring them along; while there
is an alarm system, a reporter and photographer who inadvertently
tripped it while checking out the house waited more than 10 minutes
for police to arrive, and finally gave up.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, back to the house: There are even more bathrooms than
bedrooms _ four full, two half _ so your luminary guests won't have
to dance around the door at all those parties you'll be throwing.
Luminaries? In upstate New York?
</P>
<P>
   You bet. Why, there's Pulitzer Prize winning author William
Kennedy and ... and ... well, a lot of other people who come up in
August for the races in Saratoga Springs.
</P>
<P>
   No, seriously, there are actors (David Hyde Pierce and
Christoper Reeve) and other film folks (director James Ivory and
producer Ismail Merchant of the Merchant/Ivory team); humorists
(Andy Rooney and cartoonist John McPherson of Close to Home fame;
also two guys named Mason and Sheehan who can't find work); more
writers like Richard Seltzer and Joe Persico; famed ex-cop Frank
Serpico, and plain old rich people like Mary Lou Whitney, to name a
few. Or maybe most. Oh, yeah, at last report, there were also the
handful of bank presidents whose home offices are not yet in
another state.
</P>
<P>
   Also, we've heard you like whitewater; well, the headwaters of
the Hudson are up this way and there is great rafting when there
isn't a drought. Plenty of golf courses for Bill, from the ritzy
Schuyler Meadows to the everyman's Albany Muni. If Chelsea is
considering a career as a special prosecutor, Albany Law School is
just a few minutes away in downtown Albany, where the big story
this year is new sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about the governor being Republican; lately, nobody
seems to care much about political affiliations. Republican George
Pataki is buds with Democratic Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings, and
Jennings throws fundraisers for Republican Congressman John
Sweeney, who, incidentally, beat Jean Bordewich, a Democrat from
Dutchess County, which is almost in Westchester County, so do you
really want to move there?
</P>
<P>
   There's also a neat little story that comes with the
Slingerlands house: Turns out John Macaffer's great-grandfather
built it in 1922, and the family had it until they sold it around
1960 for a whopping $50,000. Macaffer now lives next door in what
used to be his grandmother's home.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the people down in Edgemont, who aren't sure they want
all the traffic a former first family would bring, Macaffer said he
wouldn't mind having some neighbors again. And as far as traffic
goes, Macaffer sees an upside: ``My kids would have a great
lemonade stand at the end of the driveway.''

JAMES MILLER CHARTS THE GLORY DAYS OF ROCK 'N' ROLL

FLOWERS IN THE DUSTBIN 
The Rise of Rock and Roll, 1947-1977 
By James Miller. Simon &AMP; Schuster. 415 pp. Illustrated. $26. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any chronicler of rock 'n' roll as cultural history faces a
daunting challenge. On the one hand, the author must maintain
academic credibility by way of rigorous analyses and critical
distance. At the same time, the writer must convey the visceral
experience of the music itself, somehow putting into words the
decidedly unacademic thrill of bearing witness to a radical and
sometimes profound explosion of sound. One can hardly imagine two
more distinct tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The title of James Miller's new history of rock is the first
clue that this author has his finger on the pulse. ``When there's
no future / how can there be sin / we're the flowers in the dustbin
/ we're the poison in your machine / we're the future / your
future,'' sang Johnny Rotten in ``God Save the Queen,'' the Sex
Pistols song that heralded the arrival of the punk era in 1977.
That was also the year that Elvis died. Although the birth of punk
and the death of the King are related only by chronology, the
serendipitous meaning isn't lost on Miller. It's the year Miller _
a former Newsweek pop critic turned educator and author (``The
Passion of Michel Foucault,'' ``Democracy Is in the Streets'') _
chose to cap his cogent, lively examination of the rise of rock 'n'
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Miller argues that rock underwent its full creative evolution
between 1947 and 1977. More specifically, he begins on Dec. 28,
1947, when a musical revolution that would transform the
pop-cultural landscape began unremarkably enough as a little-known
black singer named Wynonie Harris entered a modest Cincinnati
recording studio to lay down a track called ``Good Rockin'
Tonight.'' The song became a hit, and popularized the term that
would come to symbolize, in Miller's words, ``an invitation to
fantasy and an image of freedom.'' By the time the Sex Pistols
loosed an exquisitely crafted version of chaos and revolt on the
world 40 years later, the musical styles and the emblematic values
that had inspired its genesis were firmly established. And the
industrial infrastructure necessary to reproduce the sound and the
fury, over and over again, was firmly established as well.
</P>
<P>
   Miller wisely resisted the temptation to compile a comprehensive
history; that's an effort better left to encyclopedists (a group to
which Miller, the original editor of ``The Rolling Stone
Illustrated History of Rock and Roll,'' also belongs). Instead he
has selected key events in the evolution of the genre, which are
captured in a measured, beautifully paced whirl of anecdote, social
history, and blessedly unpretentious interpretation. While Miller
traces rock's development chronologically, the story jumps from
place to place with the sort of syncopated beat that so enthralled
the author as a 9-year-old boy, listening to his older cousin's
radio late at night during the winter of 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Most serious fans are familiar with the genre's epiphanic
moments: Elvis's first demo session at the Sun Records studio;
Dylan plugging in at the Newport Folk Festival; the utopia-crushing
debacle that was Altamont. Miller covers all of that in literate,
exuberant detail. But he also understands that the small moments
can be watersheds as well. In 1950, Leo Fender's first amplified
guitar rolls off the assembly line in Fullerton, Calif.: a fret
board bolted to a flat plank of wood equipped with a pickup that
Frank Zappa would 30 years later describe as ``the single most
blasphemous device on the face of the earth.'' In May 1956, a
70-minute movie titled ``Rock Around the Clock'' is released,
inciting riots around the world; in Liverpool, a 15-year-old
moviegoer named John Lennon is disappointed that there is no
violence at his hometown theater. Dylan turns the Beatles on to
marijuana in a New York hotel room during their first meeting in
1964; the band begins work on ``Rubber Soul,'' a farewell to
innocence if ever there was one, several months later.
</P>
<P>
   Into this engaging tapestry of musical lore Miller expertly
weaves cultural and intellectual strands, from Norman Mailer's
notion of the ``white Negro'' _ a youthful urban hipster who
struggles to live a life of impulsive freedom _ to H. G.
Koenigsberger's theories of music as a psychological substitute for
traditional religion. Miller's thorough excavation of rock's
foundation in black music and culture is as revealing a window on
race relations as it is on pop music's roots. Race, rhythm, youth,
faith, society, politics: All of these disparate elements come
together in a music that crystallizes _ in wildly different ways,
during wildly different times _ a cultural essence.
</P>
<P>
   Miller distills that essence, as much with exhaustive and
ingenious synthesis of source material as with plain old good
storytelling. He quotes Ken Babbs, one of Ken Kesey's friends and a
participant in the early Acid Test parties, as saying, ``We always
thought of the Grateful Dead as being the engine that was driving
the spaceship we were traveling on.'' Rock 'n' roll was such an
inextricable part of the fabric of life, and of change, one wonders
_ in proverbial chicken-and-egg fashion _ which came first: the
subculture or the music? Do styles of rock simply define an era, or
does the music, in some unfathomable but powerful measure, inspire
the ethos?
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, those questions are as inscrutable as the
primal, youthful passion at the center of it all. And in a way, it
doesn't matter. In his dissection of David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust
character as the beginning of rock as mass-produced hype, Miller
admits that ``Ziggy Stardust had real, if transient, effects; not
least on those young British fans who . . . gave themselves heart
and soul to the fake messiah with the flame red hair and ghostly
white face _ an all-too accurate emblem of rock and roll, and what
it had become.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller's tidy summation of rock in the '80s and '90s _ ``a
business that became more nimble at exploiting the rough sounds and
raw styles,'' where ``the same basic formulas were applied to a
variety of different rock bands playing in a variety of genres,
from gansta rap to grunge'' _ is too pat. Yes, rock experienced its
most explosive growth in its first quarter-century. Absolutely, pop
music became a cynical, multibillion-dollar global industry.
Authentic, innovative musicians are, to be sure, outnumbered by
well-groomed poseurs and one-hit wonders. But they were in the '50s
and '60s, too. Miller's dismissal of post-'70s rock as ``ever more
stale, ever more predictable, and ever more boring'' seems to say
less about the end of rock's fertile period and more about the end
of the author's youth. Rock music, and its urgent, blissful,
irrational imperatives, belongs to the young. Miller, now 52 and
living an academic's life in West Roxbury, knows it. But it's still
hard to let go.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 
!! 1/2 ``Bowfinger'' Not as funny as it should have been,
considering that it stars Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy. The former
plays a Hollywood producer wannabe, trying to con his way into
getting a movie made by surreptitiously filming street footage of
an A-list action star, then concocting a film around it. Murphy
plays two roles _ the star who doesn't know he's going to appear in
the no-budget movie and, later, the dweeb pressed into service as
his double after the star is spooked and goes into hiding. (PG-13) 
 
(FR) !! 1/2 ``Brokedown Palace'' Yet another movie about young
Americans imprisoned abroad for drug-related offenses. What makes
this entry better than most in this sad little subgenre is the
uncommonly compelling way that Claire Danes's angry loose cannon
and Kate Beckinsale's prissy straight arrow play off one another as
they're railroaded into the Bangkok women's prison whose nickname
gives this film its title. (PG-13) 
 
! 1/2 ``Detroit Rock City'' A loud, clumsy and, of all things,
quaint rock 'n' roll film about four kids in Cleveland in 1978.
They decide to break away from adult authority by driving to
Detroit in mom's Volvo to take in a KISS concert, hoping to get
lucky sexually as well as scoring tickets. But the movie plays like
an exercise in KISS product placement, if not an actual addition to
KISS's far from scanty product line. (R) 
 
!!! 1/2 ``Late August, Early September'' A handful of French
intellectuals tumble toward the autumn of their lives, trying to
believe that their poverty is indicative of their integrity while
coming to terms with the imminent death of their novelist friend
and father figure. Mathieu Almaric is the most engaging of the lot
as the one struggling most earnestly to grow up in Olivier
Assayas's wise, humane, rueful comedy. (Unrated) 
 
!!!! ``Twin Falls Idaho'' A poetic original, and the best twin
movie since ``Dead Ringers.'' But while that film was murderous,
this one is gentle and hypnotic in its treatment of fragile
conjoined twins, hiding in a seedy yet somehow gloomily sheltering
hotel room until the one night, Halloween, when they can freely
venture forth. Michael and Mark Polish, the real-life identical
(but not conjoined) twins who wrote, directed, and star, astonish
with their level of craft and their ability to create mood. Their
love story ponders questions of identity and isolation and relies
on the intuitive communicative subtleties shared by twins. Michele
Hicks, as a prostitute drawn to them, is a standout, too. (R)

   RUSSIA-PUTIN _ MOSCOW _ The Russian Duma, the lower house of
Parliament, approved the appointment of President Boris Yeltsin's
latest prime minister, Vladimir Putin. The approval was expected,
as the Communist-controlled parliament sought not to make waves
ahead of this winter's elections. Meanwhile, a former Yeltsin prime

   SCI-SKY-MYSTERY (Undated) _ Astronomers have an unyielding
mystery on their hands, something they have observed and pondered
for three years, a point of light deep in the northern sky that
appears to be like nothing seen before. The mystery object has so
far confounded astronomers because they cannot decipher the
language of its light. This may turn out to be only a curiosity, an
odd variation of a familiar phenomenon, or it may be the first
evidence of some unsuspected object with reverberating theoretical
implications. By John Noble Wilford. (1600 words)

   (This story, offered for page one consideration, was also listed

</P>
<P>
   SCI-BREAST-CANCER (Undated) _ When scientists identified two
genes, BRCA-1 and BRCA-2, as the culprits in most hereditary cases
of breast cancer, the discovery prompted much excitement and hope.
Women with a family history of breast cancer would at last be able
to determine if they, too, were likely to get the disease. And so
armed, they could take preventive action. But as with most highly
promising developments in cancer, the decade-long story of the
breast cancer genes, while it has revealed important insights and
greatly increased scientists' knowledge, has turned out to be far
from simple, both from a scientific perspective and a personal one.

<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: The columnist
writes of her decision, after completing treatment for an early
breast cancer, to seek genetic counseling. She opted to have her
blood tested, to find out whether her cancer might have been
inherited, the result of a mutation in one of the two known tumor
suppressor genes, BRCA-1 and BRCA-2. But not every woman with a
history like hers, she writes, has chosen to be tested, often for
good reasons. By Jane E. Brody. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-YELLOW-JACKETS (Undated) _ August is official yellow jacket
month, as a number of entomologists have proclaimed on their
Internet Web pages, and as anybody within range of a public trash
can will attest. It turns out that yellow jackets are not the
mean-spirited vermin their victims assume them to be. They are not
nasty for nastiness sake. They are proactively defensive,
family-values types that struggle selflessly to support and defend
their kin. They may crave the same junk food we do, but they are
not base freeloaders, and sometimes will even pitch in by hunting
caterpillars, aphids, flies and other garden pests. By Natalie
Angier. (2000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CASSINI-SATURN (Washington) _ A giant robot spacecraft
called Cassini is to streak past the Earth Tuesday night on its way
to Saturn, culminating a circuitous, two-year journey through the
inner solar system designed to send it on its way. This journey,
which already has involved two trips around Venus before the Earth
swing, is like a celestial baseball pitcher taking an extremely
long windup before throwing a curve ball 2 billion miles. By Warren
E. Leary. (1200 words)

   SCI-CASSINI-PORCO (Undated) _ A scientist-at-work profile:
Carolyn Porco, a planetary scientist who had worked on the Voyager
missions to Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, was already known for her
ability to convey the excitement of space exploration in a
vocabulary that everyone could understand. Now she is leading the
imaging team for the Cassini mission. By Carolyn Niethammer. (1800
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MARS-WEATHER (Undated) _ The canals that the 19th century
astronomer Percival Lowell believed he saw on Mars were thought to
be evidence of an active civilization. Their existence was long ago
disproved, of course, but Mars has been shown to be an active place
nonetheless. It's just nature, not little green men, that is
raising a ruckus. A recent series of photographs from the Mars
Global Surveyor spacecraft, which finally reached its circular
mapping orbit in April, a year behind schedule, shows a huge storm
system near the north pole at the end of the Martian summer. By
Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-INTUITION (Undated) _ Anyone who has been to the
racetrack knows that picking a horse is part art and part science.
It was intuition, after all, not statistics, that rewarded those
who picked Charismatic to win the Kentucky Derby last May at
32-to-1 odds. Now, a small group of researchers say that such
intuition can, at least in part, be duplicated by computers. Rules
of thumb that are only partially accurate can be combined into
precise prediction tools using an artificial intelligence technique
called boosting. By Jennifer 8. Lee. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-KEEN-NOSED-DOGS (Undated) _ How dogs in the employ of the
U.S. Customs Service can find anything in the confusion of an
airport terminal is explained not just by their keen sense of
smell, developed over thousands of years of hunting for food and
fleeing predators, but also by scientists' increasing understanding
of this olfactory ability, and the sophisticated training
techniques developed to exploit it. By Christopher S. Wren. (1400
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SKIN-PATCHES (Undated) _ The dry, flaky outer layer of skin
that covers human beings from head to toe gets very little respect:
People oil it, clean it occasionally and otherwise ignore it,
except when they decide to buff some of it right down the shower
drain. But to pharmacologists who would like to slip drugs
painlessly into the body, that layer of skin is the biologic
equivalent of Mount Everest, one of the body's most persistent
challenges to scientific ingenuity. Despite 30 years of research
into the subject, fewer than a dozen drugs are available in skin
patches, little discs that adhere to the skin and allow a drug to
seep slowly into the bloodstream over hours or even days. By
Abigail Zuger. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NEAR-DEATH (Undated) _ An essay: In 20 years of practice, I
have cared for several persons who have had near-death experiences,
many of whom have had a clear vision about an afterlife. The
diversity of these experiences astonishes me; the clarity with
which some patients talk about these issues is one of the great
treasures of working with the dying. We have learned that death
might not be as frightening as we thought. And the visions take
some of the sting out of the medical battles we lose. By Timothy
Quill. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FEMALE-DOCTORS (Undated) _ Female doctors are viewed as less
authoritarian and more likely to involve patients in their health
care than male doctors, according to a new study by Johns Hopkins
University researchers. The study also found that black patients
see white doctors as inviting less participation than doctors who
are black. By Anne Eisenberg. (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ This just in, from the
Human-Bites-Are-More-Dangerous-Than-Dog-Bites Department: A
28-year-old man attending last year's Oktoberfest, Munich's
celebration of beer-drinking and frivolity, was dancing on a table
top when a woman he had never met came up behind him and sunk her
teeth into his leg. Calf-biters, it appears, are a local tradition
at the festival. It can be a perilous tradition.
</P>
<P>
   _Scientists have discovered a way to speed the healing of wounds
in mice, and the finding, they say, may eventually benefit humans.
</P>
<P>
   _ More evidence that going to church is healthy living.
</P>
<P>
   _ They are tasty in salads, and make a crunchy addition to a
turkey sandwich. But a new study suggests that the elderly, small
children and those with weak immune systems should steer clear of
raw sprouts, which are often contaminated with disease-causing
bacteria like E. coli, B. cereus and salmonella.
</P>

   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: On early signs
of illness in plants; another new planet; the eclipse revisited. By

 &HT;    CONSUMER Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What was Dudley Do-Right's horse's name?
</P>
<P>
   A: The horse's name is Horse. How very Rocky and Bullwinklian.
</P>
<P>
   For a brochure of Dudley items, contact Dudley Do-Right Emporium
at (323) 656-6550. Pick up a $1 button of Horse or of Dudley and
steed. I just might pick up a copy of ``Dudley Do-Right's Book of
Manners.'' Bet Nell helped on that one!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I dropped a hot iron on my carpet. Some of the synthetic
carpet melted on the surface of the iron. Can it be saved?
</P>
<P>
   A: Heat the iron slightly and with a heavy metal spatula or dull
knife (neither of which is used again) scrape the chunky part of
the residue off the ironing plate. Once the iron cools, try a paste
of baking soda and water or prewash solution with a plastic
scrubber to remove the rest. Or with the iron on low heat, iron
over salt sprinkled on heavy brown paper. One of these should
produce enough scrubbing action to clean the iron without
jeopardizing the plate surface.
</P>
<P>
   No luck? Pitch it and buy a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our problem is probably shared by many people who purchased
savings bonds many years ago and would like to give them away
without also incurring a tax liability. We have heard if ownership
is transferred to a charity, the charity gets the benefit of
today's value when cashed, and the donor gets the benefit of the
charitable tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Savings bonds cannot be re-issued to an organization, only
to an individual,'' says Peter Hollenbach of the Bureau of the
Public Debt. Reissuing the bond in the name of an individual
creates ``a tax event,'' he added. (Read: ``You pay taxes.'')

   Q: I am looking to buy a large number of Hawaiian leis (as cheap
as possible _ nothing fancy) in individual colors for a high school
fund-raiser but have had little luck.
</P>
<P>
   A: Dirt cheap? Try Oriental Trading Company at (800) 228-2269,
where 1 1/2-inch-wide leis in assorted solid colors begin at $2 a
dozen (plus shipping), but there is no guarantee how many will be
each color.

<P>
   Q: Is it possible to receive the directions to make a rose bead
necklace?
</P>
<P>
   A: This craft project is detailed in Ann Fettner's ``Potpourri,
Incense and Other Fragrant Concoctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dry 40 roses and finely chop the petals. Put the petals in a
saucepan with enough water to cover. Simmer gently for one hour. Do
not boil. Add water as needed. Let cool, reheat. After heating the
mixture twice, strain the remaining pulp. Form beads with the pulp.
Stick the blunt end of a needle in a cork. Press each bead down
over the sharp end of the needle to make a hole through the bead.
Dry the beads thoroughly but do not dry them on the needle (dried
beads break when removed). When dry, string.
</P>
<P>
   Body heat releases the fragrance of the petals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently began raising chickens and so have plenty of fresh
eggs. I have a hard time removing the shell from hard-boiled eggs.
Is there a difference in cooking fresh eggs vs. eggs from the
store?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Texas A&AMP;M Extension Service poultry specialist Sarah
Birkhold says if you cook the eggs within a few days of the hens
laying them, the albumin is more firmly attached to the shell.
Refrigerate the eggs five to seven days before boiling.
</P>
<P>
   What is this expert's egg-boiling method? Put the eggs in a pan
and cover with 1 inch of water. Put the lid on and bring the water
to a boil. When the water boils, remove the pan from the heat and
let sit for 13 to 15 minutes. Cool eggs under running water. Peel
and eat or refrigerate.

   SCI-SKY-MYSTERY (Undated) _ Astronomers have an unyielding
mystery on their hands, something they have observed and pondered
for three years, a point of light deep in the northern sky that
appears to be like nothing seen before. The mystery object has so
far confounded astronomers because they cannot decipher the
language of its light. This may turn out to be only a curiosity, an
odd variation of a familiar phenomenon, or it may be the first
evidence of some unsuspected object with reverberating theoretical
implications. By John Noble Wilford. (1600 words)

   SCI-BREAST-CANCER (Undated) _ When scientists identified two
genes, BRCA-1 and BRCA-2, as the culprits in most hereditary cases
of breast cancer, the discovery prompted much excitement and hope.
Women with a family history of breast cancer would at last be able
to determine if they, too, were likely to get the disease. And so
armed, they could take preventive action. But as with most highly
promising developments in cancer, the decade-long story of the
breast cancer genes, while it has revealed important insights and
greatly increased scientists' knowledge, has turned out to be far
from simple, both from a scientific perspective and a personal one.

   SCI-YELLOW-JACKETS (Undated) _ August is official yellow jacket
month, as a number of entomologists have proclaimed on their
Internet Web pages, and as anybody within range of a public trash
can will attest. It turns out that yellow jackets are not the
mean-spirited vermin their victims assume them to be. They are not
nasty for nastiness sake. They are proactively defensive,
family-values types that struggle selflessly to support and defend
their kin. They may crave the same junk food we do, but they are
not base freeloaders, and sometimes will even pitch in by hunting
caterpillars, aphids, flies and other garden pests. By Natalie

nonetheless. It's just nature, not little green men, that is

   SCI-COMPUTER-INTUITION (Undated) _ Anyone who has been to the
racetrack knows that picking a horse is part art and part science.
It was intuition, after all, not statistics, that rewarded those
who picked Charismatic to win the Kentucky Derby last May at
32-to-1 odds. Now, a small group of researchers say that such
intuition can, at least in part, be duplicated by computers. Rules

fleeing predators, but also by scientists' increasing understanding
of this olfactory ability, and the sophisticated training

   SCI-SKIN-PATCHES (Undated) _ The dry, flaky outer layer of skin
that covers human beings from head to toe gets very little respect:
People oil it, clean it occasionally and otherwise ignore it,
except when they decide to buff some of it right down the shower
drain. But to pharmacologists who would like to slip drugs
painlessly into the body, that layer of skin is the biologic
equivalent of Mount Everest, one of the body's most persistent
challenges to scientific ingenuity. Despite 30 years of research
into the subject, fewer than a dozen drugs are available in skin
patches, little discs that adhere to the skin and allow a drug to
seep slowly into the bloodstream over hours or even days. By

many of whom have had a clear vision about an afterlife. The
diversity of these experiences astonishes me; the clarity with
which some patients talk about these issues is one of the great

TOO EARLY TO SAY WELFARE REFORM IS WORKING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ President Bill Clinton and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the would-be president, may not see eye-to-eye on many
things, but each continues to tout his prowess as a welfare
reformer.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, do a number of other elected officials around the
country, who portray welfare reform as a major political milestone
of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who signed a 1996 law overhauling the federal welfare
system, recently bragged that there are fewer people on welfare in
the United States now than at any time in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, who strongly advocated and signed a welfare reform law
in Texas in 1995, proudly lists that accomplishment near the top of
his resume as he tours the country, campaigning for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The laws are working, the reformers say, because by putting time
limits and other restrictions on public assistance, they have
forced millions of Americans off the welfare rolls and into jobs.
And the politicians can point to statistics that seemingly support
their view.
</P>
<P>
   I hope their optimism is justified because we all would be
better off if the welfare cycle were truly broken. But, in reality,
it is too early to say whether the welfare changes are working.
</P>
<P>
   Reduced welfare rolls are encouraging, but they alone don't
necessarily mean that the new war on poverty will prove to be, in
the long run, much more effective than the old system of handouts.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, so far, has had one of the best records among the states
in moving people off public assistance. More than 400,000 people, a
reduction of more than 50 percent, have left the welfare rolls in
Texas since November 1994, a few months before Texas' reform law
was passed.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's bragging rights should be tempered by the fact that
thousands of former welfare mothers haven't yet found jobs, and
many who have been employed make wages too low to make a
significant dent in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal is not just to move people off public
assistance, but to get most of them into productive jobs that pay
enough to keep them out of poverty. And a recent study by the Urban
Institute indicates the new welfare changes are falling short all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study released earlier this month, most of the
women who left the welfare rolls in the United States in the first
wave after the new federal law found low-wage service jobs. And
one-third to one-half of those said they had serious problems in
providing food for their families, and many had difficulty paying
their rent.
</P>
<P>
   Without Medicaid, food stamps and subsidized housing _ other
forms of governmental assistance that usually are not called
``welfare'' _ many of them wouldn't be able to hang on. And
affordable housing is becoming harder and harder to find for many
poor Americans, either working or on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The Urban Institute study also found that one-fourth of the
women who left welfare during 1997 later returned to public
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Society certainly doesn't owe any welfare recipient a
high-paying job, and many welfare moms lack the education and
skills necessary to do any more than menial labor. But the reality
is that minimum-wage jobs are not going to end the poverty cycle.
They may be a start, but they're only a start.
</P>
<P>
   Education will be the key in the long run. The welfare reform
laws encourage education and vocational training as a means of
moving welfare recipients into the work force, and Texas has joined
other states in boosting its commitment to the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   There also is room for help from churches, charitable groups and
other components of what Bush has dubbed the ``armies of
compassion.'' But all those efforts will take time, much longer
than politicians care to wait before declaring victory.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the welfare changes have been boosted by a strong
economy that has made it easier for public assistance recipients to
find jobs. A tougher test will come when the economy worsens _ as
it periodically does _ and jobs, even low-paying ones, become
scarcer.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare reform may be on the right track. But it will be many
more years _ and several more election cycles _ before we will know
for sure whether the new laws were a milestone or a mirage.

WIN OR LOSE, BILL BRADLEY CAN HURT AL GORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JANE ELY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter how the contest between Al Gore and Bill Bradley for
the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination turns out, the former
U.S. senator from New Jersey will have done the current vice
president a good deal of political harm.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, if Bradley, who probably is even better known for his
professional basketball career than for his three terms in the
Senate, beats out Gore for their party's official nod, he will have
clobbered more than Gore's hope for the presidency. In beating the
former U.S. rep and senator from Tennessee, he will have destroyed
the dream Gore's father, the late Sen. Albert Gore, also of
Tennessee, held for his son from birth.
</P>
<P>
   Not so immediately obvious, but likely as politically
devastating for Gore, are the political wounds Bradley is sure to
deliver Bill Clinton's vice president as the two slowly, and rather
strangely, jostle their way down the old political path.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, for many reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gore's tendency to want to capitalize on Clinton's
political skills and fund-raising talents without absorbing a whiff
of the moral contempt in which many hold Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Gore, thus far, has paid little attention to Bradley,
choosing instead to aim his political sniping at Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, whom most now expect to be the Republican presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, Bradley has done quite well in portraying
Gore as all that is the same in Washington, as the scion of the
status quo. For example, Bradley, upon hearing many of his
intraparty political foe's promises, reportedly enjoys inquiring
why Gore has not already delivered on them. Implicit in such a
butter-won't-melt attack is the political premise Gore, as vice
president, indeed, has been unusually involved in and therefore at
least partly responsible for the Clinton administration
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bradley's attacks can knock Gore out of his widely
presumed strong lead in the race for the Democratic presidential
nomination has yet to be seen. But rare is the seasoned political
observer who doesn't recognize the virtual certainty Bradley's
licks, at the least, will have softened up Gore for a Republican
opponent in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely any Republican candidate against Gore would benefit
from Bradley's campaign. At the same time, however, should Bradley
defeat Gore in the Democratic race _ certainly a possibility, if
not a probability _ Bradley would go into the general election with
the upper political hand.
</P>
<P>
   At least he would if he maintains _ and there's considerable
indication from him he won't _ his thus far general image
nationally as a nice guy who's kind of in the middle of the old
political road.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bradley's more _ maybe even most _ remarkable political
traits is his ability so far to tarnish Gore with a life generally
spent in Washington and, specifically, spent as Bill Clinton's vice
president. Bradley, considered by most familiar with him as pretty
liberal, so far has done a swell job depicting Gore as a leading
participant in a part of Washington that is wrong and needs to be
politically exterminated.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he has convinced more than a few that his
years in the Senate will put him in a superior position to serve
the public good as president, but they haven't tainted him
politically.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he's still doing just fine at having his
political cake and eating it too. He maintains he, unlike Gore,
whom he insists is way too inside-Washington, is an outsider, a
person with a fresh approach to leading the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As for his time as a senator from New Jersey, that, he suggests,
is just enough to let him begin his presidency ready to serve
without having to learn the ways of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Bradley, like Bush, is taking political flak from
a lot of pundits and political writers for not being specific
enough about specific issues. Without comment on pundits and
political writers, I maintain it is quite worth noting something
Democrat Bradley and Republican Bush have very much in common.
</P>
<P>
   Each professes to believe _ and surely campaigns as though his
belief is genuine _ that what the American voters most want in
their next president is a person they can trust, a person who is
decent and respectable and worthy of public trust.
</P>
<P>
   By offering themselves as worthy of and quite capable of
fulfilling this trust, they, each in his own way, are saying Al
Gore, Bill Clinton's vice president, is not.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long time before Americans will, once and for all, cast
their only real votes in the cliched only-poll-that-counts for the
president to lead this country into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the only absolutely sure thing in American politics
until then _ unless it's that Al Gore is sure to hurt along the
way, with or without Bill Clinton's help. &QL;

 &HT;    Christening gowns represent great beginnings
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They resemble miniature wedding dresses _ long and white, sewn
from linen, silk or delicate cotton batiste, and trimmed with rows
of dainty antique lace. They are christening gowns for infants,
worn on the day they're presented for baptism, a dedication or
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Some babies, such as the children and grandchildren of Queen
Elizabeth of England, wear heirloom gowns that have been in their
families for generations. Others, when presented in a church or at
home, wear a brand-new christening dress bought by a doting
grandmother. After time, this dress might be handed down and worn
by other babies in the family, thus creating a new tradition.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 years, part-time Greensboro, Ga., resident Joyce
Daniel, 44, has designed and custom made ``modern'' heirloom
christening gowns. Using age-old, sewing techniques such as French
seaming, pin tucking, smocking and hem stitching, she turns out
simple yet exquisite gowns in new age polyester/cotton blends as
well as linens and silk batiste. The designer has also used fabric
from a customer's wedding gown to make a christening dress for the
woman's firstborn. Each gown, which comes with a matching bonnet or
cap, is machine made, with most of the trims done by hand. Prices
range from $55-$150.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each gown is truly a labor of love,'' said Daniel who sells
her gowns _ The Joy Collection _ on the internet
(mtcnet.net/(tilde)mdantel). ``I learned to sew from my mother when
I was in the 6th grade and took classes in heirloom sewing at
Martha Pullen's School of Art Fashion in Huntsville. That's when I
developed a love for making christening gowns. They are special
dresses for such happy occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   As added touches, Daniel trims many of her dresses, which are
lined or have a slip, with antique laces and embroideries that she
cuts from old pillow cases and tablecloths. She also embroiders the
child's name and birthdate on the back of the dress. And if you
have a family gown that's too fragile to be worn, she will copy it
for you in another fabric.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dresses, Daniel also makes romper suits for boys,
although many mothers choose to put their tiny boys in non-fussy
dresses. Daniel can also be reached at her home in Iowa:
712-722-4235.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't own a treasured old dress, you can find antique
christening dresses at estate sales and specialty shops. Cornelia
Powell on East Paces Ferry Road has a good selection of gowns from
the late 1800s through the early 1900s. ``A christening is a rite
of passage, like a confirmation and a wedding,'' said shop owner
Powell. ``These rituals require special dresses, which are usually
white, to signify purity.''
</P>
<P>
   All antique christening dresses were made by hand from linens,
silks or fine cottons. ``Sewing was, and is, a way for a woman to
express herself,'' said Powell. ``And what better way than by
sewing a christening gown for your baby.'' Antique gowns average
around $400.
</P>
<P>
   Christening gowns bought in stores such as Neiman Marcus in
Lenox Square and Jack &AMP; Jill's Children's Boutique in Alpharetta,
Ga., run the gamut, from simple to sumptuous. In Rich's stores,
short cotton christening gowns and little boys romper suits from
manufacturers Alexis and Feltman Brothers are popularly priced from
$30-$50. Royal Kids, a shop in Decatur, sells white christening
gowns starting at $29.99.
</P>
<P>
   At Gretchen's Children Shop on West Paces Ferry Road, big
sellers are long, hand-embroidered gowns from Feltman Brothers
ranging from $75 to $300 as well as more elaborate gowns from
Posies, which fall into the $200-$350 range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find people are making a big production of christenings,''
said Gay Kattel, shop co-owner. ``They are wonderful celebrations
for families.''
</P>
<P>
   Trina Summins,who owns the children's shop Through the Looking
Glass on Roswell Road, says christening gowns by California
designer Isabel Garreton are popular with moms and grandmoms. ``The
dresses are beautiful,'' she said, ``in silks, linens and dotted
Swiss, with tucking and ribbon trims.'' Prices range from
$250-$350.
</P>
<P>
   Are high prices deterents for shoppers? It depends, according to
Summins. ``Some people ask, `Why spend so much on a dress that a
baby wears only once?' Others say, `We are happy to spend any
amount for this once-in-a-lifetime dress and occasion.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tips on preserving christening gowns:
</P>
<P>
   An antique christening gown must be carefully preserved to keep
it in tip-top shape. Follow these suggestions from Martha Pullen,
author and sewing instructor from Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  After each wearing, wash in a mixture of 1/2-cup detergent
(Biz works well) and a gallon of cold water. Soak continuously for
two weeks, to remove stains and spots, including rust. Line dry. Do
not starch or iron.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Never store the dress in plastic. Instead, wrap it in
acid-free tissue paper, available at art center stores, including
Binders. A 20-by-30-inch sheet is 15 cents. Or, carefully put the
washed and dried dress in a cotton pillowcase then staple it shut
and put in a bureau drawer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you want to display a new _ or old _ christening gown, put
it in a shadow box, with the booties, cap and birth certificate.
You can also dress a life-size doll in the christening gown and put
in on a bed grouped with other dolls and lace-trimmed pillows.
</P>
<P>
   Baptism gifts
</P>
<P>
   After a christening, friends and family often celebrate with
parents at a reception, brunch or party. Appropriate gifts should
be lasting mementos, which might be engraved with the baby's
initials or date of the christening. Silver is a typical gift and
could include a picture frame, a small comb and brush set, a mug or
cup or a fork-and-spoon set. Other silver suggestions: a baby
rattle, a Bible with a silver overlay, a keepsake box or a
christening cup that holds the water used in certain baptisms and
christening ceremonies. A bit more whimsical gift might be a small
toy, a piece of clothing such as a cotton bib or booties or a set
of children's china.

A `WAKE-UP CALL' ABOUT ANTI-SEMITISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clinets)  
 By ANDREW R. HEINZE  
 c.1999 San Franicsco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In their own way, the words of Buford Furrow are
almost as shocking as the shootings at the North Valley Jewish
Community Center.
</P>
<P>
   When he turned himself in to the FBI, he reportedly told agents
that this deed was a ``wake-up call to America to kill Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of the synagogue bombings in Sacramento,
Calif., this represents something new in the history of American
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   There never was a time without anti-Semitism in this country.
But when it comes to threats against Jewish lives, the rhetoric has
always been much greater than the reality. One of the reasons Jews
have traditionally viewed America as a promised land is the
comparative absence of violence against them.
</P>
<P>
   Europe was the land of bloody crusades and inquisitions,
expulsions and pogroms. Europe was the site of perverse and
dangerous superstitions, such as the ``blood libel'' that haunted
Jews every year at Passover and Easter (the utterly false notion
that Jews killed Christian children to use their blood in the
making of matzoh, a charge that often produced riots against Jews).
The Holocaust was a European phenomenon, the culmination of
centuries of violence and malicious mythology.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the statistics of American anti-Semitism, though
plentiful, appear mild. There was Gen. U.S. Grant's expulsion of
Jewish merchants from the Tennessee war zone in the Civil War, an
act that Lincoln countermanded. There was the lynching of Leo Frank
in Georgia in 1915, after his spurious conviction for the murder of
one of his female employees. There was Henry Ford's infamous
republication in the 1920s of the fictional anti-Semitic tract,
``Protocols of the Elders of Zion.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been the incessant rant of popular anti-Semitic
preachers from Father (Charles) Coughlin's radio broadcasts in the
1930s to Louis Farrakhan in our own day. There has been conflict,
sometimes bloody and tinged with anti-Semitism, in big cities,
particularly New York City.
</P>
<P>
   We must also enter into our tally the fact that until recent
times Jews were refused accommodation in certain hotels, resorts
and housing markets, blocked by discriminatory quotas from full
admission into some colleges and universities and barred (and in
some places still are) from membership in many social
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, there are Americans still who consider Jews damned
by their failure to embrace Christianity, who believe Jews are
``Christ killers'' despite the official rejection of this doctrine
by their churches, who consider Jews incapable of total allegiance
to the United States, who think Jews are money-hungry, deceitful,
uncouth and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of Sacramento synagogues and the attempted mass
murder at the Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles are an
unprecedented manifestation of American anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   This is so not only because of the intensity of the crimes but
also because of their source in the white supremacy movement. The
white supremacists, with their various sects and splinter groups,
have emerged as the vanguard of a new anti-Semitism, colored by
Hitlerian philosophy and devoted, in a way that no American group
before has been, to violent solutions of ``the Jewish problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be, as Furrow's talk of a ``wake-up call'' suggests, that
``millennial awareness,'' the generalized sense of an imminent
apocalypse, is behind the violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the early and mid-1990s, leading scholars were concluding
that the bark of American anti-Semitism was much bigger than its
bite, and that anti-Semitism in the United States is neither
virulent nor growing. Undeniably, Jews are more fully accepted and
involved in American society than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Still, standing at the end of the decade, the century and the
millennium, I think we must agree with Buford Furrow about one
thing. The attack on a Jewish day care center in Los Angeles is a
wake-up call. Something new is happening here.

 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Steven and Barbara Grossman have reached a rare
milestone in American politics. In the fund-raising frenzy of the
1990s, the Newton businessman and his wife, a Tufts University
professor, have given more than $1 million to the Democratic Party
and its candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Grossmans, heirs to the Massachusetts Envelope empire,
embody the stereotype of Massachusetts as a bastion of affluent
liberals bankrolling the Democratic machine.
</P>
<P>
   But several wealthy Republicans are burying that image under a
crush of campaign dollars. In a struggle for political supremacy
that has pitted neighbor against neighbor and business partner
against business partner, the state's top GOP contributors are
racing Grossman and his Democratic allies to help finance the
multimillion-dollar campaigns for the White House and Congress in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Republican backers are little known. But behind the
scenes, some of them are playing major roles in national politics,
including:
</P>
<P>
   --John W. Childs, a Boston investor who has effectively served
as the Republican counterbalance to Grossman. Childs and his wife,
Marlene, have contributed more than $820,000 to the GOP cause in
the 1990s, and the Republican Party is counting on them to
contribute an additional $1 million over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   --John A. Kaneb, an oil magnate who owns H. P. Hood Inc. and
part of the Boston Red Sox. Kaneb and his wife, Virginia, have
given Republican candidates and committees more than $520,000
during the decade, including $340,000 in 1997 and 1998 to help the
GOP maintain control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   --Herbert F. Collins, chairman of Boston Capital Partners Inc.,
who has made the largest single political donation in Massachusetts
this year, $40,000 to the Repubican Party. In the 1990s, Collins
and his wife, Sheila, have donated nearly $440,000 to the GOP and
and its candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Unswayed by the failed push in Congress to ban ``big money'' in
politics or by the referendum in Massachusetts last year to
establish public funding for campaigns for state offices, the
state's titans of political giving are emerging among the nation's
most prolific contributors of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the explosion of large, unregulated contributions known as
soft money, many of the top Massachusetts donors are giving more
than ever in this year of record-setting political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless small groups of passionate Democrats like myself and
many others are prepared to step up and be significant funders of
the party, we risk creating such an imbalance in the system that it
would have a negative effect on our ability to get the job done
politically,'' said Grossman, the former chairman of the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Childs gave the GOP more than $515,000 in soft money in 1997 and
1998, more than any other Massachusetts donor gave either party.
Only four individuals in the country donated more soft money than
Childs over the two years, including Richard M. DeVos, the Amway
founder, who gave the Republican Party $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Grossman, an ardent public advocate for the Democratic
cause, Childs shuns public attention. He and the state's other top
Republican contributors did not respond to requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory has generally been: Don't talk to people and they
won't write about you,'' Childs said in a rare interview in 1995
with the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Childs and Thomas H. Lee, his former business partner,
apparently had no trouble working together and financing rival
political parties. Childs split from Lee's investment firm in 1995
to start his company.
</P>
<P>
   While Childs was providing financial fuel for Republicans in the
early 1990s, Lee was donating part of the $520,000 that he has
given the Democratic Party and its candidates over the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the current business partners with clashing
political interests are Collins and John P. Manning, the president
of Boston Capital Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Six months before Collins gave his $40,000 check to the
Republican Party in February, Manning hosted President Clinton at a
$25,000-per-person fund-raiser for the Democratic Party at his
Beacon Street townhouse near the Public Garden. Manning donated
$50,000 to the event, boosting his personal contributions to the
Democratic Party and its candidates above $600,000 for the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to Manning's townhouse are the headquarters of Thomas
A. Kershaw, owner of the Hampshire House. While Clinton was dining
at Manning's townhouse, Kershaw's business interests were providing
Kershaw with the income to help fund the Republican attack against
the president's party.
</P>
<P>
   That week, Kershaw wrote checks for $8,500 to various GOP
candidates and committees, part of his $351,000 in personal giving
over the decade. Kershaw's companies also have given nearly $30,000
to the Republican cause.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the fund-raising free-for-all, some of the state's biggest
donors have decided the current campaign finance system is broken
beyond repair. Prominent among them is Arnold S. Hiatt, retired
chairman of the Stride Rite Corp., who gave the Democratic Party a
check for $500,000 three weeks before the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusted with the campaign-finance scandals that followed the
election, Hiatt helped launch a push for publicly funded elections
and funded that effort rather than political parties.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the only contribution that Hiatt or his wife, Anne,
made last year to a political party or candidate was $1,000 to
Senator John F. Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress has rebuffed the push for publicly funded
elections, the initiative has gained momentum or succeeded in
several states, including Massachusetts. ``Contrary to the
conventional wisdom, there is a crescendo of interest in true
campaign finance reform,'' Hiatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman agreed on the need for change. But like donors in both
major parties, he said he is not willing to suspend his giving
``and leave the entire battlefield monopolized by the other side.''

 &HT;    Drink up: Beat the heat with a lot of water
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ditch digging is the worst, says Al Sharpe, owner of
Sharpe's Landscaping and Irrigation in Stockbridge (Ga.). Between
the dust and the heat, the thirst never ends.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharpe, who's worked more than a decade in Georgia summers,
said he lives by one rule when the sun bakes: ``Stick to water and
stay away from the sodas.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and dietitians agree. Water is the best protection
against heat exhaustion, dehydration and deadly heat stroke,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this kind of weather, people should really be drinking
about 8 ounces of water every 20 minutes'' if they're outside, said
Dr. Chris Wizner of Wellstar's Powder Springs Medical Center (metro
Atlanta). ``And if you know you're going to mow the lawn, or
whatever, you should tank up before you head outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people replace less than 50 percent of the fluid they lose
in sweat. And even without strenuous activity, most don't even come
close to drinking enough water, said Laney Hixon, a dietitian at
Northside Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're thirsty, it means you've already been dehydrated for
at least an hour,'' she said. ``And you don't want to get seriously
dehydrated; it's dangerous and in some cases can mean death.'' Each
day, Sharpe's landscaping crew of seven drinks four 5-gallon
coolers of water and Gatorade, and breaks for water for 15 minutes
each hour between noon and 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Gatorade and other sports drinks are OK, dietitians and doctors
say, because they replace lost electrolytes needed to keep cell
metabolism stable. So are fruit juices and milk. But such drinks
are harder on the body than water, because the sugar they contain
must be processed. Serious dehydration can cause dizziness,
disorientation, headaches, sweating and lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of heat stroke, the body's normal cooling mechanisms
become overwhelmed by heat and dehydration; one's body temperature
rises dramatically. If the temperature cannot be brought back down
quickly, death can result.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Within a year of graduating from high school in Boston
Nerine Kidd packed her bags for New York City, hoping her beauty
and moxie would win her a glamorous career in modeling and acting.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, and later Los Angeles, the tall, slender blonde
found what she had been seeking. She won modeling contracts and TV
jobs, including an eye-catching stint in a national commercial for
Brut cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, she married William Shatner, a Hollywood star
known worldwide as the dashing Captain James T. Kirk from the
``Star Trek'' TV series.
</P>
<P>
   For the bride, the marriage had fairy-tale elements: fame,
wealth, a mansion with a pool, and a handsome leading man for a
husband who, before their wedding guests, pledged his life to
``Nerine, my queen.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a dark side, too: tabloid reports that she drank
too much, made repeat visits to substance-abuse treatment programs,
and was recently threatened with divorce by her powerful husband.
</P>
<P>
   Nerine Kidd Shatner's life among the rich and the beautiful
ended abruptly Tuesday, when she was found dead in the swimming
pool behind her mansion in Studio City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a preliminary investigation indicates that Kidd
Shatner, 40, drowned, apparently by accident. Toxicology reports
and a full autopsy may not be relased for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But her relatives and friends in Boston are puzzled by the
circumstances of her death.
</P>
<P>
   They said the vivacious woman they knew was an experienced,
lifelong swimmer, someone too well-adjusted to lose control despite
her fast-paced Hollywood lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems kind of odd,'' said one relative, who asked not
to be named. ``I mean, Nerine grew up in a lake. She water-skied,
and she was an excellent swimmer. It's just very odd that she would
die in a pool . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Though she blazed a path from Boston to Los Angeles, the details
of Kidd Shatner's life in Los Angeles are not clear. Those who knew
her well in California have declined to speak publicly about her
since her death.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, her marriage hit a rough patch, and Shatner filed for
divorce last October, but friends said the couple had reconciled,
according to reports. Indeed, Shatner, apparently shattered by her
death, gave a tearful statement before reporters and TV cameras
after the body was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has their ups and downs,'' said the relative. ``I
thought she was happy, but I don't know about her Hollywood life.''
</P>
<P>
   The second oldest of five children, Nerine Kidd grew up in
Boston's Roslindale neighborhood. Each summer, from the time she
began to walk until she graduated from high school, she and her
siblings would climb into the family's dark green Chevy Impala and
head to their vacation cottage near a lake in Sandown, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd spent her summers in and around the water, boating,
water-skiing, and taking long lakeside walks. Her brother Warren,
two years younger, said he often tried to tag along with his
sister, who ``always had pretty girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Family was her source,'' he said, fighting back emotion during
an interview last week. ``Nerine always took care of us. She was
the one who held us together. That was Nerine's way. She made all
of us feel special.''
</P>
<P>
   She had gifts of character in addition to the gift of good
looks. From an early age she displayed a bold, almost fearless
personality. When she was still in high school, she saw a Filene's
television commercial, but was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called them up and said, `I've seen the girls you use as
models. I think I'm better, if you want to give me a try,' '' said
her father, also named Warren Kidd, a retired lumber worker who now
lives in Boston suburb Quincy. ``Apparently, they liked her.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Chute, a Boston modeling agent, was also impressed when
the slender teenager with ``this cute little nose'' walked into her
office with a handful of snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   She was unusual looking, raw, and unrefined, Chute said. In a
Boston accent as thick as chowder, Kidd asked if Chute would look
at her ``pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   With a laugh, Chute said, she gently corrected the girl: models
call them ``photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd quickly learned the ropes, mastering the terminology and
losing her Boston accent. Soon, she was doing photo shoots and
walking the runways in fashion shows. She based her career in New
York, but traveled to Europe for months at a time, and took jobs in
Boston, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd had an attractive personality, Chute said, adding that she
was a wisecracker who made people laugh and could laugh about
herself. She was a respected model, too, and scored at least one
commercial that caught people's attention: the Brut cologne ad
known as ``Scent of a Man.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spot, Kidd is in a man's bedroom, examining his
belongings. She pulls a dress shirt from the closet and puts it on,
smelling the cologne on the fabric. She answers the telephone,
cooing seductively, ``Oh, honey _ I was just thinking about you.''
</P>
<P>
   Her modeling success brought financial rewards, and Kidd was
generous toward her family, her brother said. She sent gifts,
money, and clothes to her siblings and her parents, who divorced 11
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She ``was full of energy,'' the younger Warren Kidd recalled
with a laugh. ``She was like a windup doll that never wound down.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been that energy that attracted Shatner when they
met in Los Angeles at a party in 1995. Shatner would later say that
``Nerine pummeled her way into my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's brother said the courtship grew gradually after his
sister returned to New York. Long-distance phone calls led to
dates, and Kidd eventually moved to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the modest recognition Kidd had achieved, Shatner
_ twice divorced and 28 years her senior _ has legions of fans.
``Star Trek,'' the late-1960s TV series that made him a star, is
broadcast in more than 100 countries in 50 languages.
</P>
<P>
   And Shatner's romantic life has long been tabloid fodder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a former personal assistant sued him, claiming he fired
her after he ended their two-year affair. A month later, an actress
demanded $9 million, alleging Shatner had been her secret lover for
six years. When Shatner and his second wife split in 1994, he was
ordered to pay her $23 million.
</P>
<P>
   The stories did not seem to bother Kidd, who shuttled between
New York and Los Angeles, both for work and to visit her beau, her
brother said. Still, when she arrived in Los Angeles, she kept her
own apartment until she and Shatner were married.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd once asked her father what he thought about her marrying
the famous, wealthy man her family had come to know as Bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Jeez, I don't know. It's your life,' '' the elder
Warren Kidd recalled. ``If you love him, then go ahead. Do you love
him?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   They were wed in November 1997 in Pasadena, a black-tie ceremony
attended by some of Nerine's relatives. The best man was Leonard
Nimoy, Shatner's co-star who played Mr. Spock in the ``Star Trek''
series.
</P>
<P>
   As a wedding gift, Shatner, who owns a California horse ranch
and stud farm, gave his new bride a $50,000 horse, her brother
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the wedding, the couple traveled the world, both for
business and pleasure. Though she kept her career and dabbled in
acting, the younger Warren Kidd said, Shatner was his sister's
first priority.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she would visit Boston with husband in tow. In 1998,
when her brother invited the couple for a home-cooked meal, Shatner
asked Warren if he could bring an old friend: Nimoy. Over dinner,
the two actors regaled the family with behind-the-scenes stories
from the ``Star Trek'' set.
</P>
<P>
   Nerine Kidd Shatner seemed comfortable bridging her low-key
Boston upbringing with her flashy Los Angeles life, as effortlessly
as she consumed both organic food and junk food, her brother said.
And she always seemed excited to see her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go to the airport to pick her up and she would run to
me, screaming, `Oh, Warren, I love you. I miss you,' '' Kidd said.
``She ran to me like I was someone special.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she returned to Los Angeles, all was not well in the
Shatner home, and the tabloids reported it with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd Shatner struggled with alcohol and drug abuse, the papers
wrote, and the wedding date had been postponed after her arrest for
driving while drunk. She spent the days before her first
anniversary in the Betty Ford rehabilitation clinic, again
undergoing treatment for substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Chute, who helped launch Kidd Shatner's modeling career, said
she was surprised to hear those reports. One of her relatives, who
asked not to be named, also expressed disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody drinks. She was not like a drunk or a lush,'' the
relative said. ``Sometimes she might have gone overboard, but maybe
that's the kind of life she got used to.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of her death was reported this week with a cinematic
flourish. Her famous husband, surrounded by reporters, stood
outside their majestic home and choked out a brief, emotional
eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My beautiful wife is dead,'' Shatner said, tears welling in
his eyes. ``She meant everything to me. Her laughter, her tears,
her joy will remain with me for the rest of my life.''

COLUMNIST DECRIES DEMOTION OVER STOCK INVESTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The San Jose Mercury News has refused to
print a letter from a former business columnist that claims the
newspaper had an inadequate ethics procedure and unfairly punished
her for what she says was a proper investment in a friend's
Internet company, her lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Nolan, a gossip columnist covering the Silicon Valley
until she was demoted last month, said in the letter that she told
three editors about her investment before it became public and none
told her it was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had violated the Merc's ethics policy, how come none of
these managers ... mentioned it to me?'' she said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The letter is the latest turn in a controversy that raises
questions about how publications covering business news handle
investments by members of their editorial staffs. Such investments
may create conflicts between staff members' personal financial
interests and their duty to report the news fully and fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's case also sheds light on how news organizations that
serve as public watchdogs monitor themselves.
</P>
<P>
   David Yarnold, the executive editor of the Mercury News, said
Friday that he hadn't seen the letter and would not confirm that
the newspaper had refused to print it. Yarnold and Pat Thompson,
the assistant managing editor for personnel and development at the
Mercury News, declined to comment on the letter or on Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, 40, had written the newspaper's ``Talk is Cheap'' column
since January 1997. She declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Gross, a San Francisco lawyer who represents Nolan, said
on Friday that the management of the newspaper had unfairly blamed
Nolan for its own shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``First they claimed that she violated the written ethics
policy, and when they realized it was never given to her, they
shifted to blaming her for investing through someone who they
claimed was a source but who was only a friend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer also alleged that the newspaper demoted Nolan partly
in ``retaliation'' for her earlier complaint that it paid male
columnists more than female columnists.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said the newspaper refused to print Nolan's letter and
claimed Yarnold had attempted to ``muzzle'' Nolan by threatening to
further discipline her if she commented on her situation in a way
the Mercury News deemed defamatory.
</P>
<P>
   On July 21, the Mercury News canceled Nolan's column and
suspended her for one week. The newspaper later reassigned her to a
news reporting job and said it would cut her salary.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary action followed a Wall Street Journal story
saying Nolan had taken advantage of an exclusive stock deal offered
by a friend who ran a Santa Clara company called AutoWeb.com,
netting a $9,000 profit.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to his staff, Yarnold said Nolan ``at minimum, created
the appearance of a conflict of interest for herself and the
Mercury News and she failed to exercise a reasonable level of
professional responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that the newspaper's policy may not have
been made clear enough, Yarnold said in a column that Nolan still
should have known better than to take a favor from a ``source.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarnold also suspended Nolan's immediate superior, Bert
Robinson, for two days and reprimanded Executive Business Editor
Pete Hillan. Yarnold added that the newspaper would review its
ethics policy.
</P>
<P>
   The policy said staff shouldn't enter into financial
relationships with news sources, and business staff shouldn't
invest in local companies, according to a Mercury News story.
</P>
<P>
   In her four-page letter, Nolan said the policy had been
``gathering dust on a shelf in a remote office and wasn't
distributed to me or others on the staff when we joined the
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's letter said, contrary to Yarnold's column, that the
executive who offered her the stock deal was not a news source but
a friend she had known for years. She said she had not written
about him or his company. She took the offer, she said, because she
thought her firsthand experience would make a ``good story.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's letter said she bought and sold the stock in March with
the ``knowledge and approval'' of Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Nolan told Robinson she had sold a first-person story
about the deal to Fortune magazine, the letter said. She also told
Hillan about it before signing the contract with Fortune, it said.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, Nolan also told another assistant managing editor,
Ann Hurst, about the magazine story, Nolan's letter said.
</P>
<P>
   But no superior raised a red flag until the Journal's July 15
report, the letter said.
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper ethics policies vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal has one of the broadest and most
thoroughly applied newspaper ethics policies, said Deputy Managing
Editor Byron Calame.
</P>
<P>
   It says staff may not invest in companies they cover or ones
that have a meaningful role in an industry they cover, Calame said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At its most simplistic, it says we have to be above
suspicion,'' he said. ``If you create a perception of a conflict of
interest, you can be disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff members must certify in writing that they have read it and
disclose ownership of any security for a period of less than six
months, which might indicate speculating based on nonpublic news
information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Examiner has a written ethics policy but it
has not been updated in several years and has not been distributed
to all staff members, said Sharon Rosenhause, the managing editor
for news.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, these policies are common sense,''
Rosenhause said. ``You don't write about something you have an
interest in. If you think you have a conflict, you should take it
to your editor. You have to worry as much about the appearance of a
conflict of interest as an actual conflict.''

PACIFIC ISLANDS' LABOR STATUS BRINGS DISCORD IN D.C.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARIA RECIO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Northern Mariana Islands, remote specks of
volcanic rocks in the western Pacific Ocean, are now the unlikely
site of a partisan eruption on Capitol Hill replete with political
intrigue, subpoenas and all the other trappings of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Strategically vital to the Allies during World War II, the
islands two decades ago became a self-governing U.S. commonwealth,
a status that has brought them notoriety as a haven for cheap
labor. The islands do not have to comply with U.S. labor laws, but
garments made there can legally carry the ``Made in U.S.A.'' label.
</P>
<P>
   A smoldering dispute between the Clinton administration and
House Republicans over imposing U.S. wage and immigration laws on
the commonwealth flared into a political firestorm last month when
the GOP accused an Interior Department official of playing dirty
tricks on top Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   According to House investigators, David North, a career official
in the Interior Department office that oversees the Northern
Mariana Islands, was so angry at top House Republicans for blocking
legislation to raise the minimum wage and impose other laws that he
used his office computer and fax to discredit them during the 1998
campaign. Such partisan work on government time and equipment is
prohibited by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, according to a memo that Republican
investigators retrieved from his computer, North wrote to aides of
one Democratic congressional campaign: ``My motivations are: to
elect Democrats to the House and to punish the handful of obvious
GOP sweatshop allies.''
</P>
<P>
   The memos indicate that his targets included House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Sugar Land. DeLay and Armey have long opposed efforts to impose
U.S. regulations on the islands.
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off to North's activity last month, Rep. Don Young,
R-Alaska, chairman of the House Resources Committee, fired off
subpoenas to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and to the executive
director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. North,
a public affairs official who was the acting director of policy in
the Office of Insular Affairs, resigned after the subpoena was
issued.
</P>
<P>
   Interior officials say they are cooperating in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   North, reached at his home in Arlington, Va., said, ``I really
can't talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But House Republican investigators are examining evidence that
North may not have acted on his own.
</P>
<P>
   His memos are copied to his department supervisor, Allen
Stayman. And in a memo to Democratic National Committee staff,
Stayman urges that the islands' Democratic governor be
``repudiated'' for ``playing footsie with the Republican House
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached Friday, Stayman, now working at the State Department,
said, ``I really don't have any comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
initially refused to comply with Young's subpoena because, as one
Democrat put it, ``It smacked of a political witch hunt.''
Eventually, the committee agreed to cooperate after Young
threatened to hold its executive director in contempt of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember anything to do with this guy at Interior,''
said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas, former chairman of the campaign
committee. ``I would not have anything to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had to comply
with the subpoena by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Young's investigators found a memo from North to longtime Frost
aide Matt Angle, then the committee's executive director. The memo
sought the names and phone numbers of the Democratic opponents of
Armey, DeLay and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Angle said, ``I don't recall receiving any
communication from that department on DeLay or anybody else asking
to coordinate research.'' He said that the memo may have been sent,
``but when you're in a political committee, you get a lot of
oddball calls and letters that you ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost said that he does not recall seeing the memo. ``If it
arrived, nobody did anything with it,'' he said. ``I would remember
it because it involved DeLay and Armey.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the House
panel, concedes that the evidence compiled so far by Young from
North's computer, laptop and disks ``is troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are the distant islands provoking so much passion?
</P>
<P>
   A class-action lawsuit earlier this year on behalf of island
garment workers, many of them citizens of China, claimed that they
worked in indentured servitude to pay off up to $10,000 in fees
owed to recruiters who transported them to the Marianas. Last week,
four major retailers named in the suit agreed to provide $1.25
million to monitor garment factories and ensure that they abide by
basic overtime and health provisions.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has been the most vocal House supporter of the islands as
a model of free enterprise and visited them with his wife, daughter
and staffers in January 1998. In a speech, he hailed the ``free
market success'' he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become an ideological issue to the left and the right,''
said Tony Rudy, DeLay's deputy chief of staff who accompanied the
whip on his trip. ``To the left, it's an example of abuses, and to
the right, it's an example of free markets at work. To us, it's a
success. We saw people getting economic opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey's press secretary, Michele Davis, who has also been to the
Northern Mariana Islands, said the majority leader was
``surprised'' by reports of the political activity. ``You're
supposed to be carrying out the law of the land, not playing
politics,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The islands have a colorful history. Discovered by Ferdinand
Magellan and claimed for Spain, they were controlled by the Germans
and Japanese before being taken by U.S. Marines in a vicious battle
on Saipan in June 1944.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tinian, one of the 14 islands in the chain, from which
the Enola Gay took off Aug. 6, 1945, carrying the atomic bomb that
destroyed Hiroshima.

`BLAIR WITCH PROJECT' IS OVERHYPED, DETRACTORS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly two months ago, ``Blair Witch Project''
co-directors Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick were finishing an
interview with a reporter. When asked if there was anything else
they'd like to add, Sanchez replied, ``Yeah. Don't hype the movie
too much. Just tell people it's a good little film and leave it at
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late. With hundreds of appreciative articles and reviews and
simultaneous covers this week on Time and Newsweek, ``The Blair
Witch Project'' has gone from independent darling to full-blown
cultural phenomenon. Television shows (``Two Guys, A Girl and a
Pizza Place'' was the first) are spoofing the movie in promos, Web
sites are buzzing with discussions (and sales items!) and the
film's tiny setting, Burkittsville, Md. (pop. 214), has become the
nation's most unlikely tourist mecca.
</P>
<P>
   But the hype seems to have come with a price. A considerable
number of people out and out hate the movie, with many moviegoers
feeling they've been sold a poorly lit, shakily filmed bill of
goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put it right up there with Hitler's diaries,'' says Jay
Johnson of Sherman Oaks. The 35-year-old contractor adds, ``Given
everything I read, I was expecting to be badly frightened. I'm
still trying to figure out what the big deal is.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Ed Mintz, president of the exit-polling firm Cinemascore:
``People's expectations for this movie went totally awry. Many just
plain despised it. The 35-and-older audience gave it an F, and we
don't see that too much. (For ``Blair Witch,'' Cinemascore polled
619 moviegoers in three cities.) It's like they couldn't wait to
voice their anger.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent film, fast approaching a $100 million take at
the box office, follows three student filmmakers shooting a
documentary about a local legend, the Blair Witch. The three
disappear. What we see is their epitaph, film footage found buried
beneath an abandoned house a year after they vanished.
</P>
<P>
   None of this actually happened, by the way, although many people
who see the movie leave convinced that it's the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still get calls to our office with people offering to help
find the three students,'' says ``Blair Witch'' producer Greg Hale.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's mock documentary format isn't the issue with
``Blair'' bashers. After all, if the events in the movie had
actually taken place, ``The Blair Witch Project'' would approximate
a snuff film.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the anger comes from people who dislike the movie's
amateurish, naturalistic look or come away feeling it didn't
properly scare them. A select few _ those given to motion sickness
_ find the film's herky-jerky camera movements to be a
stomach-turning problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a few people throw up, but no big deal,'' says
Victor Marquez, assistant manager of Pacific's Winnetka All-Stadium
21 multiplex. ``Headaches have been more of a complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's intellectual, not physical, disagreements that comprise
most of the ``Blair'' backlash. The Internet has served as the main
forum for seething emotions, a bit ironic given that the film's
grass-roots success is partially owed to the hard-core Net surfers
who discovered ``Blair Witch'' a year before it opened.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet honeymoon is over, though, with parody Web sites
like ``The Blair Bitch Project'' popping up and chat rooms full of
dissenters venting their spleens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since fans of `Blair Witch' were responsible for most of the
hype going into the opening of the film, they built a monster that
could not live up to most people's expectations,'' says Jeff
Johnsen, 33, who launched the movie's first fan site last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gets me, though, is the rabid dislike some people have
toward the film. They still frequent the fan sites, trying to exact
some kind of revenge for having their $7 stolen from them. They
just won't let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's core group of supporters are college-aged moviegoers
weaned on reality shows like ``Cops'' and MTV's ``The Real World.''
For them, the film's handheld aesthetic feels like art. The movie's
extensive Web site (80 million hits and counting) adds to the
blurring of fact and fiction with fake newspaper clippings about
the three filmmakers, fictional diary entries and mythical lore
about the Blair Witch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's low-tech _ and that's its strength,'' says media analyst
Jon Katz. ``Kids found it themselves on the Web. In fact, it's
almost as if kids designed it and made it apart from grown-up money
and hype.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, it's the first Internet movie,'' adds Bill
Block, a partner at the film's distributor, Artisan Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Older audiences (and, in this case, age 35 is considered
over-the-hill) often find little to admire in either the film's
look or execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't even see what you're supposed to be afraid of
because the lighting is so bad and the camera is moving all over
the place,'' complains Lydia Hurst, 39, of Studio City. ``Everybody
keeps saying how terrifying it is. Nauseating, yes. Terrifying,
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Clein, whose public relations firm, Clein + Walker,
handles ``Blair Witch,'' has a message for such naysayers: Give the
movie a day or two. Or a night or two. Then see how you feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a delayed-reaction movie,'' Clein says. ``I've met a
lot of people who said it initially didn't affect them and then,
two nights later, they can't sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it doesn't always work that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there's no small number of people who hate it,'' Clein
says. ``But that kind of passionate response means you have not
only a good movie, but something that's really tapped into the
culture. With a movie, the worst thing you can have is
indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' Clein adds, ``with `Blair Witch' nearing $100
million, somebody out there must like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for the sequel next summer. &QL;

NEW BOOM IN LATIN MUSIC FINDS THE MASTER WELL PREPARED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ Es el dia de Carlos Santana. It is
Carlos Santana's day. And it's about time.
</P>
<P>
   Patiently he has toiled away for 30 years, at the forefront of
the Latino pride movement, long before it was fully realized, and
cranking out an endless succession of work _ some phases more
worthy than others _ all the while exploring the parameters of the
Latin sound he originated.
</P>
<P>
   And now that exploration has taken him back home, with his best
album in ages _ ``Supernatural,'' a sizzling return to Hispanic
blues-funk, boasting a dizzying array of collaborators from Lauryn
Hill to Everlast to Dave Matthews. And rather than make the mistake
many veteran performers do _ try to conform his style to newer
artists _ even Hill finds herself abandoning hip-hop to meet
Santana on his (celestial) playing field.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of his resurgence could not have been sweeter. With
the recent explosion of Latin music _ thanks to Ricky Martin,
Jennifer Lopez and their ilk _ Santana finds himself in the
position of the movement's elder statesman. It's a position he
plays gladly; he has always loved helping younger musicians and a
host of them are looking up to him now. Two of the movement's
finest _ Mexico's Mana and East L.A.'s Ozomatli _ were on the bill
at Sunday night's outstanding tour de force of Hispanic pop at the
Shoreline in Mountain View, so sold-out that there was not even a
scalper's ticket to be had.
</P>
<P>
   Ozomatli, the Latino ska/punk/ salsa band, got things rocking
with their unique hybrid sound.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mana _ superstars throughout the Spanish-speaking world but
still relative unknowns here _ gave Santana a hard act to follow,
with a fabulously theatrical set that had the crowd dancing on
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Santana said he was pleased to host the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a good year,'' the 51-year-old Rock `n' Roll Hall of
Famer said with typical modesty. But his joy was palpable, and
infectious. For more than 90 minutes, the guitar master preached to
the choir of the already converted; the audience raised their arms
euphorically like thousands of antennas, trying to pick up the
spiritual musician's wavelength.
</P>
<P>
   Santana, known for his often-strange hyperbole, kept it to a
minimum Sunday night, giving only one dissertation on self-worth,
and how we should all ``perceive ourselves as rainbows.'' Works for
me.
</P>
<P>
   But the music? Ah, the music. With no fewer than eight personnel
on stage at any given time _ and never fewer than three
percussionists _ the music moved along like a funky freight train.
Starting with the all-in-Spanish ``(Da Le) Yaleo,'' Santana claimed
the stage as in years past: with quiet authority. Wearing his
trademark fedora and dark coat decorated with symbols, he played
with the exquisite purity of notes that has become his signature
style. He followed with the flamenco-flavored ``Put Your Lights
On,'' sung on the album by Everlast. It was beautiful, but might
have benefited from a simpler arrangement. Still, unlike recent
Vegas-style acts that have crossed this stage, nary a person seemed
superfluous, and all were working it.
</P>
<P>
   The best numbers of the night, and the ones that flowed best
from Ozomatli's and Mana's acts, were the Latin dance numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smooth,'' which was written by Matchbox 20's Rob Thomas, was a
funky show-stopper, as was ``Maria Maria.'' But when Santana busted
out ``Black Magic Woman'' and ``Oye Como Va'' late in the show, it
was stunning to see how perfectly they fit in the modern context.
</P>
<P>
   These are songs that, had they debuted today, would be top 40
hits on Spanish-language stations. That, to Santana, must count as
a small victory. Talk about being ahead of the curve.

   WASHINGTON _ The Northern Mariana Islands, remote specks of
volcanic rocks in the western Pacific Ocean, are now the unlikely
site of a partisan eruption on Capitol Hill replete with political
intrigue, subpoenas and all the other trappings of scandal.
Strategically vital to the Allies during World War II, the islands
two decades ago became a self-governing U.S. commonwealth, a status
that has brought them notoriety as a haven for cheap labor. The
islands do not have to comply with U.S. labor laws, but garments
made there can legally carry the ``Made in U.S.A.'' label. A
smoldering dispute between the Clinton administration and House
Republicans over imposing U.S. wage and immigration laws on the
commonwealth flared into a political firestorm last month when the
GOP accused an Interior Department official of playing dirty tricks

EFFECTS OF DROUGHT VARY ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DINA CAPPIELLO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Drought can cause a population boom or bust for
animals and plants. It depends on what they eat, where they live
and how they grow.
</P>
<P>
   Creatures that rely on rain-filled ponds are hungry and homeless
this summer. Those that can capitalize on the briefest spurt of
rain will withstand the dry times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bees are doing extremely well. We're having a great honey
flow,'' beekeeper Lloyd Spear said last week. He expects his yield
at Pine Bush Apiaries in Schenectady, N.Y., to increase by 25
percent this season.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Spear usually harvests 5,000 sections of honeycomb
and 1,000 pounds of pure, extracted honey.
</P>
<P>
   The sticky, sweet stuff is the end product of a natural chain of
events. Rain in May caused honeysuckle, clover and sumac to bloom
in June. A week of drizzles in early July caused knapweed and water
basswood to flower. Spear's bees collected the nectar from the
blossoms and are storing it in their hive.
</P>
<P>
   Since plants flower when stressed to reproduce before they die,
nectar remains high even in drought conditions, according to
Timothy McCabe, an entomologist with the State Museum.
</P>
<P>
   While insects in general do well, plants struggle and reptiles
migrate. Pine needles on evergreens are drooping, and the edges of
deciduous leaves are yellow, a condition called leaf scorch, said
Michael Birmingham, a forester for the state Department of
Environmental Conservation. Many are young trees whose shallow root
systems cannot reach water deep underground, he said. But oaks have
a deep tap root that allows them to drink during droughts.
</P>
<P>
   For reptiles and amphibians, water is a way of life. In search
of ponds, roaming turtles become the victims of automobiles. And
the growth of tiger salamanders _ an endangered species _ is
stunted by lack of water in the tadpole stage, according to Michael
Kallaji, a DEC fish and wildlife technician.
</P>
<P>
   Like honey bees, yellow jackets are thriving without rain. Their
ground nests are safe from flooding. Most butterfly and moth
populations are also booming because a fungus that eats their
cocoons cannot grow without moisture. The same holds true for
grasshoppers, which in a typical year lose many eggs to disease.
</P>
<P>
   The bugs that are struggling this summer are finicky eaters or
depend on water to reproduce. For instance, the caterpillar of the
pearl crescent butterfly is starving because the wood asters it
feeds on are wilting in the Pine Bush. And mosquito populations are
down because there is a lack of still water to nourish young.
</P>
<P>
   Generalists _ which eat almost anything _ are the ones best able
to cope with drought, said Alan Hicks, who studies moose and bat
populations for the DEC. Since moose eat both aquatic and
terrestrial plants, they keep on munching through drought, and bats
will gobble up any insect in their flight path.
</P>
<P>
   The human diet will also be affected by drought _ smaller
harvests bring higher prices. The upside for people is fewer
mosquito bites.

TEEN SERIES PROLIFERATE ON NETWORK FALL SCHEDULES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Meghan Green (Anne Hathaway), a typically clever
and cute TV teen, introduces herself in ``Get Real'' by
proclaiming, directly to the camera, ``I know what you're thinking
_ this is another one of those smart-ass shows where the kids talk
to the audience.'' She adds, practically redundantly, ``There is
nothing more obnoxious than self-aware teens who know more about
life's great mysteries than their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a canny piece of self-criticism or a pre-emptive
strike against viewers who would likely voice the same complaint.
It's a tacit admission that TV's teen genre has gotten huge,
ungainly and familiar _ and series creators will do anything to try
to distinguish their product from the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Which will get increasingly difficult this season. No fewer than
eight new series focusing on teen and high school life will
premiere this fall on the five major networks, with at least two
more in the wings as midseason replacements. In addition, five new
series join the 20-something genre, in which characters sit around
and grouse about their disaffection (other shows feature characters
in their 20s, but in those series they actually do things, not just
bemoan their lot in life).
</P>
<P>
   This onslaught comes to us courtesy of the success of a spate of
prior series, particularly ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Dawson's
Creek,'' ``Felicity'' and ``Seventh Heaven,'' but also sitcoms like
``That '70s Show,'' ``Sabrina the Teenage Witch'' and ``Moesha,'' a
relative success story on the lowly UPN network. Add the endless
stream of teen-friendly movies _ from the horror franchises like
``Scream'' to the teen steam of ``Cruel Intentions,'' the
rebel-jock incongruities of ``Varsity Blues'' and the crass (yet
sensitive) gags of ``American Pie'' _ and it was only a matter of
time before youth culture swallowed the country whole.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, this season finds teen-agers exploring high school's
unforgiving caste system in shows as diverse as the gracefully
comic ``Freaks and Geeks'' and the brazen ``Popular,'' which is
sort of the broadcast equivalent of the girl in high school who'd
do anything to get boys to like her. There are teens surviving
family turmoil (``Safe Harbor,'' ``Get Real,'' ``Odd Man Out'').
There are evil teens (``Manchester Prep,'' a spinoff of the film
``Cruel Intentions'') and teen cops (``The Badland''). There are
even teens making close encounters with aliens (``Roswell'').
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of depressing,'' laments Paul Feig, creator and
supervising producer of ``Freaks and Geeks.'' ``People told me,
`Boy, you really planned this well, doing this high school show,'
but I was looking for something different to do, a realistic high
school set in the Midwest. Now, there's a million high school
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd Apatow, former writer on ``The Larry Sanders Show'' and
executive producer on ``Freaks and Geeks,'' says he knew there were
a lot of teen shows but was surprised at the number that were
picked up. ``There were eight or nine pilots, and usually, two or
three would get on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird phenomenon in Hollywood _ no matter what your
idea may be, by the time you're in production there are eight
others in the pipeline,'' he adds. ``The inspiration for this show
was that these types of students were not represented on TV. We
felt it was a topic that had not been done to death. I still feel
that way, despite the fact that there's a lot of high school
shows.''

   Jason Katims, former writer on ``My So-Called Life'' and
executive producer of ``Roswell'' says he was anticipating it, but
was surprised at the level of the expansion. ``When I was on `My
So-Called Life,' the teen market was one no one at the networks
cared about at all. They didn't value it. Part of the reason `My
So-Called Life' had a short, difficult life was that it played to a
not-as-valued market. It's ironic to watch that market being chased
so much today.''
</P>
<P>
   All this comes at a time when Hollywood is under scrutiny for
pandering to and corrupting young viewers. Says Joss Whedon,
creator of ``Buffy,'' which had the airing of its season finale
controversially delayed after the mass killings in a high school in
Littleton, Colo., ``The (WB) was very concerned about (an episode
titled) `Earshot,' which had to do with a kid bringing a gun to
school. I don't think what happened is going to change the way we
tell stories or the kind of stories we tell. We're not a show about
issues _ it's about emotions, it's about the way people deal with
the issues in their lives. And we're not out to push the hot button
or be controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got burned by a very unfortunate coincidence with
`Earshot,' but it was kind of unusual for us to do an episode like
that. `Buffy' has become the show you dredge up when you're talking
about Columbine, which is kind of unfortunate. I think it's a
responsible show. We're always concerned about the kind of message
we're sending out, and it didn't take a tragedy to make us
concerned _ we always have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are some series that rise above the miasma of
mindless youthful cavorting. Shows that offer sage looks at the
high school years, that explore issues facing young viewers without
overtly preaching, that adults can enjoy alongside the shows'
target demographic.
</P>
<P>
   Those responsible for the best of these series both old and new
_ ``Buffy,'' ``That '70s Show,'' ``Freaks and Geeks'' and
``Roswell'' _ offered a series of guidelines delineating how their
approaches differ from the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 1: There's nothing normal about high school.
</P>
<P>
   While most people spend the majority of their adulthoods fitting
into society, in high school that quest isn't so clean-cut or
simple. Acceptance comes at a premium _ and a cost _ and teen-agers
are still trying to feel comfortable within their own skins, let
alone within social circles. ``There are only five popular kids in
any high school in America,'' declares Mark Brazill, creator and
executive producer of ``That '70s Show,'' a sitcom about a group of
Wisconsin kids coming of age in the post-Watergate era. ``That's
why the majority of humans relate to characters who are not
popular, because most of us weren't. All these kids (on the show),
for the most part, are left of popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge amount of pain inherent to that age _ your
feelings are so big,'' he adds. ``You never have feelings like that
again. That's why it's so relatable _ it's such a unique period in
your life. I'm glad it's over, I gotta tell you. Even recently,
I've had nightmares about not having my homework done. Wow _ what
an impression it leaves!''
</P>
<P>
   Apatow, whose ``Freaks and Geeks'' takes place a mere
half-decade later, adds, ``Our era is pre-tech, before cell phones,
most computers, answering machines; it was the beginning of VCRs
and cable. But there were the same cliques then as now; you were
defined early by peers. If peers decided you were a wimp, you
remained a wimp for a very long time. There were big kids who were
bad at sports, but no one seemed to notice _ they just knew you
weren't very good. You'd say, `I went 1 for 3 today, and so did
Bruno,' but no one else made that connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Series on the WB have taken the evergreen theme of teen-age
alienation to an otherworldly level. ``Shows like `Roswell' and
`Buffy' _ they're more metaphorical,'' observes Sarah Michelle
Gellar, star of ``Buffy.'' ``The monsters (on `Buffy') were just
the horrors of high school personified, and there are ways to teach
lessons that aren't necessarily as obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wonderful about Buffy is that she is universal _
everybody knows what it's like at some point not to fit in,''
Gellar continues. ``Part of the episode that was (delayed for
broadcast) had a lot to do with that, about how people
misunderstand other people. Everyone thinks that it's only their
pain and that only they feel it. But everyone feels it on different
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes with ``Roswell,'' which is based on a series of
juvenile novels about young alien survivors of the Roswell UFO
crash befriending high school students (Gale Berman, an executive
producer on ``Buffy,'' first brought the material to Katims'
attention). Says Katims, ``It's a wonderful age to write about. The
metaphor for the entire series is when teens feel like aliens. It's
a show about outsiders coming together. They come into this world,
they try to blend in but don't feel they belong. Those issues are
at the core of what the series is about.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits, ``Frankly, when we first told people the idea, before
anyone saw the pilot, there was always a little bit of a chuckle -
aliens in high school. We had to do the pilot with a certain amount
of integrity, so they couldn't dismiss us as a joke. If we are to
succeed, you have to not believe this is true but believe it within
the context of rules we set. I'm proud the show comes off _ you
feel for these alien characters.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a scene in the pilot of which Katims is especially proud
_ the aliens attend an ornate street party that reproduces, in
lavishly tacky fashion, a UFO crash. While everyone else dances and
laughs and screams, the three watch on with bittersweet
expressions. ``More than anything, that's a way of encapsulating
the entire series,'' Katims says. ``We see that it's not very funny
to them, and we're with them at that moment. We're with them, we
relate to the aliens. To me, the goal as we move through the series
is to live through them as much as we do the human characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 2: Don't talk down to kids.
</P>
<P>
   David Nutter, director and executive producer of ``Roswell'' and
former ``X-Files'' director, can attest to the importance of
refusing to pander to the teen audience after suffering through
severe studio indifference toward the theatrical release of
``Disturbing Behavior,'' which received an executive-mandated
hatchet job just before hitting theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `This is just for teen-agers. It's good enough;
they're just high school kids,''' recalls Nutter, the pain still in
his voice. ``If that's your attitude, then you've lost. You have to
respect your audience, and teens can be the toughest audience of
all _ if they smell a rat, they'll turn you off in a second. ``I
worked on that picture for a year, being told, `It's just for kids,
Mikey will eat anything, don't push your luck toward broadening
your audience.' Then they came to me with `Roswell' and said, `Make
this smart, we don't want to make it juvenile,' and I was so ready
to do it. I had had my hands slapped for the past year for trying
to do that.'' Gellar, whose own series was based on a tepidly
received movie, says of ``Buffy's'' cinematic incarnation, ``A lot
of people learn in feature films (that) you lose a lot of control
(when the movie goes into production), and I don't know if the
movie was the initial concept. I always felt that the pilot we did
was really what the movie was supposed to be about. The Buffy in
the movie, you couldn't have a series about her _ there wasn't that
much interesting about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Feig says he originally conceived ``Freaks and Geeks'' as an HBO
series. ``From the first day I put pen to paper, I saw it as an
adult show,'' he says. ``The only way to do it, if you do these
characters speaking honestly, is to throw out anything that doesn't
sound like something a kid would say. We've had to do it, even at
the expense of the funniest joke, because we don't want the kids to
be too clever _ we've seen too many precocious kids. If we do it
right, kids will believe it, and adults will be nostalgic _ `Oh my
god, that's what I used to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``After `X-Files' hit, everyone was saying, `Let's do more,
let's make it more out there and weird,' but that's not the
secret,'' Nutter says. ``The secret is creating an atmosphere
that's real and characters you believe in. You believe in their
passion in what they're doing and they're real people. Once the
audience begins to care, then you can show them all sorts of
strange things, and it will affect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 3: High school kids can behave in a way that
20-somethings can't.
</P>
<P>
   These shows boast tremendous crossover appeal for viewers well
beyond their teens, which is difficult to imagine saying about,
say, ``Wasteland'' or ``Cold Feet'' or ``Jack &AMP; Jill,'' shows in
which the protagonists founder in their ennui and lack of
commitment to anything. Apatow puts it most bluntly: ``There's
something inherently unsympathetic about white professionals trying
to get their life together. They have all the tools for happiness _
and nothing but their neuroses to hold them back. It's easy to
relate to but hard to like. Whereas with high school, that was
pretty hard for most of us, so you can't help but root for the kids
to survive. You can feel good about rooting for yuppies to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That '70s Shows's'' Brazill adds, ``The angst in the
20-something shows _ you're expected to get over it. It's
interesting and admirable to struggle with it in your teens, but in
your 20s, you're expected to grow up. You need to move on. That's
why there's no resonance (in those shows) _ people don't relate to
whiners. If you say the things you said in high school in your 20s,
you're a whiner. In high school, people just think, `Oh, that's a
tough time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Feig, at least, understands where the grousing comes from:
``When you're in high school, the world is still your oyster. You
can say, `Maybe I'll be an astronaut,' and not have it be insane.
You don't have to choose until college. Nothing brings you down to
earth faster than saying, `OK, I have to be a CPA.' Not that
there's anything wrong with that, but you're not dancing among the
stars anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your teens, you are filled with possibility, whereas when
you get older, you say, `I guess my life is gonna be this,' and
sometimes it's something great and sometimes not. In high school
and college, you can still choose to be a doctor or a potato
farmer, and it's fun to watch those decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Lesson 4: Don't portray adults as idiots.
</P>
<P>
   These series offer adult characters who may seem goofy and
dim-witted as seen through the kids' eyes, but there's a certain
truth to whatever they're trying to impart to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see teen-age pictures, adults are portrayed as these
two-dimensional stick figures,'' says ``Roswell's'' Nutter. ``That
was the last thing I wanted to do. In (the Charlie Brown animated
shows), when you hear the parents, they go, `Wah wah wah.' But
that's a cartoon _ you do something like that in real life, you're
gonna get killed.'' Hence, veteran character actor William Sadler
was cast as the town's sheriff, a man with a vested personal
interest in divining the secrets of the aliens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adults represented the element that makes bad behavior
fun,'' Brazill recalls of his own teen years. ``When you're living
at home and not supposed to do this, and living under that thumb,
naughtiness is so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he points out that the character of Red, the father of
the show's main character, Eric, has his eccentricities but is
pretty much on the ball as a parent. ``Red's very bright when it
comes to knowing what the kids are doing,'' Brazill says. ``Over
the summer, I heard two different opinions come up. One said that
Red was a good example of parent and one said he was irresponsible
and a hard-ass. I thought, he must be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to be a parent _ the nature of being a kid is
to test all the boundaries, to experiment,'' observes Apatow. ``And
it's painful as a parent to watch that or try to control it.
Parents make an enormous amount of mistakes. We're going to show
how difficult it is to deal with a child who's trying to figure out
who she is. Part of that is that the kids will do bad things,
illegal things, stupid things. Parents will think, they're doing a
terrible job, but it has nothing to do with their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can like their parents, but that has nothing to do with
the conflicts that have to occur,'' he continues. ``No matter how
good you are as a parent, your kid might try pot or drink, and that
doesn't mean you did a bad job. But your kid does need to be taught
enough to think about whether he or she should continue doing it.
We're not going to shy away from that struggle; it will not be a
two-dimensional aspect of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 5: Acknowledge that we live in a post-Columbine society _
but don't try to change it.
</P>
<P>
   Just one of the sad legacies of the series of recent mass
shootings is the persisting perception that TV and movies could
change everything by exclusively presenting blandly beatific
portrayals of suburban life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that we have responsibilities in entertainment,
but I do believe that it's our job, also, to entertain,'' says
Gellar. ``And it is not necessarily our responsibility to teach
children their lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate preaching,'' Brazill says flatly. ``People don't give a
s---. It stops being funny. `All in the Family' did so many things
you can't do today. `All in the Family' and `Soap' and `Maude' _
none of those shows preached to people, and none did a `very
special episode,' which came out of the '80s and ruined comedy with
the idea that the content was so heavy you couldn't be funny. I
hate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that ``That '70s Show'' has remained
resolutely wacky and issue-free. In the show's first season, its
characters dealt with sexism, birth control and a gay character
outing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Other writers have done some soul-searching since Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who's a writer for TV has to think about how to
address that,'' says ``Freaks''' Feig. ``I wrote the pilot before
that happened. In dealing with the pilot, it was not on my
consciousness at all. I'd like to think the show is in some way
hopeful, something optimistic, and I'm proud it's not a violent
show. To a certain degree, we all have to put our best foot
forward. In no way are we planning to do any direct allusion or
response to that event, but we are dealing with the universal
issues of adolescence including alienation, which was one of the
core themes in Littleton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaks and Geeks,'' Feig says, will explore topics such as pot
smoking. ``The teen years are a bad time to take a drug which
removes your motivations. When you're 15 and need good grades, it's
a bad time to slow down the machine. And I don't think it's
moralizing to say that on a TV show. I don't want to say it's bad
for every kid. I think you should lay it out there as honestly as
you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Feig recalls an anti-drug organization approaching him with
advice on how to deliver anti-drug messages on his show by
presenting as an example a scene from ``Dawson's Creek.'' ``It was
so preachy _ it said exactly the right thing. I'm not putting it
down _ it was perfect for that style of show. But if they think
that's going to make kids not do it, that's not really gonna
happen. I'm not facing this as a kids' show, and we won't pander as
far as moralizing,'' Feig says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our responsibility to do stories that are strong,''
Nutter says. ``The show will have a lot of humor, and when people
are laughing, they're listening. That will be able to give people
something to think about other than their isolation. If they see
this show about kids who want to blend in but can't, maybe
outsiders will be able to see themselves in these kids. It's
important that kids acquire wisdom that's necessary to have, and
they've got to do it some way.'' &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Is there life after death? Plants and animals on
other planets? Did William Shakespeare really write all those
plays?
</P>
<P>
   To those great, unanswered questions of the universe, add this
one: Why are gas prices higher in San Francisco than in Los
Angeles?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question few can answer convincingly, though theories
abound.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the average price of a gallon of regular, unleaded
gas in San Francisco hit $1.75 a gallon, an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   And since the beginning of the year, the gap between prices in
the city and Los Angeles has grown wider and wider, an
Examiner-KTVU Channel 2 report shows.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on July 20 the disparity was an impressive 25
cents. In L.A., the average cost was $1.36 a gallon: in San
Francisco, it was $1.61.
</P>
<P>
   AAA statistics on gas prices for both cities during the first
seven months of 1999 show motorists in the city consistently
digging deeper into their wallets when they stop for gas.
</P>
<P>
   From January through July, drivers in San Francisco paid an
average of $1.55 a gallon to fill their tanks. Their counterparts
in L.A. paid $1.35 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Why is gas cheaper in Los Angeles?
</P>
<P>
   AAA, north or south, can't answer that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have an answer, other than the broad view that oil
companies will charge what the market will bear _ and they do,''
said Paul Moreno, a AAA gas specialist in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good question,'' agreed Michelle Fadelli, manager of
communication and government affairs for the Association of Bay
Area Governments, which held a hearing on the topic in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ABAG decided the questions raised in the hearing deserved
analysis in a independent economic study.
</P>
<P>
   So the regional agency gathered representatives of the oil
industry, gas stations and local government, and the group decided
to launch an inquiry into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But the money evaporated, and no study was done.
</P>
<P>
   To Chevron's way of thinking, there's no need, because the
explanation is simple.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Libbey, a spokesman for Chevron, said there were three
reasons why gasoline costs more in San Francisco:
</P>
<P>
   _ Everything costs more. ``Land, permitting costs for developing
or expanding stations, labor _ you name it, it's more expensive,''
Libbey said.
</P>
<P>
   _ There's less competition. ``There are more stations per
motorist in L.A.,'' Libbey said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lately, there's been less gas to go around. ``There have been
a number of refinery accidents in 1999 that have primarily affected
Northern California supplies,'' Libbey said. ``Tightening supplies
tends to push prices up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the California Energy Commission in Sacramento, the more-
competition-in-Los Angeles-theory is popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound like an apologist for the oil industry,
but one of the largest factors contributing to lower prices in L.A.
is competition between gas stations,'' said Claudia Chandler, the
agency's assistant executive director.
</P>
<P>
   When the question was posed to Severin Borenstein, director of
the University of California Energy Institute, he said the answer
might be found by looking at the number of stations selling
``unbranded'' gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Unbranded gasoline is the surplus gas produced by major oil
refineries _ such as Chevron _ and sold to independent suppliers,
who then sell it to small dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a fairly high correlation between lower
prices and the presence of off-brand dealers,'' Borenstein said.
``They lower the price themselves and have a significant effect on
surrounding dealers. If you look at L.A., there are a lot more
off-brand dealers there than in the Bay Area.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many off-brand dealers had gone out of business in
California and the rest of the nation in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``More off-brand dealers have gone out of business in the Bay
Area than elsewhere,'' Borenstein said. ``But it's hard to get firm
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures from the California Energy Commission, which
were published in 1996, show there were 148 gas stations in the
city, including about two dozen selling unbranded gas.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gharib, owner of Twin Peaks Auto Care, an independent
gas station that has been selling unbranded gas for five years,
said 1999 has been a tough year to survive in the unbranded
gasoline market.
</P>
<P>
   Refinery fires, explosions and shutdowns reduced the supply of
gasoline. Wholesale prices skyrocketed. Profit margins fell.
</P>
<P>
   To keep customers, Gharib has to keep prices low, absorb some
losses and cross his fingers until supplies rise once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there is instability in the supply, we pay through
the nose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D- Calif., worries that unbranded gas
stations may become an endangered species _ threatened by the
``anti-competitive practices'' of major oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Boxer fired off a letter to the Federal Trade
Commission, asking the agency to expand its investigation into
California gas pricing, by analyzing wholesale pricing patterns and
how they affect the fate of unbranded dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbranded gas stations play a crucial role in California's
gasoline industry,'' Boxer wrote in the Aug. 12 letter to FTC
Chairman Robert Pitofsky. ``They survive by purchasing surplus
gasoline produced by the big oil companies on the open market and
selling it back to the public at a steep discount. Although their
numbers are small, these businesses provide a valuable service by
keeping the big oil companies' prices somewhat in check.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Boxer asked the FTC to investigate why unbranded
gas, which is usually cheaper on the wholesale market, now cost
more than branded gas.

competition-in-Los Angeles-theory is popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound like an apologist for the oil industry,
but one of the largest factors contributing to lower prices in L.A.
is competition between gas stations,'' said Claudia Chandler, the
agency's assistant executive director.
</P>
<P>
   When the question was posed to Severin Borenstein, director of
the University of California Energy Institute, he said the answer
might be found by looking at the number of stations selling
``unbranded'' gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Unbranded gasoline is the surplus gas produced by major oil
refineries _ such as Chevron _ and sold to independent suppliers,
who then sell it to small dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a fairly high correlation between lower
prices and the presence of off-brand dealers,'' Borenstein said.
``They lower the price themselves and have a significant effect on
surrounding dealers. If you look at L.A., there are a lot more
off-brand dealers there than in the Bay Area.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many off-brand dealers had gone out of business in
California and the rest of the nation in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``More off-brand dealers have gone out of business in the Bay
Area than elsewhere,'' Borenstein said. ``But it's hard to get firm
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures from the California Energy Commission, which
were published in 1996, show there were 148 gas stations in the
city, including about two dozen selling unbranded gas.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gharib, owner of Twin Peaks Auto Care, an independent
gas station that has been selling unbranded gas for five years,
said 1999 has been a tough year to survive in the unbranded
gasoline market.
</P>
<P>
   Refinery fires, explosions and shutdowns reduced the supply of
gasoline. Wholesale prices skyrocketed. Profit margins fell.
</P>
<P>
   To keep customers, Gharib has to keep prices low, absorb some
losses and cross his fingers until supplies rise once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there is instability in the supply, we pay through
the nose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D- Calif., worries that unbranded gas
stations may become an endangered species _ threatened by the
``anti-competitive practices'' of major oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Boxer fired off a letter to the Federal Trade
Commission, asking the agency to expand its investigation into
California gas pricing, by analyzing wholesale pricing patterns and
how they affect the fate of unbranded dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbranded gas stations play a crucial role in California's
gasoline industry,'' Boxer wrote in the Aug. 12 letter to FTC
Chairman Robert Pitofsky. ``They survive by purchasing surplus
gasoline produced by the big oil companies on the open market and
selling it back to the public at a steep discount. Although their
numbers are small, these businesses provide a valuable service by
keeping the big oil companies' prices somewhat in check.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Boxer asked the FTC to investigate why unbranded
gas, which is usually cheaper on the wholesale market, now cost
more than branded gas.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In June, after completing treatment for an early breast cancer,
I sought genetic counseling. I opted to have my blood tested, to
find out whether my cancer might have been inherited, the result of
a mutation in one of the two known tumor suppressor genes, BRCA-1
and BRCA-2.
</P>
<P>
   Because my mother died at 49 of ovarian cancer, which is
sometimes also due to mutations in these genes, I wanted all the
information I could get. That way, I could decide how best to
protect my own health and the health of my blood relatives,
particularly my brother and his three children and my sons and
their future offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Just by being the descendant of Ashkenazi Jews whose ancestors
came from Russia, there is one chance in 50 that I am a carrier for
one of three mutations in these genes. And since my mother
developed ovarian cancer at a young age, and I myself have had
breast cancer, the odds of my having a mutated gene are greatly
increased: to between 20 percent and 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although I have long followed early detection guidelines for
both breast and ovarian cancer, I now know that there is more that
I can do to assure that I do not get another cancer _ especially
one more likely to be fatal than the cancer I already had.
</P>
<P>
   But not every woman with a history like mine has chosen to be
tested, often for good reasons. The ability to test for genetic
abnormalities that greatly increase a woman's risk of developing
breast or ovarian cancer has created new and potentially lifesaving
options. But it has also raised a host of new concerns for women
with a family history of these cancers, including medical
insurance, employment discrimination, emotional distress and
strains on personal or family relations.
</P>
<P>
   Many Choices Possible
</P>
<P>
   Three women I know, all of whom are also Ashkenazi Jews, have
chosen different paths. Eva, who developed both ovarian and breast
cancer just after menopause, said she and her 28-year-old daughter
have decided not to be tested for the BRCA mutations for now. The
results, she said, would not change their current behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Eva said even if the results were positive, her newly married
daughter would not undergo surgery to have her breasts and ovaries
removed. She would rather not have to worry about a genetic
albatross at this stage of her life. But she has already begun
regular checkups, including annual mammograms, so that should a
cancer develop, it might be detected at a curable stage.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie, thus far healthy in her late 50s, has a strong family
history of breast cancer: Several relatives have had the disease.
But she is not going to be tested, she said, ``because I don't
think I could handle it emotionally if I turned out to have the
gene.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellie, in her mid-40s, lost her mother to breast cancer,
diagnosed when her mother was 43, and has been riddled with anxiety
about the disease since childhood. Other relatives have had cancer,
including two cousins, one of whom died young of breast cancer.
Both cousins carried BRCA mutations.
</P>
<P>
   Ellie would like to be tested, too, but she is currently between
jobs, and she is afraid that the discovery of an abnormal gene
could jeopardize her future employment opportunities, as well as
her ability to obtain affordable health insurance. Instead, she is
trying to alleviate her anxiety and protect her health by following
a more conservative course, having frequent checkups for the
cancers associated with BRCA mutations.
</P>
<P>
   Ellie made this decision after a two-hour session with a genetic
counselor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
With the counselor, she constructed a family tree, showing how a
genetic propensity for cancer might have been passed to her by her
mother or father.
</P>
<P>
   The counselor carefully reviewed all the pros and cons of
genetic testing, which is done on a small blood sample. But he did
not pressure Ellie to have the test. Instead, he outlined an exam
schedule for her to follow in case she is at unusually high risk:
She is to have manual breast examinations by a doctor two to four
times a year, perform monthly self-examinations and have annual
mammograms to check for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the counselor recommended that Ellie undergo an
ultrasound examination twice a year, and have a blood test for a
gene marker called CA-125, to check for ovarian cancer. Beginning
at age 40, he said, she should also have a colonoscopy every three
to five years to check for colon cancer, which may also be more
common in bearers of mutated BRCA genes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the counseling session, Ellie said, she dealt with the
anxiety created by her mother's experience with breast cancer ``by
keeping my head in the sand.'' But after learning of her cousin's
death, and her sister's decision to have her breasts and ovaries
removed while they were still healthy, Ellie said, she immediately
began following the counselor's advice and made appointments for
breast, ovary and colon exams.
</P>
<P>
   A Personal Strategy
</P>
<P>
   For my part, I sought counseling with my mind already made up:
If there was a reasonably good chance that I had inherited a
greatly increased cancer risk, I wanted to know that as soon as
possible. Medical insurance and job security were not an issue in
my case, and I have worried about getting ovarian cancer my entire
adult life and have undergone annual examinations of my ovaries for
more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   I am still awaiting the results of the test. But I have already
decided that if I test positive for a BRCA mutation, I will have my
ovaries removed. At age 58, they are not doing me much good anyway,
and I have just learned that the surgery can now be done through a
laparoscope, with two tiny incisions and no overnight hospital
stay.
</P>
<P>
   I will not, however, have my breasts removed, I decided,
especially since I have already had breast cancer, and know that in
a postmenopausal woman it can be detected early and treated
effectively with proper surveillance. Also, I am now taking
tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen shown last year to cut a woman's breast
cancer risk in half, though it is still not known if this
protection extends to women with mutated BRCA genes.
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised to learn that it would be wise to pay more
attention to my colon, which at my age I should be doing anyway.
And, if I have a mutated gene, my brother might also have inherited
it, and at age 54 should have annual prostate examinations.
</P>
<P>
   In tracing my family's medical history in preparation for my
counseling session, I learned that my mother's father died at 60 of
prostate cancer and that a maternal uncle also had the disease.
These cancers increase the likelihood that a mutated gene runs in
the family.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some Words of Caution
</P>
<P>
   But before any woman found to have a mutated gene undergoes
prophylactic surgery, the gene test should be repeated. Mistakes
have been made by commercial laboratories, and even the best
laboratories can be wrong some of the time. Also, keep in mind that
the gene test is not perfect. Even if both BRCA genes are fully
tested, some women may have an abnormal gene that is not detected
by the current test.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, beware of false reassurance. Even if you are not found
to have inherited a mutated gene, you can still get breast cancer
and you should continue with regular checkups. Keep in mind that
more than 90 percent of breast cancers are not hereditary. And if
you do choose to have prophylactic surgery, that too will not offer
perfect protection: It will reduce the risk of breast and ovarian
cancer by more than 90 percent, but it cannot totally eliminate
that risk. Regular checkups are still in order.
</P>
<P>
   Pretest Considerations
</P>
<P>
   If you think you might want to be tested for mutations in the
BRCA genes, there are a number of factors you might take into
account first.
</P>
<P>
   _ A session with a genetic counselor who is familiar with the
pros and cons of the test and who has no vested interest in
performing it is a wise beginning. You may find through counseling
that there is almost no chance that you have inherited a gene
mutation. You will also learn about the various courses of action
possible if you do have a mutation. And you will find out who else
in your family may be at increased risk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Think about your job and whether you might be bypassed for a
promotion or become fearful about seeking another job if you should
test positive. Medical insurance also is no small consideration.
Although there is now a federal law _ the Kennedy-Kassebaum Law _
that protects against insurance discrimination for people covered
by group policies through their employers or unions, if you should
need to get insurance on your own, you may be denied coverage or
charged an exorbitant amount. You might also check in advance with
your insurance company to find out if the gene test is covered or,
if you should choose prophylactic surgery, whether that might be
covered, as well.
</P>
<P>
   _ To find a genetic counselor, contact the nearest cancer center
or major medical center. If you do not have easy access to a
genetic counselor, the next best thing might be an interactive
computer program on a CD-ROM called ``Breast Cancer Risk and
Genetic Testing,'' developed by Drs. Michael J. Green and Norman
Fost. It is available for both Macintosh and I.B.M.-compatible
computers for $22 from Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, P.O.

SPACECRAFT SPOTS A MARTIAN STORM, PLUS DUST DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The canals that the 19th-century astronomer Percival Lowell
believed he saw on Mars were thought to be evidence of an active
civilization. Their existence was long ago disproved, of course,
but Mars has been shown to be an active place nonetheless. It's
just nature, not little green men, that is raising a ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   A recent series of photographs, pictured here from the Mars
Global Surveyor spacecraft, shows a huge storm system near the
north pole at the end of the Martian summer. The reddish cloud
swirling down from the pole consists mostly of dust; it is shown
evolving over six hours on June 30. (To give an idea of the size of
the cloud, the polar ice cap, a striated oval shape in the top half
of the photos, is about 700 miles in diameter.)
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft, which finally reached its mapping orbit in
April, a year behind schedule, has spotted shifting sand dunes and
dust devils, vertical plumes of dust that arise from spinning winds
and occur over several hours in the late afternoons, when the air
is hottest.
</P>
<P>
   The dust devils are similar to their counterparts in desert and
farm areas on Earth, only the Martian ones are up to five miles
high.
</P>
<P>
   The mission has also given scientists some understanding of how
the polar caps retreat. The caps consist mostly of frozen carbon
dioxide, which goes from solid to gas directly (a process known as
sublimation) as winter ends in each hemisphere. Photographs of
dunes in the polar regions show that thawing occurs simultaneously
in spots, which steadily enlarge until all the frost is gone and
only the permanent ice cap is left.
</P>
<P>
   Global Surveyor will remain in its circular polar orbit, 250
miles high, photographing the surface over a Martian year, 687
Earth days. Already, the trove of images it has sent back has been
remarkable, said Michael Ravine, advanced projects director for
Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, the builder and operator
of the craft's camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's providing the kind of data we never really had access to
before,'' he said.

   The U.S. Senate loaded the Interior appropriations bill (S.
1292) with more than a dozen shameless anti-environmental riders,
then reinstated Senate Rule XVI, which prohibits adding policy
legislation to appropriations bills. It's the Senate's version of
bait and switch _ a con game.
</P>
<P>
   The reinstatement of Rule XVI after the fact not only shuts the
barn door after the horses have escaped, it hog-ties the rancher so
he can't chase them.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Senate parliamentarian, Rule XVI cannot be used
retroactively; it cannot remove the anti-environmental riders
already attached to the Interior appropriations bill. However,
after Rule XVI was put into force, any senator who calls for a
point of order can challenge and prohibit pending policy amendments
including those that would remove, cancel or modify the
anti-environmental riders already attached to the appropriations
bill.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, by reinstating Rule XVI after the fact, the
Senate acted to protect the anti-environmental riders it had
already shoveled onto the appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   Riders to appropriations bills receive very little discussion,
are not subject to hearings and allow no time for the public to
respond. Johanna Wald, senior attorney for the Natural Resources
Defense Council, in an interview Friday, said, ``I really feel if
more people knew what this Congress is doing, they would rise up in
revolt because it is so anti-democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Wald pointed out that the 104th Congress and the 105th Congress
tried to pass grazing legislation that would have prohibited public
and federal oversight. Both bills failed. Now Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., has attached a rider (Section 117) to the Interior
appropriations bill that would accomplish much of what the previous
defeated two grazing bills attempted. There was little discussion
about the Domenici rider. It was added to the appropriations bill
while in committee.
</P>
<P>
   Riders are secret legislation. They can't stand alone in the
light of day. The Domenici rider states in part: ``Grazing permits
and leases which expire or are transferred, in this or any fiscal
year, shall be renewed under the same terms and conditions as
contained in the expiring permit or lease ...'' In other words, the
Bureau of Land Management would not be allowed to oversee the
federal grazing land under its management.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unlikely that a bill with this language would pass
in the Congress. And that's why Domenici attached it as a rider.
</P>
<P>
   The Domenici rider, Wald said, ``would make it extraordinarily
difficult for the Bureau of Land Management to change existing
grazing practices that are harming the public land. And like those
former grazing bills, this rider treats grazing lessees as if they
have an entitlement. It completely undercuts meaningful public
participation by dictating in advance what the terms must be, as
well as mandating that the grazing leases and permits must be
reissued.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., intends to introduce a rider to
amend and limit the damage the Domenici rider could cause. It is
possible, even probable, that Senate Rule XVI will be used to kill
Durbin's rider. Then the public will know the real reason Rule XVI,
which was suspended in 1995, was reenacted.
</P>
<P>
   Section 329 of the Interior appropriations bill would allow the
Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to scrap
science-based management plans on BLM and national forest lands. It
would allow those departments to take shortcuts around information
collection on wildlife resources and analysis of that information.
The rider undermines scientifically credible conservation
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., added a special little rider
(Section 124) to benefit a handful of ranchers in his state. The
rider reopens 1,000 acres of the popular Lake Roosevelt National
Recreation Area to grazing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after giving ranchers seven years to find other grazing
lands outside the national recreation area, all grazing ended in
Lake Roosevelt. Gorton's rider reinstates the grazing practices _ a
little pork-barreling at the public's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Larry Craig, R-Idaho, teamed up to
attach a rider (Section 336) that would weaken the already weak
1872 Mining Law. The Reid-Craig rider exempts existing and proposed
mining operations from toxic mining waste dumping limitations on
federal public lands. It allows mine owners to ignore the 1872
Mining Law's restrictions on the size and number of waste sites.
The rider removes the only incentive the mining industry has to
follow environmental reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate isn't paying attention to the wishes of the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks three major national polls have been conducted
that show a large majority of Americans want wildlife and public
lands protected.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, conducted a nationwide
survey of 900 Americans on behalf of the nonpartisan group,
Americans for Our Heritage and Recreation. Nearly 90 percent of the
respondents said they wanted our public lands better protected.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted by the University of Arizona showed that 84
percent of Americans support the current or a stronger Endangered
Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   And a poll conducted by the Mellman Group, Inc. for the Heritage
Forests Campaign, the Wilderness Society and the National Audubon
Society indicates that 63 percent of Americans feel that too little
of our national forests are protected and would favor a proposal
that protects all roadless areas of 1,000 acres or larger.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time to buttonhole the members of your congressional
delegation. They are home for the August recess. Face to face, they
may listen to those who voted them into office. Tell them to scrap
the anti-environmental riders.

   When scientists identified two genes, BRCA-1 and BRCA-2, as the
culprits in most hereditary cases of breast cancer, the discovery
prompted much excitement and hope. Women with a family history of
breast cancer would at last be able to determine if they, too, were
likely to get the disease. And so armed, they could take preventive
action.
</P>
<P>
   But as with most highly promising developments in cancer, the
decade-long story of the breast cancer genes, while it has revealed
important insights and greatly increased scientists' knowledge, has
turned out to be far from simple, both from a scientific
perspective and a personal one.
</P>
<P>
   From studying the behavior of the breast cancer genes, for
example, researchers now know that a woman can inherit a high risk
of breast cancer from her father as well as from her mother, so it
is not enough to consider only the mother's cancer history when
estimating a woman's risk.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the three mutations in BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 initially
identified as rendering a woman highly prone to breast cancer have
since multiplied into hundreds of mutations, each of which may
confer a different degree of risk.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the genes appear to play a role in other illnesses
besides breast cancer, and to affect men as well as women.
Mutations in the genes, for example, greatly increase a woman's
risk of developing ovarian cancer, which is both harder to detect
and much harder to cure than breast cancer. And a recent report in
the Journal of the National Cancer Institute linked mutations in
BRCA-2 to an increased risk of developing cancers of the prostate,
pancreas, gallbladder, bile duct and stomach, as well as malignant
melanoma. Other studies have suggested a modestly increased risk of
colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters further, the same gene defect may not
behave the same way in all families. In some families, in which few
or no cases of cancer have yet occurred, the gene's ``penetrance''
_ that is, its tendency to express itself _ may be much lower than
in other families, where several cases of breast or ovarian cancer
have occurred in blood relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many researchers strongly suspect that BRCA-1 and
BRCA-2 are not the only genes that can go awry and raise the risk
of breast cancer. As more is learned about the human genome, other
breast cancer genes may show up.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common misconceptions about breast cancer is
that some cases are genetically influenced and some are not.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that only a small percentage of all cancers,
including breast cancer, is inherited, that is, the likelihood of
getting them is transmitted at conception from parent to son or
daughter, either through the egg or through the sperm that
fertilized it.
</P>
<P>
   But genetic defects are at work even in cancers that are not
inherited: For a normal cell to become a cancer cell, a genetic
mutation or deletion must first occur, destroying the mechanism
that puts the brakes on the cell's ability to reproduce. As a
result, cancer cells multiply endlessly, like the broom in the
Disney version of ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.''
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Michael G. Muto, director of the Familial Ovarian Cancer
Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, and Dr. Janet
E. Shepherd, a gynecologist in Boulder, Colo., pointed out in a
journal article, ``Cancer is always a genetic disease.''
</P>
<P>
   A mutation that allows uncontrolled cell growth can occur at any
time during life, induced either directly or indirectly, by
exposure to a toxic substance like tobacco smoke or to a chronic
irritant like alcohol or stomach acid. Such mutations can also
occur spontaneously, when a mistake is made during cell division
that is not detected by the cell's built-in surveillance system.
</P>
<P>
   A cancer-causing mutation in a breast or ovarian cell acquired
during a woman's lifetime cannot be passed on to her children. But
researchers studying the genetics of breast cancer say it is
possible, even likely, that all breast cancers involve mutations in
BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 but that in only a small percentage of these cases
is the mutation inherited from a woman's mother or father. Dr.
Mary-Claire King, geneticist at the University of Washington in
Seattle, said, ``There is increasingly good evidence for a close
connection between inherited and noninherited forms of breast
cancer, although what that connection is is not yet clear.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three main types of genes known to be involved in
cancer: oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes and mismatch/repair
genes.
</P>
<P>
   Oncogenes dictate the production of proteins that stimulate
normal cell growth. If a mutation occurs in an oncogene, cells can
proliferate at a greatly accelerated rate. Excessive cell
proliferation _ as, for example, might happen in an esophagus
chronically exposed to stomach acid _ greatly increases the chance
that mutations will occur that could result in cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Tumor-suppressor genes, as their name implies, place brakes on
cell division. If a mutation inactivates a tumor-suppressor gene,
cell multiplication can continue unchecked. BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are
tumor-suppressor genes that seem to be especially important in
controlling cell multiplication in the breast and ovaries.
</P>
<P>
   The third type, mismatch/repair genes, have the job of
correcting mistakes made in the cell's DNA when it is copied, which
happens every time a cell divides to form a new cell. Because DNA
is the stuff that genes are made of, when mismatch/repair genes do
not function properly, mutations can accumulate in other genes,
including oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes.
</P>
<P>
   One hereditary form of colon cancer _ the kind that does not
involve the formation of polyps _ has been linked to mutations in
mismatch/repair genes. These same mutations have also been linked
to a three- to four-fold risk of developing ovarian cancer.

SMALL TRADERS GAIN GREAT CLOUT IN THE IPO WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The sexiest investments on Wall Street are IPOs
_ those red-hot stocks known as ``initial public offerings.''
Seemingly every investor dreams of making a killing on private
companies selling their shares for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of small investors, the big brokerage houses have
dominated the IPO market for years. On any given deal, top
underwriters hold nearly all of the treasured shares, forking out
IPO stock at low prices to money managers, institutional investors,
the wealthy and other favored clients.
</P>
<P>
   That could change. In a budding trend that may revolutionize IPO
investing, thousands of individual on-line investors on Main Street
are starting to buy IPO shares doled out by a vanguard of cyber
investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the upstart brokerage houses _ such as
E-Offering and W.R. Hambrecht in San Francisco and Wit Capital in
New York _ have stormed the Internet and started to level the
playing field for mom-and-pop investors and day traders.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling on-line brokers have a long way to go, of course.
They barely hold 1 percent of market share in IPO sales, according
to Gomez Advisors, an Internet consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the demand from small ``retail'' investors is at an all-time
high. Nowadays, it's not uncommon to see the on-line companies
allotting 10 percent to 50 percent of their IPO shares to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is the future of investment banking,'' said Tim
Newell, managing director of corporate finance at E-Offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retail investors are a growing power in the capital markets,
and every IPO must take that into account.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a groundswell out there,'' agreed David Menlow,
president of IPO Financial Network in Millburn, N.J. ``The market
has been looking for this for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching the trend in its infancy is Tom Carter, 25, of San Luis
Obispo. Ignore the nose ring, the lava lamps, the funky bedroom.
The sharp Carter is an avowed day trader who just got hooked on
on-line IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who previously worked for the California Republican
Party, discovered the joys and perils of investing on line a few
months ago. He opened an Internet brokerage account and started
trading five, six stocks a day.
</P>
<P>
   Carter recently invested in his first IPO: 1-800-Flowers.com, an
on-line florist in New York. He bought 40 shares at the offering
price of $21. The stock fell to $18 the first day, then $17 the
next day. Carter quickly sold his shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one didn't work out, but I'll definitely explore more,''
said Carter, who estimates he has grossed $50,000 in trading since
January. ``A lot of IPOs take off like rockets.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line IPOs aren't for wallflowers. Many of the high-risk,
speculative investments quickly lose steam after their sizzling
debuts. According to CommScan LLC, a research firm in New York
City, 40 percent of this year's 160 IPOs have sunk below their
offering prices.
</P>
<P>
   Today's IPO market has chilled considerably. Internet indexes
have fallen 20 percent or more in recently weeks. And only the
strongest startups are going public of late, with gun-shy companies
delaying their IPOs until the market heats up again.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scary ride, the IPO Gold Rush is too tempting to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical IPO deal, Wall Street Brahmins such as Goldman
Sachs and Merrill Lynch form underwriting syndicates to buy shares
from the company going public.
</P>
<P>
   During private presentations called ``road shows,'' the bankers
get commitments from investment managers to buy large blocks of
shares at an early offering price. They'll also sell stock to
family, friends and rich individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The process is more democratic for small investors who want a
piece of the IPO pie.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who sign up with on-line brokerages are screened.
Brokerages check their income levels, assets, investment objectives
and trading experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure they're suitable for IPO offerings,''
said Eric Brugel, chief operating officer of fbr.com, the on-line
brokerage arm of investment bank Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group
Inc. in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Once customers pass the screening, they simply open their
brokerage accounts _ typically with a $2,000 minimum _ then jump
right in. If demand is sky-high for an IPO, the lucky investors are
picked by a random computer lottery used by nearly all the on-line
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerages discourage ``flipping,'' or selling the stock for
a quick profit the first day of trading. To encourage long-term
investing that strengthens a company's stock price, on-line brokers
give preference in the next IPO deal to customers who hold their
IPO shares for 30 or 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is getting fierce among on-line brokers for the IPO
market. Some have struck strong partnerships with lead underwriters
that handle a high volume of ``deal flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Wit Capital, for instance, has gotten stock from 121 IPO deals
with dozens of big brokerages since last year. For a cut of the
action, Wit Capital agrees to electronically distribute millions of
shares to their 67,000 on-line account holders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We participate in deals with virtually every major investment
bank on Wall Street,'' said Susan Berkowitz, a marketing executive
at Wit Capital. ``These are high-quality transactions, and we're
making more progress each day.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the full-service brokerage houses are helping to
jump-start the small on-line companies. Goldman Sachs has poured
$25 million into Wit Capital, which is run by former executives
from Charles Schwab and Co. and Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street veterans hold mixed views about the new style of IPO
investing.
</P>
<P>
   Small investors, they believe, help a young company's brand name
by creating news stories and word-of-mouth excitement. But large
investors bring to the table billions of dollars, business
credibility and sustained coverage by Wall Street stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In balance, retail ownership is a positive thing,'' said
Matthew Cowan, investment partner at Bowman Capital Management, a
San Mateo firm that manages $2.5 billion in assets. ``But out of
balance, it can undermine a company's ability to build up long-term
institutional ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   More skeptical investment pros refuse to play ball with the
maverick cyber brokerages. Some believe it will take years before
Wall Street's old guard loosens its grip on IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underwriters still control that game,'' said Tom Taulli,
author of ``Investing in IPOs'' and a financial news commentator.
``There's definitely a democratization of IPO investing going on.
But it's very slow, one step at a time, like China.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the plodding progress, market forces in the long run may
help small investors win the war _ especially in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   According to investment bankers, a large number of technology
and Internet companies going public are demanding that a larger
portion of their stock go to individual investors. The idea: to
build longterm loyalty and a stable base of shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In so-called ``customer-directed share programs,'' operations
such as E-Loan, an on-line mortgage company, allot thousands of
shares to their faithful clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always felt a strong loyalty to our old customers,''
said Janina Pawlowski, president of E-Loan. ``We wanted to give
something back to them.''

 UNDATED: ovarian cancer. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1971, Dr. Alfred Knudson of Fox Chase Cancer Center in
Philadelphia, proposed a scheme by which an inherited mutation
might result in a predisposition to cancer. The scheme, called the
two-hit hypothesis, still stands for many cancer genes, including
BRCA-1 and BRCA-2. Each cell contains two copies of every gene, and
for cancer to result, both copies must be abnormal, the hypothesis
holds. Thus, an alteration must occur in each of the two genes
inherited from a person's mother and father.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, a woman who has inherited a mutated gene
from her mother and a normal one from her father. According to the
two-hit hypothesis, cancer would develop only if something happens
to the normal gene in a single breast cell or ovarian cell during
the woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   For cancers that are not inherited, the two-hit hypothesis
suggests that alterations must occur in both copies of a normal
gene. Because two hits are less likely than one to occur during a
person's lifetime, the risk of an inherited breast cancer is much
greater than the risk of a cancer that develops without any
hereditary predisposition.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of developing a nonhereditary breast cancer is about 12
percent; that of nonhereditary ovarian cancer only 1 to 2 percent.
But for women who start life with one copy of the BRCA-1 gene
already mutated, the risk of developing breast cancer by age 70 is
as high as 85 percent, and the risk of developing ovarian cancer at
any time in a woman's life is as high as 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For a woman with an inherited BRCA-1 mutation, the risk of
developing either breast cancer or ovarian cancer by age 70 has
been estimated to be as high as 95 percent, which has prompted some
women with a BRCA-1 mutation to have their breasts and ovaries
removed while these organs are still healthy. The risk of breast
cancer associated with BRCA-2 mutations is similar, and, although
lower for ovarian cancer, it is still very much higher than for
women born without one mutated gene. Unlike BRCA-1, BRCA-2
mutations increase a man's risk of developing breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   As genes go, BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are huge. BRCA-1, located on
chromosome 17, consists of about 100,000 base pairs of DNA and
codes for a protein that is made of 1,863 amino acids. BRCA-2, on
chromosome 13, is twice that size, and its protein contains 3,418
amino acids.
</P>
<P>
   The very size of these genes leaves lots of opportunity for
things to go wrong in the DNA base pairs that could cause the gene
to malfunction. Thus far, more than 340 mutations in BRCA-1 have
been identified, and most can disrupt the gene's tumor-suppressor
ability. For BRCA-2, more than 100 mutations have been identified,
and researchers expect that many others will be found that can
impair the gene's function.
</P>
<P>
   Only one in 400 Americans is believed to harbor a mutation in
BRCA-1 or BRCA-2. However, certain mutations in these genes have
been identified as occurring with unusual frequency in Ashkenazi
Jews, whose ancestors came from Eastern Europe. About 90 percent of
Jews in the United States are of Ashkenazi origin. And more than 2
percent of Ashkenazi Jews have been found to carry one of three
mutations in a DNA base: On the BRCA-1 gene, the loss of two
nucleic acids in position 185 or the insertion of an extra nucleic
acid in position 5382; On the BRCA-2 gene, the loss of one nucleic
acid at position 6174. Just as dialing one wrong digit in a phone
number connects the caller with the wrong person, these seemingly
minor errors are enough to impair a gene's ability to function
normally. Certain BRCA mutations also are found more often than
average in individuals from some Scandinavian countries.
</P>
<P>
   A number of laboratories can now test a blood sample for the
presence of the three mutations common in Ashkenazi Jews, at a cost
of about $400. Blood cells can also be analyzed for all the
mutations thus far identified in BRCA-1 and BRCA-2, at a cost of
$2,500. But the results, in terms of disease risk, are often much
harder to interpret than for the mutations found in Ashkenazi Jews.
And the results of such testing are most useful when a mutation
found in a woman who has had cancer is also found in her still
healthy blood relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Women with a family history of breast cancer are most likely to
have a mutated BRCA gene if the cancers in their blood relatives
occurred before menopause. In an analysis of 798 families, women
who developed breast cancer before age 50 had a 25 percent chance
of carrying a BRCA mutation if they had any blood relative who also
developed the disease before age 50.
</P>
<P>
   However, interpretive difficulties arise when a woman with a
family history of breast or ovarian cancer tests negative for BRCA
mutations. Dr. Kenneth Offit, director of clinical genetics at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, explained that
the cancers in the woman's family could have been the result of
different genes than the ones that were tested for. Or the cancers
may have been caused by some other nonhereditary factor.
</P>
<P>
   Since by age 85 one in eight American women will get breast
cancer and more than 90 percent of those cases are not hereditary,
``by chance alone, more than one woman in a given family may have
breast cancer,'' Offit said.

FEMALE M.D.'S ARE MORE OPEN WITH THEIR OPTIONS, PATIENTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Female doctors are viewed as less authoritarian and more likely
to involve patients in their health care than male doctors,
according to a new study by Johns Hopkins University researchers.
The study also found that black patients see white doctors as
inviting less participation than doctors who are black.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lisa Cooper-Patrick and her colleagues surveyed more than
1,800 adults who belonged to the same health maintenance
organization in the Washington area. Patients were asked to rate
doctors' interactive styles: For example, did the physicians inform
them about available options and include them in making decisions
about their care, or simply announce a course of treatment?
</P>
<P>
   Patients of all races and ethnic groups rated female doctors as
less autocratic and more inclusive. ``People felt more in a
partnership with the doctor when the doctor was a woman, possibly
because of better communication skills,'' Cooper-Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Black patients in the study, which appeared in last week's
Journal of the American Medical Association, rated visits with
white physicians as less participatory than visits with doctors of
their own race, but all the patients in the study, regardless of
race, said they felt more like active participants when seeing a
doctor who shared their race or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that older patients, aged 40 to 65, were
more likely to feel they were participating in decisions about
their treatment than did patients younger than 30. Patients with
graduate school educations rated their participation greater than
patients with a high school education or less. And patients who had
known their physician for three years or more rated their visits as
more participatory than patients who had known their physicians for
less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 64 primary care physicians participating in the study, 36
were white, 16 African-American, 10 Asian-American, and 2 Hispanic.
Twenty-four were women.
</P>
<P>
   One impetus for the study, the author said, was to test the idea
that African-Americans, Asian-Americans and other ethnic groups
tended to prefer doctors who were paternalistic or autocratic.
``Our study did not support this,'' Cooper-Patrick said. ``Everyone
was more satisfied when there was more of a partnership.'' She
added that the more patients were involved in the decision-making
process, the more satisfied they said they were with their care.

COMPUTER BOOSTING MIMICS HUMAN INTUITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (Eds: Byline is correct)  
 (af)  
 By JENNIFER 8. LEE 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has been to the racetrack knows that picking a horse
is part art and part science: a gambler can pick the horse with the
best odds, pick a horse that won its last race, pick the horse that
has the best winning streak or choose on the basis of a hunch.
</P>
<P>
   It was intuition, after all, not statistics, that rewarded those
who picked Charismatic to win the Kentucky Derby last May at
32-to-1 odds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a small group of researchers say that such intuition can,
at least in part, be duplicated by computers. Rules of thumb that
are only partially accurate can be combined into precise prediction
tools using an artificial intelligence technique called boosting.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting has two qualities that distinguish it from existing
computer prediction methods. While highly accurate, it is simpler
to execute than many other programs. And it is able to make
predictions even when the programmer provides very general _ or
even conflicting _ guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it simulates, albeit in a more sophisticated and
accurate manner, human intuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philosophically it's an interesting result,'' said Robert
Schapire, who has done seminal work on boosting with fellow AT&AMP;T
researchers Yoav Freund and Yoram Singer. ``You can take a set of
prediction rules that is better than random guessing and combine
them into something that is very accurate. It's kind of
counterintuitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Boosting is just beginning to emerge from academia into
commercial use, but researchers believe it may have a wide range of
potential applications. Companies, for example, might use it to
identify patterns in consumer behavior, a practice called
datamining.
</P>
<P>
   And the technique, which can handle not only simple yes or no
inquiries but multi-category classification and ranking, as well,
might come in handy in filtering junk e-mail, making medical
diagnoses, helping banks or other institutions identify a person's
handwriting, or allowing speculators to pick a winner in the stock
market _ or at the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, machine learning focused on developing large,
complex sets of analytical rules that the computer could use to
make predictions. But boosting shifts the emphasis to simply
finding rules that do better than chance.
</P>
<P>
   A number of studies have shown that boosting is often as
accurate or even more accurate than older predictive techniques. In
addition, it can be applied to already complex methods _ like
neural networks and decision trees _ to further ``boost'' their
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting acts as a big computational blender that can combine a
wide variety of predictive techniques from rough rules of thumb
(which computer scientists consider ``weak'') to already highly
accurate algorithms (which are considered ``strong'').
</P>
<P>
   In essence, boosting works by assigning different priorities to
rules of thumb by analyzing historical data fed in by the
programmer. The technique has five steps, which it repeats until
its accuracy cannot be improved upon. Given a rule of thumb, it
tries it out, then analyzes the errors, and assigns a priority
ranking. Solving the errors made in the first round is given a
higher priority when the next rule of thumb is tried.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the results from all trials are combined and the
program ``votes'' on the final answer.
</P>
<P>
   In racetrack prediction, boosting might work as follows: A
programmer would feed the boosting algorithm historical data on the
race, the horses and their records, in addition to a number of
rules of thumb, to be executed in order.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the algorithm might first ask how often the horse
with the best odds won. Then the computer might go on to the next
rule of thumb to see how often a horse that won its previous race
won again. In a third analysis, how often a horse with the largest
winning streak continued winning might be examined, and so on. In
the end, the horse that satisfied the most conditions with the
greatest accuracy would be selected.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting has earned fans among computational learning
researchers, in part because it provides a happy marriage of theory
and experiment. ``It's very easy to implement and understand. It's
very efficient. It yields good results. And for scientists, it has
a firm theoretical standing,'' Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   The algorithmic simplicity of boosting also provides a big bang
for the buck, which could make it attractive to many companies, he
said. ``Someone who finished a first-year programming class and
understands algorithms can implement it.'' In contrast, many other
predictive analysis techniques require sophisticated knowledge of
programming and statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting is not without its flaws. One problem that faces all
predictive techniques based on historical data is that past is not
always prologue. Also, because boosting focuses on items that
produce repeated errors, it can be influenced by extreme examples
or incorrectly entered data.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the technique makes it easier to identify such
unrepresentative cases, which can then be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of boosting was first suggested by Leslie
Valiant and Michael Kearns in a 1988 paper presented at Harvard
University. The first algorithms were developed within a year or
two, and actual experiments began in 1992. A lot of the work has
come out of AT&AMP;T's research laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   At first, many were skeptical that boosting was anything more
than a theoretical concept. But since 1995, mounting experimental
evidence has fueled an interest in boosting among the researchers
in machine learning and statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting research is still in its early stages. ``By analogy
with aircraft, Rob et al have demonstrated that it's possible to
fly,'' noted Ross Quinlan, an Australian researcher, referring to
Schapire's early work. ``Now we're at the stage of building bigger,
faster planes with different engines,'' Quinlan said.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting, like other aspects of computational learning, raises
fundamental questions about the nature of artificial intelligence.
Despite the accuracy of boosting, the algorithm does not really
``know'' anything: It does not search for certainty, but merely
makes mathematically calibrated predictions based on precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be surprising outcomes when you don't look for the
truth and just go for the prediction,'' said Freund, who worked
with Schapire to create one of the first practical boosting
algorithms. One experiment called for a computer to make deductions
based on statistical analysis of newspaper text it had processed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the computer, `Where is the Taj Mahal?''' Freund said.
``It answered, `Atlantic City,' because according to the text that
was where the Taj Mahal was mentioned most.''

CASES: DEATH HOVERS, AND WE LONG FOR GLIMPSE OF THE UNKNOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY E. QUILL, M.D.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was a medical intern in 1976 when I met the Reverend, a
fundamentalist African-American preacher. The Reverend had no faith
in medical technology or its practitioners, and had vowed never to
enter the hospital. Life and death, in his opinion, should be left
exclusively in God's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, this strategy had worked well. However, at 85 years
of age, the Reverend had embarked on the third, 40-day fast of his
life as a way to come closer to God. Midway through this fast, he
stopped drinking as well as eating. As he drifted into a deep coma,
his parishioners became uncomfortable with what they were
witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   The church elders brought the Reverend to the hospital. Although
they were acting against his express wishes, they could not bear to
watch him die. If he recovered, they said, they were willing to
bear his disapproval. Together, faith and medicine might be more
powerful than either could be separately.
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend was brought to us neatly dressed in a starched
shirt and pressed pants. Underneath, dry skin hung loosely from his
shriveled body; his tongue looked like a sliver of dehydrated
fruit. He was unresponsive, even to painful stimulation. It was
possible that he would not survive.
</P>
<P>
   I felt uncertain about imposing treatment against the Reverend's
will, but given the potential reversibility of his condition, we
reassured ourselves that his wishes might not apply to this
particular circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   We vigorously replenished his fluids and gradually corrected his
electrolytes, trying to avoid damage to his severely dehydrated
brain. We invaded his body with needles and catheters, drawing his
blood every few hours to monitor the changes. When he developed
brisk gastrointestinal bleeding, we gave him several transfusions.
Over the next five days, his blood pressure and kidney function
began to improve, but he remained unresponsive.
</P>
<P>
   We decided to discuss the Reverend's case at professor's rounds.
Ten residents, students and our professor surrounded his bed as I
began my ritualized presentation. ``Reverend A. is an 85-year-old
man who was brought to the hospital in the middle of a 40-day fast,
profoundly dehydrated after drinking no fluids,'' I said. ``His
medical history is unremarkable. He had completed two previous
fasts without incident . . .''
</P>
<P>
   As I proceeded, I noticed that the Reverend's eyes were open.
His gaze had previously been vacant and disconnected, but now a
spark was in his eyes, and he seemed to be looking directly at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reverend, how are you feeling? Can you hear me?'' I paused,
anxious about breaking from the usual format of the rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend stirred, looked around the room. ``God damn you!
What in hell do you think you are doing to me?'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
   On and on the Reverend ranted, raged and cursed. No one knew
what to say or how to respond. Our ordinarily resourceful professor
was bathed in sweat, and finally suggested that we leave the room.
The Reverend's parishioners took over and quietly calmed and
supported their leader.
</P>
<P>
   We returned to the classroom, barely acknowledging what had just
transpired. The Reverend's recovery was attributed to our medical
intervention, and the ``outburst'' was attributed to delirium. We
spent the next hour discussing his complex fluid and electrolyte
abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two weeks, the Reverend discussed his near-death
experience with us as he recovered. He was thankful to his
parishioners for bringing him to the hospital. But though he
appreciated our medical efforts to save his life, he said his
recovery was attributable to God's will. He described his time
while comatose in glowing terms. He had ``seen the other side, and
it was beautiful.'' He was not sure at first whether he wanted to
return to this life. His time in the hospital, he said, had been
God's way of letting him know that he had nothing to fear about
death.
</P>
<P>
   For us, caring for the Reverend reinforced much of what was
appealing in medicine. We believed that we had defeated death with
medical technology. Although his report about the ``other side''
was never thought to be an appropriate topic for our formal medical
education, we also learned that death might not be as frightening
as we thought. And his vision took some of the sting out of the
medical battles we lost.
</P>
<P>
   In my subsequent 20 years of practice, I have cared for several
persons who have had near-death experiences, many of whom have also
had a clear vision about an afterlife. The diversity of these
experiences astonishes me; the clarity with which some patients
talk about these issues is one of the great treasures of working
with the dying.
</P>
<P>
   I do not have a simple system for understanding or predicting
these experiences. Some patients with a peaceful notion of an
afterlife fight death to the bitter end; others with little outward
sense of spirituality approach death with calm acceptance. The last
chapter of our lives is written in part by our choices and values,
but it is also determined by arbitrary and capricious forces. Part
of our job as healers is to help patients decide what remains to be
accomplished within the constraints of their illness and to help
them respond creatively to forces and events out of their personal
control.
</P>
<P>
   With this perspective in mind, I cared for Mrs. M, who also had
a near-death experience. During the 15 years we had worked
together, she had successfully overcome alcoholism, breast cancer,
divorce and depression, and had raised two daughters as a single
mother. Gradually, we had become friends.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Mrs. M developed abdominal pain that led to a diagnosis
of a metastatic cancer, originating in the stomach. After exploring
all of the medical options, including experimental therapy, she
chose a hospice approach. She did not want to die, but she had no
desire to incur additional suffering in a futile medical battle.
</P>
<P>
   Although her prognosis was less than six months, she initially
did not qualify for a home hospice program because she did not have
a primary caregiver. I persuaded her to share the problem with her
daughters. Having witnessed the ravages of heavy drinking, they
were wary of their mother. But fortunately, they volunteered to
help care for her in a home hospice program.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. M experienced the kind of personal growth one hopes for at
the end of life. She had healing contact with her daughters, who
forgave her for past hurts, and expressed love and appreciation for
the hard work, caring, and commitment it took to raise them as a
single parent.
</P>
<P>
   She met with her parish priest and worked through some of her
anger at God and the church for what she saw as abandonment during
her years of drinking and alienation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. M's pain was easily controlled. As death approached, she
gradually stopped eating and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   As she slipped into a coma, her family sat at the bedside in a
peaceful vigil. She remained quietly unresponsive for five days.
</P>
<P>
   On day six, I got a phone call: Mrs. M seemed to be reawakening.
She had opened her eyes and was asking for sips of water.
</P>
<P>
   When I went to see her, she seemed very weak, but her eyes were
fully alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome back,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled and said, ``Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you feeling?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was it like?'' I queried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all very dark and empty. No thought, no people, no
colors. It was not unpleasant. . . . I remember a light, kind of
hazy at first. Then the light became brighter and clearer, and it
dawned on me that it was those same old $17 lamps across the room
on the mantle that I saw before I went to sleep!''
</P>
<P>
   She laughed as she told me this story. Yet there were tears in
both our eyes: sadness, about life's unfairness and perhaps about a
vision _ a light _ that wasn't. I told her I was glad that she
would get a little more time and that we would help her make the
most of it.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. M died quietly about 48 hours later. How and why she awoke
after such a long and seemingly deep sleep remains a mystery to me.
I had to laugh at the way I had reacted as she told her story of
``embracing the light.'' I had been hanging on every word, hoping
for a glimpse of the unknown and unknowable. Therein lies the
beauty and the mystery of this work, and the things that keep us
coming back.

CHALLENGE OF PATCH DRUGS: GETTING UNDER THE SKIN

<P>
   The dry, flaky outer layer of skin that covers human beings from
head to toe gets very little respect: People oil it, clean it
occasionally and otherwise ignore it, except when they decide to
buff some of it right down the shower drain.
</P>
<P>
   But to pharmacologists who would like to slip drugs painlessly
into the body, that layer of skin is the biologic equivalent of
Mount Everest, one of the body's most persistent challenges to
scientific ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 30 years of research into the subject, fewer than a
dozen drugs are available in skin patches, little discs that adhere
to the skin and allow a drug to seep slowly into the bloodstream
over hours or even days. Each of them represents a hard-won triumph
of ingenuity over biology _ a way to avoid the pain of needles and
many of the side effects of capsules and pills.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers are now pursuing more and more complicated ways
of getting drugs through the skin's defenses _ even looking at
electricity as a way of undermining them _ because medicating
people through the skin rather than the stomach has so many
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   When drugs are swallowed, their molecules tend to burst out of
the stomach or intestine into the bloodstream, like a horde of
angry bulls let out of a pen. Once in the blood, they are
immediately swept into the liver, where their structure may be
changed by the liver's enzymes, and then rush out into the rest of
the body. After this big initial burst, drug levels rapidly
diminish until the next dose.
</P>
<P>
   For some drugs, like antibiotics that kill bacteria, a dramatic
explosion into the bloodstream is exactly what they need to work
best. But other drugs, like hormones, work better with a less
hectic schedule, one that lets them persist without structural
changes at low levels in the blood over long periods. The idea of
patch drugs evolved specifically to make this possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to realize there was a huge difference between what
the body does with its own chemicals _ the hormones _ and what we
do with pills,'' said Dr. Alejandro Zaffaroni, a biochemist who
founded the first biotechnical company devoted to finding ways to
release drugs slowly into the bloodstream. ``There are a lot of
problems and side effects related to the fact that we provide a
very large initial concentration with oral medication. I began to
think, why not try to give drugs closer to the way the body does?''
</P>
<P>
   Zaffaroni's company, Alza in Palo Alto, Calif., ultimately
devised the technology behind the first patch drug, scopolamine,
marketed in 1979 for the prevention of motion sickness, after a
decade of research devoted to the not-so-simple task of getting a
drug molecule smoothly through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   The outermost layer of the skin, called the stratum corneum,
guards the body like a brick wall. In fact, structurally it is
quite similar to a brick wall, with dead, protein-filled skin cells
glued together in an oily mortar of cholesterol and other kinds of
fat.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a thin, elastic surface that is continuously
regenerated from the living layers of skin lying just underneath.
While occasionally interrupted by hair follicles and sweat glands,
and not completely waterproof, the stratum corneum is still a
high-quality raincoat: scientists have calculated that to penetrate
the layer, which on average is only 10 microns (1/2500 inch) thick,
a molecule of water may have to negotiate a tortuous zig-zag path,
hundreds of microns long, through the layers of protein and fat.
</P>
<P>
   A drug molecule has an even more problematic journey from the
surface of the skin to the blood vessels at the skin's base, which
can then ferry it off to the rest of the body.
</P>
<P>
   First, big molecules like insulin need not apply: passage
through the skin is for small molecules only. Because drug patches
cannot measure more than a few square inches, the drug has to be
powerful enough to work at very low concentrations in the body. And
the drug molecule needs to be comfortable in both oil and water, in
order to navigate the greasy stratum corneum and then penetrate the
watery layers of skin underneath and be absorbed into the
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also, unlike skin creams and ointments, patch drugs have to get
in and out of the skin without treating it; they cannot burn the
skin, be altered by the skin's enzymes or leave unsightly
footprints behind.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Urquhart, a California physician who was involved in
the development of the first skin patches, said that the asthma
drug albuterol was abruptly dropped from consideration as a patch
when a trial product covered patients with orange polka dots after
a few doses.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria for patches are so stringent that only a handful of
drugs meet them, including the hormones estrogen and testosterone,
the pain medication fentanyl, the blood pressure drug clonidine and
the heart drug nitroglycerine.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration inspects patch drugs even more
meticulously than oral drugs, said Dr. Donald Reitberg, vice
president of scientific affairs at Novartis Consumer Health Inc.,
which markets scopolamine and nicotine patches, because both the
drug molecule and the performance of the patch have to be evaluated
separately for safety and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But even when a patch comes out on the market, glitches can
remain. Skin irritation is a common side effect of all the patches,
and if a patch is replaced on irritated skin, which is more
permeable than normal skin, far too much drug may be absorbed, said
Dr. Richard Dalby, an associate professor at the University of
Maryland School of Pharmacy in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Young children have thin skin and may get too much drug from a
patch; the elderly have dry, less permeable skin and may get too
little. The body's normal variations in skin thickness can also be
a problem: while many patches work anywhere on the body, the
scopolamine patch will work only on the thin skin of the face or
the neck, and for cosmetic reasons, is usually hidden behind the
ear.
</P>
<P>
   One testosterone patch on the market also needs thin skin to
work, but is too big to fit behind the ear: uncomfortably enough,
the only patch of thin skin big enough to house it is on the
scrotum.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of biotechnology companies are devoting their energies to
figuring out new ways of delivering drugs, and many are trying some
high-tech ideas of how to make the stratum corneum yield to more
drug molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Pulses of ultrasound aimed at the skin can separate the cells of
the stratum corneum, creating tunnels through which big drug
molecules like insulin can easily pass. Drugs can also be pushed or
pulled through the skin with small electric currents.
</P>
<P>
   A new device under review by the FDA is even looking at the
process in reverse, applying an electric current to the skin in
order to check glucose levels in diabetics without requiring them
to stick themselves with needles many times a day.
</P>
<P>
   How practical these techniques will prove remains to be seen.
``My conclusion from having worked in this arena for 15 years and
thought about it for 15 subsequent years is that God didn't mean
for drugs to go through the skin,'' Urquhart said. ``The skin is
designed to keep stuff out.''

   Scientists have discovered a way to speed the healing of wounds
in mice, and the finding, they say, may eventually benefit humans.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anita B. Roberts and her colleagues at the National Cancer
Institute have found that in mice bred with a genetically
engineered mutation, incisions healed in two days, compared with
the five days for normal mice.
</P>
<P>
   A protein called Smad3 plays an important role in wound healing,
Roberts said. When she and her colleagues bred mice with the Smad3
gene ``knocked out,'' inhibiting the expression of the protein,
they expected the genetic mutation to cause wounds to heal more
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   But the absence of the protein, which is also present in humans,
caused the skin cells involved in wound healing to reproduce more
rapidly. ``Once you have a hole in your leg, you have to cover it
up with skin,'' explained Roberts. Wounds in the mutated mice form
a covering layer of skin faster, she said.
</P>
<P>
   If the loss of Smad3 accelerates the wound-healing process, why
wasn't the protein dropped during the course of evolution? Perhaps,
Roberts said, because it has a crucial function in other important
cellular processes. It will be a while before the discovery can be
applied in humans, Roberts said, ``but it offers a model.''
</P>
<P>
   If the expression of Smad3 could be inhibited in humans, she
suggested, doctors might be able to speed the recovery of patients
with wounds over large areas _ burn victims, for example _ or those
with chronic, nonhealing wounds. The study appears in next month's
issue of the journal Nature Cell Biology.

   Consequences: Ein Beer, Bitte, but Watch Out for Biters
</P>
<P>
   This just in, from the
Human-Bites-Are-More-Dangerous-Than-Dog-Bites Department: A
28-year-old man attending last year's Oktoberfest, Munich's
celebration of beer-drinking and frivolity, was dancing on a table
top when a woman he had never met came up behind him and sunk her
teeth into his leg. Calf-biters, it appears, are a local tradition
at the festival.
</P>
<P>
   The leg became infected, the man developed a high fever, and two
days later he turned up in a local emergency room, where Dr. Peter
Wienert treated him. ``It was a small wound, about five
centimeters,'' Wienert, who reported on the case in last week's
issue of the British medical journal The Lancet, said in a
telephone interview. ``It had a little bit of swelling but not too
much.'' The patient was given two antibiotics intravenously, but
when Wienert began to cut away the infected skin, he said, it
looked ``suspicious, like cooked flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious indeed. The beer-table dancer, it turned out, had
developed necrotizing fasciitis, a rare and potentially lethal
infection caused by the ``flesh-eating bacteria,'' a deadly strain
of Streptococcus A.
</P>
<P>
   Only two previous cases resulting from human bites had been
reported in the medical literature, said Dr. Andreas Sing, a
microbiologist at the Max Von Petenkofer Institute for Hygiene and
Medical Microbiology in Munich and a co-author of the report. One,
he said, involved a man who bit himself in the cheek; the other
involved a man who was bitten on the penis.
</P>
<P>
   The Munich dancer had a skin transplant and is doing fine. The
anonymous calf-biter, the doctors said, remains on the lam.

   AT RISK: Love Raw Sprouts? So Do Bacteria
</P>
<P>
   They are tasty in salads, and make a crunchy addition to a
turkey sandwich. But a new study suggests that the elderly, small
children and those with weak immune systems should steer clear of
raw sprouts, which are often contaminated with disease-causing
bacteria like E. coli, B. cereus and salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionists have long believed that alfalfa, mung bean, clover
and other sprouts are a healthy part of any diet. But seed sprouts
have been linked to outbreaks of salmonellosis and E. coli
infections in the United States, Canada, Japan and other countries,
University of Georgia researchers warned in a recent issue of the
journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Peter J. Taormina, said sprouts were
more vulnerable to the bacteria than other produce, because the
moisture and warm temperatures of the sprouting process provide
ideal conditions for the organisms to flourish. And although those
with fully developed immune systems can fight off infections, small
children, the elderly and people whose immune systems are
compromised are more susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   Taormina and his colleagues tested a number of methods for
treating seeds in an effort to curb bacterial growth, including
washing them in chlorine or alcohol solutions. Although the
treatments reduced the number of bacteria, Taormina said, they were
not totally effective.

   BEHAVIOR: Paths to a Higher Plane and Longer Life
</P>
<P>
   Attending religious services regularly may be as big a factor in
increasing longevity as refraining from smoking cigarettes, a
psychiatrist at Duke University has concluded after studying 4,000
North Carolina residents ages 64 and older over a six-year period.
</P>
<P>
   People who went to services each week, the researcher found,
were 46 percent less likely to have died during the study period.
And even when factors like health practices, physical condition and
demographics were taken into account, those who regularly attended
services were still 28 percent less likely to have died, a benefit
equal to that achieved by nonsmokers. Women, for reasons the
researchers were unable to explain, appeared to benefit even more
than men.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,177 participants who had died by 1992, 22.9 percent
attended church regularly, while 37.4 percent did not. ``Persons
attending religious services once a week or more at baseline were
physically and mentally healthier, had larger social support
networks and more confidants and lived healthier life styles,''
reported Dr. Harold Koenig, in the current issue of The Journal of
Gerontology.
</P>
<P>
   The study included about equal numbers of blacks and whites
living in one urban county and four rural counties. More than 95
percent were Christians identified with conservative Protestant
denominations. Although the demographics reflected the influence of
the Bible Belt, Koenig said the effect on the study's outcome was
minimal. The project, financed by the National Institutes of
Health, is the fourth major study in the last two years to find a
relationship between religious attendance and longevity.

`THE HOLOCAUST IN AMERICAN LIFE:' TAKING AIM AT THE SYMBOLISM OF
THE HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  (DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his vexing new book, ``The Holocaust in American Life,''
Peter Novick proposes to look at such questions as why has the
Holocaust ``come to loom so large'' in contemporary American
culture, what its cultural visibility says about American Jews and
American society at large and what consequences its heightened
place in our collective memory has on our thinking and our foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing such issues, Novick, the author of ``The
Resistance Versus Vichy: The Purge of Collaborators in Liberated
France'' and a founder of the University of Chicago's program in
Jewish studies, takes a willfully contrarian attitude toward the
Holocaust and those he dismissively refers to as ``Holocaust-memory
professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   He argues that there are no ``useful'' lessons to be drawn from
the Holocaust, and he suggests that the high level of Holocaust
awareness in American society stems in large measure from decisions
made by Jews who ``occupy strategic positions in the mass media'' _
remarks that echo assertions made by revisionist historians who
play down the Nazi crimes of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this book, Novick contests the view that the United
States should have done more during World War II to help the Jews,
arguing that such ``guilt talk'' has simply provided useful
leverage in persuading Americans that they have a continuing
obligation to support Israel. He argues that the question of Allied
bombing of the railway lines to the Nazi concentration camps ``can
be dismissed immediately,'' because ``massive experience'' taught
us that ``bombing rail lines was hardly ever effective,'' and adds
that there were ``dim practical possibilities'' for other rescue
attempts of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   As for the question of why the United States did not ease its
restrictive prewar immigration policy to allow more Jews sanctuary,
he writes that America was ``still not out of the Depression, with
unemployment still high'' and that ``anti-immigration sentiment was
so strong in Congress and among the general public that to open the
question for debate seemed likely to worsen rather than to ease
conditions; better to leave bad enough alone.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first 20 years or so after World War II, Novick
observes, the Holocaust was ``hardly talked about'': survivors were
encouraged not to look back but to look forward to building new
lives, and the upbeat, universalist Zeitgeist of those postwar
years made the Holocaust ``an inappropriate symbol of the
contemporary mood.'' In addition, he says, the Cold War _ which
taught that the Soviet Union, not Germany, was the new enemy, and
totalitarianism, not Nazism, the great evil _ made ``the Holocaust
the `wrong atrocity''' for purposes of galvanizing this new
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, all this began to change, as the Eichmann trial
raised consciousness of the Holocaust ``as an entity in its own
right, distinct from Nazi barbarism in general.'' The anxious
prelude to the Six-Day War of 1967 fed fears of a renewed Holocaust
among American Jews _ fears heightened further during the 1973 Yom
Kippur War, which left many with the image of an isolated and
vulnerable Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 1967, and particularly after 1973,'' Novick writes,
``much of the world came to see the Middle East conflict as
grounded in the Palestinian struggle to, belatedly, accomplish the
U.N.'s original intention. There were strong reasons for Jewish
organizations to ignore all this, however, and instead to conceive
of Israel's difficulties as stemming from the world's having
forgotten the Holocaust. The Holocaust framework allowed one to put
aside as irrelevant any legitimate grounds for criticizing Israel,
to avoid even considering the possibility that the rights and
wrongs were complex.''
</P>
<P>
   While concerns about Israel's security declined in the 1980s and
90s, Novick says, the Holocaust became more of a focal point for
American Jews during those same years because it ``offered a
substitute symbol of infinitely greater moral clarity'' than the
problematic Israeli-Palestinian conflict. At the same time, he
suggests, the rise of identity politics and the ``culture of
victimization'' made it acceptable, even fashionable, for American
Jews ``to embrace a victim identity based on the Holocaust.'' In
his view, the Holocaust became ``virtually the only common
denominator of American Jewish identity in the late 20th century''
as assimilation and intermarriage led to a thinning sense of Jewish
commitment among the young.
</P>
<P>
   It is Novick's startling contention that while ``there's nothing
wrong with the affirmative lessons the Washington Holocaust Museum
attempts to teach,'' such lessons ``seem, if not useless, hardly
necessary.'' He argues that the very extremity of the Holocaust and
``the extremity of the circumstances in which it unfolded''
seriously ``limit its capacity to provide lessons applicable in our
everyday world,'' adding that ``an unintended consequence of our
making the Holocaust our central symbol of atrocity'' may in fact
be a ``desensitization'' to other cases of mass death.
</P>
<P>
   In support of this theory, he notes that the Persian Gulf war
was motivated by geopolitical considerations, not moral outrage,
and that the 1994 Rwandan genocide elicited ``not the slightest
will in American political circles for any U.S. intervention.'' He
does not address the Kosovo crisis at all (though his book may have
well gone to press before NATO air strikes began).
</P>
<P>
   Although Novick has some useful things to say about the dangers
of dwelling in the memory of oppression, although he can be
eloquent on the sectarian use of the Holocaust as an easy moral
touchstone, such observations are completely overshadowed by this
volume's deliberate cynicism. Novick writes that survivors'
memories ``are not a very useful historical source.'' He glibly
tosses around phrases like ``the gold medal in the Victimization
Olympics'' and ``Jewish moral capital.'' He asserts that for Jewish
organizations intent on capturing the attention of a younger
generation, ``the Holocaust looked like the one item in stock with
consumer appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   This flippant tone reflects Novick's determination to not merely
demystify the Holocaust, but to diminish its place in the
collective imagination. While he argues that Hitler would triumph
if Jews were ``to tacitly endorse his definition'' of them ``as
despised pariahs by making the Holocaust the emblematic Jewish
experience,'' the words of the scholar Emil Fackenheim remain a
potent warning of the real dangers of forgetting the past: ``We are
commanded [to remember) the martyrs of the Holocaust, lest their
memory perish,'' he declared in 1967. ``We are forbidden . . . to
deny or despair of God . . . lest Judaism perish. . . . To abandon
any of these imperatives, in response to Hitler's victory at
Auschwitz, would be to hand him yet other, posthumous victories.''

EARLY SIGNS OF SICKNESS  
 NEW PLANET DISCOVERY  
 MIXED REVIEWS ON ECLIPSE

   When a person is coming down with the flu, the face often
provides signs of a fever well before other symptoms appear. But
can a sick plant have the equivalent of flushed cheeks? Belgian
researchers have discovered that it can.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers from the University of Ghent had previously
shown that tobacco plants infected with a virus or other pathogen
produce salicylic acid, and that the acid could raise the
temperature of a leaf, probably by closing pores, known as stomata,
that regulate the release of water.
</P>
<P>
   In their latest experiments, which they described in the journal
Nature Biotechnology, the researchers used a high-resolution
infrared camera to try to detect when a leaf that was infected with
tobacco mosaic virus was feverish.
</P>
<P>
   They found that temperatures were about half a degree Fahrenheit
higher at the sites of infection.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fever was detectable long before the appearance of
lesions or other visible signs of illness, the researchers suggest
their technique may eventually be useful in early diagnosis of
plant diseases.
</P>

<P>
   Another planet has been discovered orbiting a distant star, and
this one has the most Earth-like orbit of all.
</P>
<P>
   The planet, which was discovered by astronomers with the
European Southern Observatory, is orbiting the star Iota Horologii,
56 light-years from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Like the roughly 20 extrasolar planets reported previously, it
was not observed directly, but by measuring regular changes in the
movement of the star as it and the planet revolve around their
center of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   (Because the star is far more massive than the planet, the
perturbations are very slight, requiring lengthy and detailed
measurement.)
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers found that the planet rotates around Iota
Horologii once every 320 days in an elongated orbit that at its
closest approach to the star is about the distance of Venus to the
Sun, and at the farthest is about the same as the Earth-Sun
distance, 93 million miles.
</P>
<P>
   But like all the other known extrasolar planets, Iota Horlogii's
planet is far larger than Earth; it is more than twice as massive
as Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers note that there is additional variability in
their data that could be an indication of a second planet around
the star. Or the data could be the result of activity on the
surface of the star, which would occur if the star were relatively
young.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Although the modern-day Druids and other assorted pagans who
gathered in southwestern England for last Wednesday's solar eclipse
may have been disappointed when clouds largely obscured the view,
observers in many locations along the path of totality had better
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were good in parts of northeastern France and in the
Black Sea, where eclipse watchers on a special cruise got a much
better view than their counterparts in the German cities of Munich
and Stuttgart, which had poor weather.
</P>
<P>
   Further to the east, conditions improved, with clear skies in
Turkey, Iraq and Iran. But in India, near the eastern limit of the
eclipse, cloud cover made for an event that The Times of India said
was about as exciting as a damp firecracker.
</P>
<P>
   A group of faculty and students from Williams College that had
gone to Ramnicu-Valcea, Romania, where the duration of totality was
longest, reported great viewing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Among their experiments, the group took a rapid series of
photographs of the corona in hopes of finding evidence of magnetic
field fluctuations that could contribute to coronal heating.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sun was completely blocked for only 2 minutes and
23 seconds, the group reported that they got enough data to keep
them busy for years.

 &HT;    YELTSIN'S TOUGH-TALKING PM APPROVED BY DUMA, TURNS ATTENTION TO
DAGESTAN
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Former KGB spy and domestic security chief Vladimir
Putin became Russia's fifth prime minister in the past 18 months
after the Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house of parliament,
approved his nomination on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, 46, takes charge of the government as Russia struggles to
suppress an Islamic-inspired guerrilla war along its southern
border and to cope with a economic crisis that struck one year ago
Tuesday(Aug. 17) when the ruble plummeted in value.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's biggest challenge may be surviving in a
super-charged political environment that has prompted Yeltsin to
fire Putin's numerous predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Political survival was also on the minds of Russian lawmakers
Monday. Deferring its battle with the Kremlin to the upcoming
election season, the opposition-controlled parliament promptly
approved Yeltsin's choice to lead a new government -- and succeed
him as president. The vote was 233-84, just above the required
absolute majority of the 450 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin's appointment is not his fault, the real problem is the
country's constitution,'' which gives the president sweeping powers
to alter the government and dictate policy, said Nikolai
Kharitonov, the leader of the opposition Agrarian faction.
</P>
<P>
   Putin vowed to make few changes to Russia's economic-recovery
and foreign policies, but to do more to help the growing ranks of
the country's poor.
</P>
<P>
   When he begins his first official day on the job Tuesday,
however, Putin's most pressing problem will be the turbulent
southern Russian republic of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Yeltsin have vowed ``tough measures'' to restore
order to the province in the Caucasus Mountains, where Islamic
insurgents _ many of them fighters crossing the border from the
neighboring break-away republic of Chechnya _ launched a
significant challenge to Russian rule earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's territorial integrity is non-negotiable, nor will
Russia yield to blackmail,'' Putin said of the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   With Yeltsin's backing, he emphasized on Monday that the Kremlin
and its new government had no intention of stepping outside the
bounds of the constitution to deal with the conflict in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no state of emergency,'' Putin declared in his
remarks to the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's news media have speculated that Yeltsin may use the
disorder in Dagestan as a rationale for imposing a national state
of emergency. In turn, according to the speculation, the Kremlin
could use the state of emergency as a pretext to postpone the Dec.
19 parliamentary election and the presidential race in mid-2000,
when Yeltsin's current final term is scheduled to end.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a former Soviet-era spy and deputy mayor of St.
Petersburg, was appointed one week ago in what Yeltsin's critics
said had become an absurd routine: firing the government for no
apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   Putin replaced Sergei Stepashin, a former interior minister who
had served only 82 days.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The new prime minister required a simple majority of the
450-member Duma _ or 226 votes _ to win confirmation. Facing
re-election, legislators did not want to risk opposing Putin and
prompting Yeltsin to dissolve parliament and call early elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue reforms started by previous Cabinets, but the
reforms aren't a goal in themselves, they must improve peoples'
condition,'' said Putin, who Yeltsin also has designated as the
Kremlin-backed candidate to replace him as president though Putin
was unknown to most Russians before he was elevated last week..
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In Dagestan, Russia has launched intensive strikes in recent
days using warplanes, helicopter gunships and artillery in an
effort to push rebels from their positions in and around five
villages in the mountainous Dagestan republic. The conflict is
reminiscent of Russia's disastrous war against independence in
Chechnya from 1994 to 1996. Yeltsin subsequently called that war
the worst mistake of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Russian Interfax news agency, guerrilla
leader Shamil Basayev, a veteran of the war in Chechnya who now is
leading the fighting in Dagestan, vowed that his fighters would not
give up. The insurgents intend to turn the Russian republic into an
independent Islamic state. ``How it will be done _ by force or my
political methods _ depends entirely on Russia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claim to be making gains in the combat, but casualty
figures cannot be independently verified. A government spokesman in
Dagestan told reporters that federal forces had killed about 400
guerrillas since the fighting expanded on Aug. 7. A rebel statement
said 20 Russians had been killed in fighting over the past day.

ELVIS RETURNS, IN SPIRIT, TO THE HEART OF MEMPHIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Charcoal clouds, bloated with rain, groaned
past the top of the Memphis-Arkansas Bridge, round billows breaking
off to take the shape of Nixon's face, pale, rubbery and jowled,
thunder falling from the bottom of his mouth, more clouds oozing
across the sky to form the face of Elvis, soft and rumply, dark
eyes winking, black and purplish along the edges _ the same dark
purple as the velvet suit Presley wore to that onetime, forever-odd
meeting in the Oval Office in December of 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The faces stayed close for a few minutes, floating together,
then broke up as rain slashed against the windows of the Map Room,
a coffee house a couple of blocks up from the banks of the
Mississippi, where Vernon Chadwick was holding a copy of that photo
from the White House meeting, telling the small gathering that
nothing close to that moment will ever be seen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the docking of two spaceships ... a convulsive
beauty,'' said Chadwick, director of the Fifth Annual International
Conference on Elvis, titled ``Elvis in the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a poignancy to it _ two misfit Americans on the eve
of their destruction. Four years for Nixon, seven years for
Elvis.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1974 Nixon resigned as president of the United States
in the fallout of the Watergate scandal. Three years after that,
Presley died at the age of 42 in the upstairs bathroom at
Graceland.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick, 46, a former professor at the University of
Mississippi whose Institute for the Living South has presented
seminars on the Presley mystique for the past five years, said
Presley's death cut to the soul of America. While networks and
newspapers debated its importance _ only two networks went with
Presley's death as their top story _ the country's rank and file
called one another, sent cards to Graceland or made a pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80,000 people stood in the humidity of a Memphis
August to pay their respects at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks found that his death had wide interest and could
not be kept down by a snide remark from some pundit on NBC or
CBS,'' said Chadwick, adding that Presley's death offered ``the
first nationwide show of grief on the level of small floral
bouquets and hand-painted signs.'' That's become commonplace now,
said Chadwick, as more and more people ``attach themselves to the
tragedies of high-profile celebrities, attaching their emotions to
these larger emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Presley's death, President Jimmy Carter issued a
proclamation that said, in part, ``His music and personality,
fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues,
permanently changed the face of American popular culture.'' Presley
``was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality,
rebelliousness and good humor of his country.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick nodded. ``Rebelliousness and good humor,'' he said. ``I
think those are two aspects we can be proud of as Americans. Elvis
is pure American, and I think the world sees that. There may be
those who would like to think of America as being more privileged
... represented by a highly sophisticated figure like JFK Jr., but
I think Elvis is the embodiment of America, and the rest of the
world sees that.''
</P>
<P>
   JFK Jr. was seen as presidential material, but the American
people have been voting in other ways, casting their ballots for
the down-to-Earth image of Elvis. The Nixon-Presley photo is the
most-requested in the history of the Library of Congress. More
Americans voted on the issue of the young-old Elvis stamp in 1992
than voted in that year's presidential primaries. And Graceland
remains a close second behind the White House as the most-visited
residence in the United States, boasting more than 700,000 visitors
per year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week was the high-water mark for Graceland, which is doing
a brisk business in Elvis Week 1999 buttons and shirts that
proclaim Presley as ``Artist of the Century.'' Elsewhere around
Memphis, the 13th annual World Championship Impersonator Contest
was held at the Four Points Hotel, the P&AMP;H Cafe put on a Dead Elvis
Ball '99, and the newly refurbished Heartbreak Hotel _ offering a
heart-shaped swimming pool, the Burning Love honeymoon room and
jungle-room suites priced at $532 per night _ opened for business.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis has thrown itself behind the events of Elvis Week with
good reason, said Hal Lansky, whose family runs the Lansky Brothers
clothing company that outfitted Presley in his heyday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Elvis, there would be no tourism here, and that's the
truth,'' he said. ``Like I've said before, `Coming to Memphis
without going to Graceland is like going to Rome without seeing the
Vatican.'''

<P>
   Bernard Lansky, 72, remembers the first time he saw Presley,
pressing his face to the window of Lansky's store at the corner of
Second and Beale streets, back in the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was when he was working at Lowe's Theater _ used to be an
usher,'' said Lansky, leaning across the counter of his shop in the
Peabody Hotel. ``He'd take his coffee breaks and come by, look
through the window, just looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invited him in, and my first impression was, `Just another
dude.' But it wasn't long after that he told me, `Mr. Lansky,
someday I'll be rich enough I'm going to buy you out.' ... After he
got signed by Sam Phillips, I thought, `This young man is going to
be different than anybody else.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time he came through here with real money, he bought
up a bunch of shirts and pants _ $3.95, $4.95 for the shirts,
$6.95, $7.95 on the pants. Wasn't any time at all before I opened
up a charge account for him. Kind of taking a chance, you know, but
I kept my eyes on him and felt like, `This is my man.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We would fill up a truck with stuff for him and drive it out
to his place, and he'd take the whole truck, right now. Came out of
the Army, and he knew just what he wanted to be _ sharp. He wanted
to be sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we had before him, you know, was a black client. Then
when Elvis started coming in, it was word of mouth, word got out.
He was No. 1, belle-of-the-ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Lansky glanced toward a glass case holding a pink leather jacket
with a fur collar, once owned by Presley. ``He liked felt, velour _
wanted this Mafia look, you know? It was nothing for him to spend
$3,000, $4,000 in one visit.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Presley's mother, Gladys, died, it took something out
of the man, Lansky said. ``He never got over that. Mama was No. 1.
You lose the one you really love, and ...''
</P>
<P>
   Lansky shook his head, remembering the day Presley died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unreal,'' he said. ``But, you know, here today, gone
tomorrow. I still believe that, after he lost his mama, well,
everything just went haywire.''

</P>
<P>
   ``Elvis Presley's Memphis,'' a theme restaurant that took over
the building where Lansky's original store used to be, has become
part of the Graceland empire _ a cafe with Burgundy walls and
photos in one room, off-white Leatherette booths and a
black-and-white linoleum floor in another. A souvenir counter sells
everything from 39-cent postcards to $395 motorcycle jackets, while
the restaurant features Presley treats like a banana-meringue
pudding.
</P>
<P>
   East of Second Street, Beale spills down two blocks of cafes and
blues clubs, including the Center for Southern Folklore, where
Daddy Mack's Blues Band is playing. Just before the band took a
break, Charlie Musselwhite stepped up to do a couple of numbers,
off the cuff. ``I'm your .39 special, baby,'' he sang. ``Honey,
I'll be your bullets, too. ...''
</P>
<P>
   He stepped off the stage, saying, ``That was fun,'' and talked a
little about Elvis. ``Used to go to these parties he had at the old
Memphian movie house,'' said Musselwhite, 55, who knew some of
Presley's bodyguards. ``Double bills, and a whole bunch of
Roadrunner cartoons. He loved that Roadrunner. Go to a skating
rink, sometimes, party 'till 8 in the morning. All the pretty girls
would be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Musselwhite, who was born in Kosciusko, Miss., said, ``What
Elvis meant to guys like me, poor boys from Mississippi like us.
... He made us believe we had a chance, that we didn't have to
settle for whatever somebody would give us, anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe Presley died 22 years ago, said
Musselwhite. ``Seems just like four, five years ago. Everything's
so vivid.''

DAM BUILDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Why do beavers build dams?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Beavers make their complex domestic arrangements to improve
security from predators and to move and store a reliable food
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Dam building is only one of their construction activities, along
with canal building (to float back trees from a distance) and lodge
building, as The Encyclopedia of Mammals (Facts on File) points
out.
</P>
<P>
   The dammed-up ponds make an important contribution to the
beavers' well-being by creating storage at the right depth to stash
a winter's supply of bark, twigs, roots and leaves at temperatures
above freezing, but cool enough to keep their nutrient value
intact. The ponds also improve security and must be deep enough for
a family of beavers to swim under winter ice from their lodge to
the hidden food.
</P>
<P>
   The dams are constructed by moving mud, stones, sticks and
branches across a shallow stream. Beavers use their forepaws to
move mud and small stones from the stream bottom to the dam site.
Large sticks and branches are towed to the site with the beavers'
large incisors and are used to support the dam and keep the other
components in place.
</P>
<P>
   The females are the most active in dam building, though all
adults and yearlings may take part. Most construction takes place
at night, according to The Macmillan Illustrated Animal
Encyclopedia.

HARNESSING THE POWERFUL SECRETS OF A DOG'S NOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRONT ROYAL, Va. _ Abbey loved to play, so much so that her
distraught owner gave her to a dog pound. Who, after all, wanted a
Chesapeake Bay retriever whose notion of fun was chewing up the
curtains?
</P>
<P>
   The United States Customs Service did. It recruited Abbey, who
otherwise might have been destroyed, and taught her to sniff out
illegal drugs. During her three-year tenure at Miami International
Airport, Abbey _ or more accurately, Abbey's nose _ has been
responsible for more than 155 seizures of smuggled cocaine and
heroin, worth $25 million on the street.
</P>
<P>
   How dogs like Abbey can find anything in the confusion of an
airport terminal is explained not just by their keen sense of
smell, developed over thousands of years of hunting for food and
fleeing predators, but also by scientists' increasing understanding
of this olfactory ability, and the sophisticated training
techniques developed to exploit it.
</P>
<P>
   Customs trains its dogs to respond to a variety of odors, all of
them associated with a rolled towel saturated with the scent of a
pseudo-narcotic. ``In their mind, they're looking for the towel,''
said Tim Spittler, another canine enforcement officer. ``They don't
think they're looking for narcotics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service recruits about 1,000 dogs a year, 90 percent
of whom are plucked from animal shelters. Most are Labrador
retrievers, goldens and other breeds that are inclined to hunt and
fetch and are large enough to jump onto cargo and baggage
carousels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog that sits in front of the fireplace is a dog we can't
train,'' said Officer Spittler, who recruits from animal shelters
and kennels in Ohio and Michigan. ``We want the dog that wants to
play hide and seek.''
</P>
<P>
   The affability of the favored breeds, he said, makes them less
threatening to travelers. Customs rejects dogs that look aggressive
or are spooked by loud noises and sudden movements.
</P>
<P>
   At the Customs Canine Enforcement Training Center in Front
Royal, in the rolling foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, the
dogs undergo 12 weeks of repetitive training. The first two weeks
are largely spent playing with the rolled towel, as the dogs get to
know their handlers.
</P>
<P>
   The towel is then doused with a narcotic scent and hidden inside
junk cars or in suitcases rotating on a carousel. Whenever the dog
finds the towel, it is rewarded with lavish praise and a tug-of-war
that the handler deliberately loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the dog smells the odor, he thinks the towel is
here,'' said Carl A. Newcombe, the director of the training center.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can't make a dog smell,'' he added. ``You've got to
create the environment that makes the dog want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, dogs use their noses far more than humans. But how much
better is a dog's sense of smell?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows,'' said Dr. Lawrence J. Myers, an associate
professor of psychology and pharmacology at Auburn University's
College of Veterinary Medicine. ``It's going to be different for
different odors.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who has been investigating the sensory abilities of
detector dogs since 1982, is convinced their olfactory abilities
far outstrip those of their human counterparts. But are they
``twenty, a thousand or a million times better? I don't know,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When scientists dissected the nose of a German shepherd, Myers
said, they found 20 times as many olfactory receptor cells as in a
human nose. These complex sensory organs reside within mucous
membranes in the canine nasal cavity and are connected to the
brain's olfactory bulb.
</P>
<P>
   Sniffing, he said, increases sensitivity to an odor by widening
the dog's nostrils to pull in more air. ``A sniff straightens the
nasal cavity so the odorant hits straight to the olfactory
mucosa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Myers seemed more impressed by a dog's ability to sort out
scents. ``That discrimination capability has to be something
phenomenal, because they're doing this task around a lot of
contaminating odors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The customs training center teaches dogs to recognize heroin,
cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``If dogs are trained in all these odors, they can differentiate
between them,'' Newcombe said. ``The dog identifies the individual
odor. As long as the odor is present, the dog will be able to
respond to it.''
</P>
<P>
   They respond so well that the training center stopped using
detergent to wash the towels used by the dogs for fear they might
home in on the laundry of returning travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Some dogs specialize in detecting smuggled United States bank
notes by identifying the scent of currency paper and ink at amounts
of around $10,000. ``We're training the dog on various levels of
currency,'' Newcombe said, adding that the customs service uses
shredded money from the Mint in training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Other dogs learn to sniff out explosives and weapons for the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to train dogs to detect odors is really subject to
our own limitations,'' Officer Newcombe said. During a mission to
Saudi Arabia, he said, ``We trained a dog on explosives, weapons
and narcotics, and he did just fine.'' (Customs trains dogs for
about 30 countries, as well as for other government agencies in the
United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Dogs have uncovered new trends in smuggling like cocaine molded
into plastic machine parts from Argentina. And they continue to
expose older tricks. Officer Newcombe told of a customs dog in
Chicago that appeared to be obsessed with some imported concrete
statues. Inspectors took one statue to a hospital, where a CAT scan
found a lump of heroin inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The handler has got to believe what the dog is doing,''
Officer Newcombe said. ``He's got to trust it.'' Dr. Kenneth G.
Furton, the chairman of the chemistry department at Florida
International University in Miami and the director of the
International Forensic Research Institute, has found detector dogs
remarkably selective, even when smugglers try to mask a scent with
more pungent odors. ``If you put cocaine with coffee grounds,'' he
said, ``dogs will find the cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   The dogs, Furton explained, ``are not smelling cocaine, but the
odor of chemicals which dissipate from cocaine,'' notably
methylbenzoate, a tell-tale chemical emitted as cocaine breaks
down.
</P>
<P>
   In a study comparing the performances of dogs and electronic
drug detectors, Furton, the dogs, he said, beat the detectors
``hands down.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic detectors also are more prone to false alerts, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs and electronic detectors both identify cocaine's signature
odor, he said, but the dog processes it faster. ``Even though
computers are very sophisticated now, they're not as sophisticated
as a canine brain,'' Furton said.

 FRONT ROYAL, Va.: Furton said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Except for marijuana, the dogs do not train with real narcotics,
only with synthetic scents because of the dangers of heroin and
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they bite into that, it would kill them,'' said John H.
Krob, a course developer at the training center.
</P>
<P>
   Before a detector dog is certified for duty, it must identify
real heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine borrowed from the center's
locked vault.
</P>
<P>
   Some detector dogs are trained to be active, scratching and
biting at containers in the baggage tunnels. Others are passive,
sitting down and wagging their tails when a drug scent emanates
from a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service is working with its Australian counterpart
to develop a so-called ``super-sniffer'' though the dogs are being
bred more for physical dexterity than for increased olfactory
sensitivity. Last year, the Australian Customs Service sent a dozen
Labrador retrievers to be inseminated with sperm from Labradors at
Front Royal. The Australians worried about in-breeding because
their country's quarantine restrictions have limited its Labrador
gene pool. So far, two litters of super-sniffers have been been
born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Australian researchers at the University of Melbourne also found
that puppies raised in foster homes made far better detector dogs
than puppies raised in kennels, suggesting human companionship was
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough variability within a breed that makes it very
difficult to compare breeds,'' said Myers of Auburn. The best
sniffers he tested included English pointers, miniature poodles and
even mutts.
</P>
<P>
   But when he mentioned the poodle option to one law-enforcement
agency, Myers said, ``They looked at me and laughed.''

YELLOW JACKETS ARE THOSE PESKY, PROLIFIC ARCHITECTS OF AUGUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is late summer, which means it is time to grit one's teeth,
get outside for a little family picnic and practice that
ever-fashionable dance routine, the Yellow Jacket Jive. Herewith,
some tips from a mistress of the form (ahem):
</P>
<P>
   Partner A (half-inch, yellow-and-black striped insect): Approach
picnic table and land on sandwich wrapping. Partner B (human): Sit
bolt upright, eyes goggled, complexion fishbelly. A: Fly off
wrapping, head for can of cola in partner's hand. B: Jump to
standing position, spilling cola on shorts. A: Swoop toward
partner's face. B: Rotate arms wildly and squawk like Olive Oyl,
but with more expletives. A: Continue circling partner's face. Buzz
in left ear. B: Run inside and lock door. Stay there until the
first frost.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, August is official yellow jacket month, as a number of
entomologists have proclaimed on their Internet Web pages, and as
anybody within range of a public trash can will attest. This is the
season when the wretched little biblical plagues boil forth in
force, bobbing and weaving like drunken marionettes, poking in
fruit stands, crash-landing on soda cans, and haughtily, viciously,
perniciously stinging any human who dares to protest, you vile
little _ .
</P>
<P>
   I'm better now. Sure, I've been stung a couple of times by
yellow jackets, and, sure, both times I thought my leg had
spontaneously combusted, but it turns out that yellow jackets are
not the mean-spirited vermin their victims assume them to be. They
are not nasty for nastiness' sake. They are proactively defensive,
family-values types that struggle selflessly to support and defend
their kin. They may crave the same junk food we do, but they are
not base freeloaders, and sometimes will even pitch in by hunting
caterpillars, aphids, flies and other garden pests.
</P>
<P>
   And to the entomologists who are beginning to piece together a
portrait of their society, yellow jackets are fascinating insects,
with all the sophistication of behavior found in bees, ants and
other elaborately social insects.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow jackets are not preprogrammed automatons, but learn from
experience, including where and when to crash the best parties.
They can communicate with each other, conveying their intentions,
work assignments, the location of a hot new outdoor restaurant.
Exactly how they communicate, though _ whether through chemical
signals, touch, sound or a kinetic language like bee dancing _ is
not understood.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow jackets' cooperative talents are most evident in the
complexity of their nests, usually built underground or in wall
voids and thus not easily admired. But they are beautiful
creations, with thousands of cells assembled from masticated wood
pulp and leaf litter into a structure the shape of a hanging
Japanese paper lantern. As the colony grows, the yellow jackets
excavate the soil and expand the nest downward. If they encounter
rocks and pebbles too big to remove, they dig beneath them, causing
the rocks to drift down and form a kind of cobblestone floor at the
nest bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow jackets and their relatives, the paper wasps, are the
pinnacle of animal architects,'' said John W. Wenzel, associate
professor of entomology at the Ohio State University. ''They're
better at it than anyone else but humans, and they do it without
blueprints, without a foreman or an engineer. They create a
structure too vast for any individual worker to perceive, and yet
the whole thing fits together.'' Some are practically
indestructible. The nest of one type of paper wasp in South
America, Wenzel said, feels like a cage of tough felt, and is so
durable that specimens from the 1700s are still in good shape
today.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing thy enemy means knowing a little of its taxonomy, and
when it comes to identifying exactly what a yellow jacket is, most
people are understandably confused. Yellow jackets are in the same
insect order as ants and bees _ Hymenoptera _ and they are often
erroneously called bees, perhaps because the yellow jacket's
striped body looks like cartoon depictions of honeybees. In fact,
real honeybees often lack a distinctive banding pattern, and
instead are covered by a fuzzy coat of yellow or brownish hairs.
Yellow jackets are in no way fuzzy-wuzzy, though they, like bees,
are very buzzy.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow jackets are also waspish, literally speaking. They number
among the 900 or so species of the world's social wasps, Edith
Wharton wasps if you will, which means they live in a highly
cooperative and organized society consisting almost entirely of
females _ the queen and her sterile female workers.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow jacket wasps are closely related to, but distinct from,
another group of social wasps, the hornets; though to further
confound matters, one of the yellow jacket species native to North
America is known, misleadingly, as the bald-faced hornet. In fact,
the only true hornet on this continent is an introduced species,
the European hornet, which is chocolate-brown, as big as a thumb
and surprisingly mild-mannered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't come to get me when I dissect their nests,'' said
Wenzel, who studies wasp nests for a living. ``I had European
hornets in the wall of my house in Georgia, and they'd fly in and
out of a hole right above where I entertained guests. Nobody ever
got stung.'' Of course, Wenzel admitted, most of the guests were
entomologists. ``They're the only ones who are willing to sit there
with hornets flying overhead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow jackets, by contrast, sting readily when anybody goes
after their nests, which is why Wenzel has been stung at least a
thousand times. There are 15 species of yellow jacket in this
country, and all have the delightful ability to sting their
victims, not once, as a honeybee will, but multiple times. The
difference lies in the structure of the stinger. Whereas a honeybee
stinger is heavily barbed and stays where it is inserted, resulting
in the evisceration and death of the bee, the yellow jacket stinger
is comparatively smooth, and can be pulled out and reinserted as
its possessor sees fit.
</P>
<P>
   Another distinction between bees and yellow jackets lies in the
content of their venom. The main source of pain in honeybee venom
is a small peptide called mellitin, which disrupts cell membranes,
including of the skin's many nerve cells, which then scream
``danger!'' in the form of pain signals.
</P>
<P>
   In yellow jacket venom, the molecule that prompts a fiery
distress is a very different and even smaller peptide called kinin,
which mimics a compound indigenous to the body, bradykinin. This
mysterious compound helps to control heart rate, but will also
cause excruciating pain when released into the bloodstream, _ which
is why the yellow jacket toxin has evolved to imitate its
structure.
</P>
<P>
   As for which sting hurts the most, the answer cannot be
quantified. ``It's purely subjective,'' said Justin O. Schmidt, a
research entomologist at the United States Department of
Agriculture bee labs in Tucson, Ariz., who studies insect venom.
''I've talked to beekeepers who say bee stings are nothing, but
whoa, look out for the yellow jackets. Then there are the
scientists who work with yellow jackets, and they insist the
honeybee sting is really miserable. I personally consider them
about the same.'' He also recommends a similar treatment for both
stings: a cool poultice of salt or baking soda.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths from either bee or yellow jacket stings are fairly rare,
and usually result from a severe allergic reaction to ancillary
compounds in the venom rather than to the pain peptides themselves.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If yellow jackets seem more frankly aggressive than bees or
hornets, more apt to assault the innocent, they have reason for
their paranoia. They are the only wasps in North America that
produce large quantities of brood, and so a yellow jacket nest
offers an extraordinary nutritional jackpot, as much as two pounds
of protein, to potential predators like raccoons, skunks and bears.
Thus, they sting at the slightest sign of danger, though their
efforts may be in vain. Bears have been seen to continue raiding
nests even as they were being repeatedly attacked, and one
scientist said he found hundreds of consumed yellow jackets in the
belly of a raccoon he had shot.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow jackets also grow increasingly aggressive as summer turns
into fall, when they start running out of prey caterpillars or
maggots and must rely on scavenged goodies, which people amply if
unwillingly supply. Some yellow jacket species, particularly the
German yellow jacket, which was introduced onto this continent in
the 19th century and lately has spread throughout the country, are
pure scavengers to begin with, and so really like hanging around
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow jackets have a capacity to learn,'' Schmidt said.
``They learn not only where the places are that have good food,
like picnic tables, but they also learn what time the food will be
there. They won't be flying around the tables at 8 in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They pick up on our timetables,'' he said, and so will emerge
at lunchtime and scout a favored picnic area even when it is empty.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow jackets are hunting for two food sources: meat, to
feed the larvae back at the nest, and sweets, to give themselves
energy as they scavenge. The adults also get some sugar from their
young charges. Upon bringing back some masticated protein and
feeding these so-called meatballs to the larvae, the larvae
regurgitate sugar water that the adults then drink.
</P>
<P>
   The workers truly work themselves to death, with their tasks
changing as their lives progress, from safe to dangerous. Young
workers stay home tending the nest, feeding the larvae or building
new cells. Only as they approach the end of their 30-day life span
do workers assume treacherous foreign assignments like foraging.
Yellow jackets are also adept at switching roles when need be.
Workers operate by the clock: if somebody on the assembly line
fails to show up for duty, after a certain point the worker next in
line assumes her comrade is dead, and does the job herself.
</P>
<P>
   Even the queen is capable of getting down on her hands and knees
(and knees), and doing whatever needs doing. When a queen emerges
from hibernation in the spring, she must do everything herself:
find an abandoned rodent hole in which to start building a nest,
lay eggs and hunt for food to feed the first larvae. Only after she
has reared enough workers to take over the mundane housekeeping
chores does she retreat permanently into the nest and spend the
rest of the season laying eggs, as she alone is capable of doing.
By late summer or early fall, her colony may consist of several
thousand workers.
</P>
<P>
   As the weather cools, the queen starts generating eggs with a
new destiny before them: some will be born potential queens, and a
scattering of others will emerge as drones, males fit only to
inseminate those queens. The virgin queens and males fly up and
mate in an autumnal frenzy. Afterward, the males die, soon to be
followed by the queen mother and her workers.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the newly fertilized queens seek shelter for the
cold weather to come, and they have a genius for persistence.
Studying how yellow jackets survive the harshness of an Alaskan
winter, Brian M. Barnes, a professor of zoophysiology with the
Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska in
Fairbanks, and his students tracked yellow jackets in the field.
</P>
<P>
   They determined that a new queen will dig into leaf litter left
from the previous autumn. In that way, when the new leaves fall,
the queens are under a double layer of protection from cold and
moisture. As the snow falls, it covers the leaves, offering yet
another insulating blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the temperature within the leafy shelter, the
researchers found that it never fell below about 15 degrees
Fahrenheit, compared with an outside temperature of, say, 40 below.
They also learned that the queen was able to ``supercool'' herself,
her body tissues falling below freezing without forming deadly ice
crystals, partly the result of her being sheltered from any water
or ice particles that would set the crystallization process in
motion. She subsists in a state of cryogenic preservation, hanging
under the leaves, Barnes said, ``like a mummy.''
</P>
<P>
   It does not take much to arouse her, though. When the
researchers brought wintering queens into the lab and thawed them
out, the queens rapidly reanimated and, Barnes said, ``started
trying to sting us.''

<P>
   A giant robot spacecraft called Cassini is to streak past Earth
Tuesday night on its way to Saturn, culminating a circuitous,
two-year journey through the inner solar system designed to send it
on its way.
</P>
<P>
   This journey, which has already involved two trips around Venus
before the Earth swing, is like the extremely long windup of a
celestial baseball pitcher before throwing a curve ball 2 billion
miles.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft, powered by nuclear energy and condemned by some
environmentalists and antinuclear activists as a risk to the
public, is to zoom past Earth at 42,000 mph and use the planet's
gravity to hurl it off into deep space toward a rendezvous with
Saturn in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini is to make its closest approach to Earth at 11:28 p.m.
Eastern Daylight Time at an altitude of 725 miles over the eastern
South Pacific, a passage that may be visible from some of the small
islands in that area, such as Pitcairn Island.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasadena, Calif., guided Cassini through its last course
correction before the Earth encounter with a 130-second rocket
firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was perfect and we're exactly on the course we should be,''
said Robert T. Mitchell, program manager for Cassini.
</P>
<P>
   During the quick encounter, Cassini will use eight of its
arsenal of instruments for a quick study of Earth and the particles
trapped in the magnetic tail trailing the planet. Scientists will
use the opportunity to calibrate the instruments for accuracy while
scanning Earth, a well-understood target, and Cassini will take
pictures of the Moon, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The craft's sophisticated instruments make Cassini ``the
Lamborghini of spacecraft,'' but one ``worth every penny,'' said
Dr. Carolyn Porco, the leader of its camera team.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, calling the Earth flyby the most dangerous part of the
mission, have called for a halt to the maneuver and to the future
use of atomic-powered spacecraft. Tens of thousands of people could
be exposed to cancer-causing radioactive plutonium if something
goes wrong and the spacecraft plunges into the atmosphere and
burns, they say.
</P>
<P>
   NASA counters that its projections indicate the chance of such
an accident is less than one in one million and, if one did occur,
only a small fraction of the released plutonium would end up in
humans, adding a couple of hundred cancer deaths to the thousands
that normally occur worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spacecraft is performing exactly as we planned it and I'll
be pleased when we get back to seeing this as a mission of
discovery and not worrying about things that are not problems,''
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Najmedin Meshkati, an associate professor of civil and
environmental engineering at the University of Southern California,
criticized NASA's risk analysis for Cassini. He said the agency
looked at potential failures of spacecraft systems, but did not
give enough consideration to the substantial risk human error could
pose for the flyby, such as transmitting erroneous computer
commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also a moral argument,'' Meshkati said. ``Why should
all of the public accept the risk without being involved in the
decision to take it? There are many people in the world who get
nothing directly or indirectly from planetary exploration, yet they
are placed at risk for the benefit of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the gravity assists from Venus and Earth, and then one
from a flyby of Jupiter in December 2000, Cassini is to arrive in
the neighborhood of Saturn and its 18 known moons almost seven
years after its launching from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Then the
spacecraft is to spend at least four years cruising the Saturnian
system, turning its large array of instruments on the planet and
its rings and moons in the most extensive study so far.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the Saturn visit, Cassini is to send a probe named
Huygens into the smog-shrouded atmosphere of Titan, the planet's
largest moon, and parachute instruments to its hidden surface to
see if it holds oceans of ethane or other hydrocarbons over frozen
layers of methane or water.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft is named for the Italian-French astronomer
Jean-Dominique Cassini, who made several important discoveries
about Saturn in the 17th century, and the Titan probe is named in
honor of the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, who discovered
Titan in 1655.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassini project has been long, expensive and controversial.
Measuring 22 feet high by 13 feet wide and carrying 18 scientific
instruments, it is the last in a line of billion-dollar machines
designed to study planets comprehensively. Planning for the $3.4
billion mission began more than a dozen years ago, when the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration had the money and
inclination to build the best conceivable machines to explore the
solar system. Since then, faced with reduced budgets, NASA has been
building smaller, cheaper spacecraft, like the $250 million Mars
Pathfinder, with quicker, more limited scientific objectives.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassini project, almost canceled by Congress a decade ago
because of its cost, survived because of its heavy involvement with
the European Space Agency, the Italian Space Agency and scientists
in a dozen countries.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem for Cassini turned out to be its power
supply. Because Saturn's distance from the Sun reduces the
effectiveness of conventional electricity-producing solar panels,
NASA elected to power the spacecraft with nuclear-fueled electric
generators.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear batteries for Cassini and other craft are made with
nonweapons-grade plutonium 238 dioxide, which gives off heat from
its natural radioactive decay that is converted into electrical
power. Cassini carries 72 pounds of plutonium, divided among three
nuclear batteries. Cassini and Huygens also carry 117 tiny heater
units that regulate temperatures in the probes, with each unit
containing about 0.1 ounce of plutonium 238 encased in a metal
alloy.
</P>
<P>
   Plutonium is a highly toxic substance that can cause cancer if
inhaled or ingested in even minute amounts. To reduce the risk, the
Energy Department, which made the batteries, cast the plutonium in
ceramic form that is insoluble in water and hard to break into
pieces small enough to inhale. The agency also put the units in
impact-resistant cases that it said were designed to withstand a
rocket explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest risks to humans from Cassini's nuclear fuel were at
liftoff, during the secondary rocket firing that sent it away from
Earth, and during the return flyby. The first two events went off
with no problems, although hundreds of demonstrators protested at
the Kennedy Space Center before the Oct. 15, 1997, launching.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David H. Grinspoon, a planetary scientist with the Southwest
Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., said he is also a lifelong
environmentalist who is disturbed to see Cassini as a polarizing
issue. ``People who support space exploration and care for the
environment have many of the same values and goals,'' he said.
``Now they are standing on different sides trying to use statistics
to either maximize or minimize the risk of a possible accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Grinspoon suggested that NASA call a moratorium on future Earth
flybys with nuclear-powered spacecraft and be more open about
discussing potential risks in human terms instead of with
statistics. There would still be a launching risk in such missions,
he said, but engineers could design and test recoverable canisters
that could contain nuclear materials during a rocket explosion, and
present strong evidence to the public that they work.

Ordinarily they didn't lock the doors. It was that kind of a town,

purchase Washington-based Facilicom International. The move is a
giant leap for World Access toward its goal of becoming an
international carrier of data and voice. However, World Access has
no plans to abandon the equipment business on which it was founded.

   MEDAPHIS _ ATLANTA _ Struggling medical technology company
Medaphis Corp. (MEDA) will combine its operations with those of its
Per-Se Technologies Inc. subsidiary and adopt the Per-Se name,
executives said. The decision to link operations with the wholly
owned unit will benefit the Atlanta company by simplifying its
business and increasing its heft in the marketplace, said President
and Chief Executive Allen Ritchie. The move also will eliminate the
negative connotation still associated with the Medaphis name.

<P>
   COXNET PTECH 0817 _ It has been slow going, but Internet
companies are realizing that small business can mean big business
on the Web. A growing number of companies are developing new ways
to bring small businesses online, with small price tags to match.
(Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes 4-column color
photo of a taxi riding on the information highway.

<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY _ All electronic devices are born to die, but
there are some really easy things you can do to postpone that day.
(Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) Art includes 1 column color
sig of columnist.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS _ Web sites help people make plane
reservations, buy cars, order best sellers. Now a Web site is
putting the act of designing and ordering wedding announcements on
the Web. (Clothier, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) Art includes

   WITH: GADGETS _ If you've been wanting to enjoy the summer
months by bicycling along bike trails, but you're not sure you're
physically able to pedal long distances and up hills, you might
want to check out a bike with an electric motor. (Cummings, Dayton
Daily News) Art includes 18-pica color photo of motorized bike.

   END OF PAGE BUDGET LINES
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY_ Popular column about personal computing written for
the average user. This week: I had a sure way of knowing when it
was vacation time when I lived in Oregon. My best friends _ Marcus
and Betsy _ would start looking for the keys to their house.
Ordinarily they didn't lock the doors. It was that kind of a town,
a small place nestled in a little valley that ought to have been on
a postcard. It was if ``Leave It to Beaver'' were real. Folks
didn't need to lock their doors. The Internet used to be that way.
(Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-TOOLS _ Software reviews. This week: Gizmos 98 is another
one of those packages which, we are led to believe, contains all
the good stuff that Microsoft forgot to put into Windows. Well,
maybe. Depends upon what you want out of life, what you want out of
your computer, and whether you, like Play, Inc., which published
this program, are chiefly interested in graphics. But to take
Microsoft's view, you've got to stop somewhere. (Warner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 12. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ Unless you've been lost in the woods for the last
month or so, you'll know that the low-budget horror flick ``The
Blair Witch Project'' has virtually taken the country by storm. The
story of three college students, Heather, Mike and Josh, who head
into the Maryland wilderness in search of the legendary ``Blair
Witch.'' Even though they don't come back, they live on all over
the Web. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE _ If you've been on the Web any time at all, you've
sent and received an electronic greeting card. These cards started
out years ago as crude little images and some text, but nowadays,
you can send a card that includes music, animation or even a
photograph that you furnish. There are sites that charge for the
service, but there are so many free ones that we'll ignore the
``for pay'' sites today. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
MOVED
</P>
<P>
   TECH-MEDIA _ If you thought the leading maker of cellular
telephones was an American company such as Motorola, think again.
The leader in this category of technology is Nokia and, no, it's
not a Japanese company. Nokia is based in Helsinki, Finland. You
can learn all about this upstart leader in cellular technology in
the August issue of Wired magazine. Not only is Nokia leading in
the sale of phones but it is introducing wireless services such as
Internet access faster than American counterparts. (Haddad, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 12. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MAC-REPORT _ When it comes to speed and processing power,
Apple's laptops are the equal of any PC counterpart. But one
important area where PowerBooks have lagged behind is in size and
weight. (Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   TECH-REPORT _ Maybe all those hours glued to the computer
monitor are a good thing. A poll sponsored FamilyPC magazine, the
results of which are published in the September issue, asked 615
families about the effects PC use on their kids. Most polled, 68
percent, felt PC use made their kids smarter. But 13 percent said
they didn't think so. About 19 percent weren't sure. (Clothier,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   GADGET-COLUMN _ When it comes to figuring out ways to keep
things together, nobody takes a back seat to 3M, the Scotch tape
people. Among their newest wrinkles are removable adhesive pads for
hanging things on the wall and pop-up tape strips. (Cummings,
Dayton Daily News).

SHOW OF HITLER'S ART COLLECTION AND ART FROM POST-WAR COMMUNISM
ANGERS GERMANS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEIMAR, Germany _ Long kept from public view, more than 100
paintings collected by Hitler are on display here, offering an
intriguing glimpse of the art he believed should adorn the
1,000-year Reich planned by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The works _ paeans to the German warrior and hymns to an
idealized womanhood _ seem in many cases stunningly banal. The
Allied victory clearly saved Europe from drowning in a sea of
wooded German landscapes and mythologized German peasants
surrounded by fawning sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Banished without trace are the Expressionist angst, abstract
experiment and innovative Bauhaus functionalism that marked German
art in the first three decades of this century and found
particularly vibrant expression in this northeastern German town.
Hitler branded all such art decadent and banned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler's is by far the worst collection of paintings I have
ever put on show,'' said Achim Preiss, the curator. ``They are
really shockingly boring. But of the 120 works, perhaps 90 have not
been seen in Germany since 1945, and they are critical to our
understanding of Nazi rule.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 years after the fall of the Reich, Hitler's
paintings have generally aroused curiosity rather than anxiety.
Governed for the first time by a postwar generation, Germany
clearly feels ready to lift the veil from the past.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than laying the past to rest, the Weimar exhibition,
called ``Rise and Fall of the Modern,'' has suggested that German
history remains explosive and deeply divisive. Preiss' decision to
twin the Nazi art with the art of Germany's other modern
dictatorship _ that of Erich Honecker's Communist East German
government _ has aroused a storm of protest.
</P>
<P>
   The art is displayed in part of the Gauforum, a quadrangle of
buildings put up by the Nazis and later used by East Germany for
offices and a factory. Many easterners perceive a deliberate
provocation in the jumbled, tightly packed, helter-skelter way the
works of the Communist era have been installed, and in the decision
to juxtapose these idealized images with photographs of a dismal
Communist reality.
</P>
<P>
   The former East German Culture Minister, Klaus Hopcke, declared,
`` Preiss is a clueless idiot.'' Wolfgang Mattheuer, a painter from
the eastern town of Leipzig, called the exhibition ``an expression
of the West German victor's mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local critics even compared the presentation of Communist
art to Hitler's exhibition of ``decadent'' paintings in Munich in
1937, which included works by Otto Dix, Max Ernst and Ernst Ludwig
Kirchner. Several East German artists, including Neo Rauch and
Hans-Hendrik Grimmling, have withdrawn their work from the Weimar
show.
</P>
<P>
   The furor reflects the growing cultural tensions between east
and west 10 years after the fall of the Berlin wall. Far from
diminishing, as expected, friction has been aggravated by a broad
conviction in the eastern part of the country that its entire
postwar history has been dismissed as sad, grotesque or simply
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is an appalling presentation of an important
theme,'' said Friedrich Folger, the deputy mayor of Weimar, which
has been chosen as Europe's cultural capital for 1999. ``Preiss
came here from the West, from Cologne, and he does not understand
that good and bad alternated in East Germany. To place East German
art beside that of the Nazis is an outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Preiss said he had been stunned by the vitriolic reaction to his
ideas. In bringing the Nazi works out of storage _ many were in a
depot in Munich _ and in displaying East German paintings seldom
seen since 1989, he said, his goal was to throw light on two
dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted discussion, an airing of our cultural past,'' he
said. ``But in general I have been met with politically motivated
condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Preiss' catalog draws several parallels between Hitler's art and
that of the postwar Communists. ``The Soviet line,'' he writes,
``resulted in a reaction to American cultural hegemony and an art
which combined order and monumentality, forms of expression that
differed only slightly from those of the Third Reich.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly in their idealization of certain model citizens _ the
Nazi worker building the Fuehrer's autobahn system in Carl Theodor
Protzen's ``Roads of the Fuehrer'' (1940), or the socialist
hero-worker of Walter Womacka's ``When Communists Dream'' (1975) _
the artists appear to ply the same dismal trade.
</P>
<P>
   But the presentation does not make distinctions between the
scale of cultural repression or physical brutality in the Nazi and
Communist eras.
</P>
<P>
   Only the complete, numbing uniformity of the Nazi art, compared
with the greater variety and occasional defiance of the East German
paintings, conveys that dictatorships do come in shades.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nazi part of the show, there is no abstract work, and
there is nothing that does not slavishly serve the theme of the
heroism and power of a German Volk cleansed of its Jews, Gypsies,
leftists and other Untermenschen.
</P>
<P>
   After banning the works of such artists as Wassily Kandinsky,
Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger and Max Beckmann _ all of whom painted
in Weimar, where the Bauhaus was founded in 1919 _ Hitler set about
collecting paintings that would bolster the themes of the Reich.
Many were acquired at an annual art show in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler, an unsuccessful artist who in his youth twice failed to
obtain a place at Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts, did not have
sophisticated tastes. Female nudes play a prominent role, whether
in Johann Schult's pastoral ``Springtime of Life'' or in Sepp
Hilz's almost pornographic ``Eva,'' yet always a submissive one,
with their poses suggesting a charged association of power and sex
in the Nazi mind.
</P>
<P>
   In Arthur Kampf's ``Venus and Adonis,'' the sprawled figure of
Venus at the feet of Adonis with his spear invokes the pre-eminent
call of war, with the dedicated woman erotically drawn, despite
humiliation and even rejection, to the bold spirit of the male
warrior.
</P>
<P>
   The worker, a bulwark of National Socialism, is also a major
figure, uniformly muscular, dedicated, unstinting. The Nazi attempt
to glorify the common man put back to work by Hitler after the
hyperinflation and other economic difficulties of the Weimar
Republic is clear in Rudolf Werner's ``Asphalt workers'' and in
Waldemar Coste's ``Builders.''
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the hall where the Nazi paintings are shown, an
extraordinary collection of photographs of Nazi rallies in Weimar
has been assembled. It includes one of a fanatical crowd making the
Nazi salute next to the statue of Goethe and Schiller that still
stands outside the main theater today.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe and Schiller both lived in Weimar, and Hitler was drawn
to the town in part because he wanted to be associated with such
German genius. The Nazi exploitation of those high expressions of
German culture _ the people at the 1936 rally appear to be saluting
Goethe and Schiller _ reflects a crudeness of purpose evident in
many of the paintings.

   Only once does war intrude into the idealized world that Hitler
tried to preserve in the art he collected. In Karl Decker's ``In
France,'' painted in 1940, the ruins of Amiens, France, appear. But
the Gothic cathedral is presented intact, suggesting that Nazi
troops respected the Christian places of worship of their enemies.
The message is clear enough: even in war, the German soldier is no
savage.

   From the Nazi exhibition, a ramp leads to the East German
section of the show, where about 500 works by more than 200 artists
are on view. Some of the most interesting paintings, including the
dreamy works of Gerhard Altenbourg, appear at the beginning, before
the Communist propaganda machine moves into high gear. Abstract
paintings, newly acceptable in a state based on the abstract theory
of Communism, reappear but are quickly supplanted by monumental
expressions of worker heroism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In contrast to the Third Reich, the art of East Germany was
distant from the Volk,'' Preiss said. ``The ideological concept of
the people was more important than the people themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   To drive home that point, a wall opposite the propaganda-art
that once adorned the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin is
filled with photographs that convey a dull, weary battle for
survival in the Communist state.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings like Willi Sitte's ``Loving Couple in the Bathroom''
(1975), a bawdy scene of a soaking couple, suggest how
unchallenging the art of this period was, how little was
questioning or interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the so-called protest art of the 1980s, like the action
paintings of Else Gabriel, Rainer Goers and Micha Brendel, the
themes seem at least two decades behind the art of the West.
</P>
<P>
   To view such work in the town that was the first in Germany to
show the Impressionists in 1889, the first to mount a retrospective
of Gauguin in 1905, the home for many years to Klee and Feininger,
an inspiration on repeated visits to Edvard Munch, is to feel the
weight of dictatorial rule from 1933 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weimar is at once the promise of Germany and the betrayal of
that promise, the point of departure of the modern and a focus of
the suppression of the modern,'' said Sabine Walter, an expert on
Weimar art in the early part of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Preiss said he hoped the exhibition, which closes in November,
would provide a basis for a future Museum of the Dictatorships. But
to judge by the response to the show, memory and culture may still
be too divided in Germany to make such a project feasible.

<P>
   Every night at their telescopes, astronomers invite the universe
to a battle of wits. Surprise us, they say, with some teasing wink
of light, some few cryptic clues to something unfamiliar and,
better yet, an implied challenge to a cherished theory. In most
cases, astronomers boast, we will have it figured out by dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Now astronomers have an unyielding mystery on their hands,
something they have observed and pondered for three years, a point
of light deep in the northern sky that appears to be like nothing
seen before.
</P>
<P>
   This may turn out to be only a curiosity, an odd variation of a
familiar phenomenon, or it may be the first evidence of some
unsuspected object with reverberating theoretical implications.
Detecting planets around other stars is the most celebrated recent
discovery to challenge scientists, forcing them to rethink their
theories about the formation and dynamics of planetary systems and
take more seriously the possibility of life existing elsewhere in
the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery object has so far confounded astronomers because
they cannot decipher the language of its light. Usually, by
breaking down the spectrum of light into its component elements and
charting the spikes and dips on a graph, astronomers can identify
and describe an object within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, astronomers are finding nothing familiar
about the light spectrum, a couple of Everests representing
emissions from the object surrounded by lower peaks and broad
valleys of heavy elements that blot out the true contours of the
object's nature. They are beginning to sympathize with
archeologists who sought to read Egyptian hieroglyphics without the
Rosetta Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a spectrum anything like this, and I take
spectra for a living,'' said Dr. S. George Djorgovski, an
astronomer at the California Institute of Technology who is the
leader of the sky survey that detected the mystery object.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the astronomers are seeing, it is probably not a star,
at least not any normal star. The light signature of stars is much
simpler than this object's. Nor is it a distant galaxy, which would
have much different light patterns.
</P>
<P>
   With little evidence and even less conviction, some astronomers
speculate that the object is a quasar, one of the sources of
tremendous energies at the farthest reaches of the universe where
the enormous gravitational power of black holes presumably gobbles
up surrounding matter. If it is a quasar, it must be a rare kind
beyond current understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like a quasar to my eye, but I may be wrong,''
said Dr. Wallace Sargent, a Caltech astronomer and quasar
specialist, who is also director of Palomar Observatory in Southern
California, where the discovery was made.
</P>
<P>
   So if it is not a normal star, galaxy or strange quasar,
astronomers say, the most intriguing possibility is that the
mystery object is announcing the existence of an entirely new
cosmic phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we must do everything to rule out the known before we
postulate that we have discovered something really and truly new,''
Djorgovski said.
</P>
<P>
   Mystification is likely to be a more common experience in
astronomy as more powerful telescopes and instruments with improved
sensitivity are used for systematic probes deeper into the universe
and over broader stretches of sky.
</P>
<P>
   Several comprehensive sky surveys under way or just beginning
are expected to discover many rare or even previously unknown types
of astronomical objects and forces.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the entire northern sky in different color filters,
for example, the Digital Palomar Sky Survey, now nearing
completion, has collected data on more than 50 million galaxies and
about 2 billion stars. The census has identified more than 70
quasars at such great distances that they are being seen at a time
when the universe was less than 10 percent of its present age.
</P>
<P>
   One surprising discovery was a starlike light several hundred
times brighter than the galaxy with which it was associated.
Astronomers are not sure, but they suspect they were seeing the
aftereffects of a gamma-ray burst, the most powerful events in the
universe today.
</P>
<P>
   First detected in the 1960s, gamma-ray bursts are examples of an
astronomical mystery that is only now being solved.
</P>
<P>
   For the survey, astronomers devised computer programs to sift
through processed photographs for starlike objects, then
distinguish the stars from galaxies and isolate rare points of
light that are not immediately recognizable. This was how the new
mystery object showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Djorgovski and his team _ Dr. Stephen Odewahn, Dr. Robert
Brunner and Roy Gal, a graduate student _ examined the object's
light spectrum. Some of the lines of emissions, especially the two
Everest spikes, looked too sharp to be from a quasar. They combed
the star catalogs and published research papers, but found nothing
like it.
</P>
<P>
   A search in the archives of X-ray and infrared surveys failed to
show anything in those wavelengths at the location where the
object's visible light was detected. Radio antennas of the Very
Large Array in New Mexico scanned the same patch of sky. They
picked up only weak radio emissions from the region; many quasars
have proved to be ``radio loud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first one of something new, and a complete
mystery to us,'' Djorgovski said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By this time in most investigations of strange sightings, the
mystery would have been solved. In fact, it would probably have
been explained before the observing night was over. In several
decades of observations, Sargent recalled being stumped only once
by a strange spectrum, which turned out to be light from an
exploding star, a supernova, in the late stages of its evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't identify it for several hours,'' he said, ``and
that's a long time for unsolved mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step for Djorgovski's team was to photograph the object
again and again. Some aspects of the spectrum reminded them of a
supernova a few days after the explosion. But in the pictures, the
light from the object did not die down, as it would as a supernova
faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The light doesn't vary, doesn't move and doesn't erupt,''
Djorgovski said, reflecting the team's growing bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   Other examinations ruled out the possibility that the object was
an aging white dwarf star, where strong magnetic fields had
distorted normal spectral lines. Comparisons with all other
examples of peculiar stars also failed to suggest a solution.
</P>
<P>
   It is not even clear from the spectrum whether the object is
extremely far away or relatively close by. Distances are estimated
by the shift of light to the red end of the spectrum, a sign of the
object's velocity as it recedes from the observer in the expanding
universe.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Caltech astronomers started showing the
puzzling spectrum to quasar and stellar astronomers elsewhere. In a
presentation at the June meeting of the American Astronomical
Society in Chicago, Djorgovski issued a challenge to all colleagues
to help solve the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   When he first saw the spectrum, Dr. Richard L. White, an
astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore,
surmised that this could be a subspecies of quasars. One small
segment of the mystery object's spectrum looked a little like one
small segment of a spectrum from what astronomers know as
broad-absorptionline quasars. Some 10 percent of the known quasars
fall into this category.
</P>
<P>
   A spectrum of most quasars, White explained, is distinguished by
broad lines of the light emitted by gases, mainly hydrogen, moving
around the nucleus of the object. A small number of quasars,
though, produce a spectrum with broad absorption lines, which dip
low like the Dow Jones average on a bad week.
</P>
<P>
   These dips record the absorption of some of the object's emitted
light by intervening gases, hydrogen and sometimes heavy elements
like carbon, magnesium and iron. The mystery object's spectral
absorption line for iron was the one part that reminded White of a
broad-absorption quasar.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard George give a talk, I bet the object is a
broad-absorptionline quasar,'' he said. ``For all I know, it could
be something quite different. So much of the emitted light has been
chopped away and completely obscured by the absorption lines that
you can't recognize what it is you're seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Djorgovski said he tended to agree with White that the mystery
object was probably a rare kind of quasar. ``We may find it's a
sub-sub-subspecies of quasars for which there may be only one
example,'' he said. Or it could be something entirely new. ``We
can't think we have discovered all the kinds of things there are
out there,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of conducting wide surveys of the sky with new
telescopes is to make a census of the known universe, chart the
outlines of large-scale structure like superclusters of galaxies
and, through the sheer numbers of detected objects, discover new
and unexpected phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the first observations by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, an even more ambitious undertaking begun this year,
astronomers detected an entirely new category of dim, reddish
objects that scientists are calling ``methane brown dwarfs.'' These
are objects sometimes called failed stars, smaller than a star and
larger than a planet and, in this case, with atmospheres rich in
methane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the beginning of a lot of new surveys of the sky,
with more data about more objects going into the computers,'' White
said. ``It would be really shocking if we didn't find new, strange
objects.''

SCIENTIST AT WORK: NASA'S CAROLYN PORCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 (HLW)  
 By CAROLYN NIETHAMMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wind and sprinkles of rain greeted Carolyn Porco on Dec. 10,
1993, when she arrived at NASA's headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   She was there to make the case for sending a spacecraft to study
Saturn's mysterious ring systems and satellites, and her reception
was likely to be as discouraging as the weather. She was facing a
room full of science policy advisers with budget cutting on their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassini mission, an ambitious and costly effort, was
designed to find information about how the solar system was formed
and possibly provide clues to how life originated on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Even with two European space agencies participating, the price
tag would run into the billions. So eliminating Cassini was an
attractive option for the budget cutters.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Porco, a planetary scientist had worked on Voyager missions
to Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, was already known for her ability to
convey the excitement of space exploration in a vocabulary that
everyone could understand. Now her colleagues had chosen her to
make the case for Cassini to the members of the President's Office
of Science and Technology Policy.
</P>
<P>
   So Dr. Porco donned a suit instead of the T-shirt and jeans she
usually wears in her office at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory
at the University of Arizona and headed east.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassini mission had great potential to answer questions
about Saturn and other solar system puzzles. Among other things,
the spacecraft would carry two camera telescopes designed by the
14-member team she led, and she was eager for the data they would
begin sending back from Saturn on July 1, 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The school-bus-sized spacecraft would carry a complex set of
sophisticated instruments, she told the panel. It would be, as she
put it, ``the Lamborghini of spacecraft.'' But it would be ``worth
every penny.''
</P>
<P>
   Her enthusiasm and eloquence won the day. And today, as the
spacecraft approaches Earth on its circuitous route to Saturn, the
Cassini scientists were planning to check out the instruments they
will use at Saturn in a scientific encounter with their own planet.
</P>
<P>
   Among the things Dr. Porco and other researchers hope to learn
is how much _ and in what respects _ other planets in solar system
resemble Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are attempting to understand our own planet as one of a
family of planets all born of the same parent, of the same
material, at the same time,'' Dr. Porco said. ``We enhance our
chances of understanding what makes this complex system work by
having another example to study.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``Saturn's rings are the place in our solar system
where you can get the closest to observing processes that were
ongoing in the very early life of the solar system when the matter
that is now contained in planets was strewn out in a disk of dust
and gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Porco's love of science began in Pelham Bay in the Bronx,
N.Y., where she grew up and where her widowed father and one of her
four brothers still lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of subjectivity in the pursuit of truth is what
captured me,'' she recalled. ``What ends up being true is not the
opinion of some authority. Nature is the final arbiter. Even as a
child, I found that very appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Once during her years at Cardinal Spellman High School, her best
friend received a telescope for Christmas and they saw Saturn for
the first time from a Bronx back yard. ``What an intensely
thrilling moment,'' Dr. Porco said. ``My first cosmic connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Porco earned a bachelor's degree in physics and astronomy at
the State University of New York at Stony Brook and then enrolled
at the California Institute of Technology where she began working
with a team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. There, she joined
scientists analyzing the date from Voyager I, in particular,
information on the rings of Saturn. Once she earned her doctorate
in planetary sciences, she joined the University of Arizona, where
she was invited to be a member of the camera team for Voyager II,
which in 1986 investigated Uranus and in 1989 passed by Neptune and
established the presently accepted explanations for the
architecture of the rings around Uranus and Neptune.
</P>
<P>
   When the next big mission _ Cassini _ was being planned in 1990,
Dr. Porco knew she wanted to lead the camera team. ``I was in a
good position to know what work remained to be done in
understanding the Saturn system, and how to go about doing it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The choice was made by Dr. Wesley Huntress, then director of the
Solar System Exploration Division at NASA headquarters. ``The
essential choice was between a high rated proposal from a young
scientist with less experience,'' he recalled, speaking of Dr.
Porco's outline of what she would attempt to accomplish, ``and a
less well-rated proposal from a more mature and experienced
scientist. I chose the former.''

   RUSSIA-PUTIN _ MOSCOW _ The Russian Duma, the lower house of
Parliament, approved the appointment of President Boris Yeltsin's
latest prime minister, Vladimir Putin. The approval was expected,
as the Communist-controlled parliament sought not to make waves
ahead of this winter's elections. Meanwhile, a former Yeltsin prime
minister, Yvgeney Primakov, is expected to announce a political
alliance with Moscow Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov. Developing. (Holmes,

   GORE-REINVENTING _ WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore's project
to streamline and ``reinvent'' government cannot substantiate its
claims of $21 billion in savings, a new study said Monday. In some
cases, savings listed as ``achieved'' were not accomplished yet or
were double counted, said the General Accounting Office, the
nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress. (Malone, Cox News

   DAYTRADE-GA _ ATLANTA _ Georgia regulators did little to monitor
the day-trading industry _ until Mark Barton killed nine people at
two day-trading offices in Buckhead. Regulators in other states,
though, have raised significant questions about the fast-growing
industry. Massachusetts officials, for instance, have penalized
several firms, most notably All-Tech Investment Services, which was
barred from that state for practices that included encouraging
traders to borrow money from other traders to stay afloat.
Investigators now want to know whether Barton's shooting spree at
All-Tech's Atlanta branch and at Momentum Securities was in part
targeted toward fellow traders to whom he owed money. Why didn't
Georgia regulators look into the industry's business practices
before Barton's massacre? (Judd, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   OLYMPIC-BANDS _ ATLANTA _ Students from two metro Atlanta

   OHIO-TORT _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Ohio Supreme Court rules the state's
tort reform unconstitutional; it's been a case watched by both
sides across the nation. The state's law was considered the most
far reaching to limit the authority of the courts and everyone
wanted to see how the courts would treat it. (Wagner/Hershey,

   SAFESCHOOLS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Parents, how safe is your kids
school? To find out, the state has put together a checklist and
will teach school administrators how to audit their buildings for
safety issues. A statewide conference on school violence and safety
issues will be held Wednesday and Thursday in Columbus. We're
talking with Miami, Warren and valley sources participating. And
we'll tell parents how to use the audit checklist to find out how
their community schools are doing to improve safety for their kids.

UNDATED: the former.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, at age 37, Dr. Porco began working with her team to build
the most sophisticated camera system ever sent into space. She was
delighted to be, as she put it, ``responsible for the big
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be the lead explorer, to be the captain standing on the
bridge peering out the window,'' she said, ``therein lies the
romance and the seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next seven years, the scientists proposed questions and
designed systems to answer them and the engineers built the
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   But in July 1997, just months before the October launch, word
began to spread that the Cassini spacecraft would be powered by
plutonium. When the spacecraft was launched, it would not go
directly to Saturn, but would take a circuitous path, bringing it
by Earth in August 1999. Anti-nuclear groups said they feared
radiation contamination in the event of a malfunction, and the
issue began to cause alarm in Congress and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials again turned to Dr. Porco, asking her to go to
Washington to speak to the House Sub-Committee on Space and
Aeronautics. Donning her suit again, she explained why the craft
had to use nuclear, not solar, power _ it needed a lot of energy to
support its many instruments, and would be too far to draw it from
the sun. She told them that more than 50 scientists, engineers and
risk analysts had reviewed safety issues and asserted that even in
the unlikely event of an accident, an individual would receive less
radiation than that from a single dental X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   Then she turned to the op-ed pages and the talk-show circuit
with the same message.
</P>
<P>
   There is one problem Dr. Porco has been unable to eliminate,
though it is one she does not bring up unless pressed: ``the
ostracism, and even hostility, directed at women'' in science.
Though it is no longer overt, she said, it grows with seniority.
``As long as women don't stray from subordinate, supportive
positions, they pose no threat,'' she said. ``But women leaders are
not enthusiastically accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Porco explored this issue in an unusual forum when she
served as an adviser to the producers of the movie ``Contact,'' in
which the actress Jodie Foster plays a scientist searching for
extra-terrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Porco remembered clearly the first script she saw and the
changes she suggested. ``Young, newly arrived female graduate
students don't immediately fall into bed with their thesis
advisers, which is what the original Contact script called for,''
she said. ``The essence of the `Contact' story was that of a woman,
driven to seek the truth against all odds, who makes the most
important discovery in the history of humankind and desperately
tried to retain credit for it and to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``in the end, the way Jodie Foster played the part
was brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Dr. Porco would not want to be an astronaut herself,
she said she understood the desires of those who do. Her professor
at Cal Tech, the geologist Eugene M. Shoemaker, who demonstrated
the role of collisions and impacts in sculpting the solar system,
had dreamed of being an astronaut. Shoemaker died in a car crash in
1997, and when Dr. Porco learned he was to be cremated, she thought
of sending some of his ashes to the moon on the Lunar Prospector.
She called his family and space program officials including Dr.
Huntress, then a NASA administrator, who had the clout to get it
done.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Porco designed an epigraph to honor Shoemaker's scientific
legacy, and had it inscribed on a small piece of brass foil. Last
month, 30 years after man first set foot on the Moon, Shoemaker's
ashes became the first human remains to be interred there.
</P>
<P>
   When the president of the Navajo Tribe complained publicly that
the ashes would defile the moon, Dr. Porco said she was
``completely broadsided.'' But she unabashed. ``The last time I
looked there is a separation of church and state in this country,''
she said. ``Exploration of the moon is a secular activity and
religious notions should not be imposed on it. Other religions have
been able to accommodate scientific progress, and I hope that
somehow the Navajos will be able to modify their beliefs, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Porco, who lives alone in the Tucson foothills, said she has
little time for outside activities. ``There are absolutely no
high-maintenance items in my house of any kind,'' she said,
``plants, pets or husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are lots of Beatles memorabilia. ``When I was 11, I
thought that one day I'd have four boys and I'd name them John,
Paul, George and Ringo,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last two years, she has spent the month of June
hiking in England's Lake District. ``This is probably the only
planet I'm ever going to get to examine closely,'' she said, ``and
I want to have the opportunity to feel connected with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cassini is years from reaching Saturn, Dr. Porco is
leading a small NASA advisory group studying future missions to the
outer solar system. ``The hottest one is a mission to hover above
the rings of Saturn and make time-lapse movies of the ring
particles as they orbit and interact with one another,'' she said.
``It promises to give valuable insights into how small icy
particles, like the ones comprising Saturn's rings, eventually
coagulated and formed larger bodies which eventually formed
planets.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Porco paused and looked out her large office window, past
the swaying palms, to the range of mountains at the edge of the
Tucson valley, and the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exploration of our solar system is to me the grandest of
human endeavors,'' she said. ``It is the signature enterprise of
our time and I swell with pride to be a part of it.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sultry air will stream back into the Northeast on Tuesday as
high pressure circulates sticky air from the southwest into the
region. Sun will yield to increasing clouds in New England as a
cold front approaches in the afternoon. A few thundershowers will
develop in the St. Lawrence Valley and move into New Hampshire and
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Sea breezes combined with a weak disturbance at 20,000 feet
along the Southeast Coast will promote thundershowers from the
South Carolina shoreline to Florida. Cumulus clouds will flourish
over the interior Southeast, but very warm air aloft will limit
their growth.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave will continue over the southern Plains as high
pressure settles across northeast Texas. A weakening disturbance
migrating into the lower Rio Grande Valley will promote some
thunderstorms. Hot weather will build into the central Plains,
though a stream of humid air from the monsoon circulation over the
Southwest may trigger a few storms in Kansas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler air will seep southward into the upper Great Lakes with
considerable clouds and patches of showers. Afternoon
thundershowers will form over the higher terrain of northern
Arizona, southern Utah and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure in Idaho will keep much of the Northwest bright
and very warm. Isolated thunderstorms will grow over the northern
Sierra and central Cascades as filaments of moisture stream inland
from the Pacific. Patches of low clouds will envelope the coastal
valleys of central California.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: First Signs
</P>
<P>
   Beneath a clear sky and a calm wind, pre-dawn temperatures fell
into the 30s on Monday in portions of northern Pennsylvania and
western New York. While such readings are considered cool for
August, it is not unusual for the first signs of the pending Autumn
to appear around this time of year. Since early July, much of North
America has gained over an hour of darkness. The shortening days
combined with the diminishing intensity of the sun, sets the stage
for chilly air masses to grow over northern latitudes. Over the
weekend, a cold front crossed the Northeast, leaving chilly air in
its wake.

CLINTON URGES WAR VETERANS TO LOBBY CONGRESS ON PEACE INITIATIVES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Standing before the nation's war veterans,
President Clinton called on Congress to finance his international
peace initiatives and to retain diplomacy as the nation's first
line of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at the 100th anniversary of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars, where about 7,500 of the 30,000 VFW conventioneers
filled a huge hall and provided a warm welcome to the president
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underfunding our arsenal of peace is as risky as underfunding
our arsenal for war,'' Clinton told the veterans and their
families, encouraging them to lobby Congress. ``For if we continue
to underfund diplomacy, we will end up overusing our military.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress, now on recess, has trimmed $2 billion from the $14
billion requested by Clinton for foreign operations. Clinton
complained the funding cuts are part of a trend that began in 1985
and have ``real consequences'' for U.S. interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The president cited a range of programs, from helping Russia
deactivate nuclear warheads to financial assistance in the Middle
East and aid in Africa, that could help insure peace for the 21st
century but remain shortchanged by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the funding for foreign operations amounts to less
than 1 percent of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costliest peace is far cheaper than the cheapest war.
Every since I became president, I've been trying hard to convince
Congress of that basic truth. It has been a considerable
challenge,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the Balkans where the United States already has
been involved in military operations in Bosnia and military attacks
in Kosovo. He said the United States should now do its part to join
with Europe in rebuilding the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to succeed in winning the peace, we may see a 21st
century _ I'll say it again _ in which we do not have to send the
young people of America to fight in another European war. That is a
worthy objective,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Congress to provide a funding increase to provide work
programs for Russian scientists. The administration fears Russia's
weapons scientists, now earning little as Russia's economy
stagnates, will be lured by other nations to construct nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton requested $4.5 billion over five years to bolster the
Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative, which funds the deactivation
and storage of nuclear weapons in Russia, the Ukraine and former
Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative also supports civilian research opportunities for
40,000 former Soviet scientists, tightens export controls to
prevent countries such as Iran from gaining nuclear technology, and
eliminates chemical and biological weapons. Congress rejected
Clinton's request and opted for a $307 billion cut in the programs.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Congress to fully funding the Wye River Memorandum,
which would provide some economic incentives to the Palestinians
and security programs for the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to see it become a place of peace. If it
becomes again a place of war, it will cost us far more than
investing in a common, shared, peaceful future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had requested $1.9 billion over three years, but
Congress provided only economic aid to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also had requested $818 million in development
assistance and economic funds to Africa, pointing to recent
cease-fire efforts in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra
Leone as opportunities for peace. Congress cut the request.
</P>
<P>
   He also urged Congress to fully fund the back dues payments owed
by the United States to the United Nations. The Senate has passed a
measure to pay the bulk of the overdue bill, withheld as the United
States insisted on more efficiency from the U.N., but still
underfunds the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton requested $446 million to complete the payoff of the
$1.06 billion debt. Congress, however, proposed $351 million,
leaving a $95 million shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is this: today we have a unique opportunity,
and a real responsibility, to advance the values in the world won
in the 20th century. But if we only have one arrow in our quiver,
our military, we sacrifice the work of peace and increase the risk
of war,'' Clinton said.

FOREIGN BANKS MAY BENEFIT FROM STALEMATE IN FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The shareholders may have voted, but the
five-month takeover battle between three of France's biggest banks
barely paused Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of shareholder votes that left none of the
three banks a clear winner, the fight shifted to the halls of
government and to attempts to change the minds of key institutional
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Banque Nationale de Paris, which won enough shareholder votes to
take over Paribas SA but not Societe Generale, vowed to acquire all
the shares in the second bank _ about 31.5 percent of the total _
that shareholders had agreed to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Societe Generale, which lost its rival bid to acquire Paribas,
is now hoping that French banking regulators will block its rival
and help it stay independent.
</P>
<P>
   But the real winners may turn out to be foreign banks. Many
analysts said the messy shareholder verdicts mean that Societe
Generale is now essentially up for sale or at least in the market
for a ``white knight.''
</P>
<P>
   That opens to the door to foreign banks, because most industry
executives say there are no other logical merger partners in France
beside Banque Nationale de Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of both Banque Nationale and Societe Generale invoked
the possibility of foreign alliances Monday as they raced to
strengthen support from government leaders and institutional
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Bouton, chief executive of Societe Generale, strongly
suggested in an interview published Monday the French newspaper Le
Monde that his bank needed foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the future, we've got to think about combinations and
industrial agreements that enable us to become a European player,''
Bouton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``European banking is at the boiling point, and major players
will be created within the next five years. The Germans, Italians,
Spanish, Dutch and the French are still too nationally oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, supporters of Banque Nationale argued Monday that
Societe Generale will inevitably be a foreign takeover target if
tries to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view, Societe Generale is in a certain sense
on the block,'' said David Dautresme, a managing director at Lazard
Freres &AMP; Cie., which is advising Banque Nationale. ``It is also
clear that you have in France no other bank that could take over
Societe Generale. Nobody in France could do the same thing as
BNP.''
</P>
<P>
   A solid majority of Paribas shareholders voted to sell their
shares to Banque Nationale and not to Societe Generale. But Banque
Nationale received only 31.5 percent of votes in its simultaneous
bid for Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders reacted sourly Monday to news of the votes, which
became public on Saturday. Shares in Banque Nationale de Paris
dropped 2.6 percent to 73.45 euros, while shares in Societe
Generale slipped about 1 percent and those of Paribas declined 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate outcome is far from decided and turns on two
key issues.
</P>
<P>
   The first is whether French banking regulators, led by the
French central bank, will allow Banque Nationale to actually
acquire the shares it was offered in its rival. If it does allow
that, Banque Nationale might well have enough leverage to muscle
through a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The second issue, closely related, is whether Banque Nationale
can persuade many of Societe Generale's core institutional
investors to defect.
</P>
<P>
   The list of core investors includes Alcatel Alsthom SA; the
carmaker Peugeot; Pernod Ricard, the French drinks company; and
insurers like Meiji Life of Japan, Assurances Generales de France
and CLU PLC of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the core investors own more than 17 percent of Societe
Generale's stock and there is nothing that prohibits them from
switching sides.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, French regulators quietly set the stage for a new
attempt at a negotiated compromise. The bank supervisory committee
that must decide on whether Banque Nationale can acquire a minority
stake in Societe Generale let it be known that it will not make a
final decision until next week. The committee had previously been
expected to decide on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts are convinced that at least some of Societe
Generale's core shareholders will defect, which would give Banque
Nationale a stronger case with the bank supervisors as well as with
Bouton himself.

U.S. AND JAPAN AGREE TO WORK ON MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan and the United States agreed Monday to conduct
joint research on a missile defense system that in theory could
destroy incoming ballistic missiles like the one North Korea is
threatening to launch as a test against the wishes of both the
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura and the U.S. ambassador to
Japan, Thomas Foley, signed an agreement that calls for the two
countries to combine their technological know-how to improve the
basic capabilities of a so-called theater missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The system is intended to protect the United States and its
allies against incoming missiles flying within a 1,860-mile radius.
It uses satellites to detect enemy rockets and to intercept
missiles and destroy them before they reach their targets,
officials of both governments said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials declined to disclose the exact cost of the
research effort, but they did not contradict local news reports
that put the figure at between $400 million and $524 million, which
would be split equally between the two countries over five to six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the timing of the announcement was related to reports
that North Korea is close to a test of a long-range ballistic
missile, a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry said, ``It would
be difficult to say that this agreement has no relation to the very
tense situation that is unfolding with North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Japan was thrown into a panic after North Korea
launched a medium-range Taepodong missile, which flew over the
Japanese mainland and into the Pacific Ocean. The communist country
is now poised to test an improved version of Taepodong that is
designed for greater accuracy and range.
</P>
<P>
   But the Foreign Ministry spokesman said the results of the joint
research effort and possible deployment of a working theater
missile defense system are years _ if not decades _ away. ``We
expect this joint effort to yield something fruitful and improve
our capability,'' he said, ``but we cannot discuss issues of
deployment as we are still in the very early stages.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the United States has been trying to persuade Japan
to take part in the development of a missile defense system, but
Tokyo declined, citing the unproven technology and high cost.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Japan did not wish to offend China and Russia. Those
countries have opposed the development of antimissile shields,
which they cannot afford to develop and which they fear will give
the United States and its allies a strategic advantage _ if they
work.
</P>
<P>
   Some military experts see the agreement between Japan and the
United States as the beginning of the spread of international
missile defense efforts that could threaten to undermine current
nonproliferation and arms-control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has expressed an interest in acquiring antimissile
defenses from the United States, and some promoters of the missile
defense system envision it as one day being extended over much of
the Pacific, providing protection to United States allies and
countries willing to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why the administration of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
decided to oblige the United States is uncertain. But clearly there
is much political utility in signing on to the research project at
a time when the Japanese have been clamoring for their government
to increase its military defenses, especially in the wake of North
Korea's missile tests.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, Japan's part in the development of a
missile defense system provides the overall effort with vital
financing, technological prestige and an international face that
increases the likelihood of continued support at home.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Having a technological giant like Japan involved makes the
project more convincing to the American people,'' said a government
researcher in military technology. ``It will be difficult to
terminate the program, no matter how unpromising it is, if other
countries have committed so much money to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of missile defense systems maintain that they are
technologically unfeasible and will not function in real combat
situations, although there has been limited success with such
systems in early simulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technologically it can't work, and it has been proved to be a
failure,'' the researcher said. ``The reason is that if your
opponent launches one missile, the system can destroy it, but only
one missile. What happens if you launch 10 or 20 missiles?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement signed Monday, Japan and the United States
will focus on improving four major components of the missile
defense system: sensor, advanced kinetic warhead, second stage
propulsion, and lightweight nose cone. The missile theater defense
will be based on the Aegis radar system used by the navies of both
countries.

<P>
   FRONT ROYAL, Va. _ Abbey loved to play, so much so that her
distraught owner gave her to a dog pound. Who, after all, wanted a
Chesapeake Bay retriever whose notion of fun was chewing up the
curtains?
</P>
<P>
   The United States Customs Service did. It recruited Abbey, who
otherwise might have been destroyed, and taught her to sniff out
illegal drugs. During her three-year tenure at Miami International
Airport, Abbey _ or more accurately, Abbey's nose _ has been
responsible for more than 155 seizures of smuggled cocaine and
heroin, worth $25 million on the street.
</P>
<P>
   How dogs like Abbey can find anything in the confusion of an
airport terminal is explained not just by their keen sense of
smell, developed over thousands of years of hunting for food and
fleeing predators, but also by scientists' increasing understanding
of this olfactory ability, and the sophisticated training
techniques developed to exploit it.
</P>
<P>
   Customs trains its dogs to respond to a variety of odors, all of
them associated with a rolled towel saturated with the scent of a
pseudo-narcotic. ``In their mind, they're looking for the towel,''
said Tim Spittler, another canine enforcement officer. ``They don't
think they're looking for narcotics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service recruits about 1,000 dogs a year, 90 percent
of whom are plucked from animal shelters. Most are Labrador
retrievers, goldens and other breeds that are inclined to hunt and
fetch and are large enough to jump onto cargo and baggage
carousels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog that sits in front of the fireplace is a dog we can't
train,'' said Officer Spittler, who recruits from animal shelters
and kennels in Ohio and Michigan. ``We want the dog that wants to
play hide and seek.''
</P>
<P>
   The affability of the favored breeds, he said, makes them less
threatening to travelers. Customs rejects dogs that look aggressive
or are spooked by loud noises and sudden movements.
</P>
<P>
   At the Customs Canine Enforcement Training Center in Front
Royal, in the rolling foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, the
dogs undergo 12 weeks of repetitive training. The first two weeks
are largely spent playing with the rolled towel, as the dogs get to
know their handlers.
</P>
<P>
   The towel is then doused with a narcotic scent and hidden inside
junk cars or in suitcases rotating on a carousel. Whenever the dog
finds the towel, it is rewarded with lavish praise and a tug-of-war
that the handler deliberately loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the dog smells the odor, he thinks the towel is
here,'' said Carl A. Newcombe, the director of the training center.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can't make a dog smell,'' he added. ``You've got to
create the environment that makes the dog want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, dogs use their noses far more than humans. But how much
better is a dog's sense of smell?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows,'' said Dr. Lawrence J. Myers, an associate
professor of psychology and pharmacology at Auburn University's
College of Veterinary Medicine. ``It's going to be different for
different odors.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who has been investigating the sensory abilities of
detector dogs since 1982, is convinced their olfactory abilities
far outstrip those of their human counterparts. But are they
``twenty, a thousand or a million times better? I don't know,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When scientists dissected the nose of a German shepherd, Myers
said, they found 20 times as many olfactory receptor cells as in a
human nose. These complex sensory organs reside within mucous
membranes in the canine nasal cavity and are connected to the
brain's olfactory bulb.
</P>
<P>
   Sniffing, he said, increases sensitivity to an odor by widening
the dog's nostrils to pull in more air. ``A sniff straightens the
nasal cavity so the odorant hits straight to the olfactory
mucosa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Myers seemed more impressed by a dog's ability to sort out
scents. ``That discrimination capability has to be something
phenomenal, because they're doing this task around a lot of
contaminating odors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The customs training center teaches dogs to recognize heroin,
cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``If dogs are trained in all these odors, they can differentiate
between them,'' Newcombe said. ``The dog identifies the individual
odor. As long as the odor is present, the dog will be able to
respond to it.''
</P>
<P>
   They respond so well that the training center stopped using
detergent to wash the towels used by the dogs for fear they might
home in on the laundry of returning travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Some dogs specialize in detecting smuggled United States bank
notes by identifying the scent of currency paper and ink at amounts
of around $10,000. ``We're training the dog on various levels of
currency,'' Newcombe said, adding that the customs service uses
shredded money from the Mint in training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Other dogs learn to sniff out explosives and weapons for the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to train dogs to detect odors is really subject to
our own limitations,'' Officer Newcombe said. During a mission to
Saudi Arabia, he said, ``We trained a dog on explosives, weapons
and narcotics, and he did just fine.'' (Customs trains dogs for
about 30 countries, as well as for other government agencies in the
United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Dogs have uncovered new trends in smuggling like cocaine molded
into plastic machine parts from Argentina. And they continue to
expose older tricks. Officer Newcombe told of a customs dog in
Chicago that appeared to be obsessed with some imported concrete
statues. Inspectors took one statue to a hospital, where a CAT scan
found a lump of heroin inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The handler has got to believe what the dog is doing,''
Officer Newcombe said. ``He's got to trust it.'' Dr. Kenneth G.
Furton, the chairman of the chemistry department at Florida
International University in Miami and the director of the
International Forensic Research Institute, has found detector dogs
remarkably selective, even when smugglers try to mask a scent with
more pungent odors. ``If you put cocaine with coffee grounds,'' he
said, ``dogs will find the cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   The dogs, Furton explained, ``are not smelling cocaine, but the
odor of chemicals which dissipate from cocaine,'' notably
methylbenzoate, a tell-tale chemical emitted as cocaine breaks
down.
</P>
<P>
   In a study comparing the performances of dogs and electronic
drug detectors, Furton, the dogs, he said, beat the detectors
``hands down.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic detectors also are more prone to false alerts, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs and electronic detectors both identify cocaine's signature
odor, he said, but the dog processes it faster. ``Even though
computers are very sophisticated now, they're not as sophisticated
as a canine brain,'' Furton said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Except for marijuana, the dogs do not train with real narcotics,
only with synthetic scents because of the dangers of heroin and
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they bite into that, it would kill them,'' said John H.
Krob, a course developer at the training center.
</P>
<P>
   Before a detector dog is certified for duty, it must identify
real heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine borrowed from the center's
locked vault.
</P>
<P>
   Some detector dogs are trained to be active, scratching and
biting at containers in the baggage tunnels. Others are passive,
sitting down and wagging their tails when a drug scent emanates
from a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service is working with its Australian counterpart
to develop a so-called ``super-sniffer'' though the dogs are being
bred more for physical dexterity than for increased olfactory
sensitivity. Last year, the Australian Customs Service sent a dozen
Labrador retrievers to be inseminated with sperm from Labradors at
Front Royal. The Australians worried about in-breeding because
their country's quarantine restrictions have limited its Labrador
gene pool. So far, two litters of super-sniffers have been been
born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Australian researchers at the University of Melbourne also found
that puppies raised in foster homes made far better detector dogs
than puppies raised in kennels, suggesting human companionship was
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough variability within a breed that makes it very
difficult to compare breeds,'' said Myers of Auburn. The best
sniffers he tested included English pointers, miniature poodles and
even mutts.
</P>
<P>
   But when he mentioned the poodle option to one law-enforcement
agency, Myers said, ``They looked at me and laughed.''

FROM DANCE FLEDGLINGS, AN IDEAL OF AFRICA AND FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., N.J.)   (af)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``We have begun our rehearsals for the Jacob's Pillow
Dance Festival,'' the message announced solemnly on the telephone
answering machine of the Batoto Yetu dance company. And, indeed, an
intense rehearsal was in progress one recent afternoon a few blocks
north of the African dance company's headquarters in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in T-shirts, baggy pants and mammoth track shoes, the
dancers negotiated swirling patterns with surprising grace, only
occasionally sneaking a side glance at the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody can do steps but not everybody can dance,'' Julio
Leitao, the choreographer and founder of Batoto Yetu (Our Children
in Swahili), called out. ``Make your body dance. Make it sing.''
</P>
<P>
   The dancers and drummers began again, clearly anxious to get
everything right for one of the most important engagements in the
troupe's life. Then one performer began to giggle, followed by
others, over a problem with a huge horned animal mask. And the
hard-working dancers became the children who they are.
</P>
<P>
   The ages of the 40 dancers and drummers who will perform this
week at the august Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass.,
range from 6 to 18. Though they rehearse with adult concentration,
what they perform has been created for them rather than for
undersize grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn from Leitao's experiences with his own and other African
cultures and with professional dance, the work is also a
fulfillment of his childlike dream of dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am from one of the richest areas of Angola culturally,''
Leitao said. ``There was always something happening, some drumming
and music, and stories were constantly told. My mother, who is from
the Luba tribe in Zaire, talked of her culture. As a child, I
wanted to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Leitao said he had felt unwanted in Portugal, where he fled with
his family from war-torn Angola in 1975. ``It's a small country.
And we had brown skin. We survived by recreating our culture. It
became very important to us. But at the same time on television we
saw people of the same color as us being respected.''
</P>
<P>
   After training in dance at the Conservatorio Nacional de Danca
de Lisboa, Leitao was hired to perform on a television show, where
he met Debbie Allen. ``If I come to New York, I will be as
respected,'' he told himself. At 19 he left Lisbon for New York and
training at the Dance Theater of Harlem and with the teachers
Maggie Black and Bessie Schonberg. He performed with the Eglevsky
and Princeton Ballets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I realized dance was not a dream anymore,'' Leitao said.
``It was 9 to 5. I didn't feel the joy I had felt dancing. So many
hours at the barre for so few moments of joy. And I felt
choreographers didn't give dancers respect. I felt that dance was
too important to me to kill it inside me.''
</P>
<P>
   He began teaching at the National Black Theater in Manhattan,
which led to giving free classes to poor children. Batoto Yetu,
founded in 1990, grew out of those classes. The students, who are
now asked to pay $35 a year, were soon performing in galas and on
television.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few requirements for membership in the company is
good grades in school. There are no auditions. ``The only thing I
am interested to know is that they will be consistent,'' Leitao
said. ``I do believe if you can walk you can dance. If you can talk
you can sing. When you learn to shift your weight then you learn
about structure and form and then you put the melody in your
body.'' And learning to dance and to perform choreography is
useful, he believes, in learning how to live.
</P>
<P>
   Counting and talking about the rhythmic beats in dance phrases,
he said, has helped children he teaches at the George Washington
School, a public school in Hillside, N.J., to think in mathematical
terms: ``Spacing helps them with fractions. There is a lot of
information passed on within a dance class. If you fall down, what
do you do? Do you stay down or stand up and go?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance makes you feel good and express yourself. And I think
something positive in life makes other things positive. If you can
accomplish a step then you can accomplish a performance in the same
way you accomplish things in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Today there is also a Batoto Yetu school in Oeiras, Portugal.
Fifteen of the Pillow dancers are from that school. The Pillow
season, which runs through Sunday, is the company's first
theatrical engagement. Leitao has told the dancers that this is the
oldest festival in America ``and probably in all of dance.'' ``They
will learn more about it when they get there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Tolbert, a lanky 16-year-old whose entire body dances when
he moves, describes the festival as ``one of the biggest places we
can perform at, where all the world-famous dancers have
performed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've reached the top, but Jacob's Pillow can take us
further,'' Tolbert said. ``We've got to do our best. We
(italics)have(end italics) to have it right. This is a big
opportunity for us. Julio doesn't want to hear any excuses. We
don't either.''
</P>
<P>
   Ella Baff, director of the Pillow, first saw Batoto Yetu in a
benefit for the company. ``They blew the roof off,'' she said.
``People tend not to take a children's company very seriously. But
these children work so hard. They are very serious about what they
do. Children can be very serious. And this is a real show.''
</P>
<P>
   The program will feature ``The Mukishi,'' a suite of dances
drawn, like the traditional music that accompanies the piece, from
Angola, Zambia, Mozambique and Congo. One soft, plaintive song,
from Cape Verde, is sung in Portuguese Creole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the songs from Cape Verde are about missing your
country,'' Leitao said. ``It's a poor land, so people immigrate and
their songs are always melancholy.''
</P>
<P>
   The title of the piece refers to spirits who appear at crucial
times in a village's history and whom Leitao sees as a metaphor for
the African spirit. Tolbert has come to cherish myths like these,
as well as Leitao's folk tales and discussions about the importance
of animals' spirits in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares about antelopes in New York?'' the dancer asked
rhetorically. ``Africa's a beautiful place. It's nice. Africa is
basically who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Batoto Yetu has been in existence long enough now to have become
a family tradition of sorts. The mothers help make costumes. Older
children help the younger ones. Young musicians slip behind the
drums to play whenever the older musicians give them a chance. And
the troupe is full of sisters and brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nelson looked close to tears at the rehearsal when he
was yanked to the sidelines by his older sister, Malissa. At 5 he
is too young to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Lara, the mother of another company dancer, Nina
Lara-Daniels, sat nearby with her daughter, who is 9 and just
joined the troupe. Ms. Lara learned of the Batoto Yetu from her
sister-in-law, who performed with it.
</P>
<P>
   Does Ms. Lara envision her 2-month-old daughter, Adia, the
subject of much attention from the youngest girls in the company,
dancing with the company someday? ``Oh, absolutely,'' she said,
laughing. ``I was just telling Julio that she's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lara-Daniels is a little nervous about the Pillow
performances. ``But I try not to look at the audience,'' she said.
``I usually look up when I'm dancing.'' What is the most important
thing about performing? ``That's a toughie,'' she said. ``Remember
your steps?''

TIPPECANOE AND TRIVIA, TOO: C-SPAN'S HAIL TO THE CHIEFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a trip into the South after he assumed the presidency, George
Washington traveled through the countryside by coach. But on
entering a new town, he would switch to horseback and make his
entrance in a manner befitting a military victor: on a gallant
white charger. Or so viewers of C-Span have learned on ``American
Presidents: Life Portraits,'' that network's easygoing series about
all 41 of them, which began in March with George Washington of
Mount Vernon, Va., and is set to continue into December, when it
concludes with Bill Clinton of Hot Springs, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Presidents'' spends quite a bit of time where
presidents were born and lived as well in libraries and other sites
now attached to their memories. You get a look at Thomas
Jefferson's Monticello, Andrew Jackson's Hermitage and the
battlefield at Tippecanoe in Indiana, where William Henry Harrison
did the feats that carried him to the White House. The Polk
Ancestral Home, in Columbia, Tenn. (No. 11), naturally precedes the
Zachary Taylor National Cemetery in Louisville, Ky. (No. 12).
</P>
<P>
   Each program is a combination history, travelogue and tourist
guide, mostly on the light side. To photographs of Mount Vernon,
for example, a specialist points out where Washington shaved and
dressed and read books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington loved to read,'' we are informed, although John
Adams called him ``old mutton head.'' (David McCullough, who is
writing a biography of John Adams, discourses appreciatively on the
second president from the splendid Adams family library in Quincy,
Mass.)
</P>
<P>
   We are told, too, during the Washington hours (which set a
record for the series by running from 8 p.m. to 8 the next
morning), about the churches Washington attended and the colleges
he did not attend, his relationship with Martha and how he grew
rich on land speculation. Along the way it is revealed that
contrary to his image, he had a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   To an associate who remarked, on seeing Washington step back
from a roaring fireplace, that ``it behooves a general to take
fire,'' the general replied, ``It is worse for a general to take it
in the rear.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidents are treated in order; this week it is Benjamin
Harrison. Each Friday evening the week's segments are stitched
together for several hours of viewing and taping.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a project, in accord with conscientious C-Span's
mandate and in celebration of this cable network's 20th birthday.
Although the programs, mostly orchestrated by the no-nonsense Brian
Lamb and relying on generally uncharismatic biographers, curators
and guides, do not make for unbearably stimulating television, they
are stuffed with information.
</P>
<P>
   And to judge from the appreciative comments of callers, they are
satisfying an audience bent on edification, with future prospects
for generations of teachers and pupils. The callers, divided
between people who want to know more about the president under
scrutiny or just want to show off what they already know, are quite
sane by cable standards. In Washington's case, particular interest
and some indignation was evinced at his role of slave master, and
there was criticism of Lincoln for his cavalier way with civil
liberties during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The attention to the tourist spots associated with America's
most eminent sons at times gives ``American Presidents'' the flavor
of a packaged slide show. New Yorkers will recognize the Federal
Hall National Historic Site from the years when their city served
as the nation's capital. And there is Fraunces Tavern, now a
museum, where Gen. Washington bade an affectionate farewell to his
comrades when he set off for grander things.
</P>
<P>
   Absorbing so many bits and pieces of information for several
hours at a stretch over so many evenings and weeks can be wearying.
Even in my modest sampling, I found myself drifting off now and
then.
</P>
<P>
   But there is plenty here to stir flagging attentions. Viewers
whose hold on history is a touch shaky, for example, can get a
quick lesson in how Lincoln got to be our first Republican
president and why Andrew Johnson was named vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The series comes full circle on Dec. 18, when it carries a
re-enactment of Washington's funeral at Mount Vernon, step by
ultimate step. The portrait displayed of several members of his
original cabinet, including Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, may
cause some viewers to reflect that subsequent Administrations have
not invariably lived up to those of the founders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Grover Cleveland (Caldwell, N.J.), not the nation's
sorriest leader, was celebrated last week, and with the likes of
Theodore Roosevelt (Oyster Bay, N.Y.), Woodrow Wilson (Staunton,
Va.) and Franklin D. Roosevelt (Hyde Park, N.Y.) still ahead, all
is not lost.

 &HT;    Braves have quiet insurance with WilliamsBy Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Denver _ Gerald Williams always has been a private person, and
not just with his Braves teammates, coaches and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is the same way with his mother, the person he calls
his inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   One year when he was playing for the Yankees, Dorothy Williams
called her son, the ninth of her 13 children, to ask about his
shoulder injury. Gerald was shocked. He had made a point not to
tell her about his injury, for fear she'd worry. He asked her how
she found out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Gammons,'' she said, the ESPN baseball reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Williams didn't even know that her son always had
dreamed of playing for the Yankees until the organization drafted
him from Grambling State in the 14th round of the 1987 draft.
</P>
<P>
   So it's little wonder that when Williams was feeling depressed
on June 9, Braves hitting coach Don Baylor might have been the only
one who really knew how much.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had collected four hits the night before in his start
against Tampa Bay, but he was out of the lineup the following day.
Never in his seven-year big league career has Williams been a
regular: He didn't consider himself one when he played 155 games
for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Ryan Rupe was pitching for the Devil Rays on June
9, and that meant the other member of the Braves left-field
platoon, left-handed hitting Ryan Klesko, would start.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams was upset, however, his teammates didn't see it. He
made sure his disappointment stayed inside the indoor batting cage
in Turner Field. Williams prides himself in being positive. Baylor
said Williams has one of the best attitudes of any player he has
been around.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comes from my mother,'' Williams said. ``It's not the
situation you're in, it's the approach. It's your attitude that
allows you to have a certain amount of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he and the Braves are successful.
</P>
<P>
   Ten games ago, with Walt Weiss slumping and the Braves desperate
to get something going at the top of the order, manager Bobby Cox
turned to Williams to hit leadoff on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Since that move, the Braves are 8-2. Williams has reached base
in nine of those games. He has scored nine runs, driven in 12 and
batted .319. He has homered twice, doubled twice and stolen three
bases. He has sparked the Braves' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Williams says his performance is a product of playing time and
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach has to be the same,'' Williams said. ``I can't
control the hits. I can't control my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   His daily routine never changes, even if he's not in the
starting lineup. He takes batting practice, shags fly balls, does
agility drills in the outfield and works with Baylor in the indoor
cages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to set up in the bathroom on the road, we would,''
Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams might be one of the only reserve players in baseball
who battled blisters from taking so much extra batting practice.
And that was his only reason for skipping a day of extra work with
Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My mother) taught me (that) if you want something you've got
to put in the work,'' Williams said. ``You have to trust what
you're doing. Things will eventually turn to your favor. They have
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who grew up near New Orleans, in LaPlace, La., saw the
hard effort and preparation of his mother, who had to go to work
when she and Williams' father separated. She has held jobs ranging
from hotel maid to personal financial adviser, and she still likes
to do some design and sales work on the side, despite Gerald's
pleas that she take it easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always taught my children (that) nothing that's worth
anything comes easy,'' Dorothy Williams said. ``When (Gerald) was a
kid, if he had a chore to do, he'd always do it early. He'd rather
be ahead of the game. He's one of the neatest guys I've ever seen.
. . . He's the most patient guy I know. I don't know where he gets
it. I don't know many people who would have endured what he's
endured.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers a friend of Gerald asking him if, given the chance
for more playing time but for less money, would he do it. Before
the friend could finish the question, Gerald said, ``I'll take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has this commitment,'' Dorothy Williams said. ``He loves to
play. That's when he's satisfied.''

 &HT;    Securities regulators took wait-and-see action prior to
shootings
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Massachusetts, ads that seemed to promise more than
they could deliver caused state regulators to crack down on day
trading.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, it took a mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   State securities regulators here are investigating whether
business practices in the day trading industry contributed to Mark
O. Barton's July 29 shooting rampage, which left nine people dead
in two brokerages where the disgruntled trader had lost as much as
$450,000.
</P>
<P>
   But until Barton's killing spree, the worst in the state's
history, Georgia regulators did not follow the lead of their
counterparts in Massachusetts and elsewhere by examining the
fast-growing, high-stakes realm of day trading, even though
sanctions had been imposed against both companies which operated
the Atlanta branch offices where Barton traded and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Cathy Cox, who oversees securities
regulation, said her office had received no complaints about the
six day-trading firms operating in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia officials ``were beginning to have some concerns'' about
the firms before Barton killed fellow traders and employees at
All-Tech Investment Group Inc. and Momentum Securities Inc., Cox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Cox said Monday, the agency was waiting for the
North American Securities Administrators Association to complete a
study of day trading, in which a relatively small number of people
make thousands of quick-draw stock transactions daily. The
association ultimately blasted the industry for misleading
marketing, lax supervision of traders and questionable lending
among traders _ issues that police think may have helped incite
Barton.
</P>
<P>
   The association's report, though, was issued Aug. 9 _ a week and
a half after Barton's murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than reinvent the wheel,'' Cox said, ``we wanted to
wait until the study was completed. . . . We were waiting on the
study to give us some good ground work to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Other regulators weren't waiting, however.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the
industry's self-regulatory arm, fined Momentum $7,500 for failing
to ensure that securities laws were being followed by traders.
</P>
<P>
   And in May, in the largest case to date involving a day-trading
firm, Massachusetts fined All-Tech $50,000 and barred it from doing
business there for two years for using deceptive marketing,
transferring money from profitable clients to cover losses by
others, and encouraging traders to illegally handle investments for
others. All-Tech blamed its problems in Boston on a ``rogue''
branch manager.
</P>
<P>
   The case was one of six that the Massachusetts Securities
Division has filed against day-trading firms in the past 10 months.
All stemmed from regulators' concerns about the companies'
advertising, not from clients' complaints, said Matthew Nestor, the
division's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to indicate they somehow had some magic formula
guaranteed to change people's lives and create wealth,'' when in
fact most traders lose money, Nestor said. ``We've seen that as a
pervasive problem throughout the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   After Massachusetts began investigating day trading, he said,
Indiana, Texas and Wisconsin followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were certainly sharing information with a number of
states,'' Nestor said. But he declined to comment on whether
Georgia officials should have inquired about his agency's cases.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Terry, director of Georgia's securities and business
regulation division, acknowledged a ``learning curve'' in keeping
up with the rapidly changing industry, and Cox said new rules may
be needed.
</P>
<P>
   But both said Georgia had no reason to take action based on the
enforcement cases in other states that preceded Barton's rampages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we try to monitor what things are going on in other
states,'' Cox said. ``But every state every day is taking some
enforcement action. The fact that one state went after one branch
office of a firm would not trigger us to look at the exact same
thing in our state.''

 &HT;    GADGETS: Sticky solutions to fix what's broken
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ You hang pictures on a wall; you glue broken
handles on coffee cups; you fasten a collar around the dog's neck;
you stretch plastic wrap around leftover veggies.
</P>
<P>
   Your life is full of attempts to get one thing to stay on, near
or around something else.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to figuring out ways to keep things together,
nobody takes a back seat to 3M, the Scotch tape people. Among their
newest wrinkles are removable adhesive pads for hanging things on
the wall and pop-up tape strips.
</P>
<P>
   Command adhesive from 3M comes in little rectangular pads that
adhere to most flat surfaces such as stained, painted or varnished
wood, glass, tile, painted cinder block and plaster.
</P>
<P>
   The adhesive pads are strong enough to hold a small hook on the
wall and support up to 3 pounds. But the trick in the pads is the
way they come off.
</P>
<P>
   When you're finished with the hooks, you grab a tab on the
adhesive pad and pull straight down. The adhesive stretches and
pulls off the wall without marring the surface, 3M claims.
</P>
<P>
   The company's designer and art deco series hooks that use
Command adhesive won 1999 Good Buy Awards from Good Housekeeping
magazine. You can buy pairs of hooks with the Command adhesive for
about $3 at discount stores.
</P>
<P>
   Scotch pop-up tapes come in 2-inch strips that pop out of
dispenser one at a time like tissues from a tissue box. Packages
for kids in bright, see-through packages sell for about $1.29.

 &HT;    STUDY DOUBTS SAVINGS IN GORE'S REINVENTION PROJECT
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore's project to streamline and
``reinvent'' government cannot substantiate $21.8 billion in
savings claimed by the Clinton administration, a federal report
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House budget office had no documentation for many
asserted savings and some savings had been double-counted, said the
review conducted by the General Accounting Office, the nonpartisan
investigative arm of Congress. The report also concluded that some
of the savings, such as in the space program, could be traced to
congressional budget caps, not to the Gore program. Other savings
that are counted have yet to be realized, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore launched his reinvention effort in 1993 with promises to
make the government ``work better and cost less,'' and the
administration has frequently estimated that it would save $137
billion through next year.
</P>
<P>
   The audit examined recommendations in three programs which were
projected to yield $30 billion of the total savings and raised
doubts about whether most of those savings could be attributed to
the Gore program.
</P>
<P>
   The administration dismissed the findings. ``This report seems
to focus on arcane questions about accounting methodology,'' said
Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget.
She said that ``what really matters is that government reinvention
is working, that the government is smaller, more efficient and more
cost effective than it was at the start of this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricci cited the full time payroll drop of 350,000 federal
workers since 1993 and called the government ``indisputably
smaller,'' despite the continuing annual growth in overall federal
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans cited the report to charge that the administration
has exaggerated the success of the project that has been so closely
identified with the vice president, who hopes to succeed Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of reinventing government, it looks like they were
reinventing accounting rules,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.,
chairman of the Committee on Government Reform.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who asked for the study, added, ``I'm glad the vice
president has made reinventing government a priority. However, he
shouldn't try to pad the numbers or take credit for savings that
haven't happened.''

SETZER, HIS ORCHESTRA SWEEP ACROSS GENERATIONAL LINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brian Setzer wasn't exactly the first swinger _
Benny Goodman got there 65 years ago _ but this guitar-slinging
flashback man did get a head start on the current craze when he
released his first orchestra album in 1994. And while the swing
revival shows some early signs of petering out, Setzer clearly
still believes, and so do the fans that packed the Greek Theatre
this weekend for two well-received shows.
</P>
<P>
   Setzer is a man blessed with a great sense of anticipation. In
the early '80s, he milked rockabilly with the Stray Cats until that
ran its course. Then he moved on, fusing jump blues, swing,
boogie-woogie and pop into a toe-tapping retro sound that sent his
career soaring yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Setzer's music pulls off that rare distinction of appealing to
several generations _ the audience at the Greek spanned from teens
to their grandparents, and the older crowd often could be seen
working up a sweat near the front of the stage.
 &UR; !ital! &LR; (You go, Grandpa!) &UR; !off! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Setzer and his 15-piece orchestra kept things moving at a brisk
pace, packing 17 songs into a lively 85-minute set that neatly _
and concisely _ covered all of the big-band man's career bases.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving on stage playing the guitar riff from ``Hawaii Five-O''
(the evening had a vague luau theme), Setzer segued into a rousing
``Hoodoo Voodoo Doll'' and ripping renditions of ``This Cat's on a
Hot Tin Roof'' and ``Let's Live It Up,'' both from his now year-old
``Dirty Boogie'' album.
</P>
<P>
   Fronting a band that included five saxophones, four trumpets,
four trombones, bass and drums, Setzer was most effective when
blending his superb guitar work with his orchestra's swing sound.
</P>
<P>
   Setzer gave the orchestra treatment to two Stray Cats hits _
``Rock This Town'' and ``Stray Cat Strut'' (no surprises there) _
and he showed off his crooning abilities to fine effect on ``Mack
the Knife.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does he go from here? Probably home. Setzer, after all,
has been on the road for nearly a year. Given his restless and
prescient nature, though, his ``Dirty Boogie'' follow-up should
provide a clue or two about the next sound to be appropriated by a
Gap commercial. &QL;

   CAYMAN-SUMMER-$ADV21 _ GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands _ We needed
this family vacation. Four months of shuffling correspondents
throughout the Eastern Hemisphere to report on the bombing of
Yugoslavia and its aftermath had me in hives at the mere mention of
the name ``Milosevic.'' Worse, my family was leaving me notes in
lieu of conversation. To re-connect we went to the Cayman Islands.

   REL-OVER _ ATLANTA _ The New World was a beacon across the
Atlantic, calling to people looking for a fresh start, sick of the
old ways of the Old World. The Reformation shattered the old
Christendom, but also unleashed new energies, forces that would
sustain a people in a distant land. Protestants translated the
Bible into vernacular languages and encouraged lay learning and
initiative. From Europe, Christian missionaries dispersed to Asia,
Africa _ and the Americas. Their early efforts can still be felt
today. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

made the tiny island (pop. 250) a sacred site since Druid times,

non-denominational Iona Community in humanitarian causes around the

 &HT;    Schools `getting worse,' survey says
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How good are our schools compared with those 50 years ago? Life
($3.99) and Yankelovich Partners recently conducted a poll to find
out, and the results are dismal. Most of the respondents 50 years
ago said schools were ``not very good but getting better.'' Today,
the answer is ``not very good and getting worse.'' And statistics
seem to support that conclusion. Verbal SAT scores have declined
more than 35 points since 1967, and fewer than 10 percent of adults
can define the word ``molecule.'' In a related article, New York
Times reporter Rick Bragg revisits the Wonder School in West
Memphis, Ark., and talks to Principal Ora Breckenridge, who was a
student in the all-black school 50 years ago. Back then, 300
students were crammed into a church sanctuary with one cast-iron
stove, no electric lights or running water. The physical
surroundings have improved, but Breckenridge is concerned about
unfocused students and uninterested parents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Under the gun: In the wake of yet more shootings, Newsweek
($3.50) focuses on the causes of violence in America and the need
for more gun controls. In a recent poll, 80 percent said that poor
upbringing by parents was a contributing factor, but that the media
were also to blame. Eighty-eight percent said the intensive news
coverage of violence encourages copycat incidents by those who seek
celebrity status. As for solutions, suggestions range from paying
more attention to anti-social behavior to increased security and
metal detectors in schools and offices.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Family tree: Time ($3.50) reports on the latest scientific
findings that the evolution of Homo sapiens was not a steady,
unbroken progression, anthropologists say. Several species of
upright-walking primates competed for survival. ``Since 1994, four
new species of hominid have been added to the human family tree,''
Time says. Of course, not everyone believes in evolution. Harvard
professor Stephen Jay Gould blasts a pro-creationist decision in
Kansas to remove the teaching of evolution from the state's science
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sound and fury: After a turbulent and promising beginning as a
media watchdog, Brill's Content ($3.95) has lost some of its bite.
Maybe it's because high-profile columnists are no longer inventing
fictional characters and the White House sex scandal has cooled.
The September issue features a three-part package on political talk
shows. Gay Jervey tries to find the mind behind the mouth of Chris
Matthews, Jack Germond explains why he left ``The McLaughlin
Group,'' and author Deborah Tannen explains that in most television
debates, ``The goal is not to understand, but to win.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The great outdoors: The New Yorker ($3.95) taps into the
adventure trend with a special issue on the subject. Bill Buford
camps out in Central Park, George Plimpton goes into the wilds of
Africa to interview documentary filmmaker Alan Root, and Elizabeth
Rubin provides a firsthand account of surviving the Centurion Risk
Assessment Services' ``hostile environments'' course for
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  High Gear: Publisher Bob Guccione Jr. celebrates the one-year
anniversary of Gear ($3.50) in much the same way he launched his
slick magazine: with a scantily clad cover model (this month it's
Penelope Cruz) and a mix of articles aimed at males between ages 21
and 34. This month's issue includes pieces on gangster fashion,
female boxer Olivia Escobar and the Internet's Voyeur Dorm, plus an
essay by staff writer Celia Farber in response to charges that Gear
exploits women. Actually, she writes, women's magazines exploit
women by focusing on beauty and fashion. Why, she asks, is there
always a ``perfectly sleek, buxom, slim, flawless woman on the
cover of every women's magazine?'' Good question.

 &HT;    Versatile and fascinating, `Ernestine' was eloquence
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I come before you today to speak as the last of the
old guard still standing. I won't resort to tears, for Ernestine
wouldn't have liked that, for after all, no one could bring a mist
to your eyes better that she. (Ernestine _ a story goes with that,
but later.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time I got to Atlanta, Sibley was already a star. For the
first seven years, we served The Constitution. Then I moved to The
Journal. Then we played on the same team for a lot of years when
the two quietly grew closer. But she was never anything but a
Constitution girl, and never let me forget it, since I was imported
when Gov. Cox gently absorbed her old paper.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote through six decades and four buildings and three wars
and two spit-fights in distant parts of the world. She worked
police beats, the Legislature, murder trials, tear-jerkers and
Hollywood. She mingled with presidents, senators, governors,
statesmen and stateswomen, hollering politicians, ministers,
doctors, lawyers and at least one Indian chief.
</P>
<P>
   She was fearless. She floated about in balloons and helicopters,
rode the back seat of patrol cars chasing criminals, looked
murderers in the eye and told their story, and, near the end, no
more than two months ago, took a ride on a ``hog'' _ motorcyle to
most of us _ helmeted and all. She laughed her way through it, but
decided there were better ways to drive to work.
</P>
<P>
   We were both country people, but she got to the city before I
did. Never, though, did she adopt real ``citified'' ways. Sibley
was as much at home at a hog-killing as at an opera. That, to me,
was the foundation of the literature of Celestine Sibley, as
versatile as she was fascinating. She could take the most common
topic, how to scrub a kitchen floor or mending socks, capture you
in the opening graph and never let you loose.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine the changes she lived and wrote through.
From radio to television to cell phones to e-mail to Web sites.
From old L.C. Smith typewriters to word processors, which were slow
to win her affection. She went from gazing at a harvest moon to
watching men land and walk on it, then come home to tell of it. She
went from Eddie Cantor, Joe Penner and Jack Benny to TV smut you
wouldn't let your dog watch. She could cajole, scold, lambaste,
praise, admire or jerk you to attention, like a baseball pitcher
with a variety of ``stuff.'' It was holidays that she reserved for
mellowing out.
</P>
<P>
   As it comes to all, it comes to our most beloved. We peered at
each other from different sides of the fence through those middle
years, but as the space narrowed and our offices came closer
together, we came to share a kind of camaraderie I treasured. For
one thing, she came to admire my taste in wives, and those two
brought us all closer together. I enjoyed a friendship with her
that I'd never known, and it was a treasure. We stayed in touch.
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine? Well, being introduced as the speaker at a civic club
one day, she was announced as ``Ernestine Selby.'' Later, she'd
heard I'd been introduced at a similar function as ``Freeman
Baker,'' so we became Ernestine and Freeman. One morning as we both
arrived at 72 Marietta St. about the same time, I spoke to her as
she entered the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, Ernestine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, Freeman,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Three young reporters on the elevator looked at each other, and
their glances said, ``These poor old dodos don't even know each
other's names.''
</P>
<P>
   It just ain't going to be the same, turning that corner, looking
into her office and not seeing Ernestine at that old rolltop desk.
</P>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: There are several of us in the office,
and when those who wear perfume are present, you can smell it as
soon as you enter. There are three of us who suffer from allergies,
and the perfume gives us headaches and makes us sneeze and cough.
We have talked to the ones who wear perfume, but they just don't
get it. The problem is that our boss is one of those who wears
perfume, and because of this, we're stuck. Do you have any
suggestions? M.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you feel that your job stinks, there are ways to
counteract the nasal assault. In fact, many companies are becoming
increasingly concerned with indoor air quality, and they often view
perfumes as part of the problem. Such employers are interested in
keeping indoor air pollution to a minimum, not only from the
standpoint of maintaining employee health, welfare and
satisfaction, but also from the standpoint of maintaining employee
attendance and productivity. This is not just an issue for the
employees who have a fragrance sensitivity, but rather for all of
the employees.
</P>
<P>
   You should meet with your boss and spell out the specific
physical problems that the perfumes are causing for you and your
associates, along with the many costs that accompany this matter.
You should then indicate that you would like the boss to make a
reasonable accommodation to deal with this situation, particularly
in terms of limiting the use of fragrances at work. If your boss
thumbs his or her nose at this request, then you should sniff
things out at the next level of management.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Over a recent holiday weekend, according to my manager, I
missed several pages. I assured him that my pager is always on and
I would never ignore a page. He cursed at me and called me a liar.
Meanwhile, he is notorious for ignoring pages, voice mail, and
company e-mail. He has lied and threatened us with termination, and
I've been told that his behavior is typical for this company. What
should I do? B.E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your manager curses at you, threatens you, lies to you, calls
you a liar, ignores communication to him, all of which is typical
for this company, and you wonder what to do? Perhaps it is more
appropriate to wonder why you are putting up with this nonsense in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Your manager is in the shallow end in the management pool. He
sounds far more like a bully, harasser and abuser _ not exactly the
criteria one seeks in a leader. You and your associates can try to
discuss your concerns with him, but since he dodges pages, voice
mail and e-mail, you can expect him to dodge you as well.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that you get nowhere with him, your next stop should be
with senior management. However, if your manager's behavior is
truly typical for this company, you should not expect much of a
reaction at this level either.
</P>
<P>
   The real person to approach in this matter is yourself, and the
real question is why you are staying with this company. Employees
deserve to be treated with respect and trust, and if you accept
anything short of that, you are shortchanging your career.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I asked my sister to consider hiring my daughter. My daughter
has outstanding work experience, references, and training. My
sister interviewed her and then rejected her, saying another
candidate was more qualified. I am very upset, but my sister does
not sense any problem. Should I say something? C.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: This is probably a real career break for your daughter.
Whether for business or personal reasons, your sister did not view
your daughter as her first choice. If she had gone ahead and hired
her, the stage would have been set for a failure.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel that this situation is going to undermine your
relationship with your sister, you should talk to her about it, but
be sure to keep an open mind. Although it is possible that your
sister is harboring some strange vendetta, it is also possible that
she is a solid businessperson who found a very strong candidate and
made a business decision. In fact, when it comes to family business
matters, employers are consistently advised to focus on business,
not family.
</P>
<P>
   Your daughter may also want to talk to your sister about what
happened here. If your sister's decision was truly based on
business-related factors, perhaps she can give your daughter some
additional pointers and career guidance.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, your daughter is going to feel better about
herself and her work if she gets a job on her own. And, if your
sister in fact rejected your daughter for personal reasons, she has
actually hurt herself.
</P>

GRAVE OF GERMAN JEWISH LEADER IS DESECRATED IN JERSUALEM 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Tel Aviv burial of Ignatz Bubis, the head of
Germany's Jewish community, took a bizarre turn Sunday when an
Israeli artist quietly squirted black paint onto his grave and
later accused Bubis of having been a criminal and a traitor to his
people.
</P>
<P>
   Bubis, who died on Friday in his hometown of Frankfurt at age
72, asked to be buried in Israel so that his grave would be safe
from desecration by neo-Nazis, which happened to the grave of his
predecessor, Heinz Galinski.
</P>
<P>
   Meir Mendelssohn, 52, of Tel Aviv, who described himself as an
artist, told reporters afterward that he had carried out the
desecration because Bubis had been ``a bad man.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Reuters on Monday that Bubis ``dealt in the black market
he built illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He destroyed buildings that were very old,'' Mendelssohn said.
``But since he was a Jew, you could never say anything. He took
advantage of his Jewishness.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendelssohn was on his way Monday to Germany, where he lived for
27 years _ until three years ago, said a woman who answered the
telephone at his Tel Aviv residence and gave her name only as
Elisheva, describing herself as his companion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew Bubis personally very well,'' she said. ``He said to
Bubis before he died that he would not forget the things that he
had done. Bubis took money from Jews in Germany and became rich and
famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendelssohn was born in Israel but went to Germany at age 20,
married a German woman and has two children there, Elisheva said.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral for Bubis was attended by Israeli and German
leaders, including President Ezer Weizman of Israel and President
Johannes Rau of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must act in such a way that will make it possible to live
and to die in Germany,'' Rau said at the funeral, in recognition of
the fact that Bubis had asked not to be buried in Germany for fear
of grave desecration.
</P>
<P>
   Mendelssohn's desecration seems not to have been seen by anyone
at the funeral service on Sunday, but it was captured on videotape.
A jet of black paint can be seen shooting into the grave as
gravediggers shovel in earth, Reuters reported after obtaining a
copy of the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Mendelssohn told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz about
his deed and said he had done it because ``Bubis exploited his
Jewishness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a thief, a cheat and a liar, and after his death many
things will come out,'' Mendelssohn was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a Judenrat in his concentration camp,'' he added, using
the term for Jews who worked for the Nazis inside the camps.
</P>
<P>
   Bubis led the Central Council of Jews in Germany since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his father, sister and brother to the Nazis, and was
vociferous in defending other minorities in Germany, notably the
Turks. His eloquence helped calm the waters after a wave of racist
attacks against Turks in the eastern part of the country in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But although his commitment to German democracy was passionate,
his position remained the troubled one of a spokesman for a modern
Germany whose dark past was more vivid to him than the present.
</P>
<P>
   The last year of Bubis' life was dominated by a vitriolic clash
over the Holocaust with one of Germany's leading writers, Martin
Walser. In his last interview with the magazine Stern a month ago,
Bubis declared that he had achieved ``almost nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   After a lifetime of campaigning for greater understanding
between Jews and Germans, Bubis seems to have been overwhelmed with
rancor at the end, convinced that the enormity of the Holocaust was
increasingly lost on the postwar generation of Germans now in power
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The men now in power _ including Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer _ were among the revolutionaries and squatters with whom
Bubis clashed in Frankfurt in the 1960s and later. These conflicts
centered on Bubis' real estate development projects, which often
led to the eviction of squatters.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicts provided part of the material for Rainer Werner
Fassbinder's play ``Garbage, the City and Death,'' which was barred
in 1985 after Bubis led a protest alleging that the work was an
anti-Semitic attack.

<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. _ The vistas here in the Berkshire foothills
are already brown; shriveled oak leaves are crunching under the
boots of hikers on the Appalachian Trail, and enough maple leaves
have fallen on the village green to force a most unwelcome summer
chore: raking.
</P>
<P>
   With all six New England states suffering from the drought, bare
branches and drab leaves may be all that is left to greet the
hordes of tourists on their foliage pilgrimages in late September
and October. Foresters say that instead of the bursting bronze,
scarlet and purple hillsides that define New England for much of
the world, this fall's leaf-peepers may be stuck with muddy yellow
and orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting brown leaves already, because they're burned,''
said Michael S. Klubek, a ranger at Kent Falls State Park here.
</P>
<P>
   The bleak foliage outlook has country innkeepers worrying about
how they will fill their rooms, and prospective visitors wondering
what will be left for their trips, most of which have long been
planned and paid for.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may seem unseemly to be stewing about the view when
farmers are losing their livelihoods, a dud of a fall-foliage
season would be more than an aesthetic loss. The proliferation of
bed-and-breakfasts has helped make leaf-peeping an $8 billion
annual business in New England, ahead of skiing in several of the
states.
</P>
<P>
   So autumn glory has become cut-throat. The Connecticut Office of
Tourism bought ads in 11 magazines this fall proclaiming, ``Our
colors are still blazing well into November _ a good month longer
than other New England states.'' In an interview, a tourism
official in northern New England begged to go off the record to
dish about television pictures of failed crops in drier Connecticut
and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing opportunity, states throughout the South and Midwest
have started fall festivals and other autumn-leaf promotions,
extending the alleged foliage belt into a huge lazy Y starting in
Georgia and branching off toward Idaho and Maine. Even Oregon now
promotes a Foliage Hotline.
</P>
<P>
   But it is New England where most of the Winnebagoes and tour
buses head, and where everything from roadside pumpkin stands to
restored Victorian mansions are geared to the invasion of the leaf
people. The traffic can be so overwhelming that Michael Mueller,
45, who lives on the leaf trail in Ridgefield, Conn., calls the
season ``Fear and Foliage.'' This year, though, the biggest crush
may come from prep-school parents' weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is scared that without leaves, there won't be
people,'' said Karen R. Hamilton, an owner of The Birches Inn, an
overgrown cottage on Lake Waramaug, in New Preston, Conn. She then
pointed out that much of her business comes at suppertime, when
``it's dark and foliage isn't an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Plant pathologists said the damage is too extensive for the
season to be saved by even steady rain, which the area enjoyed this
weekend. They explain that the brown trees have already begun to
shut down in preparation for surviving through the winter, and this
annual process does not reverse itself. Some trees may not even be
able to recover fully for next season, foresters said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Cudworth, the executive director of the White Memorial
Conservation Center, a 4,000-acre preserve here in Northwestern
Connecticut, pointed toward the morning sunlight streaming through
a stand of 50-foot swamp maples that usually are bushy enough to
block out the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaves are all smaller and thinner,'' Mr. Cudworth said.
``The leaves are yellow, when they should be green. The trees can't
get any water, so they're saying, `Forget this,' and dropping
leaves so they can stay alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Splendor-seekers are reluctantly setting their sights lower.
Rona Kamenetsky, a lawyer from Cooper City, Fla., who has driven
through New England the past seven seasons, said first-time
visitors are the ones who will suffer. ``When you go see the Eiffel
Tower, you know what it's supposed to look like, because you've
seen pictures of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the New England states, the arid weather has been least
damaging to the northern swath of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine,
which are not official drought areas, although federal drought
monitors rate the territory as abnormally dry.
</P>
<P>
   The drought has been roughest on Rhode Island, where April
through July was the driest four months in the 105 years that
records have been kept. On Wednesday, Connecticut was declared a
federal drought disaster area. Most of Massachusetts is
experiencing a severe drought, federal officials say, as are the
southern parts of New Hampshire and Maine. The southern part of
Vermont is experiencing moderate drought.
</P>
<P>
   The muted show this fall should put even more of a premium on
the scramble to catch the peak weekend. Tourism officials employ a
pastiche of meteorology, botany and old wives' tales _ taking into
account frost, rain and sunlight _ to explain their forecast for
the peak. Frequently, and conveniently, it is Columbus Day weekend,
which includes a holiday.

LATIN GROUPS PLAY HARD AT WATCHA FESTIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Who's killing the great summer rock tours of
America?
</P>
<P>
   Lollapalooza, Horde and Further are on indefinite leave while
Lilith goes on hiatus at the end of the month, leaving only Warped
and OzzFest.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it looks like you can add Watcha to the list of summer
perennials.
</P>
<P>
   The high-energy tour, produced by the organizers of the annual
hard-rock- and thrash-fueled Warped trek, came to the 6,000-seat
Greek Theatre for the first time Sunday with its genre-bending
lineup of Latino acts, including Cafe Tacuba, Puya, Molotov, Illya
Kuryaki, Control Machete, Todos Tus Muertos, Fishbone, Los Mocosos,
Bersuit, Enanitos Verdes, Union 13, Chris Perez and Viva Malpache.
</P>
<P>
   And while the quality of the music varied, Watcha _ which,
roughly translated, means ``check it out'' _ was an unqualified
success, with the open-air venue nearly three-quarters filled.
</P>
<P>
   A young and mostly Latino crowd gathered for the show, which
ignored the Latin-lite English-sung pop of Ricky Martin and
Jennifer Lopez and instead accented a hard-hitting mix of
Spanish-language thrash, metal and hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of hip-hop, it took only a turntable and two Spanish
rappers for one of the show's highlights, trio Control Machete, to
control the Greek. The unit pummeled the audience with a series of
sharply chosen beats, including quick samplings of ranchera, while
the rappers roared over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lyrics were usually delivered too fast for easy
comprehension, we could make out phrases such as ``Hey, John Doe,
que paso.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the audience respond to Control Machete by waving
Mexican and Puerto Rican flags, you can clearly see Watcha's
commercial potential.
</P>
<P>
   Another fine band was Puya, hailing originally from Puerto Rico,
whose head-banging metallic attack and Spanish-language cover of
the '80s Police hit ``Spirits in the Material World'' helped
transform the area in front of the Greek's stage into a seething
mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-rock group also used a three-piece horn section on a
few numbers, including a syncopated midtempo tune that seemed to be
a tribute to Santana, the long-surviving Latin-rock pioneers whose
spirit hung over several performances Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Other acts receiving good response included the often-melodic
Viva Malpache, whose charged ballads and rockers drew cheers, and
Chris Perez, widower of slain Tejano superstar Selena, who offered
pop-rock originals that acted as a pleasing contrast to the
sometimes overly loud approach of fellow performers.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Los Angeles' Fishbone had the curious effect of
stopping everyone that had been up and dancing for earlier bands.
The ska-thrash group, back on the comeback trail after a long
hiatus, tried to rebound with its perennial cover of Curtis
Mayfield's ``Freddie's Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late _ crowd members were already trickling out. &QL;

   Connecticut tourism officials says peak viewing should come
about 10 to 14 day earlier than the normal date of Oct. 15. (But
Columbus Day, Oct. 11, would still be a fine time to come, the
officials say.) Instead of gathering the usual weekly updates for
the state's foliage report on its hotline and Web site
(http://www.tourism.state.ct.us), workers from the state Welcome
Centers will be sent out each day to scout the foliage. For the
first time, the state also will be pointing out ``primary foliage
viewing areas'' _ that is, places that still have leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be checking minute-to-minute this year,'' said
Edward D. Dombroskas, the state's executive director of tourism.
``While we know that because of the drought conditions, the foliage
on certain high ridges won't be as beautiful, the valleys will
still be spectacular. We don't think anyone will go home
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Department of Tourism and Marketing went on the
offensive on Thursday with a news release declaring, ``Vermont
Expects a Good Fall Foliage Season.'' The release asserted that
because of the state's topography, varied tree species and
high-quality soil, ``Vermont will have good quality fall foliage,
regardless of conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, Susan Benson, the state conservation spokesman, has
been pressed into her self-described duties as ``Leaf Lady''
several weeks early. ``We're really in a wait-and-see mode,'' she
said. ``Maine will have fall foliage color.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island is urging visitors to check out the harvest, art
and quahog festivals to get what Becky Bovell, the assistant state
tourism director, calls ``a more well-rounded fall experience,
rather than just leaf-changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts promoters contend that the earlier season will put
lodging at even more of a premium than usual. ``There's going to be
color,'' said Amy A. Strack, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts
Office of Travel and Tourism. ``People should be more concerned
about getting a reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most boldly of all, the New Hampshire Division of Travel
and Tourism Development has drafted a news release that begins,
``Predictions about foliage season are just predictions.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Native American legend said that the hills turned red with blood
after a celestial hunter killed the great bear autumn, while the
yellow came from the fat splattering out of the kettle as the
hunters cooked their prize.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists say the fall colors result because leaves die in
a blaze of glory. In late summer, the base of leaves begin forming
cells that will help the branch heal after the leaf falls. As the
layers of cells grow, the veins become clogged and cut off the
supply of chlorophyll, which makes the leaves look green. The
sugars in the leaves are then unmasked and, under the right
conditions, turn fiery hues. Without water, however, the trees
produce fewer sugars and use them up, giving the remaining leaves a
dull color.
</P>
<P>
   But to many, autumn in New England still has much to offer
beyond brightly colored leaves.
</P>
<P>
   At the Manor House, a Tudor-style inn with Tiffany windows in
Norfolk, in the Litchfield Hills, leaf-peepers return to their
rooms to find wood and kindling laid in their fireplaces. Diane
Tremblay, the innkeeper, said little touches like that should salve
any foliage letdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come for the getaway,'' she said. ``If the colors are
also beautiful, that's a great bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   David Glanfield, 63, a retired French teacher in Sullihol,
England, who is headed to New England this fall for the first time,
said the dicey forecast will be part of the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see it with new eyes, aren't we?'' he said.
``So whatever you have, we expect to be quite stunned.''

RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT APPROVES PUTIN AS PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ There was little debate, and no drama in the Russian
Parliament Monday as a majority of deputies voted swiftly, if
grudgingly, to approve President Boris Yeltsin's latest nominee for
prime minister by a margin of 232- 84.
</P>
<P>
   With their attention fixed on their upcoming reelection
campaigns, Parliamentary leaders openly treated the confirmation of
Vladimir Putin _a former KGB officer named by Yeltsin last week as
his heir apparent _ as a perfunctory duty that had to be performed
before getting down to the real business of arranging their
campaign strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Those strategies will become clearer Wednesday, when former
Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov _ pushed from office by Yeltsin
just three months ago _announces his long-awaited decision to head
a center-left electoral alliance that already includes Moscow Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov and a handful of powerful regional governors.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's immediate predecessor, Sergei Stepashin, is also
expected to announce his own political plans later this week, which
may pull together another new electoral alliance made up of parties
led by former members of Yeltsin's early reform governments.
</P>
<P>
   Now seen as Russia's most trusted and most popular politician,
Primakov's return to the political arena is certain to overshadow
Putin's efforts to inject new credibility into a government damaged
by Yeltsin's continuous personnel changes.
</P>
<P>
   With Primakov at the top of the ticket, the new ``Fatherland-all
Russia'' coalition promises to dominate the Russian political
landscape, and could provide Primakov with the party he needs to
make a strong bid for the presidency next year.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiescing to Yeltsin's new prime minister, the Parliament
avoided a constitutional clash that could have cost members their
seats four months before December parliamentary elections. Under
the Russian constitution, the president must disband the Parliament
if it rejects his choice for prime minister three times in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do now is to vote, forget about it and get
down to business,'' said Oleg Morozov, leader of the Russian
Regions faction, who is already a member of the newly forged
``Fatherland-all Russia'' coalition. ``In fact, we have nothing to
discuss today.''
</P>
<P>
   Grigori Yavlinsky, leader of Yabloko, a liberal party, openly
scorned the Kremlin's latest game of musical chairs by deliberately
referring to the new prime minister by the last name of his
predecessor, Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   In a short speech, delivered in clipped sentences, Putin
maintained his image as the Kremlin's ``law and order'' candidate
by pledging to restore discipline to government on all levels.
``Order means first and foremost the clear-cut responsibility of
government before society,'' he told deputies.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to take a tough stance toward some of Russia's wayward
regions, where local governors have openly flaunted the authority
of Moscow. ``I consider dangerous, unacceptable and harmful the
manifestations of spinelessness and of double standards with regard
to different subjects of the Russian federation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin reserved his harshest language for the war in Russia's
southern province of Dagestan, where Russian forces have been
battling Islamic fundamentalists for the last ten days. At his
request, the Parliament on Monday passed a unanimous resolution,
urging the government ``to take the the most prompt and severe
measures toward the destruction of illegal armed bands.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days of his nomination, Putin vowed to pursue the Islamic
commandos, who first occupied several mountain villages on Aug. 7
along the border with the breakaway republic of Chechnya, back to
their Chechen bases. On Monday, Viktor Kazantsev, commander of the
north Caucasus military district, told reporters that airstrikes
had hit rebel bases in Dagestan and in Chechnya. ``They did not
expect to be met here so resolutely and decisively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A local state of emergency in the contested districts in
Dagestan is still a possibility, Putin said Monday. But, he added,
``I think that we will succeed in localizing the conflict and
stamping out its seeds without resorting to this extreme measure.''
</P>
<P>
   But Putin Monday also acknowledged that the Russian government
must also deal with social and economic conditions in the North
Caucasus, which have deteriorated since the 1994-1996 war with the
self-proclaimed independent republic of Chechnya. ``Without a
solution of these issues nothing else will work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said one of his top goals as prime minister will be to
insure ``honest and fair'' elections first to the Parliament, then
to the presidency. He said his own presidential ambitions will
depend on whether his government is able to deliver on its
promises. `'You can't deceive the people,'' he said. ``If there are
results, then I will have a real chance to at least speak about it.
If there are no results, then there will be nothing to discuss.'

 &HT;    Dalai Lama delivers message of hope
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The Dalai Lama is a pretty funny guy.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras click as he enters a room, and he raises his eyebrows in
mock surprise, as if he can't believe anybody would want to take
his picture.
</P>
<P>
   Then he bows, presses his palms together in front of his chest _
and giggles.
</P>
<P>
   The giggle is surprising _ not exactly what you'd expect from
the leader of one of the world's great religions, Buddhism, and the
political leader of a beleaguered nation _ Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   But the message he delivered here Monday was one of humility,
religious tolerance, and, perhaps most surprisingly, of hope.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the world might focus on newspaper headlines of war,
violence and hatred. But the Dalai Lama sees the world moving
forward toward greater humanity, not less. It's what the queen
mother of England told him when he visited her. At 96, she's seen
more of this century than he has. ``I asked her, `Do you think
humanity is improving?' And she said, without hesitation, `Things
are improving. When young, almost no one talking about human rights
(sic). Now, among young people, humanity is more important than
ever.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And the millennium doom and gloom? Forget about it. Technically
speaking, that's an event he won't see in his lifetime, since this
is already 2126 on the Tibetan calendar, and he is 64 years old.
``People ask me about the millennium and I say, `Oh, it's nothing,
just another day and night.' I truly believe that the 21st century
can be more peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the themes he emphasized before a crowd of about
4,500 at Market Square Arena. It was a considerably smaller crowd
than had come to hear a similar message in New York City's Central
Park on Sunday, but they listened raptly. In keeping with his
message of inner faith harmony, his remarks were preceded by
introductions from local leaders of the Jewish, Muslim, Disciples
of Christ and Catholic faith traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood actor and Buddhist practitioner Steven Seagal even put
in an appearance, along with Robert Thurman, who, besides being the
father of actress Uma Thurman, is also professor of Tibetan studies
at Columbia University, and considered to be the foremost American
authority on Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his trademark maroon robe, with a flash of yellow at the
right shoulder, a pair of oxfords and a ring of prayer beads next
to his wristwatch, the Dalai Lama looked a little like an exotic
bird. Although he joked about his command of the English language,
he asked for an interpreter's assistance only a few times.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing century could become known as ``the century of
bloodshed,'' he said, ``but the next century could be the century
of dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   He advocated the teaching of conflict resolution in schools,
starting with kindergartners. He urged his audience to rediscover a
sense of morality through their own religious tradition, or with no
religion at all. The values of love, tolerance, reconciliation and
compassion are what he calls, ``secular ethics'' that are common to
faith traditions, but are not tied to them.
</P>
<P>
   Fear, anxiety, loneliness and narrowness of thinking are what
come from focusing on the self, the Dalai Lama said. ``The moment
you think about the welfare of others, your mind widens. At that
moment, your own problems are not significant.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a concept that is not unique to Buddhism, but is common
to many of the world's religions, including Christianity, Judaism
and Islam, Robert Thurman said. ``It's not mysterious, exotic or
far out.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who came to see the Dalai Lama were of all ages, and
their response to him bordered on reverential. But he seemed to
really strike a chord with people who don't consider themselves to
be religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a knack of touching everybody he talks to,'' said Greg
Pritchard, 44, of Indianapolis. ``I recognized a little bit of me
in what he was saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I like the idea that you don't have to be a religious
person to appreciate his message. I'm not a believer. But he
included me.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Dalai Lama will begin an 11-day Buddhist ceremony at
the Tibetan Cultural Center in Bloomington, Ind. The Kalachakra,
which means ``wheel of time,'' is considered to be one of the most
holy of Buddhist rituals, and is performed to promote world peace.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ The lights may go out in the research labs at
Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York and may dim all
over the East as the voltage droops on a hot summer day, but here,
the juice never falters. Not since a cold day in early 1997, when
power flickered at the headquarters of the First National Bank of
Omaha, causing a computer crash that executives vowed would never
happen again.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout in upper Manhattan on July 6 has cast new attention
on ``uninterruptible'' power systems. Columbia Presbyterian, like
the bank here, had an emergency supply that turned out to be
unreliable, ruining several medical experiments in progress.
</P>
<P>
   But the bank's solution is attracting attention for another
reason: it uses fuel cells, a technology that shows promise for
reliability, flexibility and cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
   So far, fuel-cell technology has failed to catch on because of
cost, but in an era marked by increasing dependence on
voltage-sensitive computer equipment, people will pay a lot for
power that will not quit. So after seven years of failing to
attract widespread commercial use, fuel cells may now have found a
niche.
</P>
<P>
   First National bought them when it decided that the 99.9 percent
reliability of its old system was not good enough. That system had
batteries powering the computers until emergency generators could
kick in. But when the Omaha Public Power District faltered one cold
day in 1997, the bank hit that 0.1 percent moment: the batteries
quit, too. Engineers found later that two in a string of several
dozen batteries had failed, probably months before.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are not like light bulbs, which dim when there is a
drop in current and return to normal when the power is restored. A
computer deprived of power for even a fraction of a second will
crash _ often destroying data when it goes down.
</P>
<P>
   So on that unlucky, one-in-a-thousand-chance day, the bank's
checkclearing, credit card processing, automatic teller machine
support system, debit card system and other vital functions stopped
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was fuel cells, devices that make electricity
through chemistry rather than combustion. Batteries have long used
chemistry to make electricity, but they eventually exhaust their
chemicals; a fuel cell is supplied continuously with the chemicals
it needs _ generally a hydrocarbon fuel like natural gas.
Understood for 100 years but still rare in the marketplace, fuel
cells combine oxygen from the air with hydrogen from natural gas or
other fuels to make three products: water, heat and a flow of
electrons _ or electric current.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction converts natural gas to electricity far more
efficiently than burning the gas to turn a turbine generator _ the
typical energy conversion that takes place at an electric power
plant. For businesses that can also find a use for the heat in the
water, which the bank is doing, efficiency is about 80 percent,
versus 50 percent or less for most utility power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that natural gas is cheap and fuel cells are
expensive. Typically a cell's capital cost comes to about $3,000 to
$5,000 a kilowatt, enough power to light ten 100-watt bulbs. Mass
production could lower capital costs, though.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells could have a variety of uses in the near future. The
Ford Motor Co., under contract with the Energy Department, has just
completed a car that runs on a low-temperature fuel cell and goes
from 0 to 60 miles an hour in 12 seconds. Its tailpipe, made of
plastic, emits nothing but a few drops of pure water.
</P>
<P>
   Others are working on tiny cells that would power laptop
computers or cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The portable cells use the same chemical reaction as the ones at
the bank, which are built by Onsi (a name based on on site), a
subsidiary of the United Technologies Corp. of Hartford, Conn., but
they rely on a different system that can increase and decrease
output rapidly and that runs at a lower temperature. But both the
portable cells, called proton exchange membrane cells, and the Onsi
cells, called phosphoric acid cells, have yet to achieve large
scale commercial acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials seem satisfied, though. Now their data center, in
a building designed to withstand 200 mile-per-hour tornado winds
and protected from the hazards of downtown Omaha by a moat, could
be the last place in America where the lights go out. Bank
officials say their power system is good 99.99997 percent of the
time _ ``six nines'' in industry parlance. When it fails, on
average less than one second a year, the computers do not go down;
the bank switches to the local utility, the Omaha Public Power
District, for backup.
</P>
<P>
   Bank executives have learned never to say never, but if the
city's grid happened to be down at that moment as well, said Dennis
C. Hughes, the bank's head of property management, it might as well
be the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a real monumental catastrophic problem
here,'' he said. ``You're talking about Mother Nature, or the man
upstairs, saying, `This is it for First National Bank. Boom!'''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Installed in May in a 200,000-square-foot data processing center
now nearing completion here, the system uses four fuel cells, each
about the size of a tractor-trailer truck's trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike conventional power plants, in which massive metal
armatures produce current by spinning rapidly within magnetic
poles, fuel cells have hardly any moving parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fat, dumb and happy,'' in the words of Richard A. Neal, a
technician who services the system, they are expected to run around
the clock, except for a 36-hour shutdown each year for maintenance.
Technicians here plan to shut the cells down one a time, and even
if one of the remaining three should fail while the fourth is down
for maintenance, they will have enough power to keep computers
humming.
</P>
<P>
   Though fuel cells of one sort or another have been in commercial
use since 1992, this installation has become one of the hot sites
in Omaha, attracting techno-pilgrims from as far away as South
Africa seeking the promise of eternal life for their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Sure Power Corp. of Danbury, Conn., which oversaw the
installation here, believes that the technology could have saved
months of research data that were lost by Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells have been held out by advocates as a quick way to
supply electricity in small, environmentally friendly packages in
places where transmission lines are overloaded or would be hard to
install. A similar fuel cell now supplies power for a police
substation in Central Park in New York, in a spot that already had
natural gas but did not have good electrical connections.
</P>
<P>
   Another cell, running at a sewage treatment plant in Yonkers,
N.Y., makes electricity from methane gas, which is produced as a
byproduct in such plants and would otherwise pollute the
atmosphere. The electricity it generates helps offset the plant's
power consumption.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 ONSI fuel cells are in service worldwide, and more
are about to be installed. One will go into the basement of 4 Times
Square, a new building with a variety of clean-energy technologies.
Donald S. Stein, Onsi's manager of customer support, said that
because fuel cells did not produce the vibrations or emissions of
turbines or other combustion generators they could be installed in
many locations unobtrusively.
</P>
<P>
   Phosphoric acid-based cells have had their ups and downs. Onsi
laid off some employees earlier this year and raised prices because
its market was not growing as anticipated. But some experts think a
large market for phosphoric acid could be found with companies
that, like First National Bank, have a need for reliability that
approaches obsessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first market segment,'' said Art Mannion,
executive vice president of Sure Power. With more experience and
volume, he said, the price of the cells would drop.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a use for the waste heat helps make the price bearable.
The bank, for example, will use the hot water produced by the cells
to melt snow in the moat, but there are many potential uses for
such heat. Even so, a utility company or a company that needs
electricity still has to find another reason to justify the expense
of fuel cells. That is not likely to change anytime soon, unless a
consensus on global warming and the need for greater efficiency
takes hold. Increasing demand, coupled with anticipated savings
from mass production, could finally generate a market for the
devices.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's motivation is the assurance that it will never leave
a customer standing at a retailer's cash register or at an ATM with
a card that does not work because the computers are down. Hughes
estimates that such an outage costs the bank $6 million an hour,
including goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's problem is that the electricity from utilities is
totally inadequate to the needs of a computer. In the old days,
power glitches never mattered, because they never registered on
lights, motors, toasters and the other relatively insensitive
devices that consumed power. Mainframe computers are more finicky;
experts say they will not tolerate a disruption much longer than
eight milliseconds, or eight thousandths of a second. That kind of
a glitch is too short for electric utilities to even log as a
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from what engineers describe as the inherent stability of
the fuel cells, the system here is redundant in all the ways
engineers could dream up. Each of the four fuel cells produces 200
kilowatts.The bank has 350 kilowatts of critical load, meaning that
any two cells would be adequate. Electricity from the utility
company is not essential unless the fuel cells fail, but engineers
like to have it there to keep the alternating current from the fuel
cell in perfect step with the grid. The bank's electric feeds come
from two different substations.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas comes from two mains. A few weeks ago, a contractor
working on a construction project sliced into one of the mains,
forcing the gas company to turn it off. But the bank's power system
automatically switched to the other gas main.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were 3 blocks away,'' Hughes said of the sliced main.
``They could have blown up, and we wouldn't have cared anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Backing up the fuel cells are two ``mechanical batteries,'' each
a five-ton steel flywheel, spinning at 3,100 revolutions per minute
in a sealed container of helium, which creates less friction than
air. They take 45 minutes to spin up to operating speed. If the
fuel cells falter, a generator taps the momentum of the flywheels
and uses it to make current, for 45 seconds. That is long enough
for two diesel generators, each rated at 1,250 kilowatts, to start
up. As long as one works, the system is fine. Six thousand gallons
of fuel oil, enough for 10 days, is stored nearby.
</P>
<P>
   If a pump seal fails, a belt breaks or something else goes
wrong, the system beeps Neal or another technician. ONSI, from its
headquarters in Connecticut, can view a schematic diagram of the
system over the Web, complete with detailed operating data. Soon
Neal and another technician will be able to do the same from home.
</P>
<P>
   The system has paged technicians twice since May. In each case,
it sensed instability in the power grid and automatically cut
itself loose.
</P>
<P>
   Four blocks away at the headquarters of the Omaha Public Power
District, executives are cooperating and learning what they can
about how the cells operate and interface with their system, but
they remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the main sources of shutdown risk in the
Sure Power system are human error, but that is hard to quantify,
said Timothy J. Burke, vice president of the district. Comparing
the reliability of the fuel cells to a traditional
battery-and-diesel-generator backup system, he said, would take
about 10 years and probably would detect no difference.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment the bank is using all the fuel cells' output
internally and guaranteeing to continue to buy a certain amount of
power from the district; otherwise, it would have to pay a fee for
the right to tap into the grid without notice.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, electric utilities might install fuel cells on
their own land or perhaps in customers' basements. The Omaha Power
District plans to buy a fuel cell of its own soon.

 &HT;    Couch gets early call
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEREA, Ohio _ Tim Couch's first starting assignment as a
professional quarterback will come sooner rather than later, Browns
coach Chris Palmer announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner? How about four days from now.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said the rookie Couch, not Ty Detmer, will take the
team's first snaps Saturday night against the Minnesota Vikings in
the christening of Cleveland Browns Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the spring I said I would like to give Couch a chance
to start one of the preseason games,'' Palmer said. ``And this is
the one we selected.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple as that? Maybe. But don't think for a minute that Palmer
put all the preseason dates in a hat and just happened to pick this
one. After a three-year hiatus from professional football, fans
can't get enough of the Browns, who will be playing their first
game in Cleveland since Dec. 24, 1995. And after watching him
complete 10 passes in a row in the Aug. 9 Hall of Fame Game victory
over the Dallas Cowboys, the football populace can't get enough of
Couch, the former University of Kentucky marksman who symbolizes
the team's future.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the Browns are anxious to see what the No. 1
overall pick in April's college draft does when surrounded by the
first team offense. They are betting nearly $50 million over the
next seven years that his right arm contains a Super Bowl or two.
</P>
<P>
   Neither quarterback exactly enjoyed the night of his life
Saturday in a 30-3 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Detmer, a
journeyman with NFL stops in Philadelphia, Green Bay and San
Francisco, marched the Browns 10 plays to a field goal on their
first possession, but accomplished little else. Couch's completions
(5) barely outnumbered his sacks (3) as the Buccaneers won the
battle of second units.
</P>
<P>
   Informed of the switch Tuesday before practice, Couch spent the
day working with the first team offense, which, for the time being,
also includes Sedrick Shaw at running back rather than Terry Kirby.
And, for what it's worth, hulking Scott Rehberg appears to have won
the right guard battle, nosing out Orlando Bobo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm elated to get this opportunity,'' Couch said. ``When Coach
Palmer told me, I just kinf of smiled a little and said, 'Sounds
good to me.' I'll be anxious all week. Hopefully, I can go out and
have a good showing. It means a lot to me to be out there and take
the first snap in the new stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said he wants to use Detmer late in the first half and
have him run a two-minute drill if the opportunity arises. He did
not rule out bringing Couch back in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer took the news of his apparent demotion like a veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's the No. 1 pick,'' he said. ``They want to evaluate him
in every aspect of the game and see how much progress he's made.
I've spent enough time as a backup in this league to know how to
prepare. I don't look at it like they're trying to light a fire
under me or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Palmer cautioned against reading too much into the
quarterback shuffle, there is a growing sense that Couch can win
the starting job if he performs better than Detmer over the final
three exhibitions. Palmer still says Detmer would be the starter if
the season opened this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go out and play really well, I don't think it's going to
hurt me,'' Couch said. ``It's going to be a great challenge for me.
I just need to stay relaxed and make plays.''

COMIC BOOKS RIDICULE LEADER OF OUTLAWED CHINESE SPIRITUAL MOVEMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For the ordinary Chinese citizen who may be tiring of
the government's relentless crusade denouncing Falun Gong, the
spiritual movement that was outlawed last month, there is now an
easy-to-read version: the comic book.
</P>
<P>
   Full of cartoons that try to ridicule Li Hongzhi, Falun Gong's
founder, the new comic books drip with so much political venom that
they capture the labored nature of the campaign in a way that
verges on parody. The comic books recently went on sale here for 75
cents each.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Falun Gong campaign, the largest and broadest political
campaign in a decade, is both as thorough and as stilted as
government-orchestrated movements from decades past, when access to
information was limited and ordinary people swallowed what they
were told more easily.
</P>
<P>
   If this year's campaign is a demonstration of the durable power
of government propaganda that survives in China today, it also
seems distinctly out of touch with an increasingly pluralistic
society.
</P>
<P>
   A central feature is a demonization of Li, who now lives in New
York. A deafening barrage of broadcasts and articles in the state
media each day portray Li as a charlatan and an evil genius, though
not a very smart one.
</P>
<P>
   The comic books distill the government's claims against Li into
their simplest form. Even the title of the first such book, ``Li
Hongzhi: The Man and His Evil Deeds,'' carries the kind of
political defamation that the Communist Party mastered in previous
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   On the book's opening page, a drawing of Li shows him pretending
to be a holy figure, with a caption that reads, in part, ``His
illegal doings seriously disrupted the normal order of society,
causing chaos in people's social and moral principles.''
</P>
<P>
   You might think Li single-handedly brought China to the brink of
social collapse. But it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   The caption beneath another drawing reaches even further: ``Li
Hongzhi spread Falun Gong's malicious distortions, raising an
apocalyptic view that created social terror.''
</P>
<P>
   The look of these comic books is distinctly reminiscent of the
cartoons that were drawn about the Gang of Four, the leftist
radicals who were arrested after the death of Mao in 1976 and
blamed for pushing China into chaos in the 1960s and '70s. Oddly,
the characters in the new cartoons wear clothing styles that were
popular 20 and 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look so strange,'' said a Chinese businessman who
expressed amazement at the old-fashioned nature of the anti-Falun
Gong campaign. ``It's as though we are reliving a bad dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a month into the campaign, Chinese authorities are still
running it full-blast.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports have ridiculed Li for stressing the merits of
frugality and simple living to his followers while he bought a
fancy house in Changchun, his hometown in northeastern China,
though when shown on television it did not look more luxurious than
an ordinarily comfortable two-bedroom apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some attacks have been so vicious and loaded with extreme
political comparisons that they seem to veer close to farce. A
recent issue of Southern Weekend, a Guangzhou-based newspaper,
likened Li to a ``despotic tyrant like Hitler,'' and then indulged
in parallels to favorite Communist Party villains of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are familiar with the cult of personality created by Li
Hongzhi and Falun Gong and Li's claim to be a savior,'' the
newspaper said. ``This is the political legacy of the Cultural
Revolution, as `the savior' kind of idolatry fabricated by Lin Biao
and Jiang Qing and their ilk are deep-rooted in the hearts of the
Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lin was chosen as Mao's deputy, but died mysteriously in what
the authorities said was a plane crash that followed a failed plot
to assassinate Mao. Ms. Jiang was Mao's wife. After his death in
1976, she was arrested as a member of the Gang of Four and
imprisoned until 1991, when she hanged herself.
</P>
<P>
   The comic books, like numerous accounts in newspaper articles,
seem to revel in ridiculing Li for changing his birthday from July
7 to May 13, apparently to suggest to followers that he was born on
the same day as the Buddha.
</P>
<P>
   The comic books also make much of Li's story that he was in
Australia on April 25 this year, and knew nothing about the
stunning demonstration by Falun Gong followers when they surrounded
Zhongnanhai, the exclusive compound in central Beijing where
China's leaders live and work.
</P>
<P>
   As the authorities proved by digging up Beijing airport records
of Li's entry on April 22 and exit on April 24, he was actually in
Beijing just before the demonstration. Li has said since that he
flew to Beijing to change planes, and that he never spoke to anyone
in Falun Gong while he was in China.
</P>
<P>
   To many Falun Gong followers, the official attempts to defame Li
are so patently slanted as to be absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those things they are saying on TV are untrue,'' said a
real-estate salesman surnamed Gao, who approached a reporter to
insist that Falun Gong is being misrepresented in official
accounts. ``They take the worst things that happened to anyone and
blame it all on Falun Gong.''

PHOTOGRAPHERS MAY NOT BE CHARGED IN CRASH THAT KILLED DIANA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ French prosecutors may not press charges against the
nine photographers and a courier who have been investigated for
possibly contributing to the automobile crash here two years ago
that killed Diana, Princess of Wales, lawyers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Diana; her companion, Emad Mohammed al-Fayed, who was known as
Dodi; and a driver died in a high-speed automobile accident on Aug.
31 while trying to outrun a pack of photographers on motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested the photographers and a motorcycle driver
for one of them at the scene, a tunnel underneath Place de l'Alma
on the right bank of the Seine, and they have been under formal
investigation for manslaughter and failing to aid the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marc Coblence, a lawyer for one of the photographers, said
Monday evening that he had heard ``all over the place'' that the
state prosecutor had recommended dismissing the charges for lack of
evidence. But he said he had not received official confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   An investigating magistrate, Herve Stephan, led the inquiry and
turned the case over to the state prosecutor earlier this summer.
Under the French judicial system, Stephan will have the final say
over whether the photographers should go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone call to the prosecutor's office was not answered.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies and blood tests have established the main cause of the
crash: the driver, Henri Paul, had three times the legal limit of
alcohol in his blood when the Mercedes hurtled into a support
pillar in the tunnel shortly after midnight at a speed estimated at
well over 60 miles an hour. Paul was the acting security director
of the Ritz Hotel, which is owned by Fayed's father.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses said the Mercedes brushed a white Fiat just
before entering the tunnel, but police searches in Paris and
countrywide appeals for the driver of the car to come forward
failed to find it.

 &HT;    AirTran raises fares, citing Delta increases
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AirTran Airlines has raised its fares in about a third
of the markets it serves from Atlanta. The Orlando-based carrier
said the hikes are in reaction to across-the-board increases Delta
Air Lines announced Aug.13.
</P>
<P>
   The increases affect 20 out of 30 destinations from Atlanta,
said Air Tran spokeswoman Cara Maruskin.
</P>
<P>
   At Delta, three-day, advance-purchase fares and walk-up fares
increased $20 each way. On Delta's seven-day and 14-day
advance-purchase fares, the increase will be $5 each way.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran made more selective increases and even some decreases in
fares, said Kevin Healy, vice president/planning. In some markets,
AirTran increased fares less than Delta did. For example, from
Atlanta to New York's LaGuardia airport, Delta's one-way, walk-up
fare increased to $269, from $249. AirTran reduced its fare to $209
for a comparable seat.
</P>
<P>
   No other increases are planned, Healy said, and AirTran
announced another sale Monday. To stimulate fall and early winter
travel, the airline will discount 30 destinations from Atlanta on a
seven-day advance purchase made by Aug. 23. Travel must end Dec.
16.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokeswoman Jackie Pate said the airline increases fares
based on demand _ what the market will bear. ``For instance,
because of demand we have gone to hourly service from Atlanta to
Boston and Atlanta to LaGuardia,'' Pate said. ``The increases are
open-ended, indefinite, based on the competitive situation in the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current industry conditions _ some analysts say this is
the top of the market _ many sales are false sales, said Randy
Peterson, editor of InsideFlyer magazine, a monthly consumer
publication. ``I think they are shoring up sales by getting fares
back up, only to put them on sale in the future. We as passengers
only react to the word `sale,' '' not to the usual price for a
ticket, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain Airfares from Atlanta (one-way)
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C. (Dulles) $59
</P>
<P>
   Boston $69

COLLEGES GIVING ADVERTISERS ACCESS TO CAMPUS WEB SITES

<P>
   Starting Tuesday, when students at Appalachian State University
check their e-mail or course outlines online, they will be looking
at advertising from dozens of companies including Amazon.com, Dell
Computer and an apartment-locator service called SpringStreet.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar will be happening soon at Villanova
University, the University of Memphis, the University of Oregon,
the University of Idaho and more than 500 other institutions that
have signed up commercial companies to run campus Web sites and
e-mail services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas '98 was the first `e-Christmas.' We think this is
the first `e-back to school,''' said Chad Muir, chief executive of
Campus Pipeline, a company that says it has agreements to provide
Web services to 420 colleges and universities, including
Appalachian State, at little or no cost.
</P>
<P>
   While at many universities students continue to use Web pages
that the schools have created and paid for themselves, at these 500
schools advertisers will be paying the bills. And the placement of
advertising on what some regard as the purest area of the Internet
_ the educational domain _ has spurred an acrimonious debate.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is what place advertising should have in the college
environment, real or virtual, particularly in public institutions.
Some educators are alarmed at what they see as a crass commercial
intrusion, yet administrators and others argue that faced with
financial constraints, they have little choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place for commercial advertisements within the
precincts of any school that takes its educational mission
seriously,'' said Scott Rice, an English professor at San Jose
State University who is researching the effects of
commercialization on education.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Williams, director of information-technology services at
Appalachian State, said he had heard such arguments. But that is
not stopping Appalachian State _ a public institution in Boone,
N.C., with 12,500 students _ from adopting the advertising model
and avoiding the need to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to
create the Web sites on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will say that it's not ethical to advertise,''
Williams said. ``Given our druthers, we'd rather not ourselves. But
it's a pretty attractive model. We'll live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has rolled out the program by instructing 2,500
first-year students at Appalachian State to log into the system
this week. They will be among the first in the country to
experience such advertising-based pages on a university Web site.
Each page includes a square advertisement _ what the company likes
to call a ``sponsorship'' _ in the top right-hand corner.
</P>
<P>
   A page labeled Campus Central has information about campus
events as well as paid advertisements _ not labeled as such _ that
link to businesses offering textbooks, financial aid information,
educational testing services, auctions and housing. A Web shopping
section will provide additional links to online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Campus Pipeline will also try to learn more about what is
essentially a captive audience. When students first log into campus
Web sites, they will be asked to fill out an optional form about
their interests. If they do, they will receive product pitches in
their e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members at Appalachian State are just learning of the
deal _ and several are voicing concerns. ``We're throwing our
freshmen to the wolves,'' said Andrew Koch, an associate professor
of political science. ``The university has become a shill for the
corporate community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells volumes,'' he continued, ``about the university,
its funding, and the business mindset that has taken over.''
</P>
<P>
   But as campuses struggle with the costs of technology _ and the
constant need to upgrade it _ such deals are becoming more and more
attractive, administrators say. Creating an internal Web service,
known as an intranet, that seamlessly pulls information from
multiple databases around campus could cost as much as $2 million
for a midsized public university, if not more. Public universities,
especially, are finding it difficult to pay such costs while facing
tightening budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Campus Pipeline, a start-up based in Salt Lake City, began
approaching colleges late last year. It has investments from Sun
Microsystems, Dell Computer and McKinsey &AMP; Co., among others, and
says it intends to bring 100 of its 420 clients online by the end
of the fall term.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Campus Pipeline, at least one other company,
called YouthStream, is offering similar services, and says it has
signed up more than 100 schools. YouthStream, which is based in New
York City, has opened a site called MyBytes.Com, which provides
students with online calendars, materials to supplement their
classes, financial-aid information and Web pages for courses if
professors choose to use them. Each page includes an advertisement
or a link to an electronic shopping area.
</P>
<P>
   Some students are practically expecting to be awash in
promotions as soon as they log on to their college's Web site. ``I
don't see anything wrong with it, unless it gets out of hand,''
said Ken Greene, a junior at the University of Memphis. ``That's
all the Web is, is lots of advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   But the concept is a striking departure for most institutions of
higher education. Academia, after all, is where the Internet grew
up, and for years, as the Web has become increasingly
commercialized, colleges have kept their distance, priding
themselves on creating an online presence that is promotion-free.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, however, colleges have been bombarded by pitches
from companies that are eager to gain electronic access to the
Net-savvy student market. Many are approaching athletic
departments, hoping to strike deals to promote apparel or soft
drinks on pages about sports teams. Policy-makers at some colleges
are even being approached by administrators on their own campuses
who want to provide Web links to online stores like Amazon.Com, so
that the school can take in commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The academy is not a billboard community,'' said Margaret
Miller, president of the American Association for Higher Education.
``But it is also the case that the academy is subject to the same
economic strains as the rest of the world.'' The result, Dr. Miller
said, is a ``blurring line'' that is spurred on by the costs of
technology.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Appalachian State, Williams said, ``There is no way we could
have done it ourselves.'' As one of Campus Pipeline's first
schools, Appalachian State has not yet had to pay anything for the
services. Other schools may have to pay for installation, which
could cost as much as $32,000, but which administrators say is
still far less than the cost of designing and maintaining the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said Williams, colleges like Appalachian State do not
have much choice. Students now expect to be able to fill out
financial-aid forms and register for classes online. Colleges that
do not offer such services may lose their ability to attract
students.
</P>
<P>
   A similar approach was taken almost a decade ago by Channel One,
a program started by the Whittle Communications company that
supplied middle schools and high schools with television sets and
paid for them with commercials. It is still derided by some
educators as a channel for pushing advertising in front of captive
students.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest example, the executives of the Web-based
companies see their approach as nothing more than a continuation of
a trend that has already become a big part of higher education.
Public and private universities of all sizes have already turned
over dining services to Marriott, student unions to Taco Bell,
copying centers to Kinkos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are increasingly getting out of specialized services
that they would rather outsource,'' said Harlan Peltz,
YouthStream's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many educators say they want a line to be drawn,
particularly when it comes to spaces _ on- or off line _ where
students are supposed to be learning and exploring.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ehrlich, a former president of Indiana University, said
he is troubled by the idea of advertisements on sites where
professors hold online office hours or post syllabi. ``I think that
is much too intrusive,'' said Ehrlich, who is now a fellow at the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Other colleges with large endowments, like most Ivy League
schools, have declined to have commercially sponsored Web sites.
Many of them say that they have the resources to create online
services like admissions and registration without outside help.
That may lead students at less selective schools to be exposed to a
barrage of advertising, while students at elite schools are
insulated from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You create a different set of haves and have-nots, so to
speak,'' said Jose-Marie Griffiths, chief information officer at
the University of Michigan, where the idea of having commercially
sponsored Web pages was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   For those that have signed up, protecting students' privacy has
been a large concern. As Campus Pipeline and YouthStream collect
information about their students, university administrators say
that they want to make sure that the information is not sold or
traded to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hilton, an assistant director in the computing center at
the University of Oregon, said that her campus has been working
with Campus Pipeline to whittle down the list of questions they ask
students and to keep the information confidential. ``That took a
while to make that point,'' she said.

LEMUEL M. WELLS, AT 78; CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST, PR SPECIALIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lemuel Marshall Wells, a public relations specialist sometimes
refered to as a one-man think tank because of his encylopedic
knowledge of political affairs, died of heart failure Saturday in
his home in the Harlem section of New York City. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wells was a behind-the-scenes adviser to two New York
congressmen, the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell and Charles Rangell. He
was also an adviser to Harlem power brokers Percy Sutton and J.
Raymond Jones.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Savannah, Ga., and attended Tennessee State
University before serving in the Army during World War II. After
the war, he graduated from Howard University.
</P>
<P>
   He was an aide to John F. Kennedy during his presidential
campaign and also was a public relations aide to Boston mayor John
F. Collins and Massachusetts governor Foster Furcolo.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to New York City in the late 1960s, he was director
of public relations for the Urban League for several years and a
public relations consultant to New York State assmblywoman
Geraldine L. Daniels before becoming a freelance speechwriter and
political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, he was an assistant to the president of
Ebony magazine. He also hosted a radio program that featured black
spirituals on WERD in Atlanta, Ga., and owned and operated a
recording company in Boston called Veritas Records.
</P>
<P>
   He summered on Martha's Vineyard for many years and was a public
relations director of the Boston branch of the NAACP when it was
headed by president Kenneth Guscott and executive director Tom
Atkins and the duo decided to participate in the St. Patrick's Day
Parade in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ugly incidents and episodes that prevented the Boston
NAACP from participating jarred the nation,'' Mr. Wells wrote in a
letter to the editor published in the Globe on Feb. 16, 1987
</P>
<P>
   ``If those individuals expressing their resistance to the NAACP
had known the history of their ancestors in America, when there
were signs that denied them work, saying, `No Irish or dogs need
apply,' they might have thought differently on that St. Patrick's
Day,'' Mr. Wells wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``History can be manufactured, but facts cannot. It was black
Americans who, by their majority vote, gave the presidency of the
United States to John F. Kennedy, the descendant of an impoverished
immigrant Boston family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Kennedy who drafted the legislation that culminated and
brought sweeping changes for the civil rights revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Massachusetts Gov.Foster Furcolo who convened the first
civil rights conference in America, which ignited the savants of
the nation's academic world to demand a role in probing and
offering solutions to civil rights problems. Boston Mayor John F.
Collins initiated the redevelopment and revitalization of Boston
for the betterment of all of its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wells leaves a sister, June Wells of Savannah, Ga.; and a
brother, James F. Jr. of Opa-Locka, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial services are being planned in Boston and New York City.

DOLE BRINGS IOWA SUCCESS TO N.H. CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Elizabeth Dole marched into the first-primary
state Monday touting her weekend achievement in the Iowa straw poll
and hoping for a subsequent boost here.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does for me is it shows our invisible army is a
reality,'' Dole said in an interview following a talk to the Rotary
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Dole said she is picking up support from men and women who have
been disenchanted with the political process and from people who
have long been uninvolved in politics. She said she now hopes to
earn the support of voters who had previously pledged their
allegiance to Lamar Alexander, who dropped out of the presidential
race Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The former Red Cross director said she is less concerned about
the other candidates for president than she is with continuing to
improve her own standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing,'' she said,
citing her visits to house parties and other small groups in Iowa
and New Hampshire. But when the competition has concluded in the
next six to seven months, Dole predicted that the candidate with
the most experience will win.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Devitte, Dole's New Hampshire chairman, said the
campaign's phones have been ringing non-stop since her third-place
finish in Ames Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to bring a lot of people's attention to the race,''
Devitte said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chateau Restaurant, Dole took a moment to brag about Iowa
and her tightfisted approach to competing there before going on to
talk about her record of public service and what she would like to
do as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are coming off a great victory in Iowa,'' she told the a
lunchtime crowd of 60 at the Rotary Club. ``To come in the top
three and you didn't spend millions of dollars _ you have to count
that as a strong victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole spent about $250,000 to organize her supporters in Iowa
compared to about $1.5 million spent by Steve Forbes, a publisher,
and $800,000 spent by Governor George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Dole continued to stress that her campaign is making history, as
the first serious candidacy of a woman for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of little girls come up to me and say, `But I wanted
to be the first woman president,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another young girl gave Dole a ruler with pictures of all the
past presidents of the United States. ``She said, `There's no women
here,' '' Dole said, holding up the ruler for her audience to see.
</P>
<P>
   Dole also said President Clinton has mishandled the United
States' relations with China, complaining that he conducts foreign
policy by political polling. The president should condemn China's
human rights abuses as well as thefts of nuclear secrets, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to that, I think you can have a separate track for
talking about trade,'' she said. Dole said trade with China is
essential because 20 percent of the world's population lives there.

<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ Having bid occasionally tearful good-byes to
their loved ones, the 160 newcomers to the lakeside university
campus here pasted on their nametags and embarked on a two-day
introduction to college life.
</P>
<P>
   At times it was like boot camp, especially when a sergeant from
the university police, a 9mm pistol on his belt, informed them of
the first-time penalty for underage drinking: a $209 fine and a
90-day suspended driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   At other times it was like group therapy, as when a dean who
exuded all the comfort of a home-cooked meal, assured them that it
was painful to separate from those who had shared a roof with them
for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big leap from high school to the University of
Wisconsin, Madison,'' Sheila Spear, the dean of students, told
them, describing a campus of 40,000 inhabitants. ``It's like moving
from the farm leagues to the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   But none in this crowd would be graduating with the class of
2003: they were all parents, and at the moment, it was their
transition, and their jitters, that were of utmost concern.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that has been repeated hundreds of times on dozens of
campuses across the country this summer, administrators have been
gathering the parents of incoming freshmen to gird them for the
looking-glass journey on which they and their families are about to
embark. While orientations for the freshmen themselves, especially
Outward-Bound-style bonding missions set in the woods, have been
fixtures at colleges for more than a decade, the systematic
immersion of parents is a relatively recent development.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one has undertaken a precise tally, Cherry Callahan,
the former president of the National Association of Student
Personnel Administrators, estimates that dozens, and likely
hundreds, of the nation's 2,200 four-year colleges have added or
substantially expanded parent orientation programs only in the last
few years. Their purpose is plain: to enlist parents as coaches to
prod their students to greatness; to ply them with information
about their children's new lives, and to address the parents' own
roller-coaster emotions as they prepare to break away from their
companions of the last 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   At Bemidji State University, a school of 4,000 students in
northern Minnesota, parents are sent a homework assignment in
advance of their orientation: a 43-page script that instructs them
how to talk to their children about the odyssey at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time that you deem appropriate, approach your student
with the following questions,'' the manual advises, suggesting, as
an ice-breaker, ``What can I (we) do as a parent(s) to assist you
with the process of adjusting to college life.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Alabama, freshmen parents are told at their
orientation to feel free to call a toll-free hotline installed just
for them in the dean's office. There, they can find a sympathetic
voice _ someone willing, if pressed hard enough, to track down a
student to upbraid him for not calling home as often as his mother
would like.
</P>
<P>
   At MacAlester College in Saint Paul, Minn., the parent
orientation includes a component lifted from an elementary school
open house: before their students even take a test, the parents
spend a day running through their children's course schedule, which
entails sitting in their child's seat, meeting his professors and
listening to sample lectures.
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds like a grand scheme designed partly to coddle
baby boomers _ many of them raised on Dr. Spock, weaned from their
own parents on an analyst's couch and now confronted with the
daunting prospect of becoming college parents themselves _ then
that's hardly accidental, says Ms. Callahan, the associate vice
chancellor for student affairs at the University of North Carolina
Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my parents never talked about their feelings very
much, particularly my father, before I went to college,'' said Ms.
Callahan, 50, who graduated from Greensboro in 1971. ``This is a
generation, the baby boomers, that is more open than their parents
were in talking with their children about life experience, social
issues and what may lie ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``They also want to know what they're getting for
their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at the University of Wisconsin, at least one parent of
almost all of the 5,700 incoming freshmen accepted the university's
invitation to spend two days on campus for one of 33 sessions in
July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 160 parents in the last group, who were on campus
Aug. 10 and 11, said they paid the $40 parent orientation fee
because the university emphasized the program's value, because they
wanted a better understanding of what their children were going
through or because they were seeking ways to wrestle with their own
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes red from crying, Tama Schmidt, 38, who had dropped out
of college in 1981 to raise her daughter Taylor, described how she
had been readying herself for Taylor's expected departure for
Madison on Sept. 2: each night the two have been watching a
different ``weepy mother-daughter movie.'' Though Mrs. Schmidt had
managed to get through ``Terms of Endearment'' without choking up,
she did not fare as well during ``Steel Magnolias.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour drive from New Richmond, Wis., to Madison had
offered little respite, with Mrs. Schmidt's mind replaying a
virtual highlight reel of her daughter's life, from birth to her
selection last year as ``Miss New Richmond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fear,'' said Mrs. Schmidt, a purchasing agent, ``is
that she's not going to be under my roof every night of the week
and I'm not going to know what she's up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Woods, 57, an architect from Milwaukee, arrived at the
orientation sweating, and covered with hay. He had spent the day
getting his daughter's thoroughbred _ she jumps competitively _
settled in a nearby stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him food when he got here and he met another horse so
he was happy,'' Woods said. ``He probably has a bigger stall than
she has a room.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he grew mournful when he realized that, for the first
time in a decade, he and his daughter, Jennifer, 18, ``aren't going
to spend time in the barn together.'' But he said he was also
relishing the prospect of free time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get reaquainted with my wife,'' Woods said.
``Need I say more.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter quickly interjected: ``I don't need to hear this.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   After dining with their daughters for the first session of the
orientation, Mrs. Schmidt and Woods were then separated from their
children for the balance of the program. While the students picked
their courses with their academic advisers, their parents were
sequestered across campus, their every concern addressed in
lectures and question-and-answer forums that went far deeper, in
time and substance, than the more social parent visiting weekends
that universities have hosted for generations.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's session, the parents were reminded, yet again,
how much lighter their wallets would be: the average cost of
tuition and room-and-board would be $8,987.70 for state residents,
and $18,301.70 for others, with checks due Oct. 1. They were told,
to their surprise, that that price included sheets, blankets and
pillowcases, to be laundered by the university each week if the
students desired. (The parents certainly liked the idea of
guaranteed clean linens.)
</P>
<P>
   And they were warned that, should their children require
hospitalization, there would likely be gaps between the basic
medical coverage provided by the university and their own policies,
many of which cover college-age children. (A hypothetical anecdote
about a freshman breaking an arm after her bike got caught in
railroad tracks caused palpable shudders.)
</P>
<P>
   But the speaker who seemed to draw out the most anxieties was
Sergeant Kurt Feavel, of the University of Wisconsin Police, who
assured the audience that his employer was ``the real police,''
with full jurisdiction over the campus, including the authority to
arrest students on criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The date-rape drug, is it a problem,'' one parent asked, via
an index card submitted from the audience, about a substance that,
when dropped in alcohol, can make someone faint, and ultimately
forgetful. The sergeant responded that ``we fortunately don't have
that problem,'' adding that there had been only three suspected
instances of the drug's use on campus in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Another card demanded, ``Is it dangerous for women to walk alone
on campus at night?''
</P>
<P>
   Again, Feavel assured that ``we're fortunate we don't have a lot
of assaults on campus.'' Yet he directed the parents toward a
poster advertising a self-defense program in which ``your daughter
will learn verbal, physical and psychological techniques to protect
and defend herself on and off campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the father of the equestrian, said the brochure had
convinced him to enroll his daughter because, ``if she's really
backed up against a wall,'' she needs the ability to ``strike out
if she has to.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Schmidt, the teary movie-watcher who had despaired over
not knowing her daughter's every coming and going during the
upcoming fall, the entire seminar had proven as spiritual as it was
informative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel better,'' she said. ``You go home feeling a little
more educated about what's going to happen in the next couple of
weeks.''

ARBITRATOR TELLS BRUINS TO PAY KHRISTICH $2.8 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Bruins got the bill Monday, a total of $2.8
million, including tax and tip. Now they have to decide if they
want to dine on another year of Dmitri Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just $2.8 million,'' mulled Bruins general manager Harry
Sinden, shortly after learning of Khristich's arbitration award.
``That's all. A nice, tidy number.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach the 30-year-old Khristich, who earned $1.95
million last season, were unsuccessful. His agent, Ottawa-based
Larry Kelly, did not return a phone call from the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the
Bruins have until approximately 8 p.m. Wednesday to decide whether
they'll accept the arbitrator's decision. If they refuse it,
Khristich, a nine-year veteran, immediately would be reclassified
an unrestricted free agent, able to sign with any other NHL club.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, Sinden sounded as if he were leaning toward
trading Khristich _ even before deciding whether to accept or
decline the award _ or perhaps cutting him loose via ``walkaway''
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true, you don't want to give up an asset and get nothing
in return,'' said Sinden, who was highly critical of Khristich's
lackluster play when the playoffs ended in May. ``But we prepared
somewhat for that possibility when we signed Dave Andreychuk a few
weeks ago. Another factor in this is, Khristich will be 31 next
summer, and he'd be an unrestricted free agent then, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   All that considered, Sinden and top aide Mike O'Connell were
busy working the phones Monday, seeking to wheel the enigmatic
Ukrainian. According to Sinden, two or three clubs expressed
varying degrees of interest in Khristich, but none immediately
offered anything pleasing to Boston's palate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I'd say we had three clubs interested, but one has
gone by the wayside,'' he said. ``I'm afraid the number ($2.8
million) might have cooled their interest. In the case of the
others, so far they've only been interested in washing back the
same amount of salary to us, in the form of a couple of lesser
players.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins decide to make a deal, Sinden said, it wouldn't
necessarily be a priority to get a winger in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time,'' said Sinden, ``we'd probably talk
about any position in trade, or a draft choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Khristich decision, representing a 43.6 percent increase
over his 1998-99 salary, came slightly more than 48 hours after
defenseman Darren Van Impe collected a handsome arbitration award.
Van Impe, who made $425,000 last year, will earn $750,000 this
season and $825,000 in '00-01.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arbitrator looks at these things and bases them strictly
on statistics,'' said Sinden. ``That's hard. I'll give you an
example: In Khristich's case, at one point the arbitrator asked,
`What do you mean by full strength?' But that's what can happen
when your business is handed over to another party. It's risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prefer to look primarily at a player's contribution to
winning. Quite often, that is tied to statistics, but not always,
and in Van Impe's case we see a lot more of that _ contribution to
winning _ than in Khristich's case. But aribtrators can't see that;
all they can see are the statistics and comparable salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arbitration is a poor guideline to go by. Both Van Impe and
Khristich got generous awards. I'd say we're more willing to live
with the Van Impe decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Khristich, who went to arbitration last year and saw his pay
nearly double from $1 million, was seeking a $3.5 million award
this time. In a span of some 12 months, he has seen his salary
nearly triple, a sign of the league's inflationary times, and yet
one more signal that owners somehow will have to gain salary
restraints, likely in the form of a cap, when the CBA expires in
2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought out two players this spring because we couldn't
afford to keep them,'' said Sinden, referring to defenseman Dave
Ellett and winger/enforcer Ken Baumgartner. ``No ill feelings
toward either of them. They were good guys, and fine with our team.
But given what they made, their ice time, and the cost of replacing
them, those are the decisions you have to make. To keep doing
business, it requires some kind of ingenuity or trickery when
you're talking these kinds of increases.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sinden reported no movement in negotiations to sign Group 2 free
agent Byron Dafoe, the club's No. 1 netminder. ``Both sides have
made proposals,'' he said. ``After that, we both agreed to calm
down for two or three weeks and talk again. That probably means
we'll talk again this week.'' If Dafoe can't come to terms, the
Bruins would start Rob Tallas in net, likely with John Grahame as
his backup. Sinden isn't sure about Grahame's readiness for the big
time. ``He might be ready to back up,'' said Sinden. ``I'm not sure
he has quite enough experience to play a lot yet. But, witness Jim
Carey: How do you ever know about goalies?''

LACMA DECOMPRESSES WITH FRENCH IMPRESSIONISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In the old days they were known as ``summer
exhibitions,'' pleasant little artistic potpourri designed to
seduce the senses while awaiting autumn's inevitable arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, these works were on loan from wealthy private
collectors who'd retreated to their seaside cottages or country
villas for the season. Alert museums would pounce on the chance to
show the public art normally hidden behind gated walls.
</P>
<P>
   These exhibitions offered nothing too taxing, nothing too
profound, says J. Patrice Marandel, curator of European painting
and sculpture at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Instead,
their existence, like the idea of summer vacation itself, testified
to the transitory pleasures of modern, middle-class life, to the
luxury of savoring a mental day-off like a watermelon eaten to the
rind.
</P>
<P>
   Such pleasurable diversions, with no apologies, were Marandel's
objective in coordinating ``Around Impressionism: French Paintings
From the National Gallery of Art,'' the new LACMA exhibition that
opens today. Consisting of roughly 70 paintings by 26 major artists
spanning a period of nearly 100 years, the show unabashedly
concerns itself with pure visual beauty. It invites patrons to bask
in luminous, intimate views of the world whose preoccupation with
temporality belies their enduring popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a show for the eyes, not for the head, and there's
nothing wrong with that; that's what museums are supposed to do,''
Marandel says.
</P>
<P>
   Impressionism's story has been told many times, at great length,
and LACMA is making no attempt to oversell a familiar tale. There
will be no five-story banners of Monet's ``Japanese Footbridge''
strung from the ramparts of LACMA West, where ``Around
Impressionism'' will run through Nov. 29. After back-to-back
Picasso and van Gogh blockbusters, ``Around Impressionism'' is
letting LACMA take a breather.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a show like this, you don't have the kind of drama and
pathos that you have in the van Gogh exhibition,'' Marandel
comments on the low-key marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all the franchise names are here. There are no less than
five Manets, six Renoirs and seven Monets, along with significant
works by Degas, Gauguin's vivid ``Haystacks in Brittany'' and
Berthe Morisot's poignantly autobiographical ``The Sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a muted, undulating Sisley landscape and a dazzling
early van Gogh that sets drab Dutch peasant houses against effusive
flowerbeds under blue skies peeking through somber leaden clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Book-ending the show, and supplying its conceptual framework,
are works by impressionistic forerunners like Jean-Baptiste-Camille
Corot, Frederic Bazille and Gustav Courbet, as well as paintings by
Edouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard, whose dreamy, stage-set
interiors and ferociously intense palette inspired so many
20th-century artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're difficult to understand,'' Marandel says of Bonnard
works like ``Table Set in a Garden'' (1908) and ``A Spring
Landscape'' (1935). ``They're not always popular with the public
because he had a very shocking sense of color, I think. He worked
in the south of France, where the light is a bit more hard, like in
Southern California. They yield a lot of pleasure, but they're
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's time frame _ from Corot, whose career began around
1822, to Bonnard, who died in 1947 _ should help dissipate any
lingering idea that impressionism was a movement scorned, whose
practitioners were treated like pariahs. While it's true that
Paris' powerful salon-istas rejected the style as ephemeral,
influential poets and writers quickly championed impressionism,
while a large segment of the viewing public embraced it.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing taxing. Nothing profound. Just a new art form,
custom-made for preserving the vanishing summer days, for
remembering the light that fades all too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always think of the impressionists as the great rejected
painters, the people who did not make it,'' Marandel says. ``In
fact, they did make it. People responded much more positively than
we think. And history told us who was right.'' &QL;

BATTLE-SCARRED PATE CITED FOR COMPETITIVENESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ This banquet was only going to be the appetizer,
for Steve Pate was about to participate in the greatest golf feast
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Here he was, age 30, on top of his game, on top of the world. He
was a member of the 12-man 1991 US Ryder Cup team, recognized as
one of the finest practitioners of his sport on the planet, and
captain Dave Stockton was so impressed that he intended to use the
Ryder rookie in the maximum five matches against the Europeans at
Kiawah Island on the South Carolina coast.
</P>
<P>
   Now Pate was on his way to the first of a weekend full of
hosannahs, the introductory dinner in Charleston on the eve of the
matches. Riding with his wife, Sheri, in the next-to-last of a
13-limousine caravan escorted by police motorcycles, Pate was
blissfully unaware of the events unfolding ahead that were about to
jolt him from his idyll.
</P>
<P>
   A car crossed the path of the entourage, and a motorcycle
swerved to avoid it. That set off a chain reaction that caused the
three vehicles at the rear to collide.
</P>
<P>
   There was one victim of this metal-on-metal domino effect. Not
wearing a seat belt for one of the few times in his life, Pate was
thrown to the floor. He suffered severe abdominal bruising that
required attention at a local hospital. While he tried to gut out
the weekend, he was able to play in only one match _ losing with
partner Corey Pavin to Colin Montgomerie and Bernhard Langer, 2 and
1, in the four-ball segment on the second afternoon. So he was more
a bystander than a contributor as the Americans reclaimed the Cup,
ending an eight-year drought, their longest ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was unfortunate,'' said Pate. ``I did get to
play one match, and even though I was hurt, I didn't play too
badly, and it was nice to get a taste of it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was mostly famine after that. Pate won a tournament the
following year, then went into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play very well and had a bad attitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His downfall reached its nadir when he suffered a wrist injury
and entered only three tournaments in 1996. But that also turned
out to be his springboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a year off did a lot for my attitude,'' he said. ``It
was kind of like starting over, getting a fresh start.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's reached a fresh peak. In acknowledgement of his revival
the past two years _ capped by his victory in the 1998 CVS Charity
Classic, the PGA Tour's farewell stop at Pleasant Valley _ Pate was
named along with Tom Lehman Monday as Ben Crenshaw announced his
two captain's choices for the 1999 US Ryder Cup team. That group
will try to end the Americans' six-year drought against Europe,
their second longest ever, Sept. 24-26 at The Country Club in
Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference at Medinah Country Club the morning
after the PGA Championship _ the final leg of the biennial
qualifying process _ Crenshaw Monday saluted Pate's tenacity in
selecting him over the favorite for the second spot, Fred Couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man has a determination and a competitive attitude,''
said Crenshaw, ``and he has shown it in the last two years. He's a
very, very fierce competitor who would walk through a wall if you
asked him to.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate can only hope Crenshaw was speaking figuratively,
considering what he's already gone through in the Ryder Cup. But he
was understandably elated when the captain called him in his
Chicago hotel room at 11 p.m. Sunday after he'd finished tied for
eighth in the PGA _ four spots shy of where he needed to place in
order to lock up one of the 10 automatic berths.
</P>
<P>
   He left Medinah Sunday afternoon figuring his sleep wouldn't be
disturbed by any congratulatory phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very unlikely,'' Pate said of his chances at the time.
``Though not out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, who has a keen sense of fair play, may have decided
that Pate was owed this one, even though he was ranked only 14th in
Ryder points. And Pate, now 38, wasn't about to quibble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very much looking forward to going to Brookline,'' he
said. ``Ever since last summer when I started playing well, it
became high-priority on my list of goals. I didn't quite make it on
my own, needed a little help, but I'm glad to have it from Ben.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Pate had to abruptly end his teleconference. He was at
Chicago's O'Hare Airport, and his flight was due to leave.
Considering his initial Ryder experience, it was a much more
desirable mode of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman already had hit the road, having departed immediately
after a disappointing 34th-place finish here for Colorado, where he
is designing a golf course and relaxing with his family. Though he
hasn't won in three years and slipped to 12th on the points list,
behind Bob Estes, who finished sixth in the PGA, Lehman was
considered a shoo-in.
</P>
<P>
   In refreshing contrast to some of his teammates who have made an
issue of how Ryder profits are distributed for charity, Lehman has
said he would pay to play for the Cup. No bribery of Crenshaw was
necessary, for Lehman's credentials and commitment were
sufficiently impressive. At 40, he has been on the last two Ryder
teams, winning both of his singles matches, and he has played in
all but two tourmaments since May 28 in a hellbent campaign to make
it three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``That I haven't been home since May 28 speaks for itself,'' he
said via conference call. ``It's a long time to be on the road
practicing and playing and working on your game, and it was all
basically because I wanted to be on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   That was duly noted by Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about his diligence and determination, his
strength and his character,'' said the captain. ``He has always
said throughout the year, `I'm working hard to try to make your
team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So in the end, Crenshaw filled out his fragmented troops with a
couple of loyal soldiers. Both are battle-tested _ and in one case,
battle-scarred.

CRENSHAW'S EAGERNESS COULD FIRE US TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Ben Crenshaw was named the 22d US Ryder Cup
captain on Oct. 22, 1997. Since then, he probably hasn't been
thinking about Ryder Cup more than, oh, 99 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't 1947, when playing captain Ben Hogan's team whipped
up on the hapless Brits, 11-1. The poor fellows from across the
pond were still dealing with food rationing, for God's sake.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't 1967, when nonplaying captain Ben Hogan led an
American team to a 23 1/2-8 1/2 victory without being able to call
upon Jack Nicklaus (he wasn't yet a five-year PGA member, and by
the rules of the day was ineligible).
</P>
<P>
   The good old days of the swaggering Yanks hah-hahing their way
to an easy triumph in Ryder Cup competition are faded memories. The
new reality is that the US is on a two-match losing streak to the
Europeans. The man to whom the PGA of America has turned its lonely
eyes has, in this ever-exploding world of international golf, a
daunting task. Golfers now come from everywhere but McMurdo Sound.
The European team will have players from England, Scotland,
Northern Ireland, Spain, and Sweden, for sure, and it may very well
include a Frenchman (Jean Van de Velde) and a German (perennial
favorite Bernhard Langer). As they have demonstrated in the past
two competitions, these players know how to unify as a team, and
now they can rally around the Euro.
</P>
<P>
   And if the intention of the PGA pooh-bahs was to select as a
captain a man who would take this task very seriously, they have
come to the right place. Ben Crenshaw is so much in love with golf
and its traditions, and is so achingly sincere, that the process of
making the two captain's picks to go along with the 10 men who
played their way onto the team was in danger of consuming him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really was worried about him this week,'' confirms his wife,
Julie. ``This was a very tough week.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking Tom Lehman and Steve Pate to complete the team was the
easy part, if only because Crenshaw was choosing among great player
after great player after great player. Bob Estes would have been
fine. Chris Perry would have been fine. The ever-popular Fred
Couples would have been fine.
</P>
<P>
   He's got his 12 men. But does he have a T-E-A-M team?
</P>
<P>
   ``My job as a captain,'' Crenshaw outlines, ``is to bring these
guys together and bring the Cup back. That's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits that, the last two times, the opponents seemed to have
that certain je ne sais quoi that gets you over the top. He also
knows that the outside world assumes he'll be presiding over a
group that is capable of putting 'em up over the play-for-pay issue
that dominated the news last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That thing is behind us,'' he insists. ``I've talked to all
the players, and they're all looking forward to Boston. Regardless
of what happened, and how it happened, we have to be a team,
because they are a team. It's very simple. Noncomplex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had long talks with Mark (O' Meara) and Phil (Mickelson)
last night,'' adds Julie Crenshaw. ``They also gave their opinions
on the final two selections.''
</P>
<P>
   Before making up his mind on those two picks, Crenshaw talked to
everybody but Dr. Laura. That would include past captains such as
Lanny Wadkins and Tom Kite, veteran players, contemporary players,
and even caddies, whom he twice made reference to as great sources
of golf knowledge. He weighed past experience vs. current play. He
considered style of play, because he firmly believes that The
Country Club course is not friendly to everyone's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben is very diligent,'' says Julie Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the process, there was also a little push from
an outside force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking Monday to Mark O'Meara and Phil Mickelson and
then I got a phone call from O'Meara as he was on his way to the
airport,'' Crenshaw says. ``He said, `If memory serves me, in 1988
Steve Pate and I tied for third, two shots back of Nick Faldo and
Curtis Strange at The Country Club (in the US Open).' It was one of
the things that I overlooked, quite frankly, and I was sitting
right there with Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   Again we turn to Julie Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben was sure he had really thought things through, but that
phone call was fate,'' she reports. ``I really think that phone
call from Mark O'Meara made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw is so into this it's almost scary. He has revered The
Country Club since first playing there as a 16-year-old amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened my eyes to the world of golf,'' he says. ``It's
ironic that I would have such an honor at a place that I dearly
love. You can understand that this honor and pulling this team
together is something I will cherish for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-time Masters winner (1984, 1995), Crenshaw is 47 and knows
his own game is in serious decline. He has not made a cut in over a
year. For this man, with his renowned historical perspective, to be
given this captaincy at this particular time in his life is
tremendously appropriate. Ben Crenshaw was in need of a personal
pick-me-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My time out there (gesturing to the course) is just about
done,'' he says. ``It's time for players like me to step aside. I
now have an honor that has been given only a few. I just want to be
diligent and do justice to the ones who have come before me.''
</P>
<P>
   If the players on his team care half as much as he does, it's
over already.

LEHMAN, PATE TOP OFF US RYDER CUP SQUAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ In the end, it was no surprise that Ben Crenshaw
leaned on experience. It was a mild surprise as to whose experience
he favored.
</P>
<P>
   The US captain for next month's Ryder Cup matches at The Country
Club in Brookline, Mass., Monday tabbed Tom Lehman and Steve Pate _
who have a combined 26 years of PGA Tour play, 10 victories, and
three Ryder Cups _ to complete the 12-man team that will attempt to
wrest the coveted trophy from the Europeans for the first time
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw said the decision process was painful, because it meant
bypassing players with whom he was friendly. Fred Couples, a
fixture on the last five Ryder Cup teams and a player many
predicted would get one of the nods, was the most notable omission.
Crenshaw said he also considered Bob Estes, Lee Janzen, Steve
Stricker, and Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, 40, has played in the last two Ryder Cups, and his
selection was pretty much a given.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about his diligence and determination, his
strength and his character,'' said Crenshaw, who called Lehman late
Sunday night with the news.
</P>
<P>
   The second call went to 1991 Ryder Cup member Pate, though not
until Crenshaw had done some lengthy soul-searching. Not that the
US captain lacked faith in the 38-year-old Pate. On the contrary,
said Crenshaw, Pate ``is confident and he has played well and he
feels good about where his game is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls to those whom he bypassed were hard, said Crenshaw.
Particularly the one to Couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a personal note, that was the hardest to make,'' said
Crenshaw. ``The whole world loves Fred. Julie (Crenshaw's wife) and
I do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   What worked in favor of Lehman and Pate worked against Couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had said before that even if he plays mediocre, mediocre for
Fred is tremendous for somebody else,'' said Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Couples's recent form has barely been mediocre _
that is, when he has even played. He skipped the British Open, as
well as the three Tour events leading up to this weekend's PGA
Championship, just his 14th event of the year and fourth since June
1. He was 17th in the standings (the Top 10 are automatic picks),
but faded with weekend scores of 75-72 at Medinah CC and never came
close to playing himself onto the team.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman and Pate, on the other hand, have been in the weekly
lineup most of the year, their passion to make the Ryder Cup team
hardly a secret. At Medinah, Lehman tied for 34th, completing his
ninth tournament since June 1, a stretch that included the Greater
Milwaukee Open and Greater Hartford Open. Those are tournaments he
normally would not have entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to be on this team, and I knew I needed to
play,'' said Lehman, whose year has been solid. He lost at Bay Hill
in a playoff to Tim Herron, was fifth at the Greater Greensboro,
and runner-up at Milwaukee and the recent Buick Open.
</P>
<P>
   Pate's schedule was just as hectic. He has played 21 times this
year, seven times since June 1 (it would have been eight, but he
withdrew from the GHO after a death in the family). He closed the
week at Medinah 73-69 to finish tied for eighth, his fifth Top 10
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In Pate, Crenshaw has a fiery competitor, one who ``would walk
through a wall for you if you asked him to.''
</P>
<P>
   And after a week in which his top stars _ Tiger Woods, David
Duval, Phil Mickelson, and Mark O'Meara _ voiced opinions about the
Ryder Cup that prompted an emotional condemnation from Crenshaw,
the captain was most assuredly going to pick someone in whom he
sees loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman and Pate fit the bill, and Crenshaw emphasized that the
pay-for-play issue that divided the team during a Tuesday meeting
was a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked to all the players,'' said Crenshaw.
``Regardless of what happened this week and how it happened, we
have to be a team because we know that (the Europeans) are a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Lehman has demonstrated leadership in so many ways. Steve
Pate is somebody that the players know and understand where he
sits.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman said he was eager to gain revenge for Ryder Cup losses in
1995 and 1997 that he was a part of. Pate's Ryder Cup experience is
bittersweet; the US won the year he played, but Pate was injured
and played in only one match.
</P>
<P>
   If Crenshaw's call to Couples was a personal struggle (they have
been friends for many years), the one to Estes was tough from a
professional standpoint. Estes was 15th in the standings entering
the PGA Championship and needed to finish at least in a two-way tie
for fifth to jump into the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Like Crenshaw, Estes is a University of Texas graduate, a fact
that was not lost on the captain. When Estes got to 8 under through
15 holes Sunday, he moved into fourth place. But bogeys on 16 and
17 ruined his effort as he fell into a tie for sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that was lacking in his column was
experience,'' said Crenshaw. ``I look forward to him on many Ryder
Cup teams.''
</P>
<P>
   But not at The Country Club Sept. 24-26. That roster is filled.

7-1 REGALLY APPEALING WINS ADIRONDACK STAKES 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ The big shootout Monday between the
training superstars Bob Baffert and D. Wayne Lukas fizzled in the
dust of old Saratoga while John Kimmel was winning the Adirondack
Stakes, the career-building race for 2-year-old fillies, with the
7-1 outsider Regally Appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The dark bay daughter of Valid Appeal, racing for only the third
time in her career, won by the length of her head over Baffert's
Miss Wineshine, who has been billed as the other filly in a barn
dominated by the prima donna Chilukki. As for Lukas, his
Magicalmysterycat's winning streak ended at four when she finished
fourth, three weeks after winning the Schuylerville.
</P>
<P>
   But Regally Appealing ran third in the Schuylerville after
winning her debut, so Kimmel was not too surprised by her telling
effort in the Adirondack, the middle race in the series for
juvenile fillies at Saratoga. And he said that his fine filly would
make her next appearance in the third race in the series, the
Spinaway on Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she gave a pretty solid effort in the
Schuylerville,'' the trainer said. ``She had a lot of fight in her
in that race; she gave a lot. My thinking was that she would
improve off a race like that. Her fitness level was way up after
that race. The time frame between that race and this race seemed to
make sense, and she had a couple of nice breezes in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Prado, who rode Regally Appealing in both races, said his
filly was still learning the tactics of racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time, it was a speed-favoring track,'' he said, ``and we
felt that we had to send her. Today, we decided to ease back and
let her run at the end. She relaxed real well behind the pace, and
when I asked her to run, she responded.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what happened to the big guns from the West?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Miss Wineshine ran a tough race for Baffert, who now
has a first and a second in two races at Saratoga this season. She
ran third for half a mile behind Trump My Heart and
Magicalmysterycat, went wide turning for home, poked her head in
front during the homestretch duel but missed by a head at the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey, who rode Miss Wineshine, said: ``I had a good
trip. I was in the catbird seat. The other filly just ran us
down.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lukas echoed the sentiments for Magicalmysterycat, saying:
``She just got outrun. It was a tough race on her to be in between
horses like that. We never had any intentions of running her three
times up here, so she won't run in the Spinaway.''
</P>
<P>
   Regally Appealing ran the six furlongs in a snappy 1:16 3/5,
paid $16.40 for a $2 bet to win and went home with $90,000, nearly
triple her career earnings before she upset the favorites at
Saratoga.

SPORTS COLUMN: PEE WEE REESE HAS HIS HEIRS EVEN TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tributes roll in from fans who rooted for Pee Wee Reese and
players who competed against him in that raucous little playpen
called Ebbets Field. Everybody knows Reese was as good a man as his
legend would have it _ courteous, kind, inspirational, and he could
execute the hit-and-run, too.
</P>
<P>
   When people of a certain age mourn Pee Wee Reese, the
implication is that things were better back then. And maybe they
were. The salaries were lower, the players were in tune with the
world around them, the Dodgers car-pooled from humble rentals in
outer Brooklyn. Real people. However, I propose that we learn from
our love and respect for Reese _ and Joe DiMaggio, and Marion
Motley, and other great stars who have died in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Every time we turn on the tube, or go to the ball park, we
should appreciate the latter-day Pee Wee Reeses, the noble
captains, the teachers and leaders, the good and real people who
keep us from being totally cynical in this time of gigantic money
and incessant media bleat.
</P>
<P>
   It was Pee Wee Reese who defined professionalism to his
teammates. When Duke Snider would get itchy to drive back to Bay
Ridge, Reese would drawl, ``Duke, Duke, if you're hurryin' out of
the clubhouse, you're hurryin' out of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese was the Cap'n of the Dodgers the way Willis Reed is still
the acknowledged Cap'n of the Knicks from the championship years.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership has never gone out of fashion. Derek Jeter runs on
and off the field today because his Yankee captain, Don Mattingly,
suggested it one day in spring training. You never know who is
watching, Mattingly whispered. Maybe Donnie Baseball was talking
about the owner, or maybe it was an allegory for the conscience of
a baseball player. Either way, Jeter learned the lesson. He is rich
and handsome and young, more visible than any Brooklyn Dodger ever
was, and he carries the 19th century game forward into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the score, or the salary, or the standings. Don't even
watch the ball. Just watch the players, the way they carry
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In these warm and casual days, let us appreciate our own boys,
our own summers. Over in Shea Stadium, there is a first baseman
named John Olerud, consistent in his hitting, bland in his public
persona, droll and urbane in his private life. Don't let him pass
through his time in Flushing without appreciating him.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at Tony Gwynn, smacking base hits where the pitches
dictate they should be smacked. Relish Junior Griffey, who refuses
to be drawn into a home run mentality, who goes after fly balls
with the smooth pride of a professional glove man. These are, as
Carly Simon sings, the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true in the other sports. In a recent Sports
Illustrated, I read Paul Zimmerman's beautiful tribute to Marion
Motley, the pioneer African-American fullback and linebacker who
left opponents flopping on the hard earth. The article reminded me
to pay more attention to football this fall, to look for dominators
like Marion Motley. (Even if they no longer play both offense and
defense.)
</P>
<P>
   It is a bit late to stop and appreciate Jackie Joyner Kersee
(although I did the night she willed herself to a bronze medal in
Atlanta in 1996), too late to catch the grace of Stefan Edberg, too
late to watch Buck Williams box out his man.
</P>
<P>
   We should appreciate the good people who play games for our
entertainment, like Michael Strahan, the defensive lineman of the
Giants, a solid citizen with time for charities. Soon it will be
the season to watch Adam Graves shift from thoughtful family man to
scrappy wing at the drop of a puck, and savor the rebounding of
Jayson Williams, the funny man who lobbied to play in his adopted
home of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   There may never be another event like the Women's World Cup of
1999, but there will be other chances to see champions like
Christine Lilly. The quiet one gravitated to the right place on the
goal line, to clear a sure Chinese goal with her forehead, the same
stalwart way Pee Wee Reese fielded the last out of the 1955 World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Reese was the captain of an epic team, described by Dick Young
and Red Barber when it happened, portrayed forever by Roger Kahn in
his classic book, ``The Boys of Summer,'' well worth rereading in
these days of mourning. One special legacy of Pee Wee Reese is that
he conditioned us to recognize the same mature gallantry in some of
the boys and girls of these summers. &QL;

PUTIN PROMISES `ORDER AND DISCIPLINE' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Promising to bring ``order and discipline'' to Russia,
former KGB spy Vladimir Putin easily won confirmation Monday as new
prime minister by casting himself in the image of a draconian
secret police chief of this country's Soviet past.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, bolstered by Russian military claims of gains against
Islamic militants in the Caucasus, became the country's fifth
premier in 17 months after impressing parliament with a
tough-talking speech reminiscent of former Soviet leader Yury
Andropov.
</P>
<P>
   Putin told parliament he would pursue market economic reforms
while easing the pain of a decade-long recession, and crack down on
Islamic militants who have occupied several mountain villages in
the southern Russian region of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's 13-minute speech was mostly about style _ the
tough-talking style of Andropov, the former KGB chairman who ruled
the Soviet Union with an iron fist from 1982 until his death in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the tasks can be carried out without installing
elementary order in the country,'' Putin told legislators,
paraphrasing one of Andropov's favorite refrains.
</P>
<P>
   The clear references to Andropov's no-nonsense style were enough
to send chills up the spine of foreigners and Russians who remember
the Soviet Union of the early 1980s as a grim and frightened
society. But Putin's Kremlin backers are apparently counting on
polls that show many Russians, especially the millions whose living
standards have plummeted since the collapse of communism, remember
Andropov's 1982-1984 rule with nostalgia in these days of
lawlessness and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Andropov theme was clearly present in Putin's speech,''
said nationalist legislator Alexei Mitrofanov. ``And Putin was
right because the figure of Andropov is popular with many now _
from liberals to communists and patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Russia watchers believe that is one reason why President
Boris N. Yeltsin picked Putin after the abrupt dismissal of the
former premier, Sergei Stepashin. Another reason, many observers
here believe, is that the Kremlin hopes the former security chief
can help turn the tables in the upcoming parliamentary and
presidential elections, in which anti-Yeltsin candidates currently
are the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin last week said Putin was his pick to be Russia's next
president.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin, who spent two years as a deputy mayor in St.
Petersburg and also served as Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, is
not a politician but a career KGB agent. Posted in Germany during
the Cold War, he was named head of the Federal Security Service,
the KGB's main successor, last year.
</P>
<P>
   His rise to power extends a trend for Yeltsin, who early in his
eight-year presidency vowed to dissolve the KGB's successors and
open the secret police's archives to the public. As Yeltsin's power
has waned, he has increasingly relied on Russia's security
services. Both Stepashin and his predecessor, Yevgeny Primakov,
once headed Russian intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   While Putin has denied he plans to order a crackdown, he has
called for new funding to rebuild Russia's security services. He
said he wants to oversee ``honest and fair'' elections, leading
some legislators to wonder how he could do that when he is also one
of the candidates. Putin said he would only run in next year's
presidential elections if his record in office gave him the ``moral
right'' to do so.
</P>
<P>
   His main problem now is a crisis in the north Caucasus region of
Dagestan, where Russian troops are battling Islamic fighters who
infiltrated from the neighboring breakaway region of Chechnya
earlier this month and seized several villages.
</P>
<P>
   On Putin's orders, Russia has begun bombing bases in Chechnya,
whose claim to independence is not recognized by Moscow, a move
that could broaden the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the militants in Dagestan, Shamil Basayev,
countered that his forces had won a ``great victory'' over Russia,
and were preparing for a new stage code-named ``Imam Gazi Bek.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military says it is winning the battle; Monday a
spokesman in Dagestan said the rebels had lost 400 men, one-fifth
of their estimated force. A quick victory would lend credence to
Putin's vow last week that it his government would crush the rebels
in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Putin answered criticism from Caucasus experts, who say the
regions' instability stems from poverty, unemployment and ethnic
tensions and cannot be solved by force alone.
</P>
<P>
   Putin told the Duma he would address ``the social and economic
reasons'' for the conflict in Dagestan and pledged to spend more to
ensure the safety of citizens living near the Chechen-Dagestan
border, the site of numerous abductions by gangs that then demand
ransom. Monday, two Polish biologists and their two Dagestani hosts
were reported kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers appeared pleased with Putin, although some showed
irritation that the taciturn candidate had given them nothing to
discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know Putin's program, we do not know his personal
qualities, and we have no knowledge of whether he will work worse
or better than Stepashin,'' said centrist leader Oleg Morozov.
Another lawmaker got Putin's name mixed up with Stepashin, then
explained it as an ``understandable slip'' in a country where prime
ministers change so often.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma also asked the government to send only volunteer
soldiers or experienced draftees who wanted to go to the combat
zone in Dagestan, to avoid a repeat of Chechnya, where hundreds of
ill-trained young draftees died in the first weeks of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The failed 1994-1996 campaing to quash Chechnya's independence
bid was Yeltsin's darkest moment and one he said he would never
repeat. But Russian media have speculated that Yeltsin might use
the unrest in Dagestan as a pretext for imposing a state of
emergency, which could then justify postponing a December 19
parliamentary election and presidential voting in mid-2000. Monday,
the president sought to end those rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be tough measures in the North Caucasus and we will
restore order there in Dagestan and other regions,'' Yeltsin told
reporters. ``But once again, I state it firmly as president _ there
will be no state of emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who appears regularly on television but speaks slowly
and in almost childishly simple sentences, also sought to defuse
rumors about his failing health.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is now working like a clock,'' Yeltsin said in a
Kremlin news conference. ``My blood pressure is 120 over 80 whether
you measure me at work, in meetings, in stress or wake me up in the
middle of the night, and my pulse, 64 beats per minute.''

A YARD SALE RUNS 450 MILES THROUGH 4 STATES 
</HEADLINE>

 By DARRELL NORMAN The Gadsden (Ala.) Times

<P>
   LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN PARKWAY, Ala. _ When the World's Longest
Outdoor Sale begins Thursday, Billy Russell should be ready. He
began setting up last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of time to get all this stuff ready, especially
as hot as it is,'' Russell said. ``And last year, they started
coming through on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell was referring to the early birds who have come earlier
and earlier for the past few years to get the bargains before the
official start date.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 12th year, the sale officially runs Thursday through
Sunday. It covers roughly 450 miles, beginning at Covington, Ky.,
and ending at Noccalula Falls in Gadsden. Vendors set up in front
lawns and in open fields offering almost every collectible
imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who lives in Crossville, said he had traveled much of
the route almost every year since the sale began, but only to buy
stuff, never to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to try selling some of this stuff I've piled up,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Russell began to unload a van under a canopy at Mount Vernon,
some of the first things to come out were old chicken feeders, a
cast iron kettle and a well bucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's something to write about,'' he said as he opened a box
containing several calendars.
</P>
<P>
   They were rough paper tablets the size of a thick steno pad. One
bore the logo of Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill Co., purveyors of bags,
burlap and twine from Atlanta and Dallas. The calendar covered the
years 1906 and 1907.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Jenkins has seen the annual yard sale as a spectator, but
she is apprehensive about facing the crowd for her first year as a
merchant. As the new owner of Mount Vernon Exxon, she's preparing
for an invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have two Jiffy-Johns, and we will set up picnic tables
here under the cover between the store and the gas pumps,'' she
said. ``We will have barrels of ice drinks and cold water outside,
and we're getting a new ice cream machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins has spots marked for vendors on three sides of her
store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to have our deli in operation for breakfast and
lunch,'' she said. ``We're going to have four cashiers and a pumper
working. We want to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the Lookout Mountain Parkway at Tabor, Dwight
Churchill has prepared for the sale the way he does every year _ by
bulldozing some of the junk that covers every foot of earth between
his store and the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a big pile of it hauled off,'' Churchill said. ``Had to
make room.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchill's junk store is a favorite stopping place for yard
sale shoppers _ both for the treasures inside his store, and for
the friends who set up on his lot for the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The annual sale began 11 years ago in Jamestown, Tenn., as a way
to lure tourists off the interstate. It first covered the U.S. 127
Corridor from Covington, Ky, to Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The Lookout Mountain Parkway _ which extends 100 miles through
Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama _ was added later, making the sale
route 450 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   Last year more than 2,000 vendors participated. The annual event
attracts thousands of buyers, many of whom plan their vacations so
they can come to the sale each year in the third week in August.

ALEXANDER DROPS OUT WITHOUT ENDORSING ANOTHER CANDIATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Disappointed by a poor showing in Saturday's Iowa
straw poll and out of money, Lamar Alexander, former Tennessee
governor, left the 10-person GOP presidential field Monday, even as
rivals scrambled to recruit his staff, claim his supporters, and
reposition their own campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who finished eighth in the
straw poll while Alexander was sixth, pledged to stay in the race
but focus exclusively on next year's early nominating contests in
Iowa and New Hampshire. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who did not
compete in the nonbinding straw poll, said he might skip the Iowa
caucuses altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a moderate who ran but did not make it to the finish
line in 1996 either, refused to endorse another candidate. At a
news conference in Nashville, he asserted that the party and
country would gain from a vigorous political debate, particularly
on his signature issues of education and lowering taxes for
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We not only have an 11th Commandment in the Republican Party,
which is `thou shalt speak no ill of any other Republican,' but we
need a 12th one, which is, `when picking a president, thou shalt
have a contest. And the contest shall be on the issues,' ''
Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates had nothing but nice words for the
59-year-old Alexander Monday. Elizabeth Dole, energized by a
respectable third-place finish in the straw poll, called him a
``talented, respected leader.'' Texas Governor George W. Bush, who
won the poll, called Alexander ``a good man'' and said he shared
his commitment to improving education.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Bush, Dole, and McCain, all considered mainstream
moderates in the race, had the most to gain from Alexander's
departure. Behind the scenes, a serious talent search was under way
for some of Alexander's key backers: Ted Welch, a top fund-raiser
in Tennessee; Thomas Rath, a New Hampshire GOP committeeman and
savvy strategist; and former Iowa Governor Terry Bransted, known
for his skills at political organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Bransted said he was going to listen to appeals from both Bush
and Dole but denied he would make ``a quick move'' to the Texas
governor, who has received the largest number of endorsements from
the party establishment. Rath, who has worked for Alexander since
1993, said he was in no hurry to endorse another candidate. It was
``a strange new morning,'' he said, to wake up and find Alexander
out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   Rath said it was a combination of Bush's fund-raising juggernaut
_ he has already banked nearly $37 million for the 2000 race _
publisher Steve Forbes' personal wealth, and ``a constant
drumbeat'' of negative media stories portraying Alexander as a
retred candidate that together made it impossible for Alexander to
raise money and move up in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a party that is very focused on beating (Vice
President) Al Gore, and people who normally might contribute to
more than one candidate aren't hedging their bets,'' Rath said.
``Organizationally, we are stronger than our poll numbers, but you
can't move your poll numbers without dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, also short of cash, said Monday he is narrowing his
sights to Iowa and New Hampshire, a decision announced just as
McCain revealed that Quayle's state chairman, campaign manager, and
two other top organizers in South Carolina were joining his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle spokesman Jonathan Baron said the defections were not
unexpected because the campaign was redirecting its resources away
from South Carolina. ``You do what you have to do,'' said Baron,
adding that Quayle was committed to staying in the race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Monday on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that he is
``leaning toward'' skipping next winter's Iowa caucuses, the first
test in the actual nominating process, and concentrating his money
and organization in the early primary states of New Hampshire and
South Carolina. ``You pick your shots,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP campaigns reported Monday that they had spent from
$50,000 (Quayle) to $1.5 million (Forbes) to woo voters to
Saturday's straw poll. Former New Hampshire Senator Warren Rudman,
a McCain adviser, said McCain ``helped himself'' by staying away
and not putting money on an event the candidate called ``a sham and
a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander, a dogged campaigner, fought hard to prove his
viability through the Iowa straw poll. After Alexander spent 21
days in Iowa in a run-up to the poll, Saturday night's dismal
results were both a surprise and a disappointment, Bransted said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ending my campaign for the presidency today,'' Alexander
said with his wife and son at his side. ``My heart tells me to keep
going and so do a lot of telephone calls this morning, but there's
really no realistic way to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may learn a lesson from this,'' Alexander joked to
reporters. ``I seem to be attracting more attention getting out
than I did getting in. So, thank you very much for being here.''

FOREST (Phoenix) - Environmentalists are calling for a halt to the
cutting of all old-growth trees in Arizona's National Forests. This
is part of their appeal of a timber sale on the Kaibab National
Forest on the north rim of the Grand Canyon, a stronghold of the
state's dwindling number of large, old ponderosa pines. This comes
on the heels of a successful appeal of a timber-cutting program
planned near Flagstaff, and it comes as a federal public employees
group calls for the resignation of long-time Apache-Sitgreaves

suffered a grim setback over the weekend. They also say Quayle

LEHMAN, AS EXPECTED, AND PATE, IN SURPRISE, NAMED TO RYDER CUP
TEAM
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ With one pick that was anticipated, and one that
was more surprising, Ben Crenshaw named Tom Lehman and Steve Pate
on Monday as the two captain's picks for the U.S. Ryder Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman and Pate complete the 12-man team that will face Europe
in the Ryder Cup, Sept. 24-26 at The Country Club in Brookline,
Mass. Europe's Ryder Cup team will be decided after this weekend's
BMW International Open, with the captain Mark James, making his two
captain's picks on Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Pate and Lehman will be the 10 players who earned their
spots on the team during the two-year points race that ended with
Sunday's PGA Championship. Those players are Tiger Woods, David
Duval, Payne Stewart, Davis Love III, Mark O'Meara, Hal Sutton,
Justin Leonard, Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson, and Jeff Maggert.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who finished 12th in the points standing, was expected
to be selected because he has played in two Ryder Cups, he is well
respected by his peers and he has played well during the past two
months. But Pate, who finished 14th in the points standing, got the
nod over two players who were also strong candidates _ Bob Estes
and Fred Couples. Estes barely missed making the team on Sunday,
finishing tied for sixth at the PGA Championship, which left him
11th in the points standing. If Estes had finished fifth or better
at the PGA, he would have made the team, bumping Maggert out of the
top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Couples has played in five Ryder Cups, and is still one of the
world's best players when he in top form. But Couples finished 17th
in the points race, and he has played a limited schedule this
season. When Crenshaw finally settled on his two picks Sunday
night, Pate got the call because of his tenacity and his
consistency the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Pate is a fiery competitor who would walk through a wall
if you asked him to,'' said Crenshaw at Monday's news conference at
Medinah Country Club. ``The only thing lacking in Bob Estes' column
was consistency. Emotionally, the phone call to Fred Couples was
probably the hardest. The whole world loves Freddie, but he has
just not played enough this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw said he also considered Lee Janzen, last year's U.S.
Open champion, along with Hale Irwin, who made an early run at the
PGA Championship before fading.
</P>
<P>
   Pate, who played on the winning United States team in 1991, was
delighted when Crenshaw awakened him with a phone call late Sunday
night to deliver the good news. The 1991 Ryder Cup was a
bittersweet experience for Pate, who was involved in a traffic
accident that week and suffered a bruised hip, which limited him to
one match. Pate was looking forward to a second chance, and he
earned it with consistent play over the past two years. He won last
year's CVS Charity Classic, and he has four top-10 finishes this
year. He showed his match-play ability at the Andersen Consulting
Match Play Championship in February, when he advanced to the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I started playing well a couple of years ago, it
has been high on my priority list,'' Pate said of making the Ryder
Cup team. ``I've always loved match play. I love the fact that at
the end of the day, you've either won or you've lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman's leadership could be crucial to a team that looked
fractured last week. There was a heated meeting Tuesday at Medinah
concerning Ryder Cup revenue, and whether players should be given a
significant amount of money to give to the charities of their
choice. Players on both sides spoke out strongly Tuesday and
Wednesday, raising questions about the team's unity heading into
the competition. The European team has won the past two Ryder Cups,
and the pressure on this year's U.S. team has only increased
because of the controversy money.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lehman and Crenshaw insisted Monday, however, that the
United States team would arrive in Brookline focused and
determined.

 &HT;    WorldAccess, FaciliCom forge unionBy Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta-based World Access has forged a $750 million deal to buy
FaciliCom International, a provider of long-distance services in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, a giant leap for World Access toward becoming a major
international carrier of data and voice, includes a $432 million
purchase price plus acceptance of the privately held, Washington,
D.C. company's debt. The result will be a combined company with
revenues of about $1.6 billion next year, according to John D.
Phillips, World Access chairman, president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   World Access, which last year had revenues of just $152 million,
had been expected to reach about $745 million in sales this year _
without a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the very beginning of what we have always said we
intend to do,'' Phillips said. ``We intend to be very aggressive.
And the hyper growth will come from acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   World Access is already negotiating with a handful of other
potential partners, and another significant acquisition could be
announced within weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   FaciliCom has invested several hundred million dollars in
networks in 14 countries, most in Europe. World Access has also
invested heavily in Europe, as well as in five key U.S. cities. The
company's goal is to handle long-distance traffic whether it
originates in the United States or overseas, Phillips said. ``Now,
I am on both sides of it. The plan has always been to build a
multi-billion dollar, multi-national long-distance company.''
</P>
<P>
   World Access, which has about 800 employees, still draws a
sizeable piece of its revenue, about 90 percent, from sales of
telecommunications equipment. That business provides the company
with financial backup should the service side of the business ever
sag.
</P>
<P>
   The combined companies will maintain headquarters in Atlanta, as
well as the name World Access, Phillips said. ``Wherever I plant my
flag is where the headquarters are. And that is in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has been a lead executive in a series of telecom
companies, including several that were later purchased by MCI
WorldCom. With support of MCI WorldCom, Phillips became CEO of
World Access after it purchased Resurgens, a company he took over
while it was in dire financial straits.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Stephen Shook of Wachovia Securities said the company
strategy is sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Phillips knows how to make a profit in businesses that
have proven difficult for other folks. And when you reach $1
billion in revenue, you have some critical mass. They ought to
start doing a pretty good business.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Allen Roness of JW Genesis Securities recently praised
World Access in an interview with the Internet Financial
Connection. ``Their growth rate is unbelievable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom is currently the largest shareholder in World
Access, with 15 percent of company shares. The Jackson, Miss.-based
telecom giant will emerge with 8 percent of the merged company.
Brown Bros. Harriman, another investor, will have a similar stake.
Employees of World Access and FaciliCom will hold 16 percent of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Largest shareholder will be the Armstrong Group of Companies,
with more than 20 percent.

ALEXANDER DROPS OUT WITHOUT ENDORSING ANOTHER CANDIATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Disappointed by a poor showing in Saturday's Iowa
straw poll and out of money, Lamar Alexander, former Tennessee
governor, left the 10-person GOP presidential field Monday, even as
rivals scrambled to recruit his staff, claim his supporters, and
reposition their own campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who finished eighth in the
straw poll while Alexander was sixth, pledged to stay in the race
but focus exclusively on next year's early nominating contests in
Iowa and New Hampshire. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who did not
compete in the nonbinding straw poll, said he might skip the Iowa
caucuses altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a moderate who ran but did not make it to the finish
line in 1996 either, refused to endorse another candidate. At a
news conference in Nashville, he asserted that the party and
country would gain from a vigorous political debate, particularly
on his signature issues of education and lowering taxes for
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We not only have an 11th Commandment in the Republican Party,
which is `thou shalt speak no ill of any other Republican,' but we
need a 12th one, which is, `when picking a president, thou shalt
have a contest. And the contest shall be on the issues,' ''
Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates had nothing but nice words for the
59-year-old Alexander Monday. Elizabeth Dole, energized by a
respectable third-place finish in the straw poll, called him a
``talented, respected leader.'' Texas Governor George W. Bush, who
won the poll, called Alexander ``a good man'' and said he shared
his commitment to improving education.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Bush, Dole, and McCain, all considered mainstream
moderates in the race, had the most to gain from Alexander's
departure. Behind the scenes, a serious talent search was under way
for some of Alexander's key backers: Ted Welch, a top fund-raiser
in Tennessee; Thomas Rath, a New Hampshire GOP committeeman and
savvy strategist; and former Iowa Governor Terry Bransted, known
for his skills at political organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Bransted said he was going to listen to appeals from both Bush
and Dole but denied he would make ``a quick move'' to the Texas
governor, who has received the largest number of endorsements from
the party establishment. Rath, who has worked for Alexander since
1993, said he was in no hurry to endorse another candidate. It was
``a strange new morning,'' he said, to wake up and find Alexander
out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   Rath said it was a combination of Bush's fund-raising juggernaut
_ he has already banked nearly $37 million for the 2000 race _
publisher Steve Forbes' personal wealth, and ``a constant
drumbeat'' of negative media stories portraying Alexander as a
retred candidate that together made it impossible for Alexander to
raise money and move up in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a party that is very focused on beating (Vice
President) Al Gore, and people who normally might contribute to
more than one candidate aren't hedging their bets,'' Rath said.
``Organizationally, we are stronger than our poll numbers, but you
can't move your poll numbers without dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, also short of cash, said Monday he is narrowing his
sights to Iowa and New Hampshire, a decision announced just as
McCain revealed that Quayle's state chairman, campaign manager, and
two other top organizers in South Carolina were joining his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle spokesman Jonathan Baron said the defections were not
unexpected because the campaign was redirecting its resources away
from South Carolina. ``You do what you have to do,'' said Baron,
adding that Quayle was committed to staying in the race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Monday on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that he is
``leaning toward'' skipping next winter's Iowa caucuses, the first
test in the actual nominating process, and concentrating his money
and organization in the early primary states of New Hampshire and
South Carolina. ``You pick your shots,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP campaigns reported Monday that they had spent from
$50,000 (Quayle) to $1.5 million (Forbes) to woo voters to
Saturday's straw poll. Former New Hampshire Senator Warren Rudman,
a McCain adviser, said McCain ``helped himself'' by staying away
and not putting money on an event the candidate called ``a sham and
a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander, a dogged campaigner, fought hard to prove his
viability through the Iowa straw poll. After Alexander spent 21
days in Iowa in a run-up to the poll, Saturday night's dismal
results were both a surprise and a disappointment, Bransted said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ending my campaign for the presidency today,'' Alexander
said with his wife and son at his side. ``My heart tells me to keep
going and so do a lot of telephone calls this morning, but there's
really no realistic way to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may learn a lesson from this,'' Alexander joked to
reporters. ``I seem to be attracting more attention getting out
than I did getting in. So, thank you very much for being here.''

PROSECUTORS GET BETTER COMPUTERS   FOR WAR CRIMES PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When American prosecutors traveled to The Hague to
help the International War Crimes Tribunal investigate atrocities
in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, they expected the world's most
sophisticated computers to aid them in prosecuting the world's most
horrific crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in the Netherlands two years ago, US law enforcement
officials found ``woefully inadequate'' technology available to
document evidence of mass executions, rapes, kidnappings, arsons
and torture, said Michael Johnson, a New Hampshire district
attorney. Undersized and outdated, the tribunal's computer network
was simply incapable of handling the flood of data being gathered.
</P>
<P>
   So several prosecutors, including Suffolk District Attorney
Ralph C. Martin 2nd in Boston, vowed to remedy the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday a coalition of New England prosecutors will announce its
latest contribution in the effort to bring to justice the
perpetrators of modern-day crimes against humanity: $3.5 million in
computer equipment, donated by technology giant IBM Corp., in what
is the largest private donation ever given to the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's donation, two refrigerator-size AS400 computer systems, 50
terminals and accompanying software, will enable international
investigators to process more quickly and efficiently the reams of
criminal evidence they are collecting, including blood samples,
ballistics tests of gunshot wounds, and DNA studies of bodies that,
in many cases, had been burned and buried.
</P>
<P>
   It will also allow far-flung overseas prosecutors to share
confidential information, encrypted via the Internet, that
previously had to be hand-carried to ensure secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is going to do is literally provide a high-speed
information superhighway for war crimes investigations,'' said
David Scheffer, ambassador at large for war crimes issues at the US
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been plagued throughout the history of the tribunals
with a slow means of communication between our various offices,''
he added, ``and this is going to allow investigators in the field
to communicate instantaneously with prosecutors located in far
distant offices and cities so that cases can be built far more
rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the new computers are installed, added Martin, the tribunal
will exchange technology that is ``two generations beyond the
adding machine'' for an electronic network that ``could run a small
city, if it had to.''
</P>
<P>
   The machines will be shipped to The Hague from Boston Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's gift follows similar contributions from companies such as
Polaroid, Eastman Kodak and Digital Equipment Corp., which have
donated global positioning systems, digital cameras, and other
photographic equipment for use in war crimes investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Three area law enforcement officials played critical roles in
the latest donation: Martin, Johnson, the district attorney for
Merrimack County, N.H, which includes the state capital; and John
Boyle, a former New York homicide detective who now works for IBM's
public safety division.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who visited The Hague and witnessed first-hand the
tribunal's technology woes, was a key player in recruiting fellow
prosecutors nationwide to rally behind the effort. Boyle provided
an inside connection at the computer company.
</P>
<P>
   And Martin, who has not traveled to The Hague, used his
political muscle to win backing for the project from the State
Department, the American Bar Association and the National District
Attorneys Association, even helping arrange for a letter of support
to be sent from President Clinton to IBM's chairman and chief
executive, Louis Gerstner.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a very simple level, we have so much in the way of good
fortune and blessings in this country and we've seen so much
success as prosecutors,'' said Martin, ``that in a lot of ways it's
a privilege to be able to mobilize whatever knowlege and talent we
have, as well as the resources of others, to aid a humaritarian
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal, established by the UN Security Council to
prosecute war crimes in Rwanda, Bosnia and now Kosovo, has publicly
indicted 70 alleged war criminals to date and has a budget of more
than $175 million.

DONORS NONPLUSSED BY CLINTONS' HIGH-PRICED HOUSE TASTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the first family shops for a new home in New
York's posh Westchester County, Massachusetts donors to President
Clinton's legal defense fund say they don't regret having loosened
their purse strings for Clinton's financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Hillary Rodham Clinton fails in her expected run for the
Senate seat in New York, contributors say, they see little wrong
with the Clintons wanting to live in a well-to-do area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect a former president to live in a one-bedroom
apartment in the Bronx,'' said Kelvin Reed, an elementary school
teacher from Boston, who gave $10 to the fund. ``The president of
the United States has a certain amount of respect due to him.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude should be encouraging to the fund's
administrators, who are groping for new money-raising strategies
after reporting last week that contributions have slowed
considerably since Clinton's impeachment trial ended, in acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's legal debts and the first lady's Senate campaign
have little to do with each other,'' said Theodore Anastos, a
lawyer from Cambridge who gave $250 to the fund this year. ``His
legal debt is the result of zealous, mean-spirited politicians. He
shouldn't have to carry that debt by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Alpert, a retired ice cream truck driver from Boston,
said he has little money to spend on himself. But ever since
Clinton's legal defense fund started accepting contributions last
year, Alpert, a lifelong Democrat, has written $5 checks to the
fund each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's not much, but Clinton's been a great president and
I want to help,'' Alpert said. ``I'll keep writing my checks until
his debts are paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as donors opened their wallets for the president, some
said they worried the Clintons might not be able to afford a house
costing a few million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have so much other things to pay, like Chelsea's college
education,'' said Helen Ahearn, a nurse who donated $10 to the
president's legal defense fund. ``I sure hope they can afford a
house that expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Derivan, a homemaker who gave $5 this year, said she
hopes the Clintons ``don't go broke'' purchasing a house in the
Westchester suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then again, if Hillary loses the Senate race, she can
probably sell back the house at a much higher price, so it'll work
out OK for her,'' Derivan said.
</P>
<P>
   For her Senate bid, the first lady needs to establish New York
residency by Election Day _ Nov. 7, 2000, but she has started her
house search early. The Clintons earned just over $500,000 last
year.

<P>
   The Clintons have suggested renting was also an option, but the
couple has not made a final selection on a house.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first sitting president to accept donations to
pay his legal fees, which ballooned to $10.5 million during his
impeachment trial earlier this year. President Nixon accepted
donations to help defray legal costs after he resigned but paid
most of the bills himself.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, so far, has raised $6.3 million, and $4.5 million of
the money collected has been used to pay Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 79,000 people from around the country have contributed to
the fund since its formation in February 1998, just weeks after the
Monica S. Lewinsky scandal became public. About 2,600 of the
contributions have come from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The top five Massachusetts contributors were former Democratic
National Committee finance chairman Alan D. Solomont, Solomont's
wife Susan, Boston Capitol President John Manning, and Kathleen and
James Daley of Boston, who have each contributed $10,000, the
maximum yearly donation allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Other maximum contributors include film producers Steven
Spielberg, David Geffen, and Jeffrey Katzenberg; Smith Bagley, the
grandson of tobacco tycoon R.J. Reynolds; and Ely Calloway, the
chairman of Callaway Golf.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In the old days they were known as ``summer
exhibitions,'' pleasant little artistic potpourri designed to
seduce the senses while awaiting autumn's inevitable arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, these works were on loan from wealthy private
collectors who'd retreated to their seaside cottages or country
villas for the season. Alert museums would pounce on the chance to
show the public art normally hidden behind gated walls.
</P>
<P>
   These exhibitions offered nothing too taxing, nothing too
profound, says J. Patrice Marandel, curator of European painting
and sculpture at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Instead,
their existence, like the idea of summer vacation itself, testified
to the transitory pleasures of modern, middle-class life, to the
luxury of savoring a mental day-off like a watermelon eaten to the
rind.
</P>
<P>
   Such pleasurable diversions, with no apologies, were Marandel's
objective in coordinating ``Around Impressionism: French Paintings
From the National Gallery of Art,'' the new LACMA exhibition that
opens today. Consisting of roughly 70 paintings by 26 major artists
spanning a period of nearly 100 years, the show unabashedly
concerns itself with pure visual beauty. It invites patrons to bask
in luminous, intimate views of the world whose preoccupation with
temporality belies their enduring popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a show for the eyes, not for the head, and there's
nothing wrong with that; that's what museums are supposed to do,''
Marandel says.
</P>
<P>
   Impressionism's story has been told many times, at great length,
and LACMA is making no attempt to oversell a familiar tale. There
will be no five-story banners of Monet's ``Japanese Footbridge''
strung from the ramparts of LACMA West, where ``Around
Impressionism'' will run through Nov. 29. After back-to-back
Picasso and van Gogh blockbusters, ``Around Impressionism'' is
letting LACMA take a breather.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a show like this, you don't have the kind of drama and
pathos that you have in the van Gogh exhibition,'' Marandel
comments on the low-key marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all the franchise names are here. There are no less than
five Manets, six Renoirs and seven Monets, along with significant
works by Degas, Gauguin's vivid ``Haystacks in Brittany'' and
Berthe Morisot's poignantly autobiographical ``The Sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a muted, undulating Sisley landscape and a dazzling
early van Gogh that sets drab Dutch peasant houses against effusive
flowerbeds under blue skies peeking through somber leaden clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Book-ending the show, and supplying its conceptual framework,
are works by impressionistic forerunners like Jean-Baptiste-Camille
Corot, Frederic Bazille and Gustav Courbet, as well as paintings by
Edouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard, whose dreamy, stage-set
interiors and ferociously intense palette inspired so many
20th-century artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're difficult to understand,'' Marandel says of Bonnard
works like ``Table Set in a Garden'' (1908) and ``A Spring
Landscape'' (1935). ``They're not always popular with the public
because he had a very shocking sense of color, I think. He worked
in the south of France, where the light is a bit more hard, like in
Southern California. They yield a lot of pleasure, but they're
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's time frame _ from Corot, whose career began around
1822, to Bonnard, who died in 1947 _ should help dissipate any
lingering idea that impressionism was a movement scorned, whose
practitioners were treated like pariahs. While it's true that
Paris' powerful salon-istas rejected the style as ephemeral,
influential poets and writers quickly championed impressionism,
while a large segment of the viewing public embraced it.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing taxing. Nothing profound. Just a new art form,
custom-made for preserving the vanishing summer days, for
remembering the light that fades all too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always think of the impressionists as the great rejected
painters, the people who did not make it,'' Marandel says. ``In
fact, they did make it. People responded much more positively than
we think. And history told us who was right.'' &QL;

EROSION ON SHORELINE GOLF COURSES CREATES SOME SERIOUS WATER
HAZARDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Mich. _ Look at some of the world's most spectacular
seaside golf courses, with their windswept greens perched on crags
high above pounding surf, and it is easy to wonder what keeps the
exposed bluffs from eroding away, undermined by waves and pelted by
rain on the thinly covered soil.
</P>
<P>
   Erosion has become a serious problem, along ocean shores and
around the Great Lakes. Golf course erosion is a particularly
contentious issue in Michigan, where auto executives are devoted to
the sport and where more courses have been built in each of the
last five years than anywhere else in the country. Thirty-four were
built last year.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute at the new Arcadia Bluffs Golf Club here on the
eastern shore of Lake Michigan pits a popular politician and
environmentalists against a developer who, rather than pay state
fines for allegedly fouling the lake, has fought back. He has
bought a two-page newspaper advertisement defending the course's
design and has, in interviews, leveled accusations that a state
lawsuit against him was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The state's attorney general, Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat
with a populist bent who was elected last November, has sued and
criticized the wealthy golf course developer, Richard Postma, of
Grand Rapids, Mich. Ms. Granholm has accused Postma of building a
badly designed golf course here, 214 miles northwest of Detroit on
sandy bluffs overlooking a deep blue expanse of Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Granholm contends that the course is so badly designed that
erosion is coating nearby beaches with mud and has turned a ravine
into a ravaged gorge. ``Instead of creating a golf course, he's
creating a massive sand trap,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in April in the Manistee County Circuit Court,
seeks to require Postma to improve drainage and pay fines of up to
$750,000.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has gained national attention and has the golf
industry cringing. ``That is the type of thing we've really tried
to avoid, because it gives everyone a black eye,'' said John LaFoy,
the president of the American Society of Golf Course Architects.
</P>
<P>
   Driving a golf cart around the almost-finished, 7,244-yard-long
course, where all 18 holes provide views of the lake and its
sailboats and freighters and where golfers will pay $125 to play a
round when the course opens on Sept. 4, Postma acknowledged that
there have been construction accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The accidents sent tons of sand and mud into the lake in heavy
rainstorms late last month and last September, he said. But he
denied that the sediment would harm the lake and said that the
course was well designed, pointing out that he had installed an
elaborate $1.5-million drainage system even though the county had
not required him to do so in granting his original construction
permit. He refused to give the overall cost of the course. The
drainage system was not yet working during the rainstorm last
September, he said, and while last month's runoff flowed through
the drains properly, it carried mud from areas not yet covered with
grass.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, the runoff ``just became a river by the time it
hit the top of the ravine _ the river was 40-feet wide and 2{ feet
deep,'' Postma said. ``It blew all our fill out into the lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two small clumps of beech trees and pines remain on the
275-acre site, a third of which used to be wooded, and where
brown-winged killdeer birds still flit by, their white bellies
flashing. Postma said that his workers removed the trees partly
because he believed long grass would be more effective in stopping
further erosion of the sandy bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-foot-wide ravine, a feature of the terrain here for at
least a century, cuts through the middle of the ninth hole.
Standing where golfers will soon tee off on the hole, aiming their
balls at a small green on the other side of the ravine, Postma said
that he had stopped further erosion of the gully, partly out of
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I do something to create erosion potential that would
jeopardize the green on that side or the tee boxes on this side?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   LaFoy, who was not involved in the Arcadia Bluffs project, said
that although golf course architects nationwide now try to minimize
environmental damage, erosion during heavy rainstorms, ``can happen
to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials have questioned whether Postma has been
successful in stabilizing the ravine. In response, Postma, who says
he does not belong to a political party, has tried to turn the
dispute into a political issue. He accused Ms. Granholm of turning
him into, ``a poster child for her campaign of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Granholm, widely expected to run for governor someday, said
that was untrue. ``Postma's perception of the political landscape
in Michigan is as poor as his ability to construct a golf
landscape,'' she said in an interview, noting that Dennis Swain,
the prosecuting attorney for Manistee County, is a Republican and
has joined the lawsuit against Postma.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has divided local residents. Barbara Katzenstein,
the owner of the Big Apple Bar and Restaurant, said that although
she thought the project should have kept more of the original
trees, she was happy with it overall. ``I'd rather have that than a
housing development,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Reffitt, a 41-year-old worker at a nearby Indian casino,
was sitting on a nearby stool at the bar and spoke up after hearing
Ms. Katzenstein's comments. After a heavy rain in late July, Ms.
Reffitt said, she was unable to go swimming because the waves
lapping the town's beach were dark with sediment, which she blamed
on the golf course a mile to the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get in because there was such mud,'' she said. ``It
was brown and it was wicked _ I know this lake.''

PROSECUTORS GET BETTER COMPUTERS   FOR WAR CRIMES PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When American prosecutors traveled to The Hague to
help the International War Crimes Tribunal investigate atrocities
in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, they expected the world's most
sophisticated computers to aid them in prosecuting the world's most
horrific crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in the Netherlands two years ago, US law enforcement
officials found ``woefully inadequate'' technology available to
document evidence of mass executions, rapes, kidnappings, arsons
and torture, said Michael Johnson, a New Hampshire district
attorney. Undersized and outdated, the tribunal's computer network
was simply incapable of handling the flood of data being gathered.
</P>
<P>
   So several prosecutors, including Suffolk District Attorney
Ralph C. Martin 2nd in Boston, vowed to remedy the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday a coalition of New England prosecutors will announce its
latest contribution in the effort to bring to justice the
perpetrators of modern-day crimes against humanity: $3.5 million in
computer equipment, donated by technology giant IBM Corp., in what
is the largest private donation ever given to the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's donation, two refrigerator-size AS400 computer systems, 50
terminals and accompanying software, will enable international
investigators to process more quickly and efficiently the reams of
criminal evidence they are collecting, including blood samples,
ballistics tests of gunshot wounds, and DNA studies of bodies that,
in many cases, had been burned and buried.
</P>
<P>
   It will also allow far-flung overseas prosecutors to share
confidential information, encrypted via the Internet, that
previously had to be hand-carried to ensure secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is going to do is literally provide a high-speed
information superhighway for war crimes investigations,'' said
David Scheffer, ambassador at large for war crimes issues at the US
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been plagued throughout the history of the tribunals
with a slow means of communication between our various offices,''
he added, ``and this is going to allow investigators in the field
to communicate instantaneously with prosecutors located in far
distant offices and cities so that cases can be built far more
rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the new computers are installed, added Martin, the tribunal
will exchange technology that is ``two generations beyond the
adding machine'' for an electronic network that ``could run a small
city, if it had to.''
</P>
<P>
   The machines will be shipped to The Hague from Boston Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's gift follows similar contributions from companies such as
Polaroid, Eastman Kodak and Digital Equipment Corp., which have
donated global positioning systems, digital cameras, and other
photographic equipment for use in war crimes investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Three area law enforcement officials played critical roles in
the latest donation: Martin, Johnson, the district attorney for
Merrimack County, N.H, which includes the state capital; and John
Boyle, a former New York homicide detective who now works for IBM's
public safety division.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who visited The Hague and witnessed first-hand the
tribunal's technology woes, was a key player in recruiting fellow
prosecutors nationwide to rally behind the effort. Boyle provided
an inside connection at the computer company.
</P>
<P>
   And Martin, who has not traveled to The Hague, used his
political muscle to win backing for the project from the State
Department, the American Bar Association and the National District
Attorneys Association, even helping arrange for a letter of support
to be sent from President Clinton to IBM's chairman and chief
executive, Louis Gerstner.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a very simple level, we have so much in the way of good
fortune and blessings in this country and we've seen so much
success as prosecutors,'' said Martin, ``that in a lot of ways it's
a privilege to be able to mobilize whatever knowlege and talent we
have, as well as the resources of others, to aid a humaritarian
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal, established by the UN Security Council to
prosecute war crimes in Rwanda, Bosnia and now Kosovo, has publicly
indicted 70 alleged war criminals to date and has a budget of more
than $175 million.

GIANTS' BARBER GOES FROM THE STAGE TO THE SCREEN PASS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Tiki Barber, the Giants' running back, appeared
in an off-Broadway play this winter. At the Giants' training camp
this summer, he has been putting his acting experience to good use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our running backs have to be good actors,'' quarterback Kent
Graham said. ``Faking things out there is really important.''
</P>
<P>
   For Graham, the subject Monday was the screen pass, a play of
deceit. It is something the guileless Giants have not been very
good at the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   This preseason, the Giants have worked on their screen passes
extensively. They are determined to make it a furtive weapon
against blitzing, attacking opponents.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it appears they have all become much better actors.
</P>
<P>
   Take the rookie Sean Bennett's electrifying 53-yard touchdown
dash Friday in the preseason victory against the Vikings at
Minnesota. During a screen pass against a blitz, the Vikings lost
Bennett in the shuffle of players.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Barber's 35-yard touchdown catch-and-run in the
Giants' intrasquad scrimmage earlier this month? Same play.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Giants have improved on offense is because they
now throw the ball deep. Just as important, they are learning how
to throw the ball short.
</P>
<P>
   ``A screen pass is a feast or famine play, but the upside is
tremendous,'' Jim Skipper, the offensive coordinator, said. ``We
tell our backs when we call a screen to think first down and then
touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   A screen pass is one of the most unusual plays in football,
where players do things they don't do on any other play. For
example, two offensive linemen purposely let their defenders slide
past them, then drift to either the left, center or right of the
field near or behind the line of scrimmage and wait.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a running back pretends _ or acts _ like he is trying
to block someone, like a blitzing linebacker, but actually lets him
go, too. Then the running back slyly works his way behind the two
drifting lineman. The linemen and running back wait as the
quarterback retreats in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The timing has to be perfect, but if it works, there are too
many defenders chasing the quarterback when he finally lofts a
little pass to the back, whose teammates may now outnumber
defenders in the way.
</P>
<P>
   One or two blocks later: first down, touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But if the timing isn't right, all kinds of things can go wrong,
from being intercepted, to running backs being pulverized as they
take the risk of waiting for the ball with their back to the
defense. It is the only time during the game that a running back
chooses such a hazardous stance.
</P>
<P>
   Giants fans know about these problems; they have witnessed them
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A multitude of breakdowns,'' is how Skipper explained the
Giants' screen-pass woes the last two years. ``Blocking, timing,
execution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So the Giants' coaching staff made some things simpler in their
approach to this key play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it was a little confusing to the linemen which guy
they were supposed to block,'' Graham said. ``So now, we say, `Go
out there and get the first guy you see.' We aren't worried as much
about which guy. Just get anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have worked relentlessly on improving the timing of
the throw between the quarterback and the running back. And Barber
and Bennett have worked on their acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny because you want that blitzing linebacker to look
at you, but not to attack you,'' Barber said. ``You kind of lunge
at him, but you've got to make it look like you just missed him.
Like: `Oh, wow, good move. You beat me on this one.' And then you
slide away, unnoticed, you hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The running back finds his spot and waits. ``That wait can be
nerve-racking,'' Barber said. ``If they've sniffed it out, you're
going to get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you have fooled them?
</P>
<P>
   ``You turn up field and all the big guys are behind you,''
Barber said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   As plays go, that is a running back's dream. All it takes is a
little play acting.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In the old days they were known as ``summer
exhibitions,'' pleasant little artistic potpourri designed to
seduce the senses while awaiting autumn's inevitable arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, these works were on loan from wealthy private
collectors who'd retreated to their seaside cottages or country
villas for the season. Alert museums would pounce on the chance to
show the public art normally hidden behind gated walls.
</P>
<P>
   These exhibitions offered nothing too taxing, nothing too
profound, says J. Patrice Marandel, curator of European painting
and sculpture at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Instead,
their existence, like the idea of summer vacation itself, testified
to the transitory pleasures of modern, middle-class life, to the
luxury of savoring a mental day-off like a watermelon eaten to the
rind.
</P>
<P>
   Such pleasurable diversions, with no apologies, were Marandel's
objective in coordinating ``Around Impressionism: French Paintings
From the National Gallery of Art,'' the new LACMA exhibition that
opened Sunday. Consisting of roughly 70 paintings by 26 major
artists spanning a period of nearly 100 years, the show unabashedly
concerns itself with pure visual beauty. It invites patrons to bask
in luminous, intimate views of the world whose preoccupation with
temporality belies their enduring popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a show for the eyes, not for the head, and there's
nothing wrong with that; that's what museums are supposed to do,''
Marandel says.
</P>
<P>
   Impressionism's story has been told many times, at great length,
and LACMA is making no attempt to oversell a familiar tale. There
will be no five-story banners of Monet's ``Japanese Footbridge''
strung from the ramparts of LACMA West, where ``Around
Impressionism'' will run through Nov. 29. After back-to-back
Picasso and van Gogh blockbusters, ``Around Impressionism'' is
letting LACMA take a breather.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a show like this, you don't have the kind of drama and
pathos that you have in the van Gogh exhibition,'' Marandel
comments on the low-key marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all the franchise names are here. There are no less than
five Manets, six Renoirs and seven Monets, along with significant
works by Degas, Gauguin's vivid ``Haystacks in Brittany'' and
Berthe Morisot's poignantly autobiographical ``The Sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a muted, undulating Sisley landscape and a dazzling
early van Gogh that sets drab Dutch peasant houses against effusive
flowerbeds under blue skies peeking through somber leaden clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Book-ending the show, and supplying its conceptual framework,
are works by impressionistic forerunners like Jean-Baptiste-Camille
Corot, Frederic Bazille and Gustav Courbet, as well as paintings by
Edouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard, whose dreamy, stage-set
interiors and ferociously intense palette inspired so many
20th-century artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're difficult to understand,'' Marandel says of Bonnard
works like ``Table Set in a Garden'' (1908) and ``A Spring
Landscape'' (1935). ``They're not always popular with the public
because he had a very shocking sense of color, I think. He worked
in the south of France, where the light is a bit more hard, like in
Southern California. They yield a lot of pleasure, but they're
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's time frame _ from Corot, whose career began around
1822, to Bonnard, who died in 1947 _ should help dissipate any
lingering idea that impressionism was a movement scorned, whose
practitioners were treated like pariahs. While it's true that
Paris' powerful salon-istas rejected the style as ephemeral,
influential poets and writers quickly championed impressionism,
while a large segment of the viewing public embraced it.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing taxing. Nothing profound. Just a new art form,
custom-made for preserving the vanishing summer days, for
remembering the light that fades all too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always think of the impressionists as the great rejected
painters, the people who did not make it,'' Marandel says. ``In
fact, they did make it. People responded much more positively than
we think. And history told us who was right.'' &QL;

RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT APPROVES PUTIN AS PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change vote total in lede from 232 to 233.)  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ There was little debate, and no drama in the Russian
parliament Monday as a majority of deputies voted swiftly, if
grudgingly, to approve President Boris Yeltsin's latest nominee for
prime minister by a margin of 233- 84.
</P>
<P>
   With their attention fixed on their upcoming reelection
campaigns, parliamentary leaders openly treated the confirmation of
Vladimir Putin _a former KGB officer named by Yeltsin last week as
his heir apparent _ as a perfunctory duty that had to be performed
before getting down to the real business of arranging their
campaign strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Those strategies will become clearer Wednesday, when former
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov _ pushed from office by Yeltsin
just three months ago _announces his long-awaited decision to head
a center-left electoral alliance that already includes Moscow Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov and a handful of powerful regional governors.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's immediate predecessor, Sergei Stepashin, is also
expected to announce his own political plans later this week, which
may pull together another new electoral alliance made up of parties
led by former members of Yeltsin's early reform governments.
</P>
<P>
   Now seen as Russia's most trusted and most popular politician,
Primakov's return to the political arena is certain to overshadow
Putin's efforts to inject new credibility into a government damaged
by Yeltsin's continuous personnel changes.
</P>
<P>
   With Primakov at the top of the ticket, the new ``Fatherland-all
Russia'' coalition promises to dominate the Russian political
landscape, and could provide Primakov with the party he needs to
make a strong bid for the presidency next year.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiescing to Yeltsin's new prime minister, the parliament
avoided a constitutional clash that could have cost members their
seats four months before December parliamentary elections. Under
the Russian constitution, the president must disband the parliament
if it rejects his choice for prime minister three times in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do now is to vote, forget about it and get
down to business,'' said Oleg Morozov, leader of the Russian
Regions faction, who is already a member of the newly forged
``Fatherland-all Russia'' coalition. ``In fact, we have nothing to
discuss today.''
</P>
<P>
   Grigori Yavlinsky, leader of Yabloko, a liberal party, openly
scorned the Kremlin's latest game of musical chairs by deliberately
referring to the new prime minister by the last name of his
predecessor, Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   In a short speech, delivered in clipped sentences, Putin
maintained his image as the Kremlin's ``law and order'' candidate
by pledging to restore discipline to government on all levels.
``Order means first and foremost the clear-cut responsibility of
government before society,'' he told deputies.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to take a tough stance toward some of Russia's wayward
regions, where local governors have openly flaunted the authority
of Moscow. ``I consider dangerous, unacceptable and harmful the
manifestations of spinelessness and of double standards with regard
to different subjects of the Russian federation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin reserved his harshest language for the war in Russia's
southern province of Dagestan, where Russian forces have been
battling Islamic fundamentalists for the last ten days. At his
request, the parliament on Monday passed a unanimous resolution,
urging the government ``to take the the most prompt and severe
measures toward the destruction of illegal armed bands.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days of his nomination, Putin vowed to pursue the Islamic
commandos, who first occupied several mountain villages on Aug. 7
along the border with the breakaway republic of Chechnya, back to
their Chechen bases. On Monday, Viktor Kazantsev, commander of the
north Caucasus military district, told reporters that airstrikes
had hit rebel bases in Dagestan and in Chechnya. ``They did not
expect to be met here so resolutely and decisively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A local state of emergency in the contested districts in
Dagestan is still a possibility, Putin said Monday. But, he added,
``I think that we will succeed in localizing the conflict and
stamping out its seeds without resorting to this extreme measure.''
</P>
<P>
   But Putin Monday also acknowledged that the Russian government
must also deal with social and economic conditions in the North
Caucasus, which have deteriorated since the 1994-1996 war with the
self-proclaimed independent republic of Chechnya. ``Without a
solution of these issues nothing else will work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said one of his top goals as prime minister will be to
insure ``honest and fair'' elections first to the parliament, then
to the presidency. He said his own presidential ambitions will
depend on whether his government is able to deliver on its
promises. `'You can't deceive the people,'' he said. ``If there are
results, then I will have a real chance to at least speak about it.
If there are no results, then there will be nothing to discuss.'

SPORTS COLUMN: HALF A VICTORY IS BETTER THAN NONE FOR GIANTS'
COORDINATORS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The referee's beeper signaled a replay challenge
during the second half of the Giants-Minnesota Vikings game last
Friday night. It came from the Giants' sideline. But Jim Fassel was
not there.
</P>
<P>
   The referee trotted over with a puzzled look since the play was
a routine kickoff. The official asked John Fox, the Giants'
defensive coordinator, why the Giants were challenging their own
kickoff? Fox said forget it, it was an accident. The referee
discovered that Fox was not wearing the beeper head coaches use for
replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, can't talk to you, who's got the beeper?'' the referee
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Fox turned and saw Jim Skipper, the Giants' offensive
coordinator, working intently with the offense on the Giants'
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Skipper, wearing the beeper on his side, had sat down and the
signal had accidentally been triggered.
</P>
<P>
   The referee laughed. Fox laughed. Skipper laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wear the beeper on your hip and the button is on the
bottom, so, it's a technical thing where you can have a
malfunction,'' Fox said. ``It happened in another game over the
weekend. I think the league may take a look at it and change it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was about as confusing as it got for Skipper and Fox in the
Giants' 36-21 preseason victory over Minnesota. Before Fassel, the
Giants' head coach, left the team on last Thursday to visit his
ailing mother in Phoenix, he named Skipper and Fox co-head coaches.
For the last five days, they have carried out their duties in a
sure-handed manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I joked with Skip that we're each one-half and 0 as head
coaches in the NFL.'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Both could win a lot more games in the league as prime leaders.
Maybe both will.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is 44, Skipper is 50. Fox coached at eight colleges and in
the defunct United States Football League before working with five
National Football League teams. Then he came to the Giants in 1997.
Skipper coached at four colleges and also in the USFL before
spending 10 seasons as New Orleans' running backs coach. After a
year with the Arizona Cardinals, he also came to the Giants in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   This was a rare head-coaching audition, of sorts, for both.
</P>
<P>
   NFL assistant coaches, whose salaries average nearly $270,000 a
year compared with almost $1.5 million for head coaches, often
blend easily into the background. Some, like those that work under
Jets head coach Bill Parcells, have no choice but to be work and be
silent because Parcells does not allow them to speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel has picked excellent coordinators in Skipper and Fox and
he is comfortable enough with his status and their savvy to allow
them not only to work but to lead and to speak for him and his
team.
</P>
<P>
   Skipper and Fox are alternating the leadership roles until
Fassel's expected return Monday. They take turns speaking to the
team. They share the media duties. They are not falling over each
other competing for glory.
</P>
<P>
   But both realize, even for a few days, that they have an
opportunity to shine, to be up front in a way that seldom arrives
for assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it, but there's no reason to shout about it,'' Skipper
said. ``Just because you've got on a brand new suit doesn't mean
you have to yell and tell everyone, `Hey, I've got on a brand new
suit!' People can see.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Skipper _ full of wit and candor. I once asked him about
Tyrone Wheatley, the former Giants' first-round pick at running
back who never quite fit. Why, Skipper was asked, didn't the Giants
do a better job of coddling Wheatley and getting to know him and
understand him in an effort to maximize his production?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of that was done,'' he answered. ``But hey, when you buy
a brand new Cadillac, why should you have to get a tune-up all of
the time? You want it to run. And you look around the league and
see other team's Cadillacs are running. Why isn't ours? That's was
a fair way to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, thus, Wheatley is gone. The Giants that remain say Skipper
is intricately involved in game planning, visits with not only his
offensive players but also with defensive players, preaches
accountability and reminds them that mistakes count, that too many
games in the N.F.L. are lost more than won.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is effusive.
</P>
<P>
   He is constantly chatting with his players and with his coaches
and devising intricate defensive schemes that are challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job, I truly do, and I enjoy being around the
players,'' Fox said. ``I expect a lot and our players have learned
to live up to those expectations. There are only 31 head-coaching
jobs in this league. I stopped trying to figure out who gets those
jobs and why. Most assistants want to be head coaches one day. I
hope to be fortunate to get that first opportunity. Then maybe I'll
be real fortunate and get to do it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' players say that both men are deserving. They see
the league's trend and history. Skipper, who is black, may have to
wait longer. Fox, who is white, could get a chance much faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skip can do it, no question, and he can be great,'' said
Jessie Armstead, a Giants linebacker. ``With John Fox, we better
win something around here pretty quick because he's not going to be
here long. Somebody's going to hire him fast. We've got two
coordinators who are pretty hard to hide.''

 &HT;    Magellan sells majority of stake in Charter
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Magellan Health Services said Monday that it agreed to transfer
most of its ownership stake of Alpharetta, Ga.-based Charter
Behavioral Health Systems to a Texas firm.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland-based Magellan also will transfer the assets of five
psychiatric hospital systems to Charter in an effort to help the
troubled chain with a proposed recapitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transfer of assets will represent an increase in Charter's
net book value,'' said Kevin Helmintoller of Magellan.
</P>
<P>
   Charter declined comment on the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The largest private U.S. psychiatric hospital chain, Charter has
been beset by federal investigations, billing disputes and
continued pressure from lower reimbursements by managed-care
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Charter's operations were the subject of a critical ``60 Minutes
II'' broadcast in April, which alleged widespread problems,
including patient injuries and deaths, in its hospital system.
Charter, which operates 88 psychiatric facilities, has insisted
that no widespread problems exist.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan said Charter has not paid August rent for its
facilities. But as part of Monday's deal, Charter can spread that
rent over the last four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland-based Magellan has attempted to sell its 50 percent
stake in Charter for some time, with a goal of becoming purely a
behavioral-health managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   A complicated 1997 deal created Charter Behavioral Health
Systems to operate 95 psychiatric hospitals. The venture was 50
percent owned by Magellan, the other half by an affiliate of
Crescent Real Estate Equities, based in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan, formerly based in Atlanta, will retain a 10 percent
share in Charter, and give the rest to Crescent Operating, the
affiliate, which will own 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Magellan will be freed from its $6 million-a-year
obligation to provide labor and other expenses in running a call
center for Charter.
</P>
<P>
   The five hospital-based joint ventures transferred to Charter
are in Raleigh, N.C.; Lafayette, La.; Anchorage, Alaska; Chicago
and Boston. Magellan will retain ownership of a system in
Albuquerque, though it plans to sell it. Charter will remain a
preferred provider for Magellan.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is expected to close next month.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan's shares rose 5/8 to close at $9 15/16. Crescent, which
is headed by billionaire Richard Rainwater, fell 1/8 to $20.25.

ERITREAN LEADER SEES END TO BORDER WAR

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, having recently
concluded intensive negotiations in the Horn of Africa, said here
Monday that the Ethiopia-Eritrea border war may soon end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospects for peace appear better than at any time in the
past 15 months, and we are cautiously optimistic,'' Isaias said at
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   African and Western mediators are still waiting for Ethiopia to
accept a final part of a peace plan that would end the world's
deadliest ongoing conflict.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Clinton administration official said Monday, ``It's
so close. We're hoping now it breaks. Both sides understand that
this war is just not worth it in terms of the lives and
opportunities lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea has unconditionally agreed to a three-part peace plan
put forward by American and African diplomats. Ethiopia has agreed
to the first two parts, but last week submitted questions on the
final part of a ceasefire arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   When negotiators supply the answers soon, Ethiopia then must
make its critical decision. If it agrees to the deal, United
Nations peacekeepers would immediately move into the border area to
oversee troop withdrawal. If the Ethiopians say no, fighting could
surge, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of peace Monday did not obscure the horror of what has
recently happened along the border, despite Isaias' best efforts to
present an image of Eritrea as a peace-seeking country that has
fought only in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian reporter Gerima Emawayish asked why tens of thousands
of people had to die in a battle along a 600-mile border of dry
riverbeds, scruffy trees and a handful of small villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and (Ethiopian) Prime Minister Meles Zenawi were called
the `lights of Africa.' When you two came to power, we were
expecting peace, stability and unity. And it was not only for
Ethiopia and Eritrea, but for all of Africa,'' said Gerima, a
writer for the Ethiopian newspaper Gaffat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said evenly, both leaders brought bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a conflict of two leaders. It is not a conflict of the
two people. Nobody has asked the Ethiopian people to go to war over
a piece of land. Nobody has asked the Eritrean people. We beg you
two leaders to stop this war. . . . It is a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Her words expressed what US and African diplomats have privately
said for months. ``For the people of both countries, it would
really be a shame if we couldn't get this peace agreement finalized
now,'' said the US official. ``The people are the ones bearing the
brunt of this.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gerima finished her short speech Monday, a stone-faced
Isaias replied: ``I have no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed later on whether he bore some blame for the war, Isaias
said, ``Whether good or bad, we bear some responsibility,'' but he
portrayed Ethiopia as the only aggressor in the fight. The
Ethiopian ambassador to the United States, Berhane Gebre-Christos,
did not return repeated telephone calls Monday seeking comment. A
deputy to Berhane declined to respond to Isaias.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats in the Horn of Africa say the war began in May
1998 when Eritrea sent a mechanized force into the disputed border
town of Badme after Ethiopian troops killed four Eritrean soldiers
there. Ethiopia then declared war, and the conflict grew into
fierce battles that resembled World War I fights, with Eritreans
dug in trenches and waves of Ethiopian soldiers charging across
open territory.
</P>
<P>
   Western analysts estimate that 30,000 to 60,000 Ethiopians have
died so far, while Eritrea has suffered casualties of 7,000 to
15,000. The fight has bewildered outsiders and residents of both
countries because Isaias and Meles, who are distant cousins,
combined their rebel forces to overthrow the Ethiopian government
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea, controlled for a century by Italy, Great Britain and
Ethiopia, soon after won its independence, and Isaias and Meles
were championed by President Clinton and other world leaders as
part of a new generation of African leaders who could help end the
continent's cycles of war and famine.
</P>
<P>
   Before their war, both Eritrea and Ethiopia played roles as
mediators in other African conflicts, including the Sudan, where a
16-year civil war has claimed the lives of an estimated 2 million
people. But Ethiopia and Eritrea have turned inward since their war
broke out, buying weapons at a furious pace.
</P>
<P>
   Isaias, who was given a glowing introduction at the news
conference by longtime US civil rights leader Julian Bond, said he
was on an unofficial trip. But the US official said Isaias was
likely to meet both Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and
national security adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger before
traveling to New York for talks with top UN officials.

 &HT;    UPS to take $1.44 billion charge
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Parcel Service will take a one-time net charge
of $1.44 billion in the second quarter to cover estimated tax
liabilities from 1984 through 1999, the company said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The charge results in a net loss of $854 million for UPS for the
quarter ended June 30. The Atlanta-based package delivery company
had reported net income of $588 million before the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the U.S. Tax Court decided that UPS owes $64.9 million
in back taxes, plus interest, for the tax years 1983 and 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS had asserted that UPS owed more taxes for 1985 through
1990, and UPS expected similar claims through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making provisions now for what we believe is the
maximum liability,'' said UPS spokesman Norman Black.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it took the charge, UPS said it has not decided how to
respond to the Tax Court decision and the claims for later years.
The company could continue the legal battles or begin negotiating a
settlement, UPS said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   As matter of bookkeeping, UPS recorded a tax assessment charge
of $1.786 billion. But it also booked a related tax benefit of $344
million, bringing the net figure to $1.44 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The major issue in the tax case involved money that customers
paid to insure their packages against losses beyond the usual limit
of $100. The Tax Court ruled that UPS engaged in ``sham
transactions'' with a Bermuda insurance company to avoid paying
income taxes on profit from the insurance service.
</P>
<P>
   UPS reaffirmed Monday its decision to proceed with plans for a
public offering of about 10 percent of its common stock later in
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jeffrey L. Pittsburg of Pittsburg Institutional Services
in Garden City, N.Y., said Monday's action will not hurt the IPO.
``It might even be beneficial for them, because they are getting it
behind them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS said that it has sufficient cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities to cover the maximum payments in the tax
case. It had $3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, as of
March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service said it confirmed UPS' senior
unsecured debt rating at Aaa and its short-term rating at Prime-1,
but changed the outlook to negative. Moody's said the negative
outlook is prompted by the ``potentially negative financial
consequences'' of the tax case.
</P>
<P>
   But Moody's added that the fundamental business conditions and
operating performance of UPS are unaffected by this development and
``remain strong,'' according to Dow Jones News Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the court's decision could result in a large cash
outflow, the company maintains strong liquidity and a solid balance
sheet,'' Moody's said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS also said it is working out a way of providing excess-value
insurance through a UPS subsidiary, rather than an outside company.
That would result in increased income from the premiums and
``should eliminate for future periods the issues raised by the
IRS,'' the company said.

GROUP 1   BOOSTS GRIP ON AMERICAN CAR DEALERSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: La., Texas)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Group 1 Automotive acquired Ira Automotive Group _ one of
Massachusetts' largest auto dealers _ Monday, bringing the first
signs of auto dealership consolidation to the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Group 1, the sixth-largest car retailer in the country, also
announced acquisitions in Louisiana and Texas, bringing the total
price tag for the acquisitions to about $67.8 million in cash and
stock. Group 1 will gain 25 dealerships in the three states.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials estimate the new dealerships will account for
$570 million in annual sales, raising Group 1's annual revenue to
more than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The automotive retailing industry has been highly
fragmented,'' said B.B. Hollingsworth Jr., Group 1's chairman,
president, and chief executive officer. ``This is a terrific
opportunity for growth through acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Group 1 hopes to compete with industry leader AutoNation Inc.
and other giant automobile retailers by entering into untapped
markets, acquiring the leading dealership in the market, and then
buying up smaller dealerships to round out the group's brand mix,
said Zachary Warren, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large groups are the trend,'' Warren said, adding that
consolidating dealerships reduces costs of advertising, insurance,
and employee benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Group 1 is the first auto consolidator to enter the Northeast
market, Warren said. The group already operates 79 dealerships and
18 collision service centers in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, New
Mexico, Colorado, and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Group 1's performance has been excellent,'' Warren said.
``They have exceeding all of the expectations during every quarter
since they went public.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira Automotive's seven dealerships will serve as Group 1's
platform business in the region, Hollingsworth said. Ira
Automotive, with annual revenues of $260 million, consists of
Toyota, Lexus, Porsche, Audi, Subaru, Mazda, Isuzu, Buick, and
Pontiac franchises, many in Danvers. The 42-year-old company
employs more than 500 workers and has been family-owned since its
start.
</P>
<P>
   Operations and management will continue under the Ira Automotive
name, Hollingsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   David Rosenberg, son of founder Ira Rosenberg, will continue to
lead the Massachusetts operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrific for me and it's terrific for my
employees,'' Rosenberg said, adding that the name Ira Automotive
will maintain its strong presence in Massachusetts. ``By joining
this public corporation we are able to enter into this fast new
area of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg said he was eager to join Group 1 because
consolidation is becoming the trend in auto retail. He said the
company actually intends to expand Ira Automotive operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is changing very rapidly,'' Rosenberg said. ``But
Group 1 is the best in the business. This will really let us be the
leading dealer in Massachusetts and let us have lower costs than
the local competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Small dealerships say they are not worried about direct
competiton from consolidating groups, but are concerned that the
manufacturers will eventually close the smaller dealerships and
serve only the giants.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Scola, a car salesman at Barron Chevrolet and Geo in
Danvers, Mass., said it is easier to sell cars at a single
franchise because people who know what they want come to the
dealership that specializes in that kind of car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big guys are no threat to us. It's just if the
(manufacturers) pick out all the small dealerships and only keep
the big guys around,'' Scola said.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans-based Bohn Automotive Group was tapped to be the
platform of Group 1's Louisiana operations. Lynn Alexander
Automotive Group, based in San Angelo, Texas, will become Group 1's
platform in that region, and the company has added Amarillo,
Texas-based Lone Star Chrysler/Plymouth/Mitsubishi to be the first
smaller dealership to complement the company's West Texas platform.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the subsidiaries will continue to be run by previous
management, Hollingsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for successful entrepreneurs,'' Hollingsworth said.
``Yes we are looking for good franchises and good locations, but
most of all we are looking for outstanding managers. And we've been
very successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Group 1's stock rose 9/16 to 19 13/16 Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange.

 &HT;    `My South is now truly gone': Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Over the years, Celestine Sibley had great fun in
planning her funeral. Sometimes she'd consider having the Atlanta
Symphony perform; other times she leaned toward a simpler affair,
with nothing more than a mule and a pine box. But she always
insisted having the Big Bethel choir sing some of her favorite
spirituals.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. at
North Avenue Presbyterian Church that isn't as lofty or as spare _
but the Big Bethel Choir will sing, as she wished.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Patricia Templeton, associate rector of St. Timothy's
Episcopal Church in Signal Mountain, Tenn., will officiate at the
service, but other details are still incomplete. Longtime friend
and former Newsweek bureau chief Bill Emerson is scheduled to
deliver a eulogy, and former Atlanta Journal reporter and Los
Angeles Times Washington Bureau Chief Jack Nelson will make
additional remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the favorite hymns Sibley chose for her service are
``Fount of Every Blessing'' and ``The Strife is O'er,'' an Easter
song of hope and resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the theme of the service to be one of celebration,''
said Templeton, who worked as an intern at The Atlanta Constitution
in 1976. ``She was a remarkable woman. How many people can say they
love going to work every day of their life until they're 85 years
old?''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes had offered the Capitol for the memorial
service, but the family decided to use the North Avenue
Presbyterian Church instead, because it's larger.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley died at 5:30 a.m. Sunday at her beachside retreat in Dog
Island, Fla. ``She went peacefully,'' said granddaughter Sibley
Fleming. ``My mother and I were beside her holding her hand.''
</P>
<P>
   As the family gathered on the beach to say goodbye at
midmorning, Sibley's neighbor and longtime friend Becker
Boatenwright ferried her body across St. George Sound to the
mainland, to be transported to Beggs Funeral Home in Tallahassee,
Fla., for cremation. At a later date, the family plans to scatter
her ashes on East Bay, at her birthplace of Holley, Fla. Fleming
says she is going to plant an apple tree in her grandmother's honor
_ once she can settle on a location.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before she died, nearly 1,000 cards and letters
arrived at the paper and were forwarded to Sibley in Florida.
``Some of them she read twice,'' Fleming said. ``Just the show of
how much people cared was what was important, she realized that
before she died. She was in such good spirits up to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to Sibley's death continued to pour in Monday, from
dignitaries such as former president Jimmy Carter to readers who
never met her but who were touched by her columns.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most poignant responses came by e-mail from Allison
DeLong of Portland, Ore., who recently discovered Sibley's columns
in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution online.
</P>
<P>
   ``My South is now truly gone,'' she wrote. ``The South of my
childhood was taken too soon from me, and reading Celestine
Sibley's column filled that place in my heart where fragmented
memories of small wooden houses with screened back porches, and the
summer gardens of my grandmother were fading too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta native and novelist Pat Conroy, who once called Sibley
``one of the South's natural wonders,'' said one of his favorite
books was ``Dear Store,'' a history of Rich's department store.
</P>
<P>
   ``That book was almost biblical in my family,'' said Conroy from
his home on Fripp Island, S.C. ``My whole family worked at
Rich's.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Sibley's column was so personal, readers felt she was
part of their family, Conroy said. ``Here's how personal people
felt about her. My mother, when I was five years old, called
Celestine to tell her our dog was missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her opinions carried a lot of weight in his family as well,
Conroy said. After his successes with ``The Great Santini'' and
``The Prince of Tides,'' one of his aunts in Alabama remarked, ``He
ain't that big. Celestine Sibley ain't written a word about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Noel Barrett of Norcross recalled getting weeks-old copies of
the Journal-Constitution when he was stationed overseas. ``But as
soon as I read Celestine's column, I was in Buckhead or at Five
Points or gardening at the cabin in Sweet Apple. After 20 years
away, I returned home to an Atlanta I didn't recognize. ... The
only constant, the only thing that remained the same was Celestine.
I could read her and feel, maybe, you can go home again....''
</P>
<P>
   MEMORIAL SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   11 a.m. Wednesday, North Avenue Presbyterian Church, 607
Peachtree St. (the corner of North Avenue, two blocks from the
North Avenue MARTA station). In lieu of flowers, the family
suggests contributions be sent to the library of one's choice or to
Trees Atlanta.

 &HT;    Celestine inspires a generation
 &HT;    By Rheta Grimsley Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I loved her from afar, the way most readers did.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred times, no, a thousand, from Tunnel Hill to Timbuktu,
in the beguiling and off-beaten places I best love to cover, people
would ask the same question: ``Do you know Celestine?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I would say, puffing like a winter sparrow. ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   And I did. Not well, not intimately, not like a lot of her
longtime colleagues. But I knew her. Had known her, really, for a
long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived in Atlanta five years ago, Celestine Sibley
already had a lifetime's worth of friends with whom to share her
wit and wisdom. Yet Celestine was one of the first, the few, to
drop by my desk, welcome me to town and invite me to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   That meal made me proud, the way a Texas Leaguer might feel
supping with DiMaggio. I called home and told my mother, who told
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   I was 11 when Celestine began writing her column. My grandmother
introduced me to Sibley stories, reading the best lines aloud
before our afternoon naps. Grannie clipped her favorites with the
pinking sheers and stuck them in the Bible for safekeeping. Some
were there, next to Jesus' red ink, when my grandmother died.
</P>
<P>
   By age 13 I was trying to write newspaper stories myself, first
for Smoke Signals, the junior high paper. But our class made a
field trip to tour a real newsroom, and I was devastated. What I
saw was a gaggle of serious, middle-aged men, all men, smoking and
looking resolutely haggard and aloof. I guess the women were off
covering teas.
</P>
<P>
   But I had hope. I had Celestine, who proved women could write
for newspapers the same as men, or, in her case, better. It is no
exaggeration to say the mere thought of Celestine gave me comfort
many times during the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism schools are 90 percent female now, and newsrooms at
least half women. That wasn't always the case. Once the same
newspapers that preached egalitarian ideals and harped at other
businesses about discrimination had trouble practicing their own
sermons.
</P>
<P>
   The gruff, gray, male reporter that Gable and Bogart rendered so
romantic died hard. I liked the type myself. But I didn't want to
sharpen their pencils.
</P>
<P>
   Celestine probably didn't consider herself a role model for
Southern girls who longed to write for newspapers; she was no
feminist crusader. But she inspired a generation of us,
nonetheless. Just as she was inspiration for any writer, man or
woman, who fought another common newsroom prejudice, the one
against so-called ``soft'' stories, stories about small happenings,
silk threads in the tapestry called life.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago in Eatonton (Ga.), the curator of the Uncle Remus
Museum, Norma Watterson, asked if I could deliver a letter. She had
written it out in longhand that morning.
</P>
<P>
   Norma met Celestine only once, about 50 years ago, when the
writer spoke to a group of Eatonton women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all dressed up,'' Norma recalled, in white gloves and hats
and heels. Celestine arrived in a plain skirt, blouse and sensible
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dressed up for anything after that,'' Norma said.
</P>
<P>
   Norma was writing Celestine to relay a remarkable thing. It
seems every time Celestine wrote about a personal experience _ the
death of her mother, spending a sleepless night on the porch _ the
same thing had just happened to Norma. Their lives had amazing
parallels, and Norma wanted Celestine to know.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was Celestine's secret strength, the one that
confounded other reporters, even editors. She wrote about the
ordinary things that happen to us all, and she did it so well we
saw our own stories in hers.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia sun grew dimmer Sunday, and the big press on
Marietta Street hummed a dirge. Celestine finally was taking a
rest, and all of us who owe her began the season called mourning.
</P>

   Canadian Heritage, a branch of the government that's supposed to
come up with ideas to unify Canadians from Vancouver to
Newfoundland, recently polled the citizenry: Would it be useful to
have a national insect in addition to such icons as the national
flag and song?
</P>
<P>
   When 84 percent swatted the idea away, Heritage spokeswoman
 &UR; Anne-Sophie Lawless &LR;  said the government probably would not pursue
it. (Education R Us: The United States does not have an official
insect, but the California dogface butterfly was designated the
official state insect in 1972.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MAFAKATHINI, South Africa _ Nomagugu Ngobese first shoos the
cows away from a shady spot at the base of a ridge. She is looking
for as much privacy as possible. She lays down a grass mat,
positions three women holding up two blankets as screens and
signals that it is time to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 girls from this village on the outskirts of
Pietermaritzburg, none older than 18, most between 11 and 14,
giggle and jostle to form a rough line. Then, one by one, they
disappear behind the blankets, lie down and submit to an
examination to determine whether they are virgins.
</P>
<P>
   As the first girl emerges from behind the blankets, her panties
still in her hand, the other girls ululate and shout their
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of testing virginity, a ritual that died out here
decades ago, is once again being revived these days. This time,
however, it has less to do with bride price and religion, than with
a fight against modern scourges, such as child abuse, teen
pregnancy and an HIV infection rate that is among the highest in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others involved in the testing, Mrs. Ngobese, a
principal at a nearby school who is also a traditional healer,
hopes that the tests will serve both as a way to enforce abstinence
morality and check the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the province of KwaZulu/Natal, where the testing has
become the most popular, recent surveys have shown that about 35
percent of the young women visiting prenatal clinics test positive
for HIV, the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say to me, `Why, why are you doing this?''' said Mrs.
Ngobese, ``And I say to them, `What have you done to stop AIDS, to
limit abortion?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``We say, `We are going ahead with our virginity testing because
we have nothing else.'''
</P>
<P>
   But some South Africans are appalled at the resumption of the
tests, which used to be used to set the price of a bride (one cow
more for a virgin) and also to make sure that only virgins danced
in rain-making ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Some women's rights advocates see the custom as degrading and
another way of making the young girls responsible for what happens
to them sexually, when in many cases they do not have much say.
Rates of rape, including that of children, are among the highest in
the world here. Moreover, they say, being identified as a virgin
may increase the danger that the girls will become targets of
sexual assault because of a popular myth that sex with a virgin
will cure AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Rights advocates also question whether many of the testers,
often traditional healers, are drawing accurate conclusions when
there is no standard medically accepted test for virginity.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ngobese, who says she began her work after she had a dream
telling her to do this, says she has examined about 10,000 girls in
the last three years. Experts estimated that ten of thousands more
have been tested. Though the practice is most popular among Zulus
here on South Africa's eastern coast, it is also used elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago if you talked about virginity testing people
would laugh and say that was something that their grannies did,''
said Suzanne Leclerc Madlala, an anthropologist at the University
of Natal who is studying the issue of gender responsibility and
AIDs. ``But it's really a growing phenomenon now. This year it is
bigger than last year and next year it will be even bigger again.''
</P>
<P>
   How the testing is conducted varies from village to village and
from occasion to occasion. In the Eastern Cape province, recently,
where most people are of Xhosa descent, three-days of celebrations,
workshops on health issues and speeches from local dignitaries were
organized around the recognition of about 60 girls who had been
virgins for two years. They were examined by a committee of women
and then given a brightly colored certificate.
</P>
<P>
   But in Mafakathini, Mrs. Ngobese was practically alone with the
girls and few villagers paid much attention, except for some
teen-age boys who climbed the ridge for a look and were loudly told
off by Mrs. Ngobese. Most of the girls said they had been sent by
their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   While the first two girls drew cheers, Mrs. Ngobese quieted the
group. She does not want overt discrimination against the girls
whom she deems are not virgins. Of the 30 girls she examined, more
than half _ some who had not reached puberty yet, had in her
opinion had sex. Several she counseled to visit a health clinic
because she believed they had a sexually transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, however, how Mrs. Ngobeselikes to work. She would
like the mothers to come with their daughters: She holds them
equally responsible for the girls' virginity. She prefers to be
able to speak to the community about the value of respecting women
and the dangers of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ngobese, who wears traditional costumes for the testing,
uses rubber gloves to do the exams which she changes whenever she
suspects that one of the girls has an infection.
</P>
<P>
   Exams cost about 10 cents, a certificate of virginity 90 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Mrs. Ngobese's motivation is to return to the ways of
her people _ traditional ways she says were dismantled by colonial
oppressors. But she also sees herself as a feminist, ``This is
about empowering the girl child to say no to sex, teaching her to
care about her body. Some people see it as oppression. But we are
burying our youth every Saturday here. We must do something.''
</P>
<P>
   On some weekends, Mrs. Ngobese's testing is only a component of
bigger celebrations that involve the whole community and are
usually organized by a Zulu cultural group that wants to revive
Zulu traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Ntshangase, a lecturer in Zulu at the University of Natal
heads the group, and says such events make better platforms for
involving both men and women in taking responsibility for the
welfare of young girls. He would like to see more male virginity
testing according to a local custom. The boys are usually asked to
urinate, without using their hands, over a three foot high marker
or fence.
</P>
<P>
   Ntshangase sees benefit in the process which he says gives young
people sex education and what he sees as some badly needed lessons
in morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are saying we are interfering with the privacy of
the individual but we are not forcing anyone,'' said Ntshangase.
``We believe the problems of today can be eradicated by going back
to the old ways. Here is the solution. Full stop.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But some child advocates and woman's rights groups say that the
testing has potentially dangerous consequences and has caused
hardship for some young women.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Childline, a child advocacy group that offers rape
counseling, say they have seen about 40 young girls in the last
year who were brought in by their parents after they failed the
virginity tests. The parents want the girls to explain what has
happened to them and have in some cases beaten them to try to get
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes these inspections destroy the child and divide the
family,'' said Joan van Niekerk, the director of the agency. ``The
children we have seen are quite frightened. There is so much abuse
out there and often it is not the girl's choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Van Niekerk and others says that virgins can also be
targeted for rape both because of the myth that sex with a virgin
cures AIDS and, particularly in townships where gang rape is
common, because virgins are seen as the ultimate challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do see the celebration of chastity as a good thing,'' said
Ms. Van Niekerk. ``But there are so many problems with this.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's Commission on Gender Equality has also expressed
its concern and has held a series of workshops in Kwa-Zulu Natal to
talk to testers and community leaders involved in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about an infringement of privacy and an
invasion of a person that is not constitutional,'' said Futhi
Zikalala, the commission's provincial manager in Kwa Zulu.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Zikalala says the commission is treading softly for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to be diplomatic about it,'' said Ms. Zikalala.
``It is too prevalent and has supporters even at quite high levels
of government. So we are trying not to alienate people and just
keep talking.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Ms. Zikalala said the commission would like to see a
test case taken to the Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the blankets in Mafakathini, Mrs. Ngobese gave the girls
she believed to be virgins a pep talk and a warm pat on the knee.
To the others, she gave a brief and unemotional lecture: They were
to stop having sex and come back next week when a big festival was
planned and there would be time for talking and counseling.
Regardless of her opinion, she gave all the girls a white mark on
their foreheads for completing the tests.
</P>
<P>
   None of the girls deemed non-virgins argued with her, though
some looked crestfallen. While the march to the field had been
high-spirited affair, the walk back to the village was somber.

 &HT;    Home Depot names new Expo locations
 &HT;    By Patti Bond

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot has picked five sites in four new markets
for the expansion of its Expo Design Center chain.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Expo will enter markets in Boston, Detroit, New
Jersey and San Francisco, the home improvement retailer said

markets, Home Depot said last year it was ready to roll out the
concept nationwide. The company wants to open 200 Expos by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Three Expos opened last month in California and Virginia. Three
more will open this year, including two in Texas and one in
suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The new cities in Monday's announcement include Laguna Niguel,
Calif.; Smithtown, N.Y.; Union, N.J.; W. Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
and Troy, Mich.

 &HT;    Medaphis metamorphs itself into Per-Se Technologies
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Seeking to erase the stain from past financial
trouble, Vinings, Ga.-based Medaphis Corp. announced Monday that it
is renaming itself Per-Se Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The new name, taken from its software unit, follows a
reorganization that combines its physician services and health-care
information businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes a clean break with the past,'' said Allen Ritchie,
president and CEO. ``I'm tired of referring to Medaphis history.''
</P>
<P>
   Medaphis, whose core business handles billing and collections
for doctors and hospitals, grew to a $500 million-a-year company in
the mid-1990s through acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   But earnings disappointments and two steep stock price plunges
in 1996 sent the company into a tailspin. Its share price, which
surpassed 50 that year, has fallen into the single digits. The
company lost $560.2 million on revenue of $349.8 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Per-Se Technologies' shares rose 11/32 Monday to close at $4
15/32. The company traded Monday under the new ticker symbol PSTI,
which replaced MEDA.
</P>
<P>
   The name change ''is a good move,'' said analyst William
Michalak of Wachovia Securities in Atlanta. ``It marks a new
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Steven Halper of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said the
new name ``is partially window-dressing.'' But he added: ``There's
been so much bad news created by Medaphis _ it's a great
opportunity to break with the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But a name change by itself is not enough, noted Alf Nucifora,
president of Nucifora Consulting in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one way to psychologically cleanse yourself from the
past. But you also need an intrinsic change in the way the company
is structured _ its management, philosophy or culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Per-Se will keep its headquarters in the Vinings area.
</P>
<P>
   It has 500 employees here, and 6,000 more across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The company has 18,000 doctors and 2,000 health-care
organizations as clients.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it recently settled the last of several
shareholder suits. It also has settled two federal investigations
of its billing and collections business by agreeing to pay $19.5
million to the Office of the Inspector General.
</P>
<P>
   The Per-Se unit, which has been operating autonomously as a
subsidiary, has focused on integrating the health-care software
gained through Medaphis' acquisition of six technology companies.
The unit provides hospitals with software that can handle patient
scheduling, clinical information and financial management.
</P>
<P>
   The patient financial software ''will become the backbone for
our physician services business,'' said Ritchie, who became CEO a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The health-care information-technology market is wide open,
Ritchie said. ``I believe there will be a new leader in health-care
information technology in two years. ``
</P>
<P>
   The current leader, McKesson HBOC, he said, is ``facing a lot of
problems this company is familiar with.''
</P>
<P>
   McKesson bought Atlanta-based HBO &AMP; Co. in January, but
accounting problems discovered at HBO &AMP; Co. have led to McKesson
shares plummeting, government investigations and numerous
shareholder suits.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie noted that getting medical claims paid is a complicated
process and that physicians and hospitals ``need a combination of
technology and people with knowledge and skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Per-Se also announced that Philip Pead, former president of the
Per-Se unit, will become an executive vice president and chief
operating officer of the combined units.

TWINS ARE WHERE BREWERS WANT TO BE AMONG SMALLER-MARKET TEAMS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Minnesota Twins are making progress before their very eyes.
In last place for 12 consecutive weeks, one week short of half the
season, the Twins are now in third place, holding their largest
lead over the fourth-place team. This is a team that has nine
rookies on its 25-player roster and has had as many as 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a better understanding of what to do and what needs
to be done in the ball game,'' Tom Kelly, their patient
manager/teacher, said.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of progress, on the other hand, has taken a toll in
Milwaukee. Under Manager Phil Garner and General Manager Sal Bando,
the Brewers were not moving forward and some other teams were, most
notably the Cincinnati Reds, the Oakland Athletics and the
Philadelphia Phillies. All three have lower payrolls than the
Brewers, and they are contending for playoff spots, the Reds and
Athletics especially.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely I'm aware of what they're doing,'' Wendy
Selig-Prieb said Monday. As president and chief executive officer
of the Brewers, Selig-Prieb was disappointed that the team had not
advanced last year and was not showing any progress this season
either. Garner and Bando shared her disappointment and understood
her desire for change.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and '97, the Brewers did not quite reach .500 but were
closing in on it. Last season they regressed, finishing with a
74-88 record. Last Thursday, the day of the dismissals, they had a
winning percentage, .464, that would compute to a 75-87 record for
a full season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed we were ready to take things to the next level
here and it hasn't happened,'' Selig-Prieb said. ``We did a
significant increase in our payroll after the '97 season in
anticipation of taking it to the next level. When that didn't
happen, I concluded we needed to make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers went from a $22-million payroll in '97 to $37
million and then $41 million this season. The Reds, with a $30
million payroll, were in first place in the National League Central
at the start of play last night. The Athletics, at $22 million,
were only a game off the American League wild-card pace. The
Phillies, at $30 million, had slipped eight games back in the N.L.
wild-card race but were eight games closer to the lead than the
Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins are paying their inexperienced crop of players $16
million for the season. They are not prepared to make a significant
increase in their payroll because, unlike the Brewers, they are not
close to moving into a new park and reaping the economic windfall
it usually generates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those teams are a little bit further along than we
are,'' Kelly said of the Reds and the Athletics. ``They're somewhat
stronger than we are, physically stronger. They hit the ball over
the wall. We can't do that. We've got to nickel and dime all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Selig-Prieb sees it, the Brewers escalated their payroll
from nickels and dimes to quarters and half-dollars, and victories
have been as rare as two-dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been aggressive in raising our payroll and in the
amateur draft,'' she said. ``In order to build a winning team I
believe you have to be aggressive in every area. This is the
approach I want to see us take organizationally, an aggressive
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking a general manager, the Brewers would do well to find
someone who would work in the style of Jim Bowden, the Reds'
general manager. Strapped by payroll constraints, Bowden every
winter scours every avenue of player procurement and usually comes
up with an interesting mix of players. One baseball official has
referred to his style as razzle-dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   In her search for a general manager, Selig-Prieb will also cast
a net wide enough to take in minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   She is in a pivotal position. Her father, the commissioner, has
directed teams to notify him of their lists of candidates for
vacancies at high and middle-level positions. If they can't
identify minority candidates, Bud Selig has told the clubs, he will
help them. Selig-Prieb doesn't need help; she has been involved in
high-level discussions about baseball's need to increase the number
of blacks and Hispanics in decision-making positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's the right thing to do,'' she said. ``I think it's
not only the right thing to do, but it's a good thing to do. Our
process will be very, very inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig-Prieb is not saying the Brewers automatically will hire a
black or a Hispanic as general manager or manager or both, but
others believe the chances are good that a member of a minority
group will fill one of those positions.
</P>
<P>
   Among members of minority groups currently employed in baseball,
the No. 1 candidate for a general manager's job is Omar Minaya, the
Mets' senior assistant general manager. If Bob Watson, the Yankees'
former general manager, is ready to jump back into the fire, he
would also be a high-ranking candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Managerial candidates could include Don Baylor, who was the
Brewers' hitting coach in 1990 and '91; Willie Randolph, who was
popular in Milwaukee when he batted .327 for the Brewers in 1991,
his one season with them, and Chris Chambliss, who, like Randolph,
has been overlooked in recent years by teams interested in hiring
whites only.
</P>
<P>
   To Selig-Prieb's credit, the Brewers will not be one of those
teams.

CLINTON STRESSES PEACE MEASURES IN SPEECH TO VFW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY SCOTT CANON and BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Thanking the Veterans
of Foreign Wars for making this an ``American century,'' President
Clinton said Monday the next 100 years could hold fewer sacrifices
if the world embraces key measures for peace now.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He called on the veterans _ noting that the VFW backed his
military intervention in Kosovo _ to join his push for money to
reduce old Soviet nuclear stores, for implementing Middle East
peace accords and for promoting conflict resolution in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underfunding our arsenal of peace is as risky as underfunding
our arsenal of war,'' Clinton told the 100th annual convention of
the VFW in Kansas City. ``For if we continue to underfund
diplomacy, we will end up overusing our military.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued for an active American role in keeping the peace in
the Balkans, an effort he said could keep Americans from fighting
in European wars in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen enough wars in Europe, claiming the lives of
their children and America's young people,'' Clinton said. ``Now we
have a chance to avoid it, and we ought to take the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose appearance at the veterans' gathering was
controversial to some people because he took steps to avoid the
draft during the Vietnam War, drew about 8,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   They filled the south end of Bartle Hall in a warm but
restrained embrace of Clinton's 40-minute speech. Although some VFW
members had called for a boycott or walkout of the speech, there
was no obvious evidence of protest in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anybody walk out or turn their backs,'' said
Steve Van Buskirk, director of the VFW Foundation. ``I was looking
for that, but I compared notes with other staff members and we
didn't see anything irregular. The president seemed to be very
warmly received.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Nave, a VFW member from St. Anthony, Utah, said he chose
not to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to listen to the man,'' he said. ``The office I
still respect; it's just the man and what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who came heard the president pledge more money to care for
veterans _ ``the troops of tomorrow will only be as good as our
commitment to veterans today'' _ and promise to keep America's
military the strongest on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our men and women in uniform will remain the best-trained, the
best-equipped, the best-prepared military in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Although military spending is billions higher than it was
decades ago, it has shrunk from more than half the federal budget
in 1962 to about 16 percent of federal spending today.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also thanked the VFW for its support of the
administration's decision to fight an air war in Yugoslavia and
commit peace-keeping ground troops to Kosovo. The outcome, he said,
vindicated those positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prevailed in Kosovo because our cause was just, our goals
were clear, our alliances were strong and our strategy worked,''
Clinton said. ``We must also work with equal determination to
prevent wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also talked about new threats to peace in a post-Cold
War world _ terrorism, the development of biological and chemical
weapons by rogue states, and the dangers created by instability
throughout the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Highly trained weapons scientists in Russia, Clinton noted, earn
less than $100 a month. Clinton has called for an increase in
funding to dispose of nuclear weapons and to put former Soviet
scientists to work safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can help them turn that expertise to peaceful projects...or
we can do nothing, and pray that each and every one of those
thousands of scientists will somehow resist the temptation to
market their expertise to those who wish to do us and the cause of
freedom harm,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He championed, in vague terms, more traditional diplomatic
missions. The United States, Clinton said, needs to remain a key
player in carrying out the Wye River accord by offering some form
of protection to Israelis and Palestinians alike. Likewise, he said
the country needs to be ready to help forge peace plans and be
willing to ``keep the peace'' throughout Africa.
</P>
<P>
   And to silence from his audience, Clinton repeated his call for
Congress to pay the country's dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we want America to pay all the costs and take all the
risks to solve the world's big problems,'' the president said, ``we
have to work with others.''
</P>
<P>
   After his remarks, Clinton walked the length of a barrier
stretching between Bartle's east and west walls, shaking hands and
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed with the president's remarks and what he
said he's done to restore the benefits that some are trying to take
away from our veterans,'' said Betty Morris, an Aberdeen, Md.,
member of the Ladies Auxiliary of the VFW, as she awaited the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hooper II, commander of VFW Post 11333 in Memphis, Tenn.,
appreciated what he believed was Clinton's strong support of
veterans entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also agree with his statements on how a major emphasis
should be placed on preventing wars,'' Hooper said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Robert Adams of Florence, Ky., said he had heard discussions
about walking out on the Clinton speech because of his history
involving the Vietnam War draft, but didn't see anyone following
through. To Adams that sort of talk was political and not really
representative of the VFW as an organization.
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans yearned for Clinton to talk more specifically
about their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished he would have talked more about what he was going to
do for the veterans,'' said Chuck Powell, commander of VFW Post
6477 in Poplar Bluff, Mo. ``He spoke about taking care of homeless
veterans. He's had eight years to do that.''

 &HT;    Last Atlanta Gas Light clients go to new firms
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Gas Light Co. assigned its remaining 286,986
customers to new natural gas providers Monday as it took one of its
final steps toward getting out of the retail business.
</P>
<P>
   The companies had already lured away AGL's other 1.1 million
customers in a fierce marketing battle this summer.
</P>
<P>
   AGL will stop selling gas to homes and businesses Oct. 1, as
part of Georgia's deregulation of the natural gas industry before
the next winter heating season.
</P>
<P>
   The company, however, will continue delivering gas to those
customers in an arrangement with marketers, including its own
affiliate, Georgia Natural Gas.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining AGL customers were randomly assigned by computer
to the marketers based on the companies' dominance as of Aug. 11.
Georgia Natural Gas held 31.3 percent of the market on that date,
so it received that percentage of remaining customers.
</P>
<P>
   Although 20 marketers are licensed to operate in Georgia, seven
control 97.5 percent of the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assignment process began early this morning and wrapped up
just a little after noon,'' said Millicent Hunter, a spokeswoman
for AGL.
</P>
<P>
   The marketers must mail notices to their new customers by Sept.
20.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who don't like their assigned service company can
switch by contacting another marketer _ but not AGL _ by Sept. 24.
Otherwise, they will begin receiving gas from the assigned marketer
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can change service companies after Sept. 24, but the
switch won't go into effect until Nov. 1 or later.
</P>
<P>
   PSC Chairman Stan Wise said he was pleased 80 percent of AGL's
customers had chosen a marketer before being assigned to one. He
said the commission's decision requiring AGL to make available its
customer lists helped competitors develop effective marketing
plans.
</P>
<P>
   SCANA Energy won 30.1 percent of the market, followed by
Peachtree Natural Gas with 11.2 percent and Shell Energy Services
with 10.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wise also noted that the General Assembly voted in March to let
the PSC set a schedule of deadlines that allow for deregulation to
take effect before the winter, when demand for gas rises sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next few months, customers will start to see real
benefits from deregulation,'' said Deborah Latham, president of
Peachtree Natural Gas. ``That's when (gas service companies) will
begin offering other products.''
</P>
<P>
   Peachtree, for example, plans to offer its customers an
appliance maintenance contract, while SCANA plans to offer wireless
telephone and Internet access services.

CLINTON ASKS CONGRESS FOR MORE FUNDS TO KEEP THE PEACE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars,
President Clinton said Monday that American troops would have a
better chance of being spared fighting in war if Congress would
spend more money on foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cutting the very programs designed to keep our soldiers
out of war in the first place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said foreign aid, which amounts to less than 1
percent of the federal budget, had been declining since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the cutbacks shortsighted, Clinton said, ``The costliest
peace is far cheaper than the cheapest war.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won big applause and a standing ovation from the
veterans, who were gathering here to mark the 100th anniversary of
their organization. The warm greeting was notable for a president
whose avoidance of service in Vietnam upset many veterans during
the 1992 campaign, and this was the first time that he had
addressed the annual gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing by our military and standing by our veterans means
more than preparing for war,'' he said. ``We must work with equal
determination to prevent wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the military as ``only one arrow in our quiver,''
Clinton said the nation must do more to promote world stability.
Conditions around the world will be safer, he said, ``if Congress
will invest only a tiny percentage of what we spend on defense in
avoiding war.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he called for spending to rebuild Yugoslavia in
the aftermath of the NATO bombing campaign over the situation in
Kosovo. But he said that it would require nothing ``as ambitious as
the Marshall Plan,'' and that European countries should bear the
heaviest costs.
</P>
<P>
   Without efforts to promote stability in the Balkans, he said,
``make no mistake _ there will be another bloody war.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said America should help pay for highly trained Russian
weapons scientists to ``turn that expertise to peaceful projects.''
Otherwise, he said, those scientists, now earning less than $100 a
month, might be tempted to market their expertise to groups or
nations that would threaten world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to ask Congress in September for an
additional $2 billion to $3 billion for Kosovo peacekeeping and
other foreign policy initiatives, congressional staff members said.
</P>
<P>
   But he is still likely to veto a measure that will come out of a
House-Senate conference in September on foreign aid. Although the
House and Senate bills passed this summer differ in their details,
both reduced the administration's overall request by nearly $2
billion, to about $12.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The House withheld $500 million that the Clinton administration
had requested to help peace negotiations in the Middle East; the
Senate withheld $350 million. Both chambers eliminated $241 million
for reducing nuclear weapons threats in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said President Truman stood before the veterans in 1949,
when the group was marking its 50th anniversary, and similarly
called for building better relations with other countries as a way
to avoid war.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``Harry Truman said, `Peace, with freedom and justice,
cannot be bought cheaply. It can only be assured by the combined
efforts of the multitudes of people throughout the world who want a
secure peace. We must keep them our friends, if the world is to be
a decent place for our children and their grandchildren to live.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly thanked the veterans for their heroism in
battle and their determination to do their duty. ``If you ask who
has been most responsible for making this the American century,''
he said, ``that answer would be America's servicemen and women.''
He also thanked the group for supporting the involvement of
American troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He said more than half of the world's people now live under
freely elected governments. Tens of millions of people around the
world live in peace, he added, because so many thousands of
American veterans ``rest in peace,'' after giving their lives in
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The president noted that that military is facing a harder time
recruiting and keeping its best troops, largely because the strong
economy offers so many appealing options to young people.
</P>
<P>
   He also said military leaders would face hard choices about
expensive military hardware. But he said the military must remain
strong, and people who join the service should be treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that there are plans to build new veterans' hospitals
and cemeteries. And, in his only reference to Vice President Al
Gore, Clinton said that Gore has pledged to keep the American
military strong in the years to come and to improve conditions for
troops. ``We know there is more to do,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threats to peace in the 21st century, Clinton said,
are likely to be ethnic rivalries, terrorist groups and the spread
of nuclear and biological weapons. He added that financial
vulnerability around the globe could also trigger violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also defended the role of the United States in the
United Nations, saying the United States is obligated to pay its
fair share of dues to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved authorizing more than $800 million in
back dues, but the House has not passed financing to cover the
payments. Conservative Republicans have balked at paying the dues,
and last year saddled the legislation with anti-abortion language
that led Clinton to veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The overdue amount is also in dispute, with the United Nations
arguing that it is owed $1.6 billion and the administration saying
it's closer to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with a foreign crisis, such as the one in the
Balkans, Clinton said Monday, it is far better to have the help of
other nations than to carry the burden alone.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said it is a disgrace that so many American
veterans have become homeless. ``They should be brought back into
the society they did so much to defend,'' he said.

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific settles in asbestos-related suit
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia-Pacific Corp., one of 35 defendants in an
asbestos-related lawsuit, reached a settlement with a Texas
plasterer after a jury awarded the man $4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta company's involvement in the suit is the latest in a
long string of litigation spurred by asbestos. The heat-resistant
mineral was once used widely in insulation and fireproofing, but
has been found to cause severe and sometimes deadly respiratory
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific's latest annual report said the company is
currently defending asbestos-related claims of roughly 71,000
plaintiffs and expects additional suits over the next several
years.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in Dallas County Court found the company's products
contained asbestos that caused cancer in plaintiff Buster Wigley,
70, owner of Wigley Construction in Mesquite, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific was found liable for 10 percent of the $4.6
million award. The undisclosed settlement amount was within that
``frame of reference,'' said spokesman Ken Haldin.
</P>
<P>
   All of the other companies were found negligent and settled
prior to the verdict, according to Baron &AMP; Budd, the plaintiff's
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other recent asbestos-related lawsuits also involve
Georgia-Pacific. Earlier this month, a 34-year-old woman in
Brookeville, Md. won a $9.2 million judgment against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Pransky convinced jurors that her lung cancer was caused by
childhood exposure to the company's Ready Mix joint-covering
compound used by her father on the family's den in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific considers that judgment unjustified and intends
to appeal the verdict, Haldin said.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Georgia-Pacific is one of 15 defendants in a
lawsuit filed earlier this month by railroad workers in Des Moines
County, Iowa. The plaintiffs claim they suffer from
asbestos-related diseases after being exposed to toxic dust linked

ZOLAK NEXT TO BE AUDITIONED FOR JETS' BACKUP ROLE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Bill Parcells' affection for Ray Lucas is
almost fatherly. So, despite Lucas' disappointing performance on
Saturday, Parcells insisted Monday that the plan to make Lucas a
big-league quarterback would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, however, will not get another chance this week following
his failure to lead the Jets to anything more than a pair of field
goals in almost three quarters of work against the Green Bay
Packers Saturday night. On Friday, Scott Zolak, who has been a
starter for Parcells at New England, will see most of the action
against the Philadelphia Eagles as the search continues for a
backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Parcells pointed out, Lucas' first real stab at
playing quarterback in the pros came on Saturday. Lucas engineered
a good drive to close out the first half but it ended with a missed
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells pointed out that Lucas' three-year career was spent on
special teams, working occasionally at receiver and taking a few
snaps at quarterback in trick-play situations. The Jets' coach also
said don't make too much of Lucas' 14-32 passing against the Pack.
Seven of those passes were dropped ``and if they catch five, it's a
different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' feelings for Lucas, who played quarterback at Rutgers,
go back to 1996 when he was the Patriots coach. Lucas subverted his
ego to do Parcells' bidding on special teams. Then last year,
Parcells decided once and for all that Lucas was going to be a
quarterback/special-teamer and stopped sending Lucas to the wide
receivers' meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Zolak's turn. It appeared to virtually everyone who
followed the Jets that Zolak's arrival signaled the fact that
Parcells had found a backup to Vinny Testaverde. Zolak, after all,
had played for Parcells for four seasons at New England, where he
backed up Drew Bledsoe. He even started one game under Parcells.
Last year Zolak, 31, an eight-year veteran, started twice at
season's end for an injured Bledsoe. The team split against the
49ers and Jets, and then he directed the losing playoff game
against Jacksonville, hampered by a dearth of healthy receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Is Parcells motivating him by not announcing right now that he
is the backup?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done it to me before,'' said Zolak. ``I've been through
this with him before. You go with what the guy says. You play your
best and let the chips fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak has thrown 244 passes since 1991, completing just over
half of them. He started four games for the Pats in 1992, one in
1995, and twice last year. He had one distinguished game, against
the Colts in 1992, when he earned offensive player of the week
honors. Parcells likes his character.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Monday he sounded like a raw recruit learning a new system.
Or perhaps he was just playing down his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of adjustments I have to make to the
receivers' routes,'' he explained, speaking of players he had never
thrown to before. ``It's like starting over, like being a rookie.
Everyone has to get comfortable with you.'' Still, he should be
more comfortable than most other new quarterbacks since he has
played for the head coach before.
</P>
<P>
   What fans will see in Zolak is a 6-foot 5-inch self-described
pocket-passer. He will not be a roamer. He also understands what
being a backup is. ``I've got a lot of miles on me,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   To Keyshawn Johnson, the back-up is unimportant. The wide
receiver snared five passes from Testaverde in only two drives
against the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My quarterback's Testaverde,'' said Johnson. ``The coach makes
the decision on who the backup is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Testaverde says he doesn't meddle in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ray or Scott has any questions, I'll talk to them. I'm not
one to be involved in other people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if he gets hurt?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not my area to worry about,'' said Testaverde, whose
last injury that kept him out of a game occurred five years ago.
``That's the coach's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the coach had no decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who the number two quarterback is,'' claimed
Parcells. ``I don't know if I have one.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican National Convention is still a year
away, and only the most reckless gambler would bet on Gary Bauer's
taking the stage in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   But Bauer has already chosen a running mate. His name is Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   In just about every speech that Bauer delivers, he gives Reagan
a starring role in one or two lengthy anecdotes. He steals Reagan's
lines, showing a particular affinity for the vision of America as a
``shining city on the hill,'' a phrase he used three times in his
speech at the straw poll in Ames, Iowa, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And Bauer, best known for his advocacy of conservative religious
values as the former president of the Family Research Council,
often seizes the opportunity to remind voters that he worked for
six years in various positions in the Reagan administration,
including as an undersecretary of education.
</P>
<P>
   In Bauer's quixotic bid for the Republican presidential
nomination, which got an important boost with his fourth-place
finish in a field of nine candidates in the straw poll, he is
taking greater pains than his rivals to cast himself as the
rightful heir to what he sees as Reagan's brand of proud, fearless
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people yearning for a Reagan-type candidate,'' Bauer
said in the days leading up to the straw poll, implying that he was
a tenable answer to that prayer. ``Reagan has been my model for all
of my political life.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bauer stands any chance of exerting the kind of
widespread appeal that Reagan did is very much open to question.
Candidate Reagan, at 6 foot 1, effortlessly attracted the spotlight
and had governed California, the nation's most populous state.
Candidate Bauer, at 5 foot 6, sometimes strains to be noticed and
has never campaigned for an elective office before, let alone held
one.
</P>
<P>
   But the results in Iowa suggest that, for now, Bauer's support
among social and religious conservatives is sturdier than that of
many of the other Republicans vying for those votes, and could keep
Bauer in the race for months.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer placed well ahead of the radio talk show host Alan Keyes,
the television commentator Pat Buchanan and former Vice President
Dan Quayle. Indeed, among candidates courting the same segment of
the electorate as Bauer, only the publisher Steve Forbes beat him,
and Forbes spent many times what Bauer did on the care, feeding and
transporting of Iowans in a ritual that often results in straw
votes going to the candidate who gives voters the most.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes finished second overall, wedged between Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, who took first place, and Elizabeth Dole, who came
in third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a pretty significant outcome for us,'' Bauer said
in an interview Monday. ``The three people above me all have 99
percent name recognition: the son of a former president, the son of
a tycoon and the wife of a former presidential candidate. I come in
next _ the son of a janitor.''
</P>
<P>
   What Bauer has, in place of a tall national profile, is moxie,
conviction, deep roots among religious conservatives and a proven
ability to reach and organize them.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the Family Research Council in 1988, Bauer built it
into an organization with a $14 million annual budget and a mailing
list of more than 400,000 people before he took a leave of absence
to run for president earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Bauer spun off the Campaign for Working Families, a
conservative political action committee that, in the 1998 election
cycle, raised more than $2 million from 90,000 donors, people to
whom Bauer has turned for the financing of his current campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's tally of roughly $3.4 million by June 30, the end of the
last period for candidates' formal reporting of the money they had
raised, was a fraction of Bush's reported $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only a hair short of the $3.5 million that Mrs. Dole
and Quayle had raised, and it put Bauer $1 million ahead of
Buchanan and $1.5 million ahead of Keyes. In the month and a half
since then, officials with Bauer's campaign said, they have raised
another $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several Republican leaders and political analysts said
that the greatest benefit of Bauer's work with the Family Research
Council and the Campaign for Working Families was the link it gave
him not to cash but to the kind of committed, active conservatives
likely to work as volunteers on a campaign and to make the trip to
the polls on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 400,000 Americans who got a letter from Gary every
month, and who thought that Gary was representing their views and
their positions,'' noted William Kristol, editor of the Weekly
Standard, a conservative publication. Kristol is a close friend and
political ally of Bauer's.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot more devoted supporters around the country than a
lot of senators have,'' Kristol added. ``A lot of people don't
appreciate what that means.''
</P>
<P>
   John Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron who
studies religious conservatives, said it meant that when Bauer
talked about the need to end abortion or allow school prayer,
positions emphasized just as strongly by several Republican rivals,
he struck particularly receptive ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that Bauer really has an edge on the issues,''
Green said. ``Where he has an edge is in organization and
connections. The hard-core Christian right knows Gary Bauer, and he
can credibly say, `I'm one of you.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was Bauer's message to the parishioners at an evangelical
church in Ames that he visited on the Sunday before the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before them, Bauer said, ``I'm not here as a
presidential candidate. I'm here as a sinner, at the foot of the
cross, saved only by the shed blood of Jesus Christ.'' He then
implored them not to surrender political involvement, and the
political process, to people who did not share their faith.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bauer had made a similar appeal the previous day to a small
group of Christian conservatives attending the Midwest Leadership
Conference, a regional Republican gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing what he said was the Democratic argument that the
federal government should not legislate morality, Bauer said that
all government policy, like protections against discrimination and
aid to the poor, involved ``a moral judgment about how we should
treat each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So the question is not whether you legislate morality,'' he
told about 20 men and women with a local affiliate of Focus on the
Family, a 2 million-member nationwide Christian ministry whose
leader, the Rev. James Dobson, supports Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whose morality you're going to legislate,''
Bauer continued. ``Somebody's values are going to win. We just have
to have the confidence to get in the public square and say that our
values will be best for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from those groups, however, Bauer spreads his oratorical
net wider, determined to fashion himself as more than a religious
protest figure, and that is where his invocations of Reagan come
into play.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bauer tells audiences that he would never appoint
anyone to the Supreme Court who supported legal abortion, he spends
just as much time denouncing the Chinese government for human
rights abuses and unfair trade practices, seemingly finding in
China a substitute for the Soviet Union, which Reagan so profitably
demonized.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also calls for lower taxes and more spending on national
defense, themes that carried Reagan to victory. And he points to
becoming a senior policy adviser for Reagan _ and having an office
in the West Wing of the White House _ as the culmination of his
personal success story.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, 53, who is married with three children, grew up in
Newport, Ky., a blue-collar, hardscrabble suburb of Cincinnati. He
said in an interview that his father, whose string of jobs included
mopping floors, driving trucks and milling steel, alternately
implored him to make more of himself and told him that he probably
never would.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very mean drunk,'' Bauer recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said that he found solace and role models at a Baptist
church, which he went to every Sunday morning with one of his
grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of scholarships, Bauer attended a small college in
Kentucky and then went to law school at Georgetown University in
Washington, D.C. After working for several years at a trade
association, he quit to hop aboard Reagan's 1980 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Research Council, initially an offshoot of Dobson's
group, was where Bauer landed at the end of Reagan's presidency,
and he gradually turned his position there into a formidable bully
pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   A confident, articulate speaker with a sharp mind and quick wit,
Bauer became a favorite choice of CNN, MSNBC or any other
television network that needed someone to argue against homosexuals
in the military or for the Ten Commandments in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he gave only occasional thought to running for
office himself. But he said he grew frustrated with former
President Bush's 1992 reelection campaign and former Sen. Bob
Dole's 1996 presidential bid, because he felt they both sold out
true conservatism. What he saw as their failures persuaded him to
enter the fray and carry the banner himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the best when the party nominated the man who the
country thought was the most right-wing candidate in decades,''
Bauer said, referring to Republicans' choice of Reagan in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Bauer said, ``I've seen the party drift through two
presidential elections. I see it drifting again with the front
runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer was referring to George W. Bush and, in particular, to
Bush's statement that he would not determine judicial nominations
based on the candidates' position on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer refuses to compromise on that issue. But on a few others,
he takes positions that depart from pure conservative dogma and
demonstrates a desire to position himself as an independent
thinker.
</P>
<P>
   He opposes privatization of Social Security. He favors more
federal intervention to insure the survival of farms, a stand that
undoubtedly helped him in Iowa. He supports one aspect of the
Democratic proposal to regulate health maintenance organizations,
saying that patients should in some instances have the right to sue
those companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts wonder if Bauer's true goal is simply to
stay in the race long enough to make sure that Bush has to answer
to, and perhaps accommodate, the concerns of the most conservative
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer and his closest associates insist that he is in it to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not delusional,'' Kristol said. ``He knows that he's a
long-shot candidate. But he doesn't think he's an
out-of-the-question candidate.''

   ASMARA, Eritrea _ Rwandan leaders traveled to Uganda Monday
night to hold talks aimed at easing tensions after troops from the
two nations, once firm allies, fought for a third day in the
Congolese city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   Both Uganda and Rwanda have soldiers stationed in Congo as part
of their mutual support for the rebels fighting to overthrow the
president of Congo, Laurent Kabila. But in recent months the two
allies have moved apart, backing rival rebel factions and
disagreeing over how to conduct the war and more recent efforts for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Those tensions erupted into fighting over Kisangani's main
airport on Saturday night, opening a more complicated chapter in
the Congo conflict. Monday, artillery and mortar fire continued,
reportedly letting up before the evening meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors and aid workers reported that at least 50 people
have died in Kisangani, many of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of women and children were also trapped inside health
centers, where U.N. health workers were immunizing people against
polio. Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, condemned the
fighting, partly because it violated a temporary cease-fire to
allow the doctors there to work in safety.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the fighting between Uganda and Rwanda broke out
after they both signed an accord aimed at ending the year-long
rebellion in Congo. The accord was signed on July 10 by the six
nations fighting inside Congo, but its chances for success seemed
slim because the three rebel factions refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was aimed at ending the fighting between Rwanda,
Uganda and the rebels on one side, and Kabila and his outside
backers, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, on the other.
</P>
<P>
   But few people could have foreseen that Rwanda and Uganda would
turn their guns on each other, particularly since both signed the
peace accord, and that complication seemed only to endanger the
accord further.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that there may be a separate bilateral issue
between Rwanda and Uganda _ that concerns us greatly,'' said one
U.S. administration official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The United States _ allies of both Rwanda and Uganda _ has been
helping the search for peace. Gayle Smith, the top official for
African affairs in the National Security Council, traveled to the
region on Friday to try to convince the rebel groups to sign the
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday she ended up meeting with Rwandan officials and later
traveled to Uganda, where the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni,
met with President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President Paul Kagame
of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday night what might have been accomplished
in the talks. John Nagenda, a senior advisor to the Ugandan
president, said he expected any troubles to be worked out given how
close the governments have been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a meaningless bit of friction,'' Nagenda said in a
telephone interview Monday night. ``It must make Kabila very happy
this is happening. Therefore it must be dealt with with all
dispatch.''
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to suggest that Uganda was willing to end its
cooperation with Rwanda in the Congo if some agreement was not
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they feel they can do without us, they will definitely be
the loser,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan officials could not be reached for comment Monday night.
Earlier in the day the Rwandan News Agency reported that the
fighting began after several hundred Ugandan soldiers were flown to
Kisangani to drive Rwandan soldiers from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Nagenda denied that Uganda had begun the fighting. A statement
from the rebel group backed by Uganda said the fighting started
after Rwandan soldiers blocked the road to the airport and fired at
Ugandan soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   When the rebellion began last August, both Rwanda and Uganda
supported the same rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy.
But since then Uganda and Rwanda began to back different elements
within the group _ a split that became formal in May when the group
ousted its original leader, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
   Wamba dia Wamba, claiming he remained the movement's true
leader, maintained the support of Uganda and established
headquarters in Kisangani. The Rwandans backed the new leader, Dr.
Emile Ilunga, a longtime opposition leader in Congo.

 &HT;    Ga. Southern's goal is Division I-AA title
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATESBORO, Ga. _ Georgia Southern quarterback Greg Hill, seated
on a Paulson Stadium bench and swatting a few of those South
Georgia gnats away from the sweaty peach fuzz on his chin,
explained his and his team's aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pretty much experienced everything here as a player,''
the senior said. ``We've won the conference twice. I've gotten
conference honors, gained a lot of yards and scored a lot of
touchdowns, individual things like that. . . . There's nothing left
but one thing _ the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill, the triggerman in an option offense that rolled to an
average of 504.7 yards and 43.6 points per game last year, led the
Eagles to the brink of the Division I-AA title in December. But
seven turnovers resulted in a 55-43 loss to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Georgia Southern's 14-1 record was an accomplishment
that continues to energize the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Far beyond the banks of Beautiful Eagle Creek, alumni are
jumping back on the bandwagon that was so crowded when the Eagles
won four national championships, 1985-90. The team enters this
season ranked No. 1 in several polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've rekindled that enthusiasm and excitement,''
athletics director Sam Baker said. ``(Coach) Paul Johnson has done
a great job, and people have identified with that.''Season-ticket
sales have jumped. Georgia Southern sold 2,986 season tickets for
last season. A month before this year's Sept. 4 opener, the school
had sold 3,376.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in Savannah recently making a speech to a bunch of our
alumni, and the next day one of them called and wanted to rent one
of our stadium boxes, which rents for $10,600 a year,'' Baker said.
``She said that after seeing us play last year and listening to the
speech, she wanted to help the program in that way. That's the kind
of enthusiasm we're experiencing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who turns 42 Friday, has a reputation as one the
brightest young offensive minds in the country. But he was
fortunate last season that his redshirt freshmen played far above
expectations. One of them was fullback Adrian Peterson, who rushed
for a Division I freshman record 2,606 yards and a Division I-AA
freshman record 35 touchdowns. Peterson was a consensus
All-American and the Southern Conference player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wouldn't listen, but I kept telling everybody that the
best players in our program were freshmen and sophomores,'' said
Johnson, who enters the season 24-4 with two Southern Conference
titles and two national coach-of-the-year honors in both his
seasons as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles are consumed by the quest to be in the playoffs for
the third year in a row and the 11th time since '85.
</P>
<P>
   For them to make the postseason, Hill and Peterson must avoid
injuries, the offensive line must be rebuilt successfully, and the
defense, which was weakened at linebacker by key injuries, must be
solidified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine athletic-wise,'' senior All-Americann guard Mark
Williams said. ``We've just got to get that communication and
chemistry together.'' Williams is one of two returning starters on
the offensive line. The other is senior tackle Rich McGrath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately,'' McGrath said, ``we've got Greg and Adrian, and
they'll make it easy to put a new bunch together. With what they
bring to the table, we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are good that the starting linebackers will be redshirt
freshmen and sophomores, Johnson said. The group could include
Michael Ward of Savannah and Jimmy McCollough of Loris, S.C., a
fleet-footed first-year players for whom hopes are high.
</P>
<P>
   The secondary is three strong at each position. But the key
defensive player probably will be All-American down lineman
Voncellies Allen.

PRICE IS STEEP IN PARKING SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Apologetic and frustrated, several UCLA players
responded last weekend to the public outrage over their involvement
in the disabled-parking scandal. And no one is more distraught than
senior fullback and Sylmar native Durell Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``People called us monsters (at the July 28 arraignment) because
they said we took handicapped-parking spaces from people in
wheelchairs,'' Price said. ``But we're not monsters. Nine times out
of 10, guys weren't parking in handicapped spots. We used the
placards to park for free in regular spaces. It was all about the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Year-round parking passes for lots near UCLA's athletic
facilities cost approximately $600.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never parked in a handicapped spot and I didn't think I was
hurting anyone,'' Price said. ``But I have two boys to support. It
was wrong, but at the time it was the only thing I could do
financially.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-game suspension hit Price hardest of all, since he'll
miss a long-awaited date at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   As a Sylmar High senior, Price planned to attend Ohio State
until the signed portion of his letter of intent was improperly
faxed to the Buckeyes' athletic department. Without his signature,
the letter was invalidated. Price reconsidered and signed with
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the night I hung up with (Buckeyes coach) John Cooper,
I've been waiting for this game,'' Price said. ``Everything I've
worked for was to play in that game. I'm frustrated as hell that I
can't play in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Price learned his picture had been removed from the inside
cover of UCLA's media guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really hurt, because it's a long-term thing,'' he said.
``The Ohio State game will be forgotten in a few years, but the
media guide you feel and see for a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Price and senior guard Jim Ghezzi, a Montrose native and
Glendale College graduate, will be arraigned Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The seven Bruins arraigned last month were fined $1,500,
sentenced to 200 hours community service and suspended for two
games. Two others, Eric Whitfield and Keith Brown, were suspended
for two games, but their cases have not been forwarded to the
district attorney's office by UCLA police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anxious to get on with the community service,''
sophomore linebacker Ryan Nece said. ``We're sorry for what we've
done and we want to rectify the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We committed a crime and we've been punished _ punished hard.
But the main reason we did it was definitely financial. When you
look at the bigger picture, it was wrong. But at the time, we
didn't see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nece and linebacker Tony White sent letters of apology to
athletic director Peter Dalis. Price and Brown apologized to Dalis
in person.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions have forced the Bruins to adjust the defense's
practice routine. Normally, the first and second teams get most of
the repetitions. But because five defensive starters and three
reserves are suspended, the coaches have added a third group to the
mix.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins begin preparing for the Sept. 4 season opener
against Boise State, the suspended players will become the scout
team, which mimics the opponent. Upon reinstatement, they must win
their starting spots back. In some cases, that might not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely forced a different method of practicing,''
defensive coordinator Bob Field said.

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The 100th annual
convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars attracted more than
President Clinton on Monday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 25 protesters, representing different agendas, gathered
across from the convention center, hoping to get their messages
across.
</P>
<P>
   A man with a small sign with the words ``Global Warming'' was
there.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was a group of about a dozen folks holding
anti-Clinton signs.
</P>
<P>
   One sign described Clinton's grade card, giving high marks for
avoiding military service and low scores for truthfulness. Another
sign read, ``Draft Dodger.'' A third asked, ``Who took your place
in Vietnam?''
</P>
<P>
   About eight persons wanted Leonard Peltier freed. Peltier is in
prison in Leavenworth in connection to the 1975 shooting deaths of
two FBI agents in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Andiy Sullivan of Overland Park, Kan., held a sign on Peltier's
behalf. ``Clinton said he was going to free him and he hasn't,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton never passed the protestors. Instead, the
motorcade rolled about a block away. The free-Peltier group hustled
to get in position.
</P>
<P>
   But it appeared that they were too late.

 &HT;    Ryder Cup's Crenshaw fills final positions
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Declaring the team properly unified, United
States Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw added two captain's
selections for the matches against the Europeans, Sept. 24-26 at
The Country Club in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw picked No. 12 Tom Lehman and No. 14 Steve Pate for the
remaining two spots on the team. They will join the top 10 already
on the team, including PGA champion Tiger Woods, David Duval, Payne
Stewart, Davis Love III, Mark O'Meara, Hal Sutton, Justin Leonard,
Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson and Jeff Maggert.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw gave strong consideration to No. 17 Fred Couples, No.
24 Lee Janzen, No. 16 Chris Perry and No. 11 Bob Estes, who bogeyed
two off the last three holes Sunday at Medinah Country Club and
failed to make the team on points.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was an obvious choice. He played on the last two Ryder
teams with a 3-2-2 record and is a leader. Pate was the tougher
choice, but he won over Crenshaw as ``a very, very fierce
competitor who would walk through a wall for you if you asked him
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate was supposed to play on the 1991 team, but he injured his
ribs in a traffic accident on the way to the Ryder Cup banquet. He
was a semifinalist in February's World Golf Championship Match Play
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it was a big factor,'' Pate said. ``I've always loved
match play. I've always liked the fact that you start the day and
at the end of the day, you either won or you lost. The immediate
result, for some reason, makes me focus better. I seem to swing a
little more freely in match play, because I can go ahead and make a
10 somewhere and it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw seemed to view Couples as the best player available but
thought he played too sparingly _ six times since the Masters _ to
be prepared properly for the Ryder Cup. Conversely, Crenshaw called
Pate ``maybe the most determined and intent about this game right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman played 11 of the last 13 events to accumulate points and
hasn't been home since May 28. He said he didn't ``feel any more or
less pressure'' making the team as a captain's pick than through
points in 1995 and 1997. Crenshaw said, ``I think everyone knows
that he exudes leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw criticized some team members last week because of the
play-for-pay issue, which almost overshadowed PGA Championship
week. But the team will be ready to play, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the money issue, Lehman said the matter probably will be
``resolved between (PGA Tour commissioner) Tim Finchem and (PGA of
America CEO) Jim Awtrey somewhere down the road after the Ryder
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, it's behind us,'' Crenshaw said. ``We're looking
forward to going to Boston. Regardless of what happened this week
and how it happened, we have to be a team, because we know (the
Europeans) are a team.

 &HT;    Bands re-invited to Sydney Games
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (i) International
categories.)
 &HT;    By Jennifer Brett and Paul Donsky
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Sydney saga has taken another turn.
</P>
<P>
   After being invited and then uninvited from performing in the
2000 Olympics' Opening Ceremonies, two Georgia marching bands _
Fayette County High School and Cobb County's Walton High School _
were invited again Monday after Sydney organizers settled a court
fight with the company originally hired to bring in the American
students.
</P>
<P>
   Walton band parent Jim Talerico said Monday that band parents,
board members and Walton's principal would have to talk before
deciding whether to accept the new invitation. After being jilted
from the Opening Ceremony, Walton band families decided not to take
Sydney Olympics officials up on their offer of performing at other
venues.
</P>
<P>
   Fayette had left the door open, and band director Kenneth Beard
said Monday, ``I'm able to look at it as if we've never been
through this roller coaster ride, to say this is a good
opportunity.'' But parent approval is not a sure thing. Beard said
he will take the Olympic Committee's final proposal before the band
in the next two weeks. Unless ``significantly more than half'' sign
up, he said, he'll have to cancel the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the original trip would have been great, but
because of what has transpired, I have reservations about the
trip,'' said parent James Wideman. ``It's hard for me to believe
that we should have our children go where they might not be
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip would cost about $3,600 per student. Some Fayette
parents, while still in favor of the trip, said valuable
fund-raising time was lost while they waited for Olympics officials
to make up their minds. Other parents, believing the trip already
canceled, have spent the money on other things, such as one family
that bought their daughter a new bassoon, Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   Some students are optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it'll be exciting to go,'' said Jodie Fleming, a
sophomore saxophone player at Fayette High. She added she'll have
to talk it over with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Flowers, who plays the alto saxophone, was initially very
excited but soured after all the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family and I do not feel as though it would be safe for me
to go to Sydney now, because I feel that since a legal binding
contract was broken I can no longer believe anything that they
promise the band,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki White, a flute player, is also weary of the matter, but
she said, ``My family and I are still for this trip and hoping and
praying that we will be able to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached Monday, the Sydney Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Games will pay the American company,
World Projects Corporation, to train an expanded band of about
2,200 from 20 nations.
</P>
<P>
   The original contract called for a 2,000-member band, including
1,300 Americans and 500 Australians.
</P>
<P>
   That plan was dropped after after a public backlash, but SOCOG
reversed course again after World Projects filed legal action and
the controversy became embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   The new band is to include 900 Australians. At least 400
Americans will be cut so Australians have the largest national
contingent.

BIG LAPSES FOUND IN PENTAGON'S SECURITY-CLEARANCE CHECKS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon is making incomplete background
investigations of a majority of its candidates for security
clearance and has built up a backlog of over 500,000 cases,
according to preliminary findings of a congressional investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The problems uncovered at the Pentagon's Defense Security
Service, which conducts investigations of 120,000 defense employees
and contractors each year, pose a threat to national security,
according to the early draft report by the General Accounting
Office, an investigating arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary findings have already prompted the Pentagon to
remove the head of the agency, to begin altering its computer
system and to institute new procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In a sample of 531 cases, the General Accounting Office found
that the Defense Security Service failed to make critical checks on
92 percent of the cases under review, according to a government
official familiar with the early findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a troubled agency,'' said Kenneth Bacon, the
Pentagon spokesman. ``The GAO report acknowledges we are on the
road to solving the problem, but it is a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was initiated after a Pentagon lawyer was
arrested and convicted in 1997 of spying for East Germany. Even
though Secretary of Defense William Cohen promised to review the
Pentagon's security procedures, Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., asked for
the independent review by the GAO. The preliminary findings were
reported Monday in USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Security Service has lost nearly half of its staff
since 1989 as part of the ``reinventing government'' initiative of
the Clinton administration, a reduction from 4,080 to 2,466 people
that several Defense Department officials say is part of the reason
why the agency has failed to do thorough background investigations.
The Pentagon also acknowledges that the agency purchased a new
computer system to streamline the investigations, but the equipment
is so poorly designed that it breaks down routinely and has created
the case backlog.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the agency did in the name of efficiency instead created
great inefficiency,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Pentagon appointed Gen. Charles Cunningham, a
retired Air Force officer, to replace Steven Schanzer as head of
the Defense Security Service. In the past two months Cunningham has
standardized investigations for security clearance, set up quality
checks of those investigations and set up an academy to train
agents in making security checks, the Pentagon said. He has also
brought in computer experts from the Air Force to sort out problems
in the agency's computer system and has asked for advice from the
government's Office of Personnel Management to help reduce the
backlog of pending security clearances, according to Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   The backlog of cases has grown so serious that the Pentagon is
considering asking private security firms to help undertake the
background investigations.
</P>
<P>
   While Pentagon officials acknowledge responsibility for some of
the problems at Defense Security Service, Bacon said that a 1996
presidential order requiring the review of all low and mid-level
security clearances also helped create the backlog.
</P>
<P>
   Under that provision, all government departments and agencies
are to review the ``confidential'' clearances of their employees
every 15 years and the higher level ``secret'' clearances every 10
years. To meet this requirement the Pentagon is reviewing an
additional 54,570 cases this year, according to a Defense
Department official.
</P>
<P>
   ``This explains some of the managerial confusion and the
backlog,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Pentagon is reviewing whether the secret
clearances are necessary at all.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office declined to comment on the
preliminary findings of their investigation. The final report is
due in October.

 &HT;    Ohio court throws out civil suit law
 &HT;    By William Hershey and Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ In a 4-3 decision, the Ohio Supreme Court on
Monday threw out a comprehensive 1996 law that limited monetary
awards in personal injury, medical malpractice and other civil
lawsuits and granted businesses some protection against being sued.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling that the law violated the Ohio Constitution
was the most recent in a series of decisions by state courts
throwing out business-backed laws enacted under the banner of
``tort reform.'' A tort is a wrongful act for which a civil lawsuit
can be filed.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio law was more ``enormous and comprehensive'' than
similar legislation in other states, said Robert Peck, senior
director for legal affairs and policy research at the Association
of Trial Lawyers of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the Guiness Book of World Records' tort reform
statute,'' said Peck, who has argued agaisnt these laws in court.
An Illinois' law, thrown out in 1997, had been considered the most
``draconian,'' Peck said. The Illinois law took up 68 pages, while
the Ohio law went on for 248 pages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Linda Woggon of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, said the
decision puts Ohio ``on a black list of states that have a hostile
business climate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this could cost the state jobs and small businesses,''
said Woggon, a chamber of commerce vice president who also serves
as president of the Ohio Alliance for Civil Justice, the coalition
that pushed the bill through the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Among other provisions, the law limited the damages a jury could
award to punish the person or company that caused an injury.
</P>
<P>
   For example, punitive damages could not exceed the greater of
$100,000 or two times the actual economic damages suffered by the
person who brought the lawsuit. For smaller companies, the cap on
punitive damages was even more restricted.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, product liability lawsuits for most products would
have to be filed within 15 years of the sale of the product, while
professional and medical malpractice claims would have to be filed
within six years.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Marx, president of the Dayton Bar Association, predicted
the decision will split the legal community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (lawyers) who represent the plaintiffs will say this is
a victory for consumers. Those who represent businesses and
insurance companies will say it's a significant setback,'' Marx
said.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys and labor union officials rejoiced over
the court's decision, while business leaders, some business owners
and Republican legislative leaders said it would harm the business
climate in Ohio. The Ohio AFL-CIO and the Ohio Academy of Trial
Lawyers went to the Supreme Court to challenge to the legislation
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends a very important message to big business _ workers
have rights in this state. And if that means we have to use those
rights in a court system, then that is what we will do,'' said Wes
Wells, executive director of the Miami Valley AFL-CIO, whose
members represent 93,000 Dayton-area workers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Kile, co-owner of Dayton Fireplace Systems Inc. in West
Carrollton, said lawsuits are a constant fear for all business
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``One bad lawsuit can put people out of business and you can
only buy so much insurance,'' said Kile, whose company generates
about $2 million in annual sales. ``So, no, it's not good news to
hear the court ruled that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio House Speaker Jo Ann Davidson, R-Reynoldsburg, and state
Senate President Richard Finan, R-Cincinnati, said they were
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that tort reform remains in the best
interest of all Ohioans in order to curtail the filing of frivolous
lawsuits,'' they said in a joint statement. They said there is
``significant support'' in the Republican-controlled legislature to
``craft another tort reform bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bob Taft, who was not governor when the law passed, also
supported it, said Scott Milburn, Taft's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes that Ohio needs tort reform to make our state a
competitive business environment and to encourage businesses to
expand and locate in Ohio,'' Milburn said. ``We are in the process
of reviewing the decision now and then a decision will be made on
the best way to move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   If lawmakers and Taft try again, Justice Alice Resnick, writing
for the court majority, gave them clear instructions on what not to
do.
</P>
<P>
   The current law represented an attempt by the legislature to
grab power from the state's courts in violation of the doctrine of
separation of power, Resnick wrote. Also, the law violated the Ohio
Constitution's requirement that legislation deal with only one
subject, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The law ``converts the drive for civil justice reform into an
attack on the judiciary as a coordinate branch of government,''
Resnick wrote. She said the legislature tried to turn back the
clock to pre-1851, the year Ohio's current Constitution was
written, ending what Resnick called a period of legislative
dominance in state government.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Andrew Douglas, Francis E. Sweeney Sr. and Paul E.
Pfeifer concurred.
</P>
<P>
   The majority specifically cited as unconstitutional the limits
on jury awards and the shortened time periods to file a claim.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer, writing for the minority, said
the constitutionality of the law should not even have been
considered by the Supreme Court at this point. Instead, challenges
should have worked their way up from lower courts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The court majority ignored ``established common-law principles,
which date back to the time of Elizabethan England,'' wrote Moyer.
He was joined in dissent by Justices Deborah L. Cook and Evelyn
Lundberg.
</P>
<P>
   Resnick and the others in the majority took such exception to
Moyer's dissent that they took what they said was the unusual step
of responding to it.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Pfeifer wrote that the law represented a ``global
cloud'' over cases filed after its enactment and the high court did
the right thing by addressing the issue promptly, rather than
waiting for appeals to arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am reminded of the fires in Yellowstone National Park 11
years ago. Park officials, despite strong opposition, decided to
let the naturally occurring wildfires run their course through the
park. The fires raged beyond the officials expectation. By the time
they decided to fight the fires, it was too late,'' wrote Pfeifer.
``Restraint is not always admirable. Here it simply would be
unjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Monteleone, president of the Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers,
said the decision won't help plaintiffs who have reached
settlements in cases brought since the law was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some poor widow settled a case cheap, it's too late,'' said
Monteleone, a Cleveland attorney.
</P>
<P>
   However, the decision could affect cases that are being
appealed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a trial court applied this unconstitutional law to the
detriment of a person in this case, there are excellent ground for
reversal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Joyce, president of the Washington, D.C.-based American
Tort Reform Association, which has promoted laws like Ohio's across
the country, was dismayed by the decision. It represented one more
example of overreaching judicial decisions that improperly limit
legislative authority, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who thinks this type of activism is limited to the
civil justice system is wrong. We've seen cases where courts are
running school systems and prisons,'' Joyce said.

WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS, THIS FORMER WRESTLER IS A REAL `OUTLAW'

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Before he can ride off into the sunset of a second
term in office, Mayor Lee Brown has to outgun a challenger: Outlaw
Josey Wales IV.
</P>
<P>
   Wales, 51, is so far the only candidate to enter the mayor's
contest. ``The Outlaw Josey Wales`` was a 1975 Western movie
starring Clint Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   Wales said Monday that he is a promoter of the Texas Wrestling
Association, with a facility near Hobby airport in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A former wrestler, Wales said he got the idea to run for public
office before Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura made his successful run
for governor of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my time,'' Wales said of his candidacy in the nonpartisan
race. ``I have a whole platform, and with a name like that on the
ballot, I am going to get some votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the name _ which is on his Texas driver's license
_ was also his name at birth, Wales replied, ``Ma'am, I am a
wrestling promoter by trade, and I have the appropriate name.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his ideas for Houston, Wales said he would like to channel
some of the city's current prosperity toward the creation of new
jobs _ an area in which he said the city is lagging.
</P>
<P>
   Wales said he was born in Virginia, grew up in Florida, received
his degree in mechanical engineering from Georgia Tech. He came to
Houston in 1975 and worked in the oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Wales said he became involved in wrestling. But he said
the breadth of his life experience would be a boon to the city if
he is elected mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the city can use a guy that is project management
and project construction-oriented,'' Wales said. ``Quite honestly,
Lee Brown is not a project manager, he is a police chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has yet to formally declare his candidacy, has raised
about $1.2 million for his presumptive second run.
</P>
<P>
   City elections are Nov. 2.

 &HT;    Ohio schools to get safety plans
 &HT;    By Joanne Huist Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As children throughout the Miami Valley prepare
to swap summer vacation for the classroom, administrators have
added school safety to the time-honored list of reading, writing
and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody, every school building, needs a crisis
plan,'' Larry Davidson, a Franklin school board member and school
safety consultant for the Warren County Career Center, said Monday.
``Kids who are worried about somebody coming to school with a gun
or bomb can't learn.''
</P>
<P>
   But how can parents tell if their child's school building is
safe from outside threats and from violent students within?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, the state Department of Education and the Franklin
County Educational Council has created a checklist to help
communities audit their schools for safety.
</P>
<P>
   All Ohio schools are eligible to receive a free safe-school
audit guidebook and technical assistance to get the process
started, said Barb Murphy, Ohio safe and drug-free school
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   State law has given school administrators added impetus to
develop safety plans this year, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that requires all school districts to create
comprehensive school safety plans was signed into law by Gov. Bob
Taft on April 20, the same day two teen-agers shot and killed a
dozen other students and a teacher inside Columbine High in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a society seem to have short attention spans,'' said
Cynthia Buettner, assistant director of the Educational Council of
Franklin County. ``There's concern now because students have been
killed. That concern needs to continue once school violence is not
the sexy, hot topic it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday and Thursday in Columbus, a statewide summit on
school violence and safety will be held. About 600 educators and
police officials will learn how to conduct the audit and look at
ways to create safer schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased people are looking at issues of school safety
seriously,'' Murphy said. ``I don't think there is a quick fix to
these types of issues. What the audit can do is give school
districts data to help them make decisions for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   The audit looks at the physical plant of a school: Whether, for
example, the building has working security cameras, locks on all
the doors, or hinges on the inside of doors. It also helps school
districts gauge the overall climate within the school building,
Buettner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do teachers model empathy? Are they caring? Do students feel
they belong _ have a sense of connectedness to school?'' Buettner
said. ``The audit is a surveying instrument, a questionnaire, for
school districts to use to collect data.''
</P>
<P>
   To be successful, the audit should be conducted by a community
of school stakeholders _ parents, students, teachers,
administrators and law enforcement, Buettner said. The audit takes
about six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Once data is collected, school districts can send the
information to the Educational Council of Franklin County for
analysis. The not-for-profit organization charges $200 for the
analysis if districts put the data onto a computer disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more in-depth you want the data to be, the more people you
need collecting data,'' Buettner said.
</P>
<P>
   Once data has been submitted, it takes about three weeks for the
report and recommendations to be issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to be pretty busy this fall, but the audit is just
the first step,'' Buettner said. ``The worst thing a school
district can do is get the report and let it sit on a shelf. It's a
baseline so the community can look ahead to how to best plan for
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The audit originated in Franklin County as a reaction to an
incident in which a student brought a gun to a suburban school,
Buettner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was injured, but the incident served as a wake-up
call,'' Buettner said. ``We wanted a checklist to make sure we
looked at all aspects of school safety.''
</P>
<P>
   EDS: Optional information box below.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Department of Education lists 56 steps to help local
schools determine if students and teachers are safe. School
officials are supposed to use the list to evaluate how prepared
they and to identify what else can be done. Among the
recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   Students know what is expected of them both academically and
behaviorally (for example, all children are expected to learn; all
people are to be treated with respect.)
</P>
<P>
   Students and staff generally feel physically and psychologically
secure from physical and verbal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   School provides safety programs that utilize students (for
example, police/student link, hot line, peer mediation teams, teen
court).
</P>
<P>
   School identifies students with social, academic, emotional,
substance abuse or health needs and matches them to school and
community resources (for example, through a school assistance
team).
</P>
<P>
   School has support programs in place for families in crisis (for
example, divorce death, abuse, addictions).
</P>
<P>
   Safety issues (violence, gangs, drugs) are addressed by an
advisory group that represents parents, business, law-enforcement
and other community interests.
</P>
<P>
   There is a student code of conduct that emphasizes the student's
responsibility for safe, disciplines, and drug-free behavior and it
is communicated in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   School has a crisis management plan (for example, student
deaths, strangers on the groups, emergency procedures) with clearly
defined and communicated roles for all personnel.
</P>
<P>
   School has closed circuit television cameras available for the
following areas: inside buildings, outside buildings, in buses,
isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
   School has working cameras for collecting evidence of criminal
violations.
</P>
<P>
   School has doors with hinges on the inside of the doors.
</P>
<P>
   School has locks on all doors and windows.

<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ As much as a billion dollars has
disappeared from public funds or been stolen from international aid
projects through fraud carried out by the Muslim, Croatian and
Serbian nationalist leaders who keep Bosnia rigidly partitioned
into three ethnic enclaves, according to an exhaustive
investigation by an American-led anti-fraud unit.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-fraud unit, set up by the Office of the High
Representative, the international agency responsible for carrying
out the civilian aspects of the Dayton peace agreement, has exposed
so much corruption that relief aid agencies and embassies are
reluctant to publicize the thefts for fear of frightening away
international donors.
</P>
<P>
   The report names several officials linked to the governing
nationalist parties as profiting from the fraud. Even though the
Office of the High Representative has dismissed 15 officials or
prevented them from holding office, most retain their authority.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident cited in the report, 10 foreign embassies and
international aid agencies lost over $20 million deposited in a
Bosnian bank, but only the Swiss Embassy has publicly acknowledged
its losses.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-fraud unit, which requires special security measures
and does not make public who is working for the organization in
Bosnia, is now investigating 220 cases of fraud and corruption. It
documents the current cases in a 4,000-page report that has not
been released to the public. Its contents were made available to
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations as diverse at the Office of the High
Representative, the United Nations and the U.S. Agency for
International Development, all dedicated to rebuilding the country,
have lost tens of millions of dollars, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread corruption is viewed by many here as a severe
blow in the long, frustrating struggle to build a democratic
Bosnia, a country that has received $5.1 billion in international
aid since the end of the war in 1995. The corruption has also
played a pivotal role in driving away foreign investment, seen as
the only way to free Bosnia from dependence on foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The missing funds were supposed to have been used to rebuild
Bosnia's roads, buildings and schools, as well as to provide
municipal services in towns throughout Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, along with other
senior nationalist leaders, has dismissed the allegations of
official corruption made by the international investigators. While
conceding that corruption takes place, the president disputes the
scale of the charges, denying that as much as a billion dollars has
been misappropriated as stated in the long and detailed report.
</P>
<P>
   Izetbegovic has repeatedly denied these charges, most recently
in a local press interview. ``It would be nonsense to claim that
there is no corruption, or that it is irrelevant, in a country that
has just come out of the war,'' he said, adding that Bosnia is a
country ``which does not have established borders, where joint
institutions are still not functioning, and which has at least two
armies and two police forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton agreement, which was signed by Muslim, Croatian and
Serbian warring factions in 1995, called for the creation of a
single state and the return of about two million displaced people
to their homes. But Bosnia remains partitioned into three
antagonistic ethnic enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Serb-held Bosnia continues to operate as a separate entity. The
internationally created Muslim-Croat Federation has no authority
and has been unable to raise revenues. The two million refugees and
displaced people have not gone back to their homes. And the Office
of the High Representative has been reduced to promising money and
aid projects to towns and cities that say they will allow some
refugees to return, promises that are usually never kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dayton stopped the violence, but it did not end the war,''
said Jacques P. Klein, the chief U.N. representative here, ``and
the war is still being fought bureaucratically through obfuscation,
delay and avoidance by a group of leaders who do not want to lose
power. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a patient on life support
assistance _ political, military and economic.''
</P>
<P>
   International donors say the endemic fraud is making it harder
to justify continued aid levels. Without the huge infusions of
money, it is unlikely that the Muslim, Croatian and Serbian
enclaves will be able to continue to pay pensions and salaries and
reconstruct the country. The Sarajevo government, for instance, has
asked the World Bank for loans to make its April pension payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is running out,'' said James Lyon, the director of the
international Crisis Group, an independent research organization.
``The international community has no enforcement mechanism. The
international administrators beg, plead, cajole and in some case
engage in what looks like bribery, promising cities infrastructure
projects if they allow some refugees to return. This tactic might
work if we continue the present aid levels, about a billion dollars
a year, over the next 20 years. But as aid declines, what will make
these people even promise to comply?''

</P>
<P>
   Tuzla, a Muslim city, is one case study of widespread corruption
that infects many local governments, the report says. The report
charges that $200 million was missing from this year's budget, in
addition to $300 million missing over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Tuzla's schools were painted four times last year alone by the
city government, although they were rebuilt and painted by
international aid organizations as well. Tuzla officials paid two
or three times the normal price for such work and sold many of the
cans of paint on the local market, the auditors found. Many of the
schools, meanwhile, still lack heat, and students must wear their
coats to class in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Sanski Most, heavily damaged during the war,
municipal funds are being used to build a horse racing track, much
to the consternation of aid agencies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report charges the town's mayor, Mehmed Alagic, with 358
counts of corruption. The charges include the theft of $450,000 in
relief aid from the government of Saudi Arabia. That money was
supposed to be used to provide feed and farm equipment, but the
report alleges that the mayor gave the money instead to his brother
to start a bank. The mayor has denied the charges and accused the
Office of the High Representatives of mounting a campaign against
him.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive case under investigation by the anti-fraud
unit concerns the Bosnia and Herzegovina Bank, or BiH, in Sarajevo.
The bank took in tens of millions of dollars from international
agencies and 10 foreign embassies. The money, the investigators
maintain, was lent to fictional businesses or given as personal
loans to friends by the two owners.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has now collapsed. The collapse underscores a
near-total failure to establish a viable banking industry. Of the
some 50 banks in Bosnia, Western diplomats say, only six are
solvent.
</P>
<P>
   The Agency for International Development, which has not made its
losses public, had at least $4 million in the BiH bank, according
to Western diplomats. At least half of the $20 million lost by
international organizations deposited in the bank was to have been
used for reconstruction projects, the anti-fraud investigators said
in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fear is that once the extent of the theft is known,
international donors will get disgusted and walk away,'' said an
official at the Office of the High Representative, who asked not to
be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Until the bank collapsed, the U.S. Embassy had asked it to act
as an agent to screen and approve small businesses that should
receive low-interest loans and then collect the funds, Western
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   AID has also filed suit in Bosnian courts against 19 Bosnian
companies, which have failed to repay business loans worth more
than $10 million. The loans, for sums ranging from $100,000 to $1
million, are part of a $278 million revolving credit established in
1996 by AID to help kick-start the Bosnian economy. The agency,
unable to collect $1 million in loans from Hidrogradnja, one of
Bosnia's largest companies, is trying to seize its assets.
</P>
<P>
   The rampant corruption has discouraged foreign investment. Most
foreign companies, including McDonald's, have refused to set up
operations after demands by officials to pay bribes and do business
exclusively with local party officials.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies _ like the Italian construction firm Aluveneto
and Gluck Norm, Germany's largest manufacturer of door and window
frames _ have pulled out with heavy losses, complaining of
interference from the state, an inability to collect debts and
demands by officials for kickbacks and bribes to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen is also considering pulling out of Bosnia, according
to European diplomats. Volkswagen officials would not comment. The
German government pushed hard to get the company to reopen its
heavily damaged plant in the Sarajevo suburb of Vogosca. Volkswagen
did so on condition that the Bosnian government buy official cars
from the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the government reneged on its promise, forcing
Volkswagen to go to court, but the state company in partnership has
refused to pay the $1 million it promised to invest.
</P>
<P>
   The money-losing Volkswagen plant does only final assembly on
car bodies shipped from the Skoda auto plant in the Czech Republic.
Sixty workers assemble about six cars a day from the kits. Few
sell, in part because of the thousands of stolen cars brought into
the country from Europe by local gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   The used car market in Stolac, which convenes every Sunday in
the Croat-controlled part of Bosnia, has one of the largest
collections of stolen vehicles in Europe, according to
international police.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent Sunday, some four hundred cars, most with forged
registration papers and German, Swiss and Italian license plates,
were being sold for large wads of German marks. The gangs that
bring the cars into Bosnia oversee the sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of the High Representative has outlawed the market.
It pressed in January to have the market's organizer, Jozo Peric,
arrested. But the local Croat court released him a few days later
and dismissed the charges. Now Peric is in hiding. When federal tax
officials showed up last year to try carry out an audit they were
beaten so badly they were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   OHR officials and western diplomats say that one of the
wealthiest and most powerful men in Bosnia is Bakir Izetbegovic,
the son of the president .
</P>
<P>
   Bakir Izetbegovic controls The City Development Institute, in
charge of determining the occupancy rights of 80,000 publicly owned
apartments in the city. The apartments, many of which belonged to
Serbs or Croats before the war, have been given to members of the
ruling Muslim-led Social Democratic Party. Others who want
occupancy rights must pay Izetbegovic $2,000, said several Bosnians
who have paid the required fee.
</P>
<P>
   Izetbegovic owns 15 percent of Bosnia Air, the state airline,
and takes a cut of the extortion money paid out by local
shopkeepers to Sarajevo gangsters, said these diplomats.
Izetbegovic has consistently denied any involvement in such
activities.
</P>
<P>
   When foreign aid agencies or even the Office of the High
Representative itself try to turn to Bosnian courts for redress,
they run up against an overwhelmed and corrupt system.
</P>
<P>
   The Agency for International Development is moving against
several large state-owned firms. But creditors are rarely able to
collect. The Tuzla courts, for example, have a backlog of over
30,000 cases of organized and violent crime. There were a total of
1,050 convictions last year, and in most of those cases, those
convicted were released on parole.
</P>
<P>
   Even when laws are passed to try to contain the fraud,
politicians have blocked or ignored them. For example, a law was
passed last year in the Bosnian Assembly that would allow the
government to tax the oil and gas trucked in from Croatia. The
revenue was expected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
But when the law appeared in the official gazette articles 24 and
26, the ones that stipulated such taxation, were inexplicably
missing.
</P>
<P>
   The Croat Mafia that brings in the oil and gas continues to pay
no taxes. Although the case is in a Sarajevo court, western
diplomats say the judges, fearing retribution, are afraid to try
it.

Alou unlikely to return by Sept. 1 target date
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   As the Astros welcomed back third baseman Ken Caminiti on
Monday, the wait for Moises Alou continued.
</P>
<P>
   And it could be longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Gerry Hunsicker indicated there is virtually no
chance the team's All-Star left fielder can be ready to return to
the lineup by Sept. 1, as originally targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unrealistic at this point,'' Hunsicker said prior to
the opener of a four-game series between the Astros and Milwaukee
Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Alou went through a 10- to 15-minute batting session Monday, his
first since he suffered a setback in late July. He had initially
hinted at a mid-August return, but his left knee has been slow to
recover from arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn anterior
cruciate ligament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to set a date now, because I set one and I had a
setback, and I don't know when I'm going to come back,'' said Alou,
who suffered the injury in February and has been on the disabled
list all season. ``I think it (my knee) is going to come back
quick, hopefully before the (regular) season is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou experienced soreness in his knee while on the club's road
trip to Colorado July 26-29. He was inactive for a few days and has
been limited to rehab exercises over the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was probably too aggressive and pushed himself too much,''
Hunsicker said. ``He's starting to step it up again. That's part of
coming back from a serious injury _ you just don't know from one
day to the next what's going to happen. That's why it's unrealistic
to set a timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou had progressed at such an encouraging pace earlier this
summer that the Astros projected a Sept. 1 return. Prior to the
July setback, Alou was scheduled to begin a rehabilitation
assignment in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   With the return date coming so late in the season, the Astros
will have a hard time finding game situations in which to bring
Alou along. The minor-league season ends at the beginning of
September, which may force the Astros to stage simulated games for
Alou at the Astrodome, Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good, even though I stopped swinging a bat for a
while,'' Alou said. ``Four or more times like this (Monday's
session), and I might be able to play. But it's up to my knee.
Whenever my knee is ready to go, I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he does not return by Sept. 1, Alou will be eligible for
postseason play if the Astros qualify. Any player on the
major-league 15- or 60-day disabled list, as well as the 25-man
active roster, is eligible for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Alou has little doubt he will be back in time for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I should be there by playoff time,'' he said.
``Hopefully I'll have a couple of days to struggle during the
regular season, and then I'll be ready for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first season with the Astros in 1998, Alou finished third
in the National League Most Valuable Player voting behind Chicago's
Sammy Sosa and St. Louis' Mark McGwire. Alou batted .312 with a
career-high 38 home runs and 124 RBIs in helping the Astros to a
second straight NL Central championship.

   Former holdout Anderson joins Falcons camp
</P>
<P>
   By Matt Winkeljohn
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ As Falcons coach Dan Reeves left the dining
hall after dinner at Furman University on Monday, he said, ``It's
so bright; the sun is killing me.''
</P>
<P>
   You might think he was commenting on the ever-bright sun just
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Reeves was responding to the star power of his most
recently-signed player, running back Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who ended his 14-day contract holdout last Wednesday,
was in pads Monday afternoon for the first time since Super Bowl
XXXIII, and he looked more or less like the same back who ran for a
franchise-record 1,846 yards last season.
</P>
<P>
   After practice, the Falcons' new $32-millionaire made his way to
the mess hall, resplendent in shorts, a T-shirt, sneakers, a
bandana wrapped around his head and . . . sun glasses. Indoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, can you believe that?'' Reeves joked.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who wears No. 32, was certainly back in form off the
field. After practice, in which there was no full tackling but a
considerable amount of hitting, he took his seat in his golf cart,
the one with the, ``Jam'' sign on the front.
</P>
<P>
   Our came the alter ego that goes by the same name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of taking it easy. I don't want to hurt any of
these guys,'' said Anderson, who signed a five-year, $32 million
deal that makes him one of the five highest-paid backs in the NFL.
``They've all been here a couple weeks, and they're all sore.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said it's too early to tell if Anderson will play in
Saturday's home preseason game against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll work him in there during the week, and we'll see whether
he's ready to play both mentally and physically,'' Reeves said.
``If he's ready to go, we'll play him some, and if not, we'll hold
off for another week.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's first serious contact came in a tackling drill, where
running backs went one-on-one with safeties and linebackers, and
wide receivers went up against cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   There, between two tacking dummies, he collided with strong
safety Marty Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders were instructed not to take ball carriers all the way
to the ground, just to get a good hit and wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who is 6-feet-2, 210 pounds, stalemated the 5-11, 236
Anderson as a loud, ``Whumpf'' noise resonated.
</P>
<P>
   There were some other collisions, too, in 9-on-7 and 11-on-11
drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm loose and fresh so I was just trying to get in there and
bang a few shoulders and see what I could do,'' Anderson said. ``It
was good to get back out there and get the juices flowing.''

 ALEXANDER WITHDRAWS FROM PRESIDENTIAL RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Tenn., S.C., N.H., Ariz., Calif., Ohio, Ind., N.C.,(See also BAUER-PROFILE, MCCAIN-CAMPAIGN, DOLE-SORORITY) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lamar Alexander abandoned his dogged
six-and-a-half-year quest for the White House on Monday, while top
supporters of former Vice President Dan Quayle bolted from his
campaign. Both candidates are suffering from an early Republican
stampede to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas that has helped
dramatically cut short the traditional nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining that he had not had an adequate chance to compete,
Alexander said, ``I campaigned on the idea that we ought to have a
contest.'' He told supporters at the state capitol in Nashville,
where he formally announced his candidacy only six months ago, ``My
heart tells me to keep going and so do a lot of telephone calls
this morning, but there's really no realistic way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The reshuffling of the Republican field comes after a straw poll
of nearly 25,000 people on Saturday in Ames, Iowa, in which Bush
led the field, followed by Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole. The
last straw for Alexander came, literally, when he placed a
disappointing sixth. Quayle finished eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a thoughtful and low-key former governor of Tennessee
and former secretary of education, devoted more time and energy
than his opponents and had assembled an impressive organization in
Iowa; he has not held any other full-time job since he left
Washington in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But while Alexander mounted a respectable run for president in
1996, this time he never caught on in the early polls or with
contributors. He is slightly more moderate than most of the other
candidates, but never established a clear niche.
</P>
<P>
   His cash-poor campaign, which collected about $2.5 million,
could not compete with Bush and his treasury of more than $37
million. In his remarks Monday, Alexander did not endorse any of
his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Though Quayle fared even worse on Saturday, he insisted that he
would stay in the race. But several of his leading supporters in
South Carolina _ a critical early primary state _ deserted him
Monday for Sen. John McCain of Arizona, whose campaign was
energetically trying to pick off Quayle's backers around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Merrill, the director of Quayle's campaign in the state, and
four other top organizers, including Edward T. McMullen Jr.,
abruptly submitted their resignations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I have tried to reach your office this morning
but have been unable to personally contact you,'' McMullen wrote in
a letter that was faxed to Quayle. ``Your loss in Iowa and the
resulting calls from your supporters forced me to conclude that
South Carolina's Quayle 2000 effort is now irreparably weakened.''
He scribbled on the bottom: ``Your friendship and support over the
years means a great deal _ I hope that will continue!''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona also endorsed McCain; Salmon had
announced his support of Quayle in February.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Baron, a spokesman for Quayle, responded to the
defections by saying, ``The rats may be jumping off the ship but
the ship's not sinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet speculation that Quayle will quit has been so rampant that
Kyle McSlarrow, his national chairman, put out a statement
asserting, ``Dan Quayle is completely committed to this campaign.''
He framed the defections as part of a reorganization in which the
campaign would concentrate on the vital states of Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign may be trying so assiduously to show
movement to blunt the impact of Mrs. Dole's solid third-place
finish in the straw poll. She and McCain, who did not compete in
Iowa, are battling for many of the same voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from the McCain campaign last night _ they're
recruiting,'' said Fran Wendelboe, a state representative in New
Hampshire who supports Quayle. ``But we're going to go on.
Someone's got to emerge; I don't think those conservatives are
going to go with G.W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The developments Monday led some politicians and academics to
complain that the winnowing of the field _ Rep. John Kasich of Ohio
dropped out last month _ was occurring before voters had a chance
to weigh in, let alone to focus on the campaign. Only 9 percent of
registered voters say they are paying much attention to the
presidential race, according to a CBS News poll conducted earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The experts said the results of the nonbinding straw poll have
been taken too seriously because it was to some degree a
competition over which campaigns could spend the most money to bus
supporters to the event, feed them and supply their $25 tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Polsby, a political scientist at the University of
California at Berkeley, said Alexander's withdrawal validated ``a
bought-and-paid-for straw poll.'' He said while the event ``was
completely meaningless,'' he knew ``it would nevertheless achieve
meaning because of the interpretations that it would inspire.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates have been forced to begin the race earlier because
several states moved up the dates of their primaries next year in
an attempt to wield more influence on the outcome. The result is
that the Republican and Democratic nominees will probably be
settled upon by early March.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who is 59, said in a telephone interview that because
of a $1,000 limit on individual contributions, he could not compete
with Bush's vast support. ``The rushing to judgment combined with
the $1,000 limit makes it virtually impossible for anybody except
the rich and the famous to run,'' he said. ``So we can look forward
to a race between Donald Trump and the latest Powerball winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding more resigned than exasperated, as he was in the final
days of his campaign, Alexander said, ``I'd call people and they'd
say, `I read in the morning paper that George Bush is already
elected and you don't have a chance. So it's impossible for me to
raise money for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Asked if anyone would emerge to take on Bush, he said, ``It's
hard to see. The most qualified of the others are Senator McCain,
Vice President Quayle and Senator Hatch.'' Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah
entered the competition last month.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by his campaign, Bush said, ``Lamar is a
good man who poured his heart into his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans dismissed Alexander's complaint that he did
not have ample opportunity to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was out there running before George W. raised his first
nickel,'' said Lyn Nofziger, a Republican strategist who backs
Patrick Buchanan. ``Lamar's got a problem: He doesn't seem to
appeal to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
said: ``He had as good a chance as anybody else. There's a timing
and rhythm about politics _ and it just didn't seem to be Lamar's
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant, said, ``Quayle
and Lamar have had years. If you've been trying to get your car
started for what _ 15 years now _ and can't get it to turn over,
you might as well start hitchhiking.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Larry M. Bartels, a political scientist at Princeton University,
said he was still mystified that ``a person like Alexander could
think it was worthwhile to devote years of his time and energy to
this without having gotten any real positive signals either from
the political establishment or the public.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Gov. George W. Bush is expected on Tuesday to decide
the fate of a mentally ill death row inmate who murdered five
people but whose cause is being championed by mental health
advocates who say his case illustrates the state's inadequate
services for mentally ill people.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination
as a ``compassionate conservative,'' the case of Larry Keith
Robison is attracting attention, particularly in light of comments
attributed to the governor in a recent magazine interview in which
he seemed to mock the clemency pleas of a death row inmate, Karla
Faye Tucker, who was executed in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The execution by lethal injection of Robison, 42, is scheduled
for 6 p.m. Tuesday. He would become the 99th person executed since
Bush took office in January 1995. A total of 184 people have been
executed in Texas since the state amended its criminal code in 1974
to allow the death penalty. The first execution occurred in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Melodee Smith, who is also a lawyer and is handling
Robison's clemency petition, said she filed appeals Monday with
state courts that included a request for a delay to allow a state
psychiatrist to determine Robison's competency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no excuse for the crime,'' Ms. Smith said of the 1982
killings in Tarrant County. But she said the state's system for
serving mentally ill people had failed Robison, who has a history
of drug abuse and had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic
several years before the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush, said Monday that the
governor had not made a decision in the case. She said that the
Texas Board of Pardons and Parole voted 17-0 on Friday to deny
commutation of Robison's death sentence to life in prison. Without
such a recommendation, Ms. Edwards said that the governor could not
commute a death sentence under Texas law. Bush could grant a 30-day
stay of execution. ``He is carefully considering the facts in the
case as he does in all death penalty cases,'' Ms. Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, acting at the recommendation of the parole board,
Bush commuted the death sentence of Henry Lee Lucas, who was found
guilty of several murders in the 1980s but whose conviction in
Texas had been called into question. In every other case, the
parole board has recommended death, and Bush has followed the
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   If Robison is executed, he will become the 21st death row inmate
in Texas to die this year. In a state where executions have become
almost commonplace, four other inmates were executed earlier this
month with little fanfare. But Robison's case has attracted the
attention of mental health advocates from across the country and a
plea for mercy from Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   The details of Robison's case are particularly gruesome: He was
convicted of shooting, stabbing and sexually mutilating five people
in August 1982, and prosecutors also suggested that he committed
cannibalism. Prosecutors discounted his assertion of mental
illness, saying that he acted deliberately and with premeditation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be mentally ill,'' said Greg Pipes, the Tarrant County
prosecutor who handled the case. ``I'm just saying his mental
illness did not cause him to commit the crime. He knew what he did
and why he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for Robison place much of the blame on the state's
mental health system. His mother, Lois Robison, said she made
repeated efforts to get him psychiatric help before the murders.
She said she tried unsuccessfully to commit her son to state
hospitals after he was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.
``They couldn't keep him more than 30 days because he was not
violent,'' Ms. Robison said in a telephone interview Monday. ``If
he ever got violent then they could keep him on an involuntary
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Graham, vice president of the National Mental Health
Association, a national group of mental health agencies, said that
Texas ranked 42nd among the 50 states in per resident expenditures
for mental health services. Last spring, the state legislature
allocated an additional $27 million for mental health services, but
this month, as state officials discovered the possibility of a $30
million budget shortfall, the Texas Department of Mental Health and
Mental Retardation announced that $5 million would be cut for
medications and $2.4 million for state mental hospital beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has never adequately funded mental health services _ yet
it is perfectly willing to execute people for crimes that good
mental health care might have prevented,'' wrote The Dallas Morning
News, in a lead editorial that appeared on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards said state officials were ``working on finding funds
elsewhere.'' She said that financing for mental health and
retardation had increased by $670 million while Bush has been in
office.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1992 election, when President Clinton was governor of
Arkansas, he attracted criticism for deciding to proceed with the
execution of a brain-damaged felon who had been convicted of a
killing a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the Robison case also has political ramifications. The
governor has faced criticism for his comments in a recent profile
in Talk magazine in which he was quoted as mocking Karla Faye
Tucker in a whimpering voice.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials for Bush have denied the characterization of
his comments, saying that the governor was misread. But the article
has brought criticism even from putative allies. The columnist
George Will criticized Bush not only for his remarks about Ms.
Tucker but also for his salty language in the article.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the political backdrop, Ms. Smith said: ``We're hoping
he'll evaluate the case on its merits and be the compassionate
conservative he has proclaimed to be.''

<P>
   One psychiatrist says it's what happens to people when they are
frightened _ or when they're crammed into a coach-class seat on a
major airline carrier.
</P>
<P>
   On a subconscious level, academics say, the act of flying
includes physical cues that can set someone on edge. And that's not
counting the stress in the terminal: long check-in lines,
unsympathetic airline employees, delayed or canceled flights.
</P>
<P>
   If you lose your cool, there's a name for the affliction: air
rage. And the recent rash of conflicts, arguments, and even
fistfights between passengers and airline crews are gaining
nationwide attention.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Juan Jose Benito was arraigned in East Boston District
Court for allegedly throwing coffee on a gate attendant at Logan
International Airport. Last week, Patricia Lemerise stood in the
same courtroom, charged with disrupting her flight from Miami to
Boston after she swore to flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   As the phenomenon has grown into a national fascination,
psychologists have joined the the search for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Theories abound, and so does the blame. Passengers blame flight
attendants. Flight attendants blame airlines. Airlines blame the
air traffic control system.
</P>
<P>
   Some, from consumer-advocacy groups to maverick members of
Congress, insist it's due to the state of the airline industry
since deregulation, 21 years ago. Others say it's the
democratization of air travel: more passengers, less gentility.
</P>
<P>
   Margie Terrell, 45, a flight attendant for 27 years, says she
remembers a time when ``people dressed up to fly.'' Now, she said,
some passengers behave as though they were taking a bus ride _ or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get on there and they go berserk,'' she said, largely
for problems she can't solve. ``I can't give you a meal if they
gave me pretzels. I can't give you steak if they gave me chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   But on a basic level, some psychologists say, the airport
experience can fray a person's patience, and make ``irate'' _
airline workers' term for unruly customers _ a common state of
being.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University psychologist Tom Cottle said air travel is a
breeding ground for anxiety: Fear of death, discomfort in crowds,
separation from home and family, fouled-up sleep cycles.
</P>
<P>
   The ``mysterious sociology,'' he said, also includes
restrictions on where to stand or park your car, language that's
used nowhere else (``your final destination'') class tensions
evoked at the baggage counter: ``This line, which is very short, is
for the first class, and this line is for the rest of you slobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that more people are flying than ever before _ 614 million
per year compared to 275 million two decades ago _ air travel means
confronting overbooked flights, overstuffed luggage compartments,
and other opportunities for anger.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, about 30
percent of all major airline flights nationwide arrived more than
15 minutes late in June, the last month data was available.
</P>
<P>
   That same month, about one in every 200 bags was reported lost,
damaged, delayed or stolen. Between January and March, at least one
out of every 100 passengers was involuntarily bumped from a major
airline flight.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines blame an understaffed, underfunded air traffic control
system for many of the troubles, and say pilots often aren't told
why their flights are delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as many as half of all delays can be traced to air
traffic control problems, said Paul Hudson, president of the
Aviation Consumer Action Project, an advocacy groups founded by
Ralph Nader in 1971 _ after he was bumped from a flight.
</P>
<P>
   But Hudson also notes that the airlines themselves are
responsible for some of the frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are getting larger, he said, but the airlines are
shrinking the seats to pack in more passengers. Fed up with lost
luggage, more people are bringing their bags on board, and find
themselves fighting for space in the overhead bin.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson pointed out that airlines deliberately overbook flights,
anticipating no-shows. And he said their hub-and-spoke dispatch
system sends 94 percent of air traffic through only 13 percent of
the nation's airports.
</P>
<P>
   The system was fine until the mid-1990s because most flights
were only about half-full, Hudson said. But recently, he said, jets
have been flying at 70 or 80 percent capacity, and a single delay
or cancelled flight can disrupt an entire region.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, he said, waiting passengers get little or no
information, or are strung along for hours without answers. Real
information, consumer advocates say, would go a long way to easing
the burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can take it. Tell us what's really going on,'' said U.S.
Rep. Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat who has worked for years for
air travel consumer reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Economics make that unlikely, Hudson said. If passengers knew a
flight would be delayed for hours, he said, they'd demand refunds
or switch to other carriers. And that could cut into the airlines'
record profits.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, people will wait.
</P>
<P>
   A little empathy would go a long way toward soothing the
tensions in airports, said Anne O'Dwyer, a University of
Massachusetts psychologist who studies ``queue rage.''
</P>
<P>
   When trying to resolve a conflict, she suggests, tell the
airline employee you know your problem is not his fault. If a
conversation with one employee is going poorly, she said, try to
talk to someone different.
</P>
<P>
   And while you're waiting for a flight, don't sit and stew, she
said. Buy a good book. Call an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   And when you get to the airport, she said, expect the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be surprised. Envision backups. Anticipate delays,''
said O'Dwyer, who also teaches at Boston University. ``Don't assume
that it's all going to go smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   Or reduce your expectations even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sort of lowered my standards,'' DeFazio deadpanned.
``Hey, if they can get me there alive, that's great.''

 By DON VAN NATTA JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since the first days of her house-hunting tour
through the hamlets of Westchester County, N.Y., Hillary Rodham
Clinton has worried that she and her husband may not be able to
afford the seven-figure showplace homes they have inspected.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are the least affluent couple to occupy the White
House since Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter lived there 20 years ago.
They have not owned their own home since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time they are viewing million-dollar-plus houses,
President and Mrs. Clinton are also deep in debt. They owe a
battery of lawyers $5.5 million, a sum that far exceeds their net
worth of approximately $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clintons are weighing whether to place bids on
Westchester properties, the administrators of the Clinton Legal
Expense Trust are mailing out new appeals for donations and are
expressing concern that they will not be able to erase the
Clintons' debt before the president leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an analysis of the Clintons' finances shows that the first
family can still afford to purchase a property in the price range
of the ones they toured on Sunday, from a seven-bedroom, $1.7
million house in Edgemont, N.Y., to a 4.14-acre property in Rye
Brook, N.Y., that is listed at $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clintons make a 20 percent down payment of $440,000 on a
$2.2 million house, a 30-year mortgage, at a fixed rate of 8.75
percent, would mean their monthly payment would be $13,845, said
Seth Cohen, the managing director of Home Mortgage Acceptance Corp.
in Manhattan. Cohen estimated that the Clintons would also owe
about $25,000 a year in property taxes and about $500 a month on
insurance. ``That comes to a monthly nut of about $16,645,'' Cohen
said. He said that the Clintons would need to earn about $525,000 a
year to qualify for that particular mortgage. Based on the
Clintons' 1998 income, the couple would qualify now for such a
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and supporters said Monday that the Clintons had not
decided whether to buy or rent a home, but they seemed to be
leaning toward making an offer and applying for, as one friend
described it, ``a super-jumbo mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton wins election to the Senate from New York in
November 2000, her annual income will be $129,619, or 35 percent
less than the president's current $200,000 annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   When he leaves office in January 2001, Clinton could become his
family's predominant bread-winner for the first time since the
early 1980s. His friends say he has strong potential to earn
millions of dollars from book deals, speaking engagements and,
possibly, serving on corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll do great,'' said James Carville, a political strategist
and a close friend of the Clintons. ``His book advance alone will
be enough to pay off the balance of a large mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   Other former presidents, including Gerald Ford, have served on
corporate boards. Former President Carter has done well as an
author. Former Presidents Reagan and Bush have earned high speaking
fees abroad, including a $2 million fee paid to Reagan by a
Japanese corporation.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton loses or abandons her bid for the Senate, she,
too, would likely be in demand. She has already written a best
seller and several publishing executives have said they think her
memoirs could fetch more than the president's. Corporations would
likely compete for her service on their boards.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage experts say that a couple with an annual income of
$500,000 can easily qualify for a mortgage for a home costing $2
million. Of course, most couples do not have the Clintons' legal
debts, but then those who have such debts do not have a legal
defense fund raising contributions to erase it. But mortgage
experts said that most lenders will not penalize the Clintons for
their enormous debts unless a civil lawsuit was filed to recover
it, a possibility that is highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wanted to do 80 percent financing on a $2.2 million
house, there will be banks lining up to offer the Clintons a
mortgage, as long as there are no judgments or liens filed against
them,'' said Melissa Cohn, president of Manhattan Mortgage Co., a
top broker for luxury homes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohn said that banks would certainly also consider Clinton's
future earning potential after he leaves office. ``They'll be more
than willing to gamble on his ability to earn solid income because
of who he is,'' Ms. Cohn said. ``And they won't hold it against him
that he is about to become unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons estimated their net worth to fall somewhere between
$1.2 million to $5.57 million in their most recent annual financial
disclosure form released in May. The biggest chunk _ worth more
than $1 million but less than $5 million _ came from a blind trust
of securities held in Mrs. Clinton's name. The forms require only a
range of figures rather than precise numbers, but White House aides
said that the trust was worth slightly more than $1 million. Thanks
to the bull market, the blind trust's value has grown substantially
in the past five years, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' adjusted 1998 gross income of $504,109 came from
the $200,000 salary Clinton receives as president and $200,318 from
securities from a blind trust they sold shortly before they paid
$850,000 to settle the Paula Corbin Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit
against Clinton. They also reported $16,665 in taxable interest,
$16,736 in dividends, $1,329 in a state income tax refund from
Arkansas and $74,289 in royalties from Mrs. Clinton's best-selling
book, ``It Takes A Village.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton herself has worried aloud about whether a
multimillion-dollar home is within her family's reach. She
pronounced a $3.8 million house beyond her family's price range.
``If I can afford it, I'd buy,'' the first lady told reporters last
month, ``but I probably will end up renting.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, friends say the Clintons have felt more
confident about making an offer on a home because of the
expectation that the president will soon be earning a much larger
income.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Clinton was one of the lowest-paid governors in
the nation, earning $35,000 a year, while Mrs. Clinton pulled down
a six-figure income as a partner at the Rose Law Firm, one of
Little Rock's most profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Worry over the magnitude of their legal debt has also receded.
``It's not like a Mastercard,'' Carville said of the still-unpaid
legal fees. ``There's no interest, and the lawyers are not going to
sue the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Clintons' unpaid legal fees are substantial, and they
continue to escalate, even now as Kenneth Starr nears the
conclusion of his five-year-old inquiry. According to their 1998
disclosure report, the Clintons reported owing more than $1 million
each to the Washington law firms of Williams &AMP; Connolly and
Skadden, Arps, Slater, Meagher &AMP; Flom. The Clintons also reported
owing $100,000 to $250,000 to the Little Rock, Ark., firm of
Wright, Lindsey &AMP; Jennings and $250,000 to $500,000 to Mayer, Brown
&AMP; Platt.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, friends say, the Clintons had to sell more of
their securities to help pay the $850,000 settlement to Paula
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than half of the settlement, $475,000, came from
an insurance policy against civil liability that the president held
with Chubb Group Insurance. Most, if not all, of the remainder was
withdrawn from the blind trust held in Mrs. Clinton's name. A White
House official said that although both Mr. and Mrs. Clinton held
blind trusts in separate names, they were, in effect, joint
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Aides and friends said they did not know how much those costs
reduced the first family's net worth. More recently, a federal
judge in Little Rock ordered the president to pay $90,000 for a
contempt of court fine for Clinton's misleading answers in a
deposition in the Jones lawsuit. Friends said they did not know how
the Clintons' have paid that fine.
</P>
<P>
   To come up with the cash for a down payment, the Clintons could
sell a portion of their blind trusts. Clinton has a blind trust
estimated to be worth $100,000 to $250,000, his disclosure report
says. But most mortgage brokers said that the Clintons would not be
required to put down a large down payment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, several close friends of the Clintons' discussed the
possibility of buying a home for the first family, and leasing it
to them, an arrangement similar to one made by friends of the
Reagans when they retired to a $2.5 million ranch-style house in
Bel Air, Calif. ``We talked about it pretty seriously,'' said one
friend, who insisted on anonymity. ``But with Hillary's run for the
Senate, it's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Strict Senate gift rules would make it impossible for Mrs.
Clinton, if she wins the New York Senate seat in November 2000, to
accept gifts of more than $50. Federal ethics rules would also
prevent lawyers from forgiving the debt owed by the Clintons,
because such a move would constitute an impermissible gift to a
federal officeholder.

GOP COUNTY DA A LIKELY OPPONENT TO SEN. KENNEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Apparently undaunted by US Senator Edward M. Kennedy's
$2.4 million campaign war chest, District Attorney Michael Sullivan
is telling Republican leaders he is leaning heavily toward taking
on Massachusetts' most famous Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   GOP sources said Sullivan will travel to Washington Thursday to
meet with officials at the Republican National Committee and the
National Republican Senatorial Committee, which can provide up to
$650,000 for his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said Sullivan is giving ``serious consideration'' to
taking on Kennedy after being recruited by Governor Paul Cellucci
and Lieutenant Governor Jane M. Swift. He is expected to make his
decision after the meetings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If Sullivan decides to run, as is expected, he would be the
first GOP candidate with a substantial political base to challenge
Kennedy, who has held the seat since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the challengers Kennedy has faced were wealthy
businessmen, such as Josiah Spaulding, Ray Shamie, and Mitt Romney,
or candidates with little name recognition and no major electoral
experience, such as Joseph D. Malone in 1988 and Michael Robertson
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   According to Republican aides, Cellucci's decision to recruit
Sullivan demonstrates the governor's strong beliefs that candidates
for major offices must have political experience at the local and
county levels, and that a personal fortune cannot buy a Senate
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, 44, is a former three-term state representative from
Abington who was appointed Plymouth County district attorney in
1995 by Governor William F. Weld after incumbent William O'Malley
died.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Sullivan, who opposes abortion, proved a strong
vote-getter in Democratic strongholds when he faced a tough battle
against John Buckley, a politically well-connected, Brockton-area
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   He raised nearly $250,000 in that campaign and defeated Buckley,
a Democrat, by 12 percentage points _ noteworthy during the year in
which President Clinton's reelection helped sweep Democrats to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy ``is going to have to scrap the old playbook that
demonizes the wealthy millionaires who take him on,'' said one
Republican official. ``It will be nice to have someone who has been
in debates, has shaken hands, marched in parades, and asked people
for money and votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan could not be reached for comment Monday. Will Keyser,
Kennedy's press spokesman, said the senator would not speculate
about possible opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serving people of Massachusetts is his highest priority,''
Keyser said. ``He is working hard on the issues that make a
difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Rehnert, a venture capitalist partner of Romney, had
shown interest earlier this year in running for the Senate seat,
but he reportedly has told GOP leaders that he will not enter the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's toughest reelection campaign came in 1994, when Romney
spent $7 million _ $4 million of which came from his own fortune _
in a year when Republicans took over Congress from the Democrats.
Romney lost to Kennedy by 17 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy spent nearly $11 million in the race, including $1.25
million from his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks before the election, Romney had pulled even with
Kennedy. But his momentum was shattered when Kennedy aired a series
of television ads that depicted Romney as an insensitive financier
whose firm had laid off workers and dismantled a factory in
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are hoping their recruitment of Sullivan will
show that Cellucci is reinvigorating the party and that Sullivan,
who is considered a longshot in the race, will benefit from the
exposure. In 1990, Malone parlayed the publicity from his failed
race against Kennedy to become the first GOP state treasurer in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But some political observers say Sullivan's decision to take on
Kennedy could be a serious political blunder. They say Sullivan
could face a devastating counterattack similar to the one Kennedy
launched against Romney.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, campaigns use opposition research and vicious ads
to raise their opponent's negative ratings with voters. If Sullivan
mounts a serious challenge, specialists say, he will probably face
scrutiny and exposure to his opponent's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   His record as a district attorney will become prime campaign
fodder, including his handling of politically volatile issues and
decisions that may be legal and correct for a prosecutor but hard
to defend as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every plea bargain that his office has negotiated, every
campaign contribution from a lawyer with a case before his office
is all open to scrutiny,'' said one leading Massachusetts Democrat,
who did not want to be quoted by name. ``This guy could have a
serious Democratic opponent by the time he is finished running
against Kennedy.''

   MUENSTER, Germany _ It's a little past 11 at night, and Mikhail
Gorbachev has just appeared on the tree-lined path that leads to
the hotel. He's walking slowly, with his shoulders hunched over and
his arms behind his back. He's wearing a blue T-shirt and a pair of
new blue jeans. A few steps behind him, one of two bodyguards is
carrying the black bag that goes with Gorbachev wherever he goes.
It's a reminder of the famous ``nuclear'' bag, which hasn't been
his for years now. But this bag remains filled with mysterious
things the former Soviet president doesn't want to be without.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember ever having seen Gorbachev so strained. It
makes me think of that photograph of Raisa and him on the mobile
staircase of the airplane that had just landed in Moscow, after
they had been held captive for three days under house arrest during
the August 1991 coup. His wife was visibly shaken, but the eyes of
the president were flashing like those of a tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Now the light is gone in that weary gaze. He's clearly moved and
gives me a quiet hug. ``So good of you to come, let's go get
something to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's tired. He says so: ``The first 10 days were very rough
_ I was alone. Irina (his daughter) came once she'd settled things
in Moscow and brought along the grandchildren (Xenia and Nastia). I
wanted _ and had _ to stay with Raisa Maksimovna all the time. They
were sleepless nights both for her and for me, and I had to help
her change her position every 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   With a melancholy smile, he goes on: ``Now I've got a terrible
back pain that never lets up. You know, it's exactly like that kind
of movement they advise weightlifters to avoid, where you bend over
to lift something. And I did it 40 times a night!''
</P>
<P>
   He eats some salad and a yogurt, but I can see that he wants to
talk. Things are going a little better now. Irina goes to the
clinic early in the morning and stays till 2 p.m. Then it's his
turn until evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk a lot. I don't leave until I see that she is
relatively calm. For the first few days she was so exhausted. She
suffered a lot. The treatment is so violent, so harsh,'' he says,
sighing.
</P>
<P>
   Raisa had learned her diagnosis only a few days earlier. The
family's compassionate attempt to keep her mind free of the bad
news couldn't last for long. It was her questioning that put
Gorbachev up against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never told her a lie in my entire life. She knows that _
so she didn't ask the doctor, she asked me. I told her yes, it was
a form of leukemia, one of the many different ones. She closed her
eyes and remained silent for 40 minutes. I didn't dare to break
into that silence, which seemed to last an eternity. That was the
hardest moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the doctors explained everything _ showed Raisa Gorbachev
the lab reports and told her there was hope.
</P>
<P>
   The internal medicine clinic at the University Hospital in
Muenster is one of the world's finest care centers. The original
diagnosis was made in Moscow on July 21 by Dr. Andrej Vorobiof of
the Central Clinical Hospital. Four days later, Raisa Maksimovna
was in the high-tech room of the transplant department at the
Muenster clinic.
</P>
<P>
   To visit this area you have to remove all your clothing, put on
sterilized clothes and cover your mouth with a mask. The hundreds
of letters and flowers and gifts that keep arriving are not even
allowed into the ward. They are rerouted to the hotel room of Karen
Karagesianz, the press secretary of The Gorbachev Foundation, who
is taking care of business.
</P>
<P>
   But how, I wonder, did Raisa get to Muenster so fast? In her
weakened state, she couldn't have taken a commercial flight. Did
the Russian government provide a plane? Gorbachev shakes his head.
He would rather not talk about this. Irina also keeps mum, despite
herself.
</P>
<P>
   They show me a batch of recent well wishes. Two days earlier, a
telegram arrived from Boris Yeltsin (after those from the Clintons,
George Bush, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and countless other world leaders, Nobel Prize winners and
cultural and religious figures.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's telegram reads: ``I want to express my deep concern
for the ordeal that your family is going through. I know well how
hard it is to experience the illness of a loved one. More than
ever, in moments like these, mutual support, warmth and caring are
needed. I wish for you, my esteemed Mikhail Sergeivich, strength
and perseverance and, for Raisa Maksimovna, courage in her struggle
against the disease as well as a speedy recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time in the last nine years that Yeltsin has
addressed himself directly to Mikhail Gorbachev, and the former
Soviet president clearly doesn't want to stir up any controversy.
He remarks: ``They're kind words, a very nice gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   I have to look elsewhere to find out what airplane carried the
Gorbachevs from Moscow. It turns out that it departed from a Swiss
airport and was flying the Swiss flag. It may be (although this
remains unconfirmed) that the plane was rented by a Greek
shipowner, a close friend of the Gorbachev family since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   So they didn't fly courtesy of the Russian government. Or was it
that they chose to arrange things by themselves? Beyond politics,
it is true, these questions are of little importance in light of
the human drama confronting Gorbachev and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Next morning, while Irina takes her turn in the clinic and after
Mikhail Sergeivich finishes updating reporters, we go for a long
walk in the park. People stop and stare at Gorbachev. He is a hero
in Germany. Bicycle brakes screech to a halt on the winding
streets. A woman shakes Gorbachev's hand. A teen-ager simply says,
``Thank you.'' A well-dressed, elderly gentleman says to him, first
in German and then in English: ``You are the Napoleon of our
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Gorbachev says, in a forceful German _ and then,
snickering to me sotto voce: ``It is not a great compliment. He
ended up on Saint Helena. And besides he was more of a general than
a reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   The prior night Raisa slept better, he says, and her high fever
has disappeared. So Gorbachev is in a better mood. He's clearly
happy also with the coverage of Raisa's story in the Russian
newspapers and on the TV stations. It's a kind of moral recompense
that seems to somewhat soothe the wounds of being ignored for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to know something?'' he asks. ``I never expected
this from the Russians. I thought it would take a whole generation
before they understood. But I see that not one bad word has been
written against her, or against me. It's as if our pain has broken
through all of that lack of understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   He has tears in his eyes, and this time he doesn't try to hide
them. He shakes his head and puts his fingers over his eyes _ then
pulls a newspaper clipping from his pocket. ``Read this.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an article from Izvestiya, titled ``Ledi Dostoinstvo,'' the
Lady of Dignity: ``Maybe we Russians are becoming people again. ...
We seem not to have lost the capacity to share the pain of others.
... It may be only this sad occasion, but we are showing great
respect for two people who love each other, Raisa and Mikhail.''
</P>
<P>
   I read on: ``Diminutive and elegant, with sophisticated tastes,
she is not like the others. She has been the symbol of a country
that wanted to free itself from its dreary greyness. People didn't
understand her, or perhaps they didn't want to understand her.
Maybe too much was asked of them when the couple was in power. But
it's also true that no one was able to bend their will and
subordinate them.''
</P>
<P>
   And did Raisa read this article? ``Yes, she read it and cried. I
think she has never read so many expressions of tenderness and
admiration for her before.''
</P>
<P>
   Again Gorbachev has the look of somebody ready for battle. ``I
remember,'' he says, ``how they wrote that Raisa went shopping in
London with an American Express card, when we didn't even know what
a credit card was. Or when they spread rumors that Raisa was
spending great sums of capital to compete with Nancy Reagan, when
in fact all of her wardrobe and personal things were made for her
by Tamara Makeeva in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his hotel room, he shows me the telegram sent by Bill
and Hillary Clinton: ``For a long time we have admired your grace
and composure while supporting unprecedented changes throughout the
courageous political activity of your husband. ...''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, after his turn at Raisa's bedside, Gorbachev is
walking in the garden during a light summer rain that sets off a
warm, fragrant mist. His voice comes, as if he is thinking out
loud, but also with the resolute quality of a decision: ``Raisa
said something very important to me today. 'When I recover _ if I
recover _ let's find a little house somewhere, near the sea, where
there's a lot of sunshine, so that we can enjoy these last years we
have.' And I thought to myself: 'Yes, she's really right. It's time
to live out fully, with our feelings, these last years we have.'''

   Cape May Ferry Undergoes Renovations &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The five ferries that transport 1.3 million passengers and
400,000 vehicles annually between the beach resorts of Cape May,
N.J., and Lewes, Del., have undergone $54.4 million in
renovations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The boats vary in size and amenities; the flagship, the Twin
Capes, is modeled after luxury European ferries, with four
passenger decks, a 100-seat glass-enclosed dining area, outdoor
cafe, full bar, children's play room and sun deck.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the five vessels can carry up to 1,000 passengers and
100 vehicles. Renovation of the terminals is next, and is expected
to be finished by summer 2001. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trips across the Delaware Bay last about 70 minutes, and the
company offers many excursion packages combined with ferry passage
from either side. New this season are the Doo-Wop '50s Tour, which
combines a ferry trip with a trolley ride and a walking tour of the
1950s architecture of Wildwood, N.J., and a package with a trip to
the Discoversea Shipwreck Museum in Fenwick Island, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Other combination excursions include destinations like the Cape
May County Park and Zoo, the Cape May historic district, and in
Lewes, the Historical Society Museum, the Cannonball House Maritime
Museum and stops of historic interest along the way.
</P>
<P>
   There are also packages to Fort Delaware and a Family Fun
cruise, a three-hour round trip with music, food, clowns and other
entertainment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reservations 24 hours in advance are recommended. Contact (800)

   Innovative Theater Reopens in Paris &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a year of renovation to overhaul the stage and refurbish
the facades and public spaces, the Theatre du Chatelet in central
Paris will reopen in October. Founded in 1862 under Napoleon III,
the Chatelet introduced Parisians to works by Debussy, Ravel and
the Ballets Russes, and is still considered one of France's most
innovative and eclectic showcases for the performing arts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Jean-Pierre Brossmann, formerly of the
Opera National de Lyon, the 1999-2000 season promises to be no
exception. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the operas, new productions created at Chatelet include
Luciano Berio's ``Outis,'' Ferruccio Busoni's ``Doktor Faust'' and
Mozart's ``Mitridate,'' as well as the opening Oct. 8 of twin
premieres of Gluck's lyric tragedies ``Orfeo ed Eurydice'' and
``Alceste'' (the latter sung by Anne Sofie von Otter).
</P>
<P>
   Presented on alternate nights, both premier productions are
directed by Sir John Eliot Gardiner and staged by Robert Wilson.
Thomas Hampson and Jose van Dam are to star in a co-production of
``Hamlet'' with the Toulouse Opera next June. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dance highlights include contemporary takes on 19th-century
classics: Maurice Bejart uses his childhood memories of Marseilles
in ``The Nutcracker Suite'' Dec. 10 to 31; John Neumeier's ``Swan
Lake,'' Feb. 19 to 27, is transferred to the Bavarian court of
Louis II.
</P>
<P>
   In a co-production with Lincoln Center and the Barbican in
London, the soprano Jessye Norman and the dancer Bill T. Jones take
center stage on May 10 with ``How! Do! We! Do!,'' which has been
described as a personal journey, set to Berlioz, Schubert and
spirituals, reflecting the lives of both artists. &QL;

   Nobody comes off a trans-Atlantic flight looking better than
when he got on it. Realizing this, British Airways has added a spa
at its Terminal Four arrivals lounge at Heathrow Airport outside
London. Capsules on the floor release the scent of freshly mown
grass and sea breezes; there's a small gym, power-jet showers and
massages for scalp, neck, shoulders, hands and feet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The spa, operated by Molton Brown, manufacturer of skin-care
products, is available free only to British Airways passengers
flying in Club or first class or on the Concorde. For more

<P>
   Kenya has revoked its visa requirements for Americans staying 30
days or less. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tourism in Kenya has been hurt by the August 1998 bombing of the
United States Embassy in Nairobi, and street crime in Nairobi,
Mombasa and beach resorts. The State Department urges travelers to
avoid political demonstrations because ``violence can be
spontaneous and unpredictable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kenya has also lifted the visa requirements for citizens of 14
other countries. The Kenya consulate and tourist office is at 424

<P>
   Call it This Old Treehouse. A familiar attraction at Disneyland
in Anaheim, Calif., the Swiss Family Treehouse, has received a new
look to take advantage of the success of Disney's latest animated
film. Tarzan's Treehouse, part of Adventureland, begins with a trip
up a wooden staircase made of items salvaged from a ``shipwreck.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After crossing a rope bridge, visitors enter the homes of
Tarzan's human parents and his ape foster mother, Kala. Live
animals and costumed characters from ``Tarzan'' will visit the
treehouse as well. For information, call (714) 781-4565. &QL;

   A Stretch of Prairie Inside the Beltway &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An American Prairie exhibit featuring bison, prairie dogs and
native plants opened last month at the National Zoo in Washington.
The exhibit is part of a multimillion-dollar zoo renovation that
includes a new restaurant, gift shop and plaza. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are two bison calves (male and female) and a prairie dog
colony. The animals share the new 46,000-square-foot exhibit with
110 species of grass and broad-leafed plants known as forbs. Some
of the grasses can grow more than six feet high. The forbs include
many brightly flowering species that will be in bloom in summer and
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the plants are indigenous to the prairie that once
covered about 40 percent of the United States; only about 1 percent
of that land remains undeveloped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 photographs and illustrations explain prairie
ecology and man's role in shaping that environment. A Prairie Plant
Discovery trail highlights traditional ceremonial, dietary and
medicinal uses of many of the plants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bronze sculptures of prairie dogs and magnesium bas-reliefs of
plants are accompanied by Braille as well as regular English
labels. The exhibit is also wheelchair-accessible. Only a low
concrete border separates visitors from the prairie dogs; the bison
are behind an electrified fence. &QL;

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Surgeons have stapled stomachs for more
than 30 years, but a gutsy singer has given the operation _ and her
insides _ international exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Those who could stomach the sight of incisions were able to see
singer Carnie Wilson's gastric bypass live on the Internet last
week. (Wanna view the video? Log on: www.adoctorinyourhouse.com)
</P>
<P>
   Wilson _ 31-year-old daughter of Beach Boy Brian Wilson, a TV
talk-show host and the zaftig third of singing group Wilson
Phillips _ said she opted for the surgery after exhausting all
other weight-loss methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've struggled with it mentally and physically for all these
years, and I've reached my limit,'' she said in a pre-surgery
Internet chat. At 5-feet-4, she weighed close to 300 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 58 million adults feel her pain; that's how many
Americans are considered overweight. About 32,000 choose surgery to
shed pounds each year, according to the American Society for
Bariatric Surgery. (Bariatrics refers to the study and treatment of
obesity.)
</P>
<P>
   To go under the staple, patients must be at least 100 pounds
overweight and have at least two obesity-related physical problems,
such as hypertension or gall bladder disease.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies will sometimes help pay for the operation,
which costs about $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bariatric surgery involves reducing the size of the stomach. In
the most common gastric bypass, the surgeon uses staples or bands
to create a small stomach pouch. The small intestine is rerouted
and attached to the pouch so that food will bypass the first two
segments of the small intestine. This reduces calorie and nutrient
absorption.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the smaller stomach, the patient will feel full
faster. ``If they try to overeat, it's painful, and they'll usually
throw up,'' says Georgeann Mallory, executive manager of the
American Society for Bariatric Surgery. In the days following the
operation, ``two or three crackers with cheese feel like
Thanksgiving dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of weight loss occurs within the first two years, and
after five years, the loss of excess weight can reach 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the pounds don't drop off magically. Patients must learn to
eat smaller meals and exercise regularly. ``It's a lifelong
follow-up,'' says Dr. Robert K.T. Liem of Lake Worth, who since
1981 has performed about 90 gastric bypasses and gastroplasties (a
simpler version of stomach stapling).
</P>
<P>
   Several South Florida surgeons specialize in the treatment of
obesity. One option for finding a local doctor is to visit the
American Society for Bariatric Surgery Web site at www.asbs.org. Or
call the society's national headquarters at (352) 331-4900.

THE NEW KID IS GARCIA, BUT WOODS IS THE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Reflecting on Sunday's dramatic back nine of the
Professional Golfers' Association Championship, Ben Crenshaw said
what many people were thinking. ``That,'' said Crenshaw, ``was the
future of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. Ryder Cup captain is correct, then golf will be the
beneficiary. All four of golf's major championships this year had
remarkable endings, and Sunday's one-stroke victory by Tiger Woods
over Sergio Garcia had enough electricity to light up Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Woods, who has won two majors at age 23, battle Garcia,
a charismatic 19-year-old from Spain with special gifts, left
everyone who witnessed the special afternoon at Medinah Country
Club eager to see their careers unfold. The public has been
clamoring for a rivalry, most notably Woods versus David Duval, who
recently clashed in a made-for-TV event, but who have never settled
things on the back nine of a major.
</P>
<P>
   But while the wait for Woods versus Duval continues, the arrival
of Woods versus Garcia was as compelling as golf gets. Give Woods
credit for his victory, further proof that as good as Woods is, he
is only getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Give Garcia credit for putting magic in the air, for thrilling
the crowd with incredible shots, and for putting the world on
notice that another gifted young player will have much to say
during the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was the low amateur at the Masters, then turned pro the
following week. Since then, he has won the Murphy's Irish Open,
finished second at the PGA Championship and Loch Lomond, finished
third at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic and clinched a spot on the
European Ryder Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   How does Garcia assess his year? ``Probably a little over my
expectations,'' he said. For Woods, this year has not been beyond
expectations, but it has been superb.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has won five tournaments this year, including four in the
United States. But Sunday's victory was special, because it was a
major, because Woods appeared so in control of his game and his
emotions and because he showed an improved short game and a
developing patience that have made him a more complete player.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Woods' last seven starts. He tied for seventh at the
Byron Nelson, he won The Deutsche Bank Open, he won The Memorial,
he tied for third at the United States Open, he won the Motorola
Western Open, he tied for seventh at the British Open and he won
the PGA Championship. That is the most consistent stretch of Woods'
career, the most consistent stretch in golf this year.
</P>
<P>
   Woods enters this week's Sprint International as the PGA Tour's
1999 leading money winner ($3.25 million), and he has regained the
world's No. 1 ranking. But winning the PGA brings Woods halfway to
the career grand slam well before his 25th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole week was a great week,'' said Woods. ``Winning
majors is not easy to do. I was having a lot of fun. It was tough,
but it's always nice to play with all the pressure on the line. If
you don't like that and you don't have fun doing that, I don't know
why you're even out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' toughness allowed him to hold strong when Garcia reduced
a five-stroke deficit to one with five holes to play. And the
victory reaffirmed that Woods is the world's best player, that when
he raises his game to a higher level, everyone else is left looking
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger carries the weight of the world on his shoulders, yet he
handles it,'' said Crenshaw. Woods and Garcia will meet again at
next week's World Golf Championships NEC Invitational in Akron,
Ohio. And next month, Woods and Garcia will be on opposite sides at
the Ryder Cup, as Woods hopes to help the United States win the
event, held every two years, for the first time since 1993.
Meanwhile, Garcia has earned his PGA Tour card for next year, and
he will have to decide how much he wants to play in the United
States, as well as in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say anything before probably November or
December,'' said Garcia of his schedule for next year. ``I want to
enjoy what I have right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods should enjoy what he has as well _ another major, and the
confidence of knowing that the hard work he has put into his game
has paid dividends. There is no shortage of young players ready to
lead golf into the next century. But Woods is still the playing
leading the pack. &QL;

 &HT;    Carnie Wilson's Internet surgery was a last resort

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Surgeons have stapled stomachs for more
than 30 years, but a gutsy singer has given the operation _ and her
insides _ international exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Those who could stomach the sight of incisions were able to see
singer Carnie Wilson's gastric bypass live on the Internet last
week. (Wanna view the video? Log on: www.adoctorinyourhouse.com)
</P>
<P>
   Wilson _ 31-year-old daughter of Beach Boy Brian Wilson, a TV
talk-show host and the zaftig third of singing group Wilson
Phillips _ said she opted for the surgery after exhausting all
other weight-loss methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've struggled with it mentally and physically for all these
years, and I've reached my limit,'' she said in a pre-surgery
Internet chat. At 5-feet-4, she weighed close to 300 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 58 million adults feel her pain; that's how many
Americans are considered overweight. About 32,000 choose surgery to
shed pounds each year, according to the American Society for
Bariatric Surgery. (Bariatrics refers to the study and treatment of
obesity.)
</P>
<P>
   To go under the staple, patients must be at least 100 pounds
overweight and have at least two obesity-related physical problems,
such as hypertension or gall bladder disease.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies will sometimes help pay for the operation,
which costs about $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bariatric surgery involves reducing the size of the stomach. In
the most common gastric bypass, the surgeon uses staples or bands
to create a small stomach pouch. The small intestine is rerouted
and attached to the pouch so that food will bypass the first two
segments of the small intestine. This reduces calorie and nutrient
absorption.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the smaller stomach, the patient will feel full
faster. ``If they try to overeat, it's painful, and they'll usually
throw up,'' says Georgeann Mallory, executive manager of the
American Society for Bariatric Surgery. In the days following the
operation, ``two or three crackers with cheese feel like
Thanksgiving dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of weight loss occurs within the first two years, and
after five years, the loss of excess weight can reach 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the pounds don't drop off magically. Patients must learn to
eat smaller meals and exercise regularly. ``It's a lifelong
follow-up,'' says Dr. Robert K.T. Liem of Lake Worth, who since
1981 has performed about 90 gastric bypasses and gastroplasties (a
simpler version of stomach stapling).
</P>
<P>
   Several South Florida surgeons specialize in the treatment of
obesity. One option for finding a local doctor is to visit the
American Society for Bariatric Surgery Web site at www.asbs.org. Or
call the society's national headquarters at (352) 331-4900.

AUDIT SUPPORTS UMASS MONITORING OF RESEARCH FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A state audit released Monday found that the
University of Massachusetts has the proper procedures to ensure its
researchers are not earning disproportionate riches from
taxpayer-funded projects that they then spin off into commercial
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   But the university does need to more carefully monitor how well
it is following those procedures, the audit noted.
</P>
<P>
   State Auditor Joseph DeNucci undertook the audit following a
Globe Spotlight report last year showing how inventors used state
money and worked on university time to develop products and then
channeled those products to private companies.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the stories alleged, the new companies reaped
significant profits for the researchers-turned-entrepreneurs, but
not much for the university.
</P>
<P>
   The audit examined whether the university had proper and
equitable policies governing how to distribute profits from
inventions developed in state-financed laboratories and whether
those policies were being followed.
</P>
<P>
   It found that the policy developed by the university's Office of
Commercial Ventures and Intellectual Property (CVIP) was comparable
to ones at other private and public research universities.
</P>
<P>
   UMass officials said they were happy with the auditor's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that the auditor seems to recognize that the
commercialization of intellectual property is being done in a way
that looks out for the university's best interest and the
taxpayers' best interest,'' a UMass spokesman, Robert Connolly,
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under UMass guidelines, an inventor receives 30 percent of any
net income from the invention while 15 percent goes to CVIP and 40
percent is siphoned to the university's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor's share at the University of Washington, for
example, is on a sliding scale from 30 to 100 percent, and at
Michigan State University it is on a sliding scale from 15 to 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
   CVIP has generated $3.9 million in revenue since it opened in
1995, the audit stated. Of that, DeNucci's office examined six
commercial agreements with revenues totaling $684,753.
</P>
<P>
   The report released Monday cited only a few instances in which
UMass had not followed its policy. In two agreements, a researcher
was actually underpaid for research, earning only 25 percent of the
net profit, or $17,500, which was $3,500 less than required by the
university's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   UMass also failed to distribute $1.1 million earned from 1996 to
1998 to the university system's Worcester campus. As a result the
Worcester branch could not reinvest, meaning the campus could not
redirect that money into new research projects.
</P>
<P>
   But DeNucci's office said it was satisfied the university is
working to resolve these problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to help promote innovation and research, but certainly
we want to make sure the taxpayers are being protected, as well,''
said Glenn Briere, a spokesman for the auditor. ``Certainly the
UMass policy seems fair in comparison to other research
universities. (At other universities) it's actually possible to
pocket the whole 100 percent of the profit. Under this policy, it's
impossible for a UMass researcher to pocket even the lion's share
of the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spotlight series also looked at how the drug Respigam was
developed in the state's Public Health Laboratory, then transferred
to a private company with little of the profit returning to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Another Spotlight report looked at how federal dollars go to
developing expensive pharmaceuticals _ with drug companies earning
huge profits _ that most consumers can not afford.
</P>
<P>
   The audit released Monday, however, did not look at Respigam or
how National Institutes of Health funding for drugs is spent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the university said in a written response to the audit,
``We are hopeful that the day is near when a member of our faculty,
a state employee, receives millions of dollars in royalty payments
from research activity developed at the University.''

DON'T BE A JETHRO; TRY THIS SALARY-CAP FANTASY GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you say it's easy to run an NFL team, especially staying
within the constraints of a salary cap?
</P>
<P>
   You say if Jerry Jones can do it, any old Jethro can do it.
</P>
<P>
   FoxSports Online has a game for you.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the fantasy football games coming down the pike this
fall, FoxSports Online has one of the more creative with its Salary
Cap Challenge (www.foxsports.com/fantasy/football).
</P>
<P>
   While most fantasy games offer competition based on players'
skills, FoxSports Online's salary-cap game tests a fantasy owner's
ability to make sound financial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In Salary Cap Challenge, Jerry Jones wannabes can select a
roster of 10 players _ each with assigned values _ with the
objective of staying under an imaginary salary cap of $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to earn the most fantasy points over the course of
the regular season, which starts Sept. 12 and ends Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are simple. The players' fantasy points will be the
team's points for that week. Lineups can be changed or carried over
each week. Owners can play individually or they can create a
private league or join a public league.
</P>
<P>
   The tough part, of course, is staying under the imaginary cap
and coping with the various twists. A player's salary can change
from week to week, depending upon their latest week's production.
However, once a player is signed, his salary will be locked in
until you cut him. Once cut, the player's salary will change to the
market value. Players who do not play for a week for any reason
have a salary fixed at 80 percent of their previous week's salary,
until they play again. Carmen Policy wannabes will be disheartened
to find no room for creativity, no way to manipulate the cap with
contract restructuring or backloaded bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly scores will be combined for a final score, and the winner
will be declared Fox Salary Cap Challenge King. Weekly winners
receive a Fox prize pack, including a nifty Terry Bradshaw
Claymation doll.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the prizes, then Salary Cap Challenge is one way to
see if you have what it takes to be an NFL team owner _ or if
you're a Jethro.
</P>
<P>
   OVER THE CAP: The Salary Cap Challenge can also be played as
Coach's Clipboard at Sandbox.com, a company based in Fairfax, Va.,
that develops online fantasy games. The advantage of playing at
Sandbox.com is the grand-prize winner collects a satellite
television system with service, definitely better than a Claymation
doll.
</P>
<P>
   CBS SportsLine plans a similar game on its Commissioner.com
site. For $19.95, team owners will receive a customizable site
where they can view live scoring on game day.
</P>
<P>
   YOU CAN SECOND-GUESS CHAN GAILEY: For anyone who has sat around

Crenshaw names Lehman, Pate as at-large Ryder Cuppers
<TEXT>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw wants fire and passion on his Ryder Cup team, which
explains why a guy nicknamed ``Volcano'' was one of his captain's
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pate, whose once-volatile temper has become more dormant
with maturity, was a somewhat surprising pick by Crenshaw on
Monday. Pate joins Tom Lehman as the two at-large players filling
out the 12-man U.S. team that will try to break the second-longest
American losing streak in Ryder history Sept. 24-26 at The Country
Club near Boston. The 10 other members made the team by earning
more Ryder Cup points over a two-year stretch than any other
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was expected to be one of Crenshaw's picks. He has
performed well in two previous Ryder Cups and has worked diligently
this year to recover from off-season shoulder surgery. Lehman has
not had a full week at home since May 28, and the hard work paid
off with his selection by Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Pate caught many by surprise. Fred Couples, Bob
Estes, Hale Irwin, Lee Janzen and Chris Perry all received
consideration, Crenshaw said. But it was Pate's competitive fire,
plus his steady play this year, that swayed the captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would walk through a wall for you if you asked him to,''
Crenshaw said of Pate. ``I have talked to so many people in the
past week, getting their ideas and feeling them out. His name was
always there. He's a player's player. Everybody enjoys being in his
company. That's a part of him, and I think that's important. A
little lightness is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he has the competitive attitude to go with it. Players and
caddies know when a player is playing well. There was always that
same, incessant thing I was hearing that this man is playing
confident. You envision him playing that golf course, and I think
it's a good fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate, 38, has a good history at The Country Club. He tied for
third there in the 1988 U.S. Open. He said the choice didn't catch
him off-guard as much as the timing of the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I was in bed when Ben called me about 11 o'clock
(Sunday night),'' Pate said. ``I didn't know what to expect. I
wanted to be on this team very badly. I needed a little help to
make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate, who missed virtually a full year in 1996 when he suffered
injuries in a car wreck (he attributes that time off to his
learning to deal with his temper), said his ability to play well in
match-play situations probably worked in his favor as a captain's
choice. He finished fourth in the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship in February, beating Davis Love III and Couples, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it was a big factor,'' Pate said. ``I've always loved
match play. Something about it makes me focus better. I seem to
swing a little more freely because one bad hole doesn't cost you 10
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Lehman, 40, was virtually assured a month or more
before the qualifying for the team ended Sunday at the PGA
Championship. His game should be a perfect match to The Country
Club, and his steady demeanor can be paired with just about anybody
else on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about his diligence, his strength and his
character,'' Crenshaw said. ``I really tried to determine who was
playing best right now. Tom's playing well, and everybody knows he
exudes leadership. He's a confident and determined player.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lehman: ``It's an honor to be on the team, whether you
finish first (in points) or 12th. My game has gotten better and
better since the shoulder surgery (in November). That I haven't
been home since May 28 speaks for itself. That's a lot of time
practicing and working, and it was all because I wanted to be on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for Steve Pate to have that injury with the wrist and to
come back and be a Ryder Cupper again is a testament to his
perseverance. I feel very good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   There also were some bad feelings for players who were omitted
from the team.
</P>
<P>
   By picking Pate, who was in the 1991 Ryder Cup, and Lehman, who
has been in two of them, Crenshaw will have only one Ryder
``rookie'' on his team. David Duval is the only U.S. player without
any Ryder Cup experience.
</P>
<P>
   The European team, conversely, could have as many as six
first-timers. Their team will be finalized on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In picking his final two choices, Crenshaw said: ``You can only
do what you think is right for the team. And it was extremely
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   He made four of what he called ``the most important and
dreaded'' phone calls he's had to make when he notified Couples,
Irwin, Estes and Janzen that they were not going to be Ryder
Cuppers.
</P>
<P>
   Couples' situation was particularly difficult. He has been on
the past five Ryder teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an emotional standpoint, Freddie Couples was probably the
hardest call to make,'' Crenshaw said. ``The whole world loves
Fred. He just hasn't played enough this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you know that even if he plays mediocre for Fred, that's
tremendous for somebody else. But I just felt if you look at these
players and the way they're playing, Steve Pate was most intent and
determined about his game right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Fred, a little rust (probably hurt). Look at his schedule
this year. How many times has he played? (Only six tournaments
since the Masters.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred Couples always wanted to be on this team. I know he may
be a little sad, because this is a fighter who has been on five
Ryder Cup teams. This would have been his sixth. But I really think
it boils down that he didn't play as well as he'd have liked in
this two-year period and this year in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw reiterated that he couldn't be happier with the makeup
of his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``No captain could look down this list and not say, `These are
the best,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman added that now it's a matter of Crenshaw's players
getting tough to break a two-Cup skid against the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our team will be extra focused on winning,'' Lehman
said. ``It's a pretty stacked team. As long as we get ourselves
focused, I think we'll be pretty tough to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know for me personally, I'm sick and tired of being on a
losing team.''

TEEN PLEADS GUILTY IN BURNING DEATH OF TEXAS MAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EMORY, Texas _ A Rains County teen-ager pleaded guilty Monday to
helping burn to death a 53-year-old man last May and agreed to
testify against an accomplice who was arrested Saturday near
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leaders had alleged that the crime was racially
motivated since the victim was black and both defendants are white,
but in entering his guilty plea, Michael Shane Marr, 16, said it
was the result of a drug deal gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   H.W. Walker was found dead June 2 in a wooded area near Emory,
about 70 miles east of Dallas, a month after he was killed. Autopsy
reports still have not been released by the Dallas County medical
examiner's office, but his body had been badly burned.
</P>
<P>
   Marr was arrested the day after the body was found.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently agreed to plead guilty and name his accomplice to
avoid being certified to stand trial as an adult. He was sentenced
to 40 years and could be eligible for parole in three years.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, authorities arrested Brian Long, 24, at his
mother's house in Spring. He was returned to Rains County and
charged with murder. His bond was set at $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Seated beside his court-appointed attorney Monday, Marr listened
as Judge Robert Newsome read an ``agreed statement of facts'' that
outlined how Walker was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Marr picked Walker up May 2, took him to a secluded area and
tied him up, according to the statement. He later picked up Long in
Lone Oak and, with a can of gas obtained from Long's home, drove to
where he had left the victim. They set Walker afire and drove back
into town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was burned to death,'' said Marr's court appointed
attorney, William McDowell. ```Did you set him on fire?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No sir,'' Marr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew it was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from McDowell and District Attorney Frank
Long, Marr said he had met Long through a friend a month or two
before the murder. In May, he said, Long told him, ``I need to kill
a couple of people over a bad drug deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Marr said he had known Walker for three or four years and
frequently visited in his home, as did other youths in the area. He
said Walker supplied them with drugs and alcohol and performed oral
sex on them. He said Walker bought and sold narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not racially motivated, was it?'' McDowell asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Several civil rights leaders who had raised the ``hate crime''
issue were in the courtroom and later expressed dissatisfaction
with the way the case was handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This had nothing to do with justice,'' said Lee Alcorn, former
president of the Dallas NAACP. ``He should have been certified as
an adult. This is a misuse of the plea bargain. They had enough
evidence on that kid to try him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Glenn, a regional NAACP representative in Greenville, said
he still thinks the crime has the marking of racial motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the South,'' he said, ``burning has been a traditional way,
along with lynching, of carrying out hate crimes. They spent more
time smearing Mr. Walker than they did investigating these
culprits.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's sister, in a statement read to the court, also
criticized the handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This matter has moved too quickly and too secretly for us to
have confidence in this process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As to the claims of sexual abuse, she said, ``If my brother was
molesting these boys, why didn't the parents do something about it?
I believe these people are lying.''
</P>
<P>
   In sentencing Marr to 40 years, Judge Newsome explained to him
that he will first be in the custody of the Texas Youth Commission.
If he is not paroled before being transferred to the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice, he will have to serve at least 20
years of his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Long, known as ``Tattoo'' because of the markings on his arms,
has been charged with murder and could receive life in prison. Some
of his tattoos reportedly have white supremacist themes.

APPELLATE COURT BACKS CONVICTIONS IN TERROR PLOT
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: An expanded story is scheduled to move by 10 pm ET) 
(rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court panel Monday upheld the
convictions of Omar Abdel-Rahman and nine others for plotting to
blow up New York City landmarks, validating the prosecution of
terrorists under a Civil War-era seditious conspiracy law that
makes it illegal to wage war against the government.
</P>
<P>
   The foiled plot involved bombing the United Nations, the Lincoln
and Holland Tunnels and other landmarks in what was to have been a
campaign of terror six years ago. Although the evidence showed that
Abdel-Rahman was not involved in the day-to-day planning of the
bomb plot, the government argued that his exhortations to his
followers amounted to directing the violent conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   It was this unusual prosecution of the Egyptian religious figure
known for his fiery Islamic sermons and strong denunciations of the
United States and Israel that led critics to assert that
Abdel-Rahman was being punished for his political and religious
views, in violation of the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But the three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said that ``freedom of speech and of religion do not extend
so far as to bar prosecution of one who uses a public speech or a
religious ministry to commit crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence justifying Rahman's conviction,'' the court said,
``showed beyond a reasonable doubt that he crossed this line. His
speeches were not simply the expression of ideas; in some instances
they constituted the crime of conspiracy to wage war on the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's 165-page decision, which was unanimous, was not the
first to uphold the constitutionality of the seditious-conspiracy
law, which was last used successfully in the mid-1980s against
members of a group of Puerto Rican nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   But the unsigned decision by Judges John O. Newman, Pierre N.
Leval and Fred I. Parker, offers the most extensive analysis and
endorsement yet of the use of the law in prosecuting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said Monday
through a spokesman that the court's decision was ``an important
milestone in the continuing efforts by this office and the FBI's
Joint Terrorist Task Force to apprehend and prosecute those who
commit and plot to commit terrorist acts to the fullest extent that
our laws allow.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling may also help lay the groundwork for an eventual
prosecution of Osama bin Laden, the fugitive Saudi exile being
sought in the deadly bombings last year of the U.S. Embassies in
Tanzania and Kenya. Although bin Laden has not been charged with
seditious conspiracy, aspects of the cases are similar; Ms. White's
office has also accused bin Laden of issuing religious declarations
that have incited his followers to attack Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who handled Abdel-Rahman's appeal, Ramsey Clark, said
Monday night that neither he nor his client had read the opinion
and would not comment on it. Lynne F. Stewart, who defended
Abdel-Rahman in the trial said ``we are bitterly, bitterly
disappointed.''

ALCOA MAKES $4.2 BILLION HOSTILE BID FOR REYNOLDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alcoa Inc., the world's largest aluminum producer, announced a
$4.2 billion unsolicited all-cash bid Monday for the rival Reynolds
Metals Co., a day after Reynolds spurned Alcoa's friendly
half-cash, half-stock offer.
</P>
<P>
   To turn up the pressure, Alcoa also said it would take its
hostile bid directly to Reynolds' shareholders and ask them to
remove the company's board, which opposed Alcoa's first overture.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa's move comes as consolidation sweeps the global aluminum
industry. Last Wednesday, a two-continent, three-company deal was
announced when Alcan Aluminium of Canada, Pechiney SA of France and
Alusuisse Lonza Group AG of Switzerland agreed to a $17.6 billion
merger. That deal would still leave Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, in
the No. 1 position globally.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday's three-way global deal, however, left Reynolds,
based in Richmond, Va., without a merger partner, and Alcoa swiftly
moved the same day with a $65-a-share half-cash, half-stock offer
for Reynolds. When the Reynolds board rejected that offer on
Sunday, Alcoa turned it into an all-cash deal Monday. With the
assumption of debt, the offer totals $5.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   This global mating dance is being brought on by global
overcapacity and aluminum prices that have hit five-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   In an exchange of news releases Monday, the two companies staked
out their positions: Alcoa said it preferred to negotiate a
``mutually agreeable merger'' rather than a hostile one and said
the proposed union would not run afoul of antitrust laws because an
Alcoa-Reynolds merger was ``complementary'' and ``not
anti-competitive.'' Reynolds said Alcoa's offer was ``designed to
serve Alcoa's own interest and not the interests of Reynolds
Metals' shareholders. Shareholders need take no action at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a battle between the two companies, some analysts expect
that Alcoa could well prevail, that the antitrust issues would be
minimal and that the posturing taking place right now is simply a
negotiating strategy designed to come to a price both sides can
live with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reynolds seems willing to be a bride and, as a matter of fact,
for some time has been looking for a groom,'' said Manford Mallory,
an analyst with Research Capital Corp., a brokerage firm in
Toronto. ``This is the proverbial courtship response that you would
expect. If Reynolds said anything else, you'd be surprised. It's
like the bride saying that the diamond is too small.''
</P>
<P>
   The current merger wave appears to have been started by Alcoa
when it bought Alumax Inc., the nation's No. 2 producer, last year
and then proceeded to snap up aluminum producers in Spain, Italy
and Hungary. These moves increased Alcoa's market share and cut its
costs, all of which stepped up the competitive pressures on other
global producers.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Billick, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read, said the
three-way international deal was the ``orphaning of Reynolds,''
increasing the need for the company to find a merger partner.
Billick does not view the Reynolds statement as an outright
rejection: ``It's the posturing by both sides. I think what's going
on behind the scenes is that they are trying to come to some
agreement. Reynolds knows it has to sell and Alcoa has to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Reynolds fell 43.75 cents Monday, to $68.9375, while
those of Alcoa rose 37.5 cents, to $66.875. Last year, Reynolds had
$5.9 billion in sales, compared with $15.4 billion for Alcoa.
</P>
<P>
   Adding additional intrigue is the hovering by McCook Metals,
owned by the Michigan Avenue Partners investment firm in Chicago,
which wrote to Reynolds last Thursday expressing interest in buying
the company. That offer, however, did not contain a price, except
to say that McCook would pay more than Alcoa. There was no
indication of the source of McCook's financing for the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest risk in this deal is that Reynolds shareholders
reject a $65 bid because they want a bigger number,'' said John
Tumazos, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``And Reynolds'
board rejects $65 as inadequate, and then there might not be
another date for Reynolds at the big dance.''
</P>
<P>
   For Alcoa, the bid for Reynolds is seen as a can't-lose
proposition: If Alcoa prevails, it will get aluminum assets at a
relatively modest price that analysts say Alcoa can can exploit
through its considerable financial muscle and proven cost-cutting
skills. And if the company does not get Reynolds, it would remain
dominant in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Alcoa gets Reynolds at a good price, or if they don't get
it at all, they still retain their No. 1 position,'' said Andrew
Howard, an analyst in the London office of Dresdner Kleinwort
Benson. ``Alcoa is the benchmark against which the industry is
measured. It generates the highest returns. It is the most
profitable. If all the mergers that have been talked about in the
last few weeks suddenly stopped, Alcoa would still be all those
things.''

LATEST EQUIPMENT WILL MAKE BALLISTICS IDENTIFICATION EASIER IN
TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By S.K. BARDWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Harris County Sheriff's Regional Firearms
Laboratory is the first in Texas to acquire a state-of-the-art
ballistics identification system from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The Integrated Ballistics Identification System, or IBIS, is an
electronic imaging system that captures, stores and compares
identification patterns of fired projectiles and cartridges that
are as unique to firearms as fingerprints are to people.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's firearms lab, operating in space donated by the
Harris County Medical Examiner's Office, offers its services to
Southeast Texas law enforcement agencies. Harris County, which
includes most of Houston, has 3.1 million people and is the largest
county in Texas. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Those services include comparison and identification of fired
bullets and cartridges from crime scenes, testing clothing for
gunshot residue, evaluating the mechanical condition of weapons,
and examining toolmark, footwear and tire impressions. The lab also
provides expert testimony.
</P>
<P>
   IBIS makes ballistics identification and comparison easier,
faster and more efficient, said lab manager Matthew Clements.
</P>
<P>
   Projectiles and cartridges from crime scenes are brought to the
lab, where their images are recorded and stored by IBIS, Clements
said.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons recovered at crime scenes or from suspects also are
brought to the lab and test-fired, providing images of their fired
projectiles and cartridges that are stored in the IBIS.
</P>
<P>
   Each time an image is stored, the computer searches its database
for similarities, which are then examined to determine whether they
were fired from the same weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County Sheriff Tommy Thomas said remote sites at
sheriff's departments in nearby Brazoria, Jefferson, Galveston,
Montgomery and Fort Bend counties, as well as at the Houston and
Pasadena police departments, can share electronic information with
the Harris County IBIS hub, creating a Southeast Texas firearms
identification network.
</P>
<P>
   The IBIS hub also can share images with IBIS hubs across the
country, Thomas said. The nearest hub is in New Orleans, where 107
matches, or ``cold hits,'' with test-fired weapons have been
obtained since May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, the ATF said, 67 IBIS sites will be
operating in the United States and at 11 overseas sites.

<P>
   Q. Are there one-day tours from Paris to some of the World War
II beaches and sites in Normandy? _ P. Avery Edgerton, Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   A. At least two Paris tour-bus companies organize such trips,
although they're available only during the warmer months.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Vision offers tours from early May through late September,
with buses leaving Tuesday and Saturday mornings at 7:15 and
returning at 8:30 p.m. The $130 price, figured at about 6 francs to
the dollar, includes a guided tour, in English, of about six D-Day
beaches, including Omaha Beach, where American forces landed on
June 6, 1944, to confront one of the deadliest battles of D-Day,
and Utah Beach, another American landing site.
</P>
<P>
   The tour also goes to the Normandy American Cemetery near Omaha
Beach, where some 9,400 military personnel are buried, and visits
the Musee du Debarquement in Arromanches. Lunch at an 18th-century
farmhouse is included. Information: (33-1) 47.42.72.31.
</P>
<P>
   Cityrama offers a similar trip, which runs from early April
through the end of September. Tours leave Paris on Tuesdays and
Saturdays at 7:15 a.m. and return at 9:30 p.m. The itinerary
includes visits to the major D-Day beaches and a guided tour of the
the Memorial Peace Museum in Caen. The price is $140. Information:
(33-1) 44.55.61.00. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cityrama also offers a two-day visit, which ventures into
eastern Brittany as well, and costs $327, including accommodations
in Caen.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to explore the area on your own, trains for the
Calvados and Manche departments of Normandy leave from the Gare
St.-Lazare in Paris, while destinations more to the west, toward
Mont St.-Michel and Granville, are served from the Gare
Montparnasse. The price of a round-trip ticket to most of these
places is about $50 and the trip takes at least two hours.
Information (33-8) 36.35.35.35.
</P>
<P>
   For information about Normandy, call the Regional Tourist Office
at (33-2) 32.33.79.00. Information is also available in English on
the regional Web site at www.normandy-tourism.org. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm a Jane Austen enthusiast and would like to go to some
places in England connected with her life and her novels. _ Millie
P. Dranskard, Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are several places associated with Jane Austen that you
can visit.
</P>
<P>
   In Bath, where the Austen family lived from 1801 to 1805, a new
2,000-square foot Jane Austen Center recently opened at 40 Gay St.
Among the exhibits are Austen's letters to her sister Cassandra as
well as costumes worn in the BBC production of ``Persuasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The center is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; admission is
$6.50, $3.25 for children. The center also offers 90-minute walking
tours _ with stops at such places as the Austens' house at 25 Gay
Street and Queens Square, which figures in ``Persuasion'' _ on
Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. The cost is $5.65, children $4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-century six-bedroom family house where Austen spent
most of the last eight years of her life in the Hampshire village
of Chawton, 47 miles west of London, is another must-see. These
were the years when ``Sense and Sensibility,'' ``Persuasion'' and
other novels were published.
</P>
<P>
   The house was restored 50 years ago and contains original family
furniture, including the author's round oak writing table. The
donkey carriage _ Austen's principal mode of local transportation _
is also on display. The house is open daily from 11 a.m. to 4:30
p.m. Admission is $4, children 8 to 18, $1. Telephone and fax:
(44-1420) 83262. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lyme Regis in Dorset, 150 miles from London, is the seaside town
featured in ``Persuasion,'' and where Austen herself spent many
holidays. For information on Austen sites there _ including the
Jane Austen Memorial Garden _ call the Tourist Information Center
(44-1297) 442138.
</P>
<P>
   Two publications that will help you find places linked to Austen
are a Map of Literary Britain, published by the British Tourist
Authority, and ``Jane Austen'' by Victor Lucas, a 20-page booklet
that documents the author's life from her birth in 1775 in the
village of Steventon in Hampshire, about 50 miles west of London,
to her death in 1817 at 8 College Street in the city of Winchester,
also in Hampshire. You may order the $4 booklet through Pitkin
Unichrome, telephone (44-1264) 409206; fax (44-1264) 334110;
www.britguides.com. The map is available from the British Tourist
Authority's New York office, 551 Fifth Ave., Suite 701, New York,
N.Y. 10176; (800) 462-2748. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm trying to find an educational tour to Morocco that
departs in March or April next year. _ Ron Petrohf, Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. Among the possibilities are the following tours, both led by
guides with expertise in various aspects of Moroccan history and
wildlife. The prices include round-trip air fare from New York,
most meals, accommodations in deluxe hotels and ground
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Natural and cultural history are the focus of the Massachusetts
Audubon Society's 17-day tour to Morocco, which departs on March
11. Morocco's Atlantic coast is rich in birdlife, and participants
will spend several days bird-watching in coastal wetlands and dunes
near the mouth of the Wadi Ksob near Essaouira and in the Sous
Massa National Park, where flamingos and Barbary partridges make
their home.
</P>
<P>
   In Marrakech, there will be demonstrations of Berber
horsemanship, a visit to the souk and dinner in embroidered tents.
A tour of Fez will include the spice and dye markets in the medina;
a visit to the sand dunes of Erg Chebbi starts off with a camel
ride at sunrise. Other stops include Casablanca, Erfoud, Taroudant,
Ouarzazate and Tinerhir. The cost of the tour is $4,995 per person,
based on double occupancy. Information: (800) 289-9504.
</P>
<P>
   Smithsonian Study Tours is offering a 15-day Mysteries of
Morocco tour, which focuses on history and culture. Stops include
Rabat, where participants will visit the unfinished 12th-century
Tower of Hassan and the Royal Palace; the ruins of Volubilis, a
Roman outpost, with a well-preserved Triumphal Arch; the walled
city of Meknes; and Marrakech, where the tour goes to the
Jemaa-el-Fna market and the Majorelle gardens. Tangier, Meknes,
Fez, Erfoud and Ouarzazate are among the other places that will be
visited. The tour costs $4,870. Information: (202) 357-4700.

ACTING GLOBALLY ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can the Internet end extreme poverty? There's reason to hope it
can at least help.
</P>
<P>
   One ambitious theory is that the Internet could revolutionize
awareness of global poverty and turn awareness into action. Forget
the fleeting images on nightly news broadcasts. A Web site could
provide vivid details _ facts, video clips, and firsthand accounts,
along with background reports and progress updates.
</P>
<P>
   Once Web surfers understood the problems in, say, Kenya, China,
or Guatemala, the site could suggest actions to take _ potentially
obliterating the helplessness some people feel when they learn
about world tragedies from the news. The technology would surpass
that of existing sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also could help countries that missed the first
industrial revolution join the information revolution. If they had
an education, people in extreme poverty could even be employed
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in this vision are the United Nations Development
Program and Cisco Systems Inc., which makes networking hardware and
software systems. In September, the two will launch an antipoverty
Web site called NetAid.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that no one _ not even the UN and Cisco _ knows
exactly how NetAid will work. At worst it could be a one-hit
wonder, remembered more for a kickoff concert _ in New York,
London, and Geneva _ set for October.
</P>
<P>
   But if it is even marginally successful, NetAid could provide
insights into the Internet's vast and largely unexplored
noncommercial uses. Just as television showed Americans the worst
attacks on the civil rights movement, the Internet could show
cyber-citizens the worst world poverty _ and persuade them to
demand and work for justice.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be exactly what Newt Gingrich imagined. But NetAid
is an eloquent example of how the former speaker's old cry for a
laptop in every lap _ backed by food, financial aid, and education
_ could change the world.

   What's the point of going to the movies if they show
commercials? A person might as well stay home and watch television
_ the seats are free, the popcorn is cheaper, and the clicker can
zap the pitchmen.
</P>
<P>
   But common sense has never held sway in the world of
advertising, where the latest gimmick is the ``cinemad.'' Mad is
right. Running after the snack bar spots and before the coming
attractions, these ads hawk everything the tube does at home,
including TV shows, and some theater chain executives see this as
the most irresistible source of revenue since the jumbo, colossal
soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake. (So was the jumbo, colossal soft drink.) The reason
people go to the movies is to watch the movies in reasonably
comfortable seats _ in air conditioning if they are escaping summer
heat _ and in front of a nice screen. Holding hands with a date in
the dark may still be a draw too, but not as much as it was 40
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   People go to the movies to watch a story unfold so they can
laugh, cry, scream, or groan together. Movie houses, like the
stage, offer much-needed communal entertainment in an increasingly
isolating society. Even if the film is some ridiculous tale about
space aliens on rollerblades, the audience still shares it, and
that kind of experience doesn't happen at the computer or in front
of the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers and cinema managers say the new commercials are a
form of entertainment, made in the tradition of Super Bowl spots,
and that viewers will enjoy them. That logic misses a key bit of
psychology: Super Bowl audiences don't have to sit still for the
message, and if they happen to catch a clever ad, they think
watching it was their idea. But a movie audience is trapped and
just might feel used, especially with ticket prices creeping up
toward $10.
</P>
<P>
   What's next _ a word from our sponsor right at the exciting
part? Or maybe full-length feature commercials will simply take
over at what will eventually become known as ``the cinemad house.''
In a culture where everything is for sale, anything is possible.

BRIEF FARE DEALS DOING AN ENCORE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22) 
</HEADLINE>

   Some air fares for fall and winter, and a few Mediterranean
cruise prices, are making Europe seem nearly irresistible. The low
air fares were presented as short term earlier in the summer, but
industry officials said that an oversupply of flights to Europe had
developed with the delivery of new planes, and the airlines began
gradually backing away from higher prices to try to fill the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is bringing a bonanza for travelers. Northwest was
first with the fare cuts, but others have followed. As seats fill,
of course, the good buys will fade away. But not many have so far.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the cruise specials were sometimes described as an
effort to recover from the period of the Kosovo bombardment, when
many Adriatic itineraries were changed. But various circumstances,
including itinerary changes caused by the late delivery of new
vessels, have created the cruise bargains.
</P>
<P>
   One example of an excellent price is Swissair's Newark-Basel
round-trip economy fare of $330, plus taxes, a promotion to
introduce its new A-330 Airbuses on the daily service, which has
been operating for a year or so.
</P>
<P>
   This fare will be sold at least until Friday, with travel
possible until Dec. 15. The new planes have 224 seats, with 166 in
economy class; the route to Basel, a pharmaceutical center, is
heavily used by business travelers. Swissair: (800) 221-4750.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a small selection of some other good buys running into
the fall. These are available from travel agents, the airlines or
on the Web. The prices do not include departure taxes or Customs
fees.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines had a fistful of choices. Many of these fares
for midweek travel were originally due to expire 10 days ago, but
continue to be available until Aug. 31 _ and that deadline is not
immutable, either. Those looking for even lower rates can buy them
now for travel in November and December, but blackouts apply to the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   These are all seven-day advance-purchase fares. Tim Smith, a
spokesman for American, said that the seats available for these
prices were limited, but that many flights in the winter showed
wide availability. Weekend flights, which are $50 more round trip,
fill up faster than midweek ones.
</P>
<P>
   On American, a New York-to-Frankfurt economy ticket is $588 for
midweek travel, $638 otherwise. For travel from November to
mid-March, with a holiday blackout, fares are $330 and $380.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-London (Heathrow) economy round-trip fares for travel on
American into October are $448 to $498, depending on the day of the
week. For later travel, holidays excluded, Bostonians who want to
swap their dark city for a dark city on the Thames can do it for
$318 to $368. Nonstop flights from Dallas-Fort Worth, American's
headquarters, to London go into Gatwick: these fares are $588 and
$638 until October, $428 and $478 after that.
</P>
<P>
   New York to Paris until October is $458 and $508; for November,
these are $368 and $418.
</P>
<P>
   Continental has a new route from Cleveland to London (Gatwick).
Until Aug. 31, round-trip tickets for midweek travel between Sept.
5 and Oct. 30 cost $588. For travel from Oct. 31 to March 31, with
a blackout from Dec. 17 to Jan. 2, midweek round trips drop to
$428. Also on Continental, midweek travel between Newark and Paris
in September and October is $458. For November, it is $368.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways put some promotional fares on the market Aug.
10, with the last purchase date Aug. 31. All of the line's 22
United States cities were involved. Jill Donaldson, vice president
for leisure marketing, said that the best buys involved New York
departures. To London (Heathrow), the midweek fares begin at $448;
to Paris, $458; to Rome, $588.
</P>
<P>
   Midweek fares from Los Angeles or San Francisco to London begin
at $638. From Chicago, the midweek fare is $558. Dallas-Fort Worth
to London is $588, and Atlanta-London, $608. Travel on these fares
is possible between Sept. 5 and Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that any other airline flying the routes mentioned
above is offering similar prices. Ask.
</P>
<P>
   An airline new to the United States, AirEurope, is offering
flights between Kennedy Airport in New York and Venice, with a
continuation to Pisa. To announce itself, it is offering $425
round-trip fares for travel until the end of September. The price
is available until Aug. 30. The line was having some ticketing
difficulties at first and apparently could not process credit card
sales at Kennedy, only cash. There is a long wait on the line's
number: (888) 999-9090.
</P>
<P>
   On the Mediterranean cruise front, Holland America made schedule
changes because delivery of its new vessel, the Volendam, was
delayed. As a result, a 12-night cruise on the Rotterdam from
Venice to Istanbul on Sept. 22 is being deeply discounted. Stewart
T. Chiron of the Cruise Line, a big agency in North Miami Beach, is
offering this cruise for $2,399 a person, including port charges
and air fare from New York and other United States and Canadian
cities, based on double occupancy in an inside cabin.
</P>
<P>
   The least expensive outside cabin is $2,899. The ship visits
Romania and Greece before reaching Turkey. These prices were $1,500
higher when they were first posted.
</P>
<P>
   Another value Chiron cited in the European cruises was a
12-night trip aboard the Norwegian Dream of Norwegian Cruise Line
that leaves Istanbul Oct. 23 and ends in Civitavecchia, the port
for Rome, on Nov. 4. This cruise is also sold with air fare from
the East Coast to Istanbul and home from Rome. Prices per person,
based on two people in an inside cabin, start at $2,652. These
prices were formerly $2,600 higher.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Turkey and Italy, this cruise stops in Israel,
Egypt and Greece. Chiron said the Norwegian Dream was shifted from
the Black Sea to this Holy Land itinerary because the line found
two similar cruises were selling well. The Cruise Line: (800)
244-7447.
</P>
<P>
   There are pluses and minuses to prices that include air fare.
The flight may take a roundabout route. But if the flight was
booked by the cruise line and is delayed, the line usually takes
responsibility. On the other hand, if a cruise starts or ends in
Venice, and the traveler wants to stay over, arranging the air trip
separately can be an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents can quote prices with and without the air fare. A
12-night Royal Caribbean Mediterranean cruise in Chiron's roster
was $2,649 with air fare; $1,599 without.
</P>
<P>
   When competition drives down air fares, do Internet shoppers
learn it quickly, or do they have to fill in the boxes for
departure date and return date to get a picture? Suzi LeVine, a
product manager for Microsoft Expedia, said clients did not have to
fill in all the blanks.
</P>
<P>
   Her company's home page at www.expedia.com posted a ``big sale''
notice on Aug. 3, with samples also on the front page. The page
gave all the caveats, which at that point included an Aug. 13
closing date for the sale. A fare tracker, a service users can sign
up for, will look for the best fare, she said.

THE LOSS OF LAMAR ALEXANDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite serving as secretary of education in George Bush's
Cabinet, Lamar Alexander was able to present himself legitimately
as a Washington outsider in the 1996 presidential race because the
core of his experience was in Tennessee. He had been a two-term
governor, president of the University of Tennessee, and a
successful businessman. Alexander ended up battling two others _
publisher Steve Forbes and TV personality Pat Buchanan _ for the
outsider track, but the nomination went to the consummate insider,
Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Republican Party is headed toward the nomination of a
candidate with minimal electoral experience.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's eight years as governor represent three more years
in elective office than those held by the top five finishers in
Saturday's Iowa straw poll combined. George W. Bush has been
governor of Texas for less than five years. Forbes, Elizabeth Dole,
Gary Bauer, and Buchanan are not encumbered by any political
victories at all.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander ended his candidacy with a statement notable for its
graciousness and brevity. The Republican campaign is diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Bush will earn the GOP nomination. Attorney Tom Rath of
Concord, N.H., Alexander's leading supporter in the Granite State,
said that Bush ``hasn't made a mistake yet.'' But he added that the
time to judge people is when things aren't going well, and, with
Bush, ``that's what we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment is on target. Because of his massive spending _
challenged only by Forbes _ combined with a very early primary
calendar, Bush may be able to secure the nomination in the first
few months of next year. But no Republican president since
Eisenhower has won on his first attempt. What happens if problems
develop in Bush's candidacy?
</P>
<P>
   Alexander should have been able to offer one answer. A system
that spits out a candidate of his caliber six months before the
first convention delegates are chosen threatens to limit the
choices left to most voters in a most troubling manner.

POLICE AND THE GUN TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four times in five months, gunmen opened fire in public places,
killing and maiming unsuspecting people and spreading terror across
the country. Whether the motive was hatred of fellow students,
resentment at bad investments, racism, or anti-Semitism, the common
denominator was that all the killers used handguns. America is a
nation that bemoans violence even as it allows virtually free
trafficking in these weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The culture of handgun ownership is so pervasive that police
departments &UR;  &LR; routinely trade in their old guns for resale. IN
Boston, Police Commissioner Paul Evans had second thoughts about
selling them in this country, so Boston's old weapons now go to
foreign markets, where they can still be put to illegal uses. It
would be better if they were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the guns allegedly used by Buford O. Furrow Jr. to kill a
mail carrier and wound children at a Jewish day care center in Los
Angeles came from the Cosmopolis, Wash., Police Department. The
police chief said he had to trade in his old guns to pay for new
ones. If a car is traded in, its ownership is tracked. Not so with
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Many police weapons end up at gun shows. Dylan Klebold and Eric
Harris, the Columbine High School killers, got their four weapons
at one of these shows. Only one was a handgun, probably not from
the police, but the availability of police guns legitimizes the
sale of all guns.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, running for the Democratic nomination for
president, wants to register all handguns in the country. Vice
President Al Gore would like to license handgun owners. Why not do
both? Guns ought to be regulated with the same care as motor
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Murderers could also resort to rifles, as the Columbine shooters
did. (Furrow was also armed with at least two.) But handguns,
smaller and lighter, made it easier for Mark Orrin Barton to kill
nine people in Atlanta and for Benjamin Nathaniel Smith to murder a
black man and a Korean in the Midwest. Government should make it
harder to obtain these weapons, whether by keeping track of them or
by destroying ones no longer of use to the police.

 Electronic Systems Challenge Market-Makers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Online trading has forever changed the way investors buy stock. Now
an equally momentous electronic revolution is transforming what
happens after your broker gets your order.
</P>
<P>
   Under the traditional system, brokers forwarded orders from
retail customers to middlemen firms, known as market-makers on the
Nasdaq Stock Market and specialists on the New York Stock Exchange.
These firms bought stock from an investor at one price and sold
that stock to someone else at a higher price, profiting from the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new breed of computerized trading systems is bypassing
these middlemen. Called electronic communications networks, or
ECNs, these systems automatically match buy and sell orders. If you
want to buy a stock at a given price and someone else wants to sell
at that price, an ECN will instantly carry out the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Why should investors care what happens behind the scenes once
they put their order in? Industry experts say, in many cases, using
computers instead of middlemen makes it faster and cheaper to buy
stock. And it's more likely that your order will get carried out at
the price you want.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, computerization encourages longer trading hours
since no one has to sit by a telephone to process your order. That
means that investors on the West Coast will have greater
opportunities to trade after the traditional 1 p.m. Pacific Time
closing of U.S. stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are winners,'' said James Punishill, an electronic
commerce analyst at Boston's Forrester Research. ``They benefit
from improved pricing and reduced spreads.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you want to buy 100 shares of Yahoo, a
market-maker might quote you a price of $133.06 a share. If you
want to sell, the market-maker might offer to pay $132.94 a share.
</P>
<P>
   An ECN might be able to match a buyer and seller without a
middleman, completing the trade at $133 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The shock waves triggered by the rise of ECNs and other
electronic trading systems are causing a seismic upheaval on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of two investors to, in effect, meet each other
and trade without a third party getting in between them is a
revolution,'' said Greg Smith, an electronic brokerage analyst at
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. ``It's definitely producing a sense of urgency
among the established players.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the challenge of ECNs is mainly directed at
traditional middlemen, whose services they often replace. But they
could soon take on not only individual firms but the traditional
stock markets themselves, including the NYSE, Nasdaq and San
Francisco's Pacific Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Two ECNs, Island, affiliated with online broker Datek
Securities, and Archipelago, which is bankrolled by online broker
E-Trade and old-line brokerage Goldman Sachs and other firms, have
actually applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to be
given the formal status of stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow them to process stock orders without going
through one of the other exchanges and put them in direct
competition with the established stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   ECNs ``could potentially give the NYSE a 30 percent haircut,''
that is, take away nearly a third of the exchange's business, said
Archipelago spokesman Jamie Selway.
</P>
<P>
   And the Pacific Exchange's 60 stock specialists would face
competition from ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the threat, NYSE, Nasdaq and the Pacific Exchange,
are floating plans to jettison their membership structures and turn
themselves into publicly held, for-profit corporations.
</P>
<P>
   On the theory that if you can't lick 'em, you should join 'em,
officials of the exchanges have said they want to affiliate with
ECNs. The result would be new-generation exchanges that use both
middlemen and ECNs to process orders.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting from a membership to a corporate structure would make
it easier to overcome opposition by their members, many of who are
representatives of precisely those middlemen firms threatened by
ECNs. &UR;  &LR; Members would get stock in the newly formed corporations to
compensate them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, old-line brokerages such as Goldman Sachs and online
powerhouses such as Charles Schwab Corp. and E-Trade are buying
stakes of ECNs to ensure they get a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are just under a dozen ECNs operating as
members of traditional stock markets, principally Nasdaq. ECNs
control about 30 percent of Nasdaq's volume, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist's
Smith calculates.
</P>
<P>
   ECNs receive orders from retail and institutional brokers. If
they can't match them up within their own systems, they send out
stock quotes through the Nasdaq system and pass off orders to other
Nasdaq members.
</P>
<P>
   Archipelago, for example, actually executes 60 percent of its
orders outside its own system in the larger Nasdaq market, Selway
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet, the stock trading company owned by Britain's Reuters
Group, began operating an ECN several years ago that today is the
largest by a wide margin. Island holds the No.2 spot, with other
players far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Archipelago and Redibook, backed by Schwab and mutual fund giant
Fidelity Investments, have huge organizational muscle behind them
and could emerge as leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, ECNs' share of NYSE trading is infinitesimal because
of exchange rules that make it difficult for them to operate there.
But that's certain to change.
</P>
<P>
   Once Archipelago and Island are granted exchange status, they
will have access to stock quotation systems that will allow them to
trade NYSE stocks. ``The biggest benefit of being an exchange is
the ability to trade (NYSE) stocks,'' said Island general counsel
Cameron Smith.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, a cheaper, faster system such as ECNs should sweep
everything before them. Market-makers should go the way of
stenographers and telegraph operators, whose jobs were eliminated
by new technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, though, it doesn't work out that way. In the
first place, ECNs only handle limit orders, that is, orders to buy
a designated number of shares of stock at a specific price.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are systems for matching orders at specific prices,
they can't accept market orders, that is, orders to buy shares at
whatever price is available on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, ECNs only work well when there are plenty of buyers
and sellers who want to trade a specific stock. That makes it easy
for them to complete trades of widely held stocks such as Microsoft
or Dell Computer. But for stocks that trade sporadically, it can be
tough to match orders.
</P>
<P>
   That's where market-makers come in. Part of their job is to be
the buyer or seller of last resort, promising to fill orders for
investors willing to meet the price they quote.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you need guaranteed liquidity, only a market-maker can
provide that,'' said Gary Craft, an independent San Francisco
electronic commerce analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ECNs have existed in embryonic form for years. But they got a
huge boost 21/2 years ago when the SEC issued new rules on how
stock orders and price quotes should be handled.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure investors got the best possible prices, the new
rules required market-makers to display orders on computer systems
accessible to all market participants. Before that, market-makers
kept some orders virtually secret in order to complete the trade
themselves rather than take the chance that someone else in the
market would offer a better price.
</P>
<P>
   Once rules took effect requiring marketwide display of quotes,
ECNs became open systems that could swap orders with any market
participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly an outgrowth of those rules,'' said Island's
Smith. ``The change gave us the ability to have our quotes
reflected in the entire market.''

 Hewlett Tops Expectations On Earnings  
 By Henry Norr 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Hewlett-Packard topped Wall Street's expectations for the fourth
consecutive quarter yesterday, reporting a 37 percent jump in net
earnings on 11 percent revenue growth for its fiscal third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Palo Alto technology colossus reported net earnings of $853
million for the period, which ended July 31, compared to $621
million for the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding a one-time charge of about $60 million (4 cents per
share) for the spin-off of HP's noncomputer businesses, earnings
amounted to 85 cents per share, up from 58 cents a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call had predicted earnings of 80
cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Net revenues for the quarter were $12.2 billion, compared with
$11 billion last year. While U.S. revenues grew a modest 8 percent,
revenues from international markets climbed 14 percent, with the
recovering Asia Pacific region setting the pace at 24 percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite continuing price pressures in the PC market, HP said
revenues and profits from its computer products hit all-time highs.
The company cited record shipments of consumer PCs, solid growth in
its commercial PC lines and particular strength in PC notebooks and
servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last quarter went pretty much the way we expected,'' said
Daniel Kunstler, an analyst at J.P. Morgan in San Francisco, ``but
it seems to me their momentum going into the next quarter is very
strong, particularly with printers and certainly with PCs.''
</P>
<P>
   Results from the businesses HP plans to spin out under the name
Agilent Technologies were included in the parent company's
third-quarter results. Overall, those businesses recorded 8 percent
growth compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Agilent filed a preliminary prospectus yesterday
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in preparation for an
initial public offering later this year. The document, which will
be amended later, does not yet specify how many shares will be
offered, when or at what price. A spokesman said the company plans
to carry out the IPO before the end of the year, assuming the SEC
approves.
</P>
<P>
   According to the prospectus, HP plans to distribute all of its
common shares in the spin-off to HP stockholders by the middle of
next year. Under a ``private letter ruling'' from the Internal
Revenue Service, the document says, distribution of the Agilent
shares will be free of federal income tax for both HP and its
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Agilent IPO is expected to be one of the largest in U.S.
history. The businesses that will make up the new company,
including groups that make test and measurement devices,
specialized semiconductors, and health-care and chemical-analysis
equipment, recorded revenues of almost $8 billion in fiscal 1998,
according to the prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent last week named Gerald Grinstein as nonexecutive
chairman of its board. He currently holds the same position at
Delta Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings announcement came after the stock market closed.
Earlier, HP shares closed at $110.31, up $4.31.

CRESCENT AGREES TO RECAPITALIZATION OF CHARTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JIM FUQUAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Crescent Real Estate Equities and its
affiliate, Crescent Operating, agreed on Monday to a
recapitalization of Charter Behavioral Health System, the
struggling psychiatric hospital operator.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, the two Crescent entities agreed to
defer this month's rent owed by Charter. Crescent Real Estate owns
Charter's facilities, and Crescent Operating owns 50 percent of
Charter Behavioral.
</P>
<P>
   Charter, which has one Fort Worth-area location, disclosed last
month that it was not hitting its financial targets and could fail
to pay the rent on its facilities. Charter also disclosed that it
was considering selling or leasing some facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Crescent Real Estate, which is based in Fort Worth and was
founded by investor Richard Rainwater, ventured into mental health
care in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In what essentially was a bet that psychiatric health services
were about to recover from a long slide, Crescent Real Estate paid
$400 million for 92 Charter hospitals and gained a 50 percent
interest in Charter. The other 50 percent has been owned by
Magellan Health Services, the nation's largest psychiatric managed
care organization.
</P>
<P>
   Crescent Real Estate retains ownership of Charter's 88
hospitals. Crescent Operating was spun off from Crescent Real
Estate in 1997, and took over Crescent Real Estate's stake in
Charter's operations at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the complicated recapitalization plan
announced Monday, Magellan will transfer to Crescent Operating all
but 10 percent of its share in Charter, including its rights to
Charter's corporate name and other intellectual property. Magellan
also will not seek any other fees owed it by Charter.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Charter's management will have the ability to
acquire up to 30 percent of Charter, and Crescent Operating will
explore moving at least part of its Charter holdings into
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Stevens, Crescent Operating's chief operating officer,
said that Crescent does not plan to own a controlling interest in
Charter when the transaction is completed.
</P>
<P>
   That will ensure that Crescent Operating does not have to carry
Charter's operating losses on its books, he said. The value of
Crescent's stake in Charter was written down to zero last year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Charter's woes are symptomatic of a decade-long decline in the
financial status of the nation's mental health industry. In the
early 1990s, government agencies and the corporations that pay the
bills rebelled against skyrocketing behavioral health costs and
widespread scandals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1991 Texas Utilities spent 41 percent of its
employee health benefits on mental health services. By 1997,
aggressive cost-control efforts lowered that to just 3 percent,
roughly the U.S. average.
</P>
<P>
   The Hay Group, an Arlington, Va., actuarial and benefits
consultant, said the value of behavioral health benefits declined
in 1998 for the 11th consecutive year. The average benefit in 1998
was down 54.7 percent from 1988, Hay said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems, in its
latest survey, said in June that the average inpatient stay at a
U.S. mental health hospital was 10.2 days in 1997, an 11.3 percent
decline from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of patients rose 15.6 percent. That means more
people were treated as outpatients.
</P>
<P>
   Even those patients are receiving fewer visits. The average
outpatient experienced eight visits, down from nearly 8.7 visits in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Bender, president of the National Association of
Psychiatric Health Systems, said the figures show that ``dollars
are disappearing from the behavioral healthcare system.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Crescent Operating said it earned $200,000, or a
penny a share, in the year's second quarter, down from $1.9
million, or 16 cents a share, a year ago. Revenues were $173
million, up 62 percent from the same quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its interest in Charter, Crescent Operating owns hotels,
resorts, refrigerated warehouses, real estate developers and an
equipment sales and leasing business.

 Tech Heavy Hitters Join Open-Access Fray
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Some of the biggest names in the high-tech industry are coming out
in support of AT&AMP;T and ExciteAtHome in the fight over ``open
access.''
</P>
<P>
   The Information Technology Industry Council, which includes
heavy hitters such as Cisco Systems, Apple, 3Com and Intel, sent a
letter to the Federal Communications Commission, saying it favors a
national policy that would not force AT&AMP;T to open its cable TV
lines to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some additional technology companies, such as General
Instrument, WebMD and Broadcom, also plan to ask the FCC to avoid
imposing open access.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and Redwood City's ExciteAtHome are locked in a fierce
battle with America Online and other Internet service providers
over who should control AT&AMP;T's cable TV lines. The ISPs and some
consumer groups want the government to force AT&AMP;T to lease space on
its wires to other companies that want to offer high-speed Internet
service via cable TV lines.
</P>
<P>
   Several cities, including San Francisco, have been debating
whether to impose ``open access'' as a condition of approving
AT&AMP;T's purchase of TCI and MediaOne. So far, just Portland, Ore.,
and Broward County, Fla., have approved open access, while San
Francisco decided to delay a decision until December.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and ExciteAtHome have asked the FCC to intervene and set a
national policy _ one that opposes open access. The companies argue
that local municipalities don't have the right to impose open
access and say that forcing AT&AMP;T to open its cable TV lines will
delay the development of new technology.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has been trying to drum up support for its position since
June, when a federal judge in Portland ruled that city officials
could force AT&AMP;T to share space on its cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is now on appeal at the U.S. Court of Appeals in
San Francisco, which will hold hearings in October. Meanwhile, the
parties involved have been filing ``friend of the court'' briefs in
support or against the Portland ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the FCC filed a brief in support of AT&AMP;T's position.
ExciteAtHome plans to file a similar brief today, company officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, a coalition of consumer groups sent a letter
to the FCC several weeks ago, saying that consumers would benefit
from open access because they could get high-speed Internet service
from a number of providers, not just AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter to the FCC, Information Technology Industry
Council President Rhett Dawson said regulators should not impose
restrictions on companies that want to offer high-speed Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because cable Internet access is an emerging service and the
providers currently lack market power in the Internet access
market, they should not be subject at this time to open network
requirements,'' the letter said.

OHIO SUPREME COURT VOIDS LEGAL LIMITS ON DAMAGE SUITS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Accelerating an intense battle in state courts across the
country over laws to curtail damage suits, the Ohio Supreme Court
on Monday struck down that state's sweeping 3-year-old law.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio case was the latest in a series of legal confrontations
over the constitutionality of laws passed to rein in what critics
say are frivolous lawsuits and excessive damages. Like laws passed
in most states in recent years, the Ohio law sought to cap damages,
limit the time in which certain suits could be brought and
otherwise curtail damage suits. But the Ohio law was one of the
most comprehensive in the nation, with scores of provisions making
it harder to file and win such civil suits.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio case, brought by trial lawyers and a labor group, had
drawn widespread national attention from legal and business groups
because it was one of the most sweeping attacks on such laws.
</P>
<P>
   The impassioned ruling Monday highlighted a developing stalemate
in many states between courts and legislatures over the new laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very notion of it threatens the judiciary as an
independent branch of government and tears at the fabric of our
Constitution,'' the Ohio Supreme Court's 4-to-3 majority said of
the way the law was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law was approved even though the Ohio Supreme Court had
struck down similar measures in earlier cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio justices Monday joined an increasing number of state
courts in blocking the new laws as violations of fundamental state
constitutional guarantees like the right to a jury trial. The
Supreme Courts of Illinois, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Oregon and
other states have all reached similar decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rulings are being made entirely on state
constitutional grounds, supporters are left with little chance of
appealing to the United States Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But in many states the battle over the civil justice system has
become a permanent part of the political landscape, with
legislators continuing to enact the measures and business groups
continuing to push for them.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Republican leadership of Ohio's Legislature issued a
statement that said changing the civil justice system ``is the
prerogative of the Legislature'' and that there was significant
support for a new bill imposing limits on lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Chamber of Commerce said the ruling put the state on a
```blacklist' of states that have a judicial climate hostile to
business development.'' The chamber rebuked the four justices in
the majority for what it said was a campaign by them ``and the
personal injury lawyers who bankroll their campaigns to establish
the court as a super legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   In her forceful majority decision Monday, Justice Alice Robie
Resnick, a Democrat, said the Legislature had ``boldly seized the
power'' of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The majority Monday included the court's two Democrats, Justice
Resnick and Francis E. Sweeney Sr., and two of the court's five
Republicans, Andrew Douglas and Paul E. Pfeifer, who often vote
with the Democrats on issues concerning personal injury law. The
majority cast the decision as a critical defense of the concept of
separation of powers and of the power of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting justices said the majority had violated
fundamental legal principles by agreeing to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   Although lawsuits typically arise out of one individual's claim
for damages from another, the Ohio case began as a suit filed by
the Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers and the state AFL-CIO against
local judges. It sought to block the judges from using the 1996
law, contending that it was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In his dissent, the state's chief justice, Thomas J. Moyer, said
the decision ``affronted our constitutional system of government.''
The two other Republican justices who dissented were Deborah L.
Cook and Evelyn Lundberg Stratton.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of efforts to limit liability suits said the ruling
was a significant setback. Victor E. Schwartz, general counsel of
the American Tort Reform Association, a business group, said the
ruling gave added strength to the critics' strategy of attacking
the laws through state Constitutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to say to any person interested in tort reform that
state tort reform is a hollow victory because of this state
constitutional `trap' that has been set up,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert S. Peck, legal director of the Association of Trial
Lawyers of America, which has fought the new laws, said the ruling
was a sign of progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the largest and most Draconian `tort reform' law ever
enacted,'' Peck said. ``And here you have the Supreme Court of Ohio
recognizing that it tramples on the rights of people.''

REGISTRY HEADQUARTERS SERVING FAVORITES, SOME SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Registry of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   To the average citizen, the name means dismal, crowded offices
with harsh flourescent lights and grueling lines.
</P>
<P>
   But the Registry's headquarters is another world: a quiet,
upscale Copley Plaza office with a sweeping view of the Back Bay,
with tony neighbors such as Bain Capital, Liberty Mutual, and the
German consulate.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a place where people in the know, including state
legislators, can can skip the long lines and depressing mood of the
Registry's branch offices and renew their licenses in a matter of
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast is especially striking as criticism of the Registry
has reached a fever pitch. Public anger over long lines and poor
service contributed to the recent ouster of Registrar Richard D.
Lyons, and has prompted a movement on Beacon Hill to reform the
agency. Public hearings at which motorists have blasted the state
agency are scheduled to continue this week in Sturbridge and
Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Registry's Washington Street branch on a recent
afternoon, Boston resident Pedro A. Reyez summed up the prevailing
public mood with an assessment of his 75-minute visit for a new
license plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awful,'' Reyez said. ``The worst.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a different story in the plush Copley Place tower, however,
which houses the Registry's administrative offices. There, a
handful of staffers are able to provide, in a few minutes, license
renewals and other services performed _ often done at a snail's
pace in the Registry's grim branch offices.
</P>
<P>
   Rent for the carpeted, sun-drenched office is $38.08 per square
foot, totaling a hefty $3,893,180 annually _ or more than six
percent of the agency's estimated fiscal year 1999 expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who can get service at the Registry's Copley Place
office is a mystery. The office has quietly acquired a
word-of-mouth reputation as a place where people who are connected,
or who drop the right name, can escape a soul-crushing day spent in
line with the teeming masses.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdoctal evidence bolsters the notion that the Registry
headquarters takes care of connected insiders. One person seeking
to renew a license there recently was asked by a receptionist, ``Do
you know somebody here?'' Another recent visitor, mentioning a name
provided by a friend, was able to renew her license in a matter of
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And a source familiar with the Registry said the Copley office
is ``where all the legislators go'' to conduct Registry business.
</P>
<P>
   Several legislators interviewed, however, said they had no
knowledge of special services at Copley Place.
</P>
<P>
   Further Globe inquiries have produced various explanations of
the office's policy. Twice, a Globe reporter was told by a
receptionist that the office only serviced employees of the Copley
Place mall, on Wednesday afternoons only.
</P>
<P>
   But Registry spokeswoman Donna Rheaume said the office, although
not equipped to handle large numbers of people, is open to the
general public. ``We try not to turn anyone away,'' Rheaume said.
</P>
<P>
   The office does allow Copley Place employees to conduct Registry
business on Wednesday afternoons ``as a courtesy,'' Rheaume said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't advertise it as a license renewal station,'' added
Registry director of driver licensing Herb Osgood. But Osgood said
the office tries to help all visitors. ``If we have someone who can
run the machine . . . and we have someone available we will try to
service them.''
</P>
<P>
   Osgood said his staff of five in the Copley office primarily
services people who have problems that can't be solved at the
agency's branch offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we handle are people who are having problems in the
system,'' Osgood said, including confusion over motorists'
identity. ``We correct the record. We're the only ones who can go
in and declare that . . . a misidentification is occurring and
you're getting tickets that don't belong to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Copley Place headquarters handles official license plates
for state legislators. Osgood said some legislators also recieve
service there that ordinarily would require them to visit a branch
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the legislators choose to go to their local branches,
but if they're here conducting Registry business we'll try to
accomodate them,'' Osgood said.
</P>
<P>
   The Registry's administrative offices have been based in Copley
Place since 1995, when a court order forced the agency to evacuate
its former headquarters after it was deemed to be in a ``sick
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lyons resigned as registrar last month under intense
criticism over Registry service and planned office relocations in
Lawrence and Lowell. He will step down on Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several legislators are leading efforts to evaluate
and reform the agency. State Senator James P. Jajuga, a Democrat of
Methuen, and Representative Timothy J. Toomey Jr., a Democrat of
Cambridge, have been holding hearings around the state to gather
public opinion on the Registry. And earlier this month state
Senator Susan Tucker, an Andover Democrat, filed legislation that
would create a commission to propose improvements to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Also, three former Registry employees filed a lawsuit last week
against Lyons and two other Registry officials claiming
discrimination and violation of state whistleblower laws. Rheaume
said she would not comment on pending litigation.

   More than 500 colleges and universities have made deals with
commercial companies to run campus Web sites and electronic mail
services. As a result, students who want to check course outlines
or send e-mail will become an audience for advertisers. The move

HEWLETT SAYS EARNINGS TOP EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For the fourth consecutive quarter,
Hewlett-Packard Co. has reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street
analysts' estimates. Hewlett-Packard officials who announced the
figures Monday also predicted the company would see 11 to 13
percent revenue growth in the next quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Hewlett-Packard said it had filed a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the
initial public offering of its subsidiary, Agilent Technologies
Inc. Agilent is the name given to Hewlett-Packard's original
business in electronic test and measurement gear as well as its
medical imaging and patient monitoring business. Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter and Goldman, Sachs are the lead manager and co-lead
manager for the offering.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard reported its results after the close of the
market. But positive news was broadly anticipated, and
Hewlett-Packard shares closed at $110.25, up $4.25, on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was altogether a good quarter,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an
analyst with J.P. Morgan. ``The place where they just blew the
cover off the ball was in printers. They've got very little to
apologize for.''
</P>
<P>
   For its third fiscal quarter, which ended July 31,
Hewlett-Packard reported earnings of $853 million, or 81 cents a
diluted share, up 37 percent compared with $621 million, or 58
cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Revenues rose
11 percent, to $12.23 billion, compared with $10.98 billion in the
third quarter of fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Third-quarter 1999 earnings reflect about $60 million in costs
associated with the spinoff of Agilent. Without these costs,
Hewlett-Packard said, it would have earned 85 cents a diluted
share. Analysts had expected the company to report earnings per
share of 80 cents, according to First Call Corp., although the
so-called whisper number, which analysts communicate to clients
orally, had been as high as 87.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we committed, we've stayed focused on profitable growth,
and we're beginning to see the results of our efforts to convert
orders into stronger revenue growth,'' Lewis Platt,
Hewlett-Packard's chairman, said in a statement. ``Profit results
were even better. A number of businesses improved their
profitability, with overall profitability exceeding our
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarter was Platt's last as chief executive of
Hewlett-Packard. Last month, the company named Carleton Fiorina
president and chief executive. Platt continues as chairman. Edward
Barnholt was named president and chief executive of Agilent.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard said its computer-product revenue had grown to
record levels and helped take profits to a new high, driven by
strong sales of personal computers and servers using Intel
microprocessors. Hewlett-Packard's printing and imaging businesses
saw double-digit revenue growth compared with that in the quarter a
year earlier. The company said revenue growth in the businesses
that would make up Agilent Technologies was 8 percent more than the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recovery is very much on track, but they didn't blow away
the numbers the way they have in previous years,'' said Steven
Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. He said there was an
extra three to four cents per share in interest income, so actual
earnings per share were just a penny above consensus. ``The bar has
been set higher,'' he said. ``They said they would have
double-digit revenue growth for the year, and they have had nothing
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wayman, Hewlett-Packard's chief financial officer, said
that in observation of the quiet period for Agilent's public
offering, the company would not break out order rates for the
quarter. He said the company had not determined when it could begin
reporting Agilent's financial results as discontinued operations.
There will be an additional $160 million in separation costs
associated with Agilent in the fourth quarter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kunstler said, ``I think the market will be fairly neutral to
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't comment on intraquarter growth for Agilent, but
I suspect it's on a ramp,'' he added, noting that competitors have
had a good quarter. ``They're being superconservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard shares have been on an upward path since March,
when the company announced that it would split into two independent
companies, one to focus on computers, printers and scanners, and
the other on electronic test equipment and medical technology
products. Hewlett-Packard had computer-related revenue of $39.5
billion in its 1998 fiscal year, with $7.6 billion from its test
and measurement, semiconductor products, chemical analysis and
medical businesses.

COMMERCE DEPARTMENT SEEKS TO CLOSE GOVERNMENT INFORMATION SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (rk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For almost 50 years a small agency of the Commerce
Department has done business in the resale of government documents
and reports. Now the department is proposing to shut down the
service, saying it is no longer viable because of the wealth of
free information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of plans to close the agency, the National
Technical Information Service, comes just three months after the
Clinton administration rejected its plan to begin a fee-based
Internet search service designed to help people more easily find
and buy the government documents the agency sells.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that the service, usgovsearch.com, was
announced, the administration halted it. And last Thursday,
Commerce Secretary William Daley said he would ask Congress to
close the service and transfer its extensive archives to the
Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way, the American people can find the documents they want
via search engines that currently exist _ and the more powerful
ones being created _ and download them for free,'' the statement
from the Commerce Department said. ``We will propose legislation to
Congress next month to achieve these ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the agency sells some of its reports for thousands of
dollars each, the increased use of the Internet by government
agencies to make free documents available to the public has
resulted in declining sales, Daley said. He pointed to a recent
report from the Commerce Department, ``The Emerging Digital Economy
II,'' which is available free on the department's Web site but
costs $27 if requested through the information agency.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was lauded by advocacy groups that have pushed the
government to post more reports and public information on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is great news,'' said Ari Schwartz, a policy
analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit
organization based in Washington. ``We think that this shows that
the Commerce Department is really looking at the Internet and
realizes what it can mean for public access to government
information.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency has 250 employees, who Daley said would be put on a
priority list for re-employment within the government if Congress
approves the plan to close the service.
</P>
<P>
   The agency was turned into a self-sustaining agency during the
Reagan administration, meaning it was charged with financing itself
through its sales. Daley said the agency had not operated at a
profit since 1993, and from 1995 to 1998 registered more than $5
million in operating losses.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for a fee-based Internet search service was intended as
a joint venture with Northern Light Technology, an Internet
database company in Cambridge, Mass., which was going to split the
profits with the Commerce Department agency. It has since begun the
service on its own.

NO MARTINEX-WILLIAMS MEETUP YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Pedro Martinez said he has yet to meet with Jimy
Williams in the aftermath of Saturday's falling-out with the Red
Sox manager, when the Sox ace showed up late for his starting
assignment and Williams responded by starting little-used Bryce
Florie and using Martinez in relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I won't meet with him, either,'' said Martinez, an
indication that his distress at the manager's actions has not
waned.
</P>
<P>
   Would he meet with Williams if asked by the manager?
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' said Martinez, adding that he has yet to speak
with general manager Dan Duquette, either.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, whose next scheduled start is Thursday against the
Oakland A's in the finale of their four-game series, said he does
not expect the matter to linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to linger,'' he said. ``I'm not that type of
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't back off his criticism of Williams's actions. The
manager said Martinez violated a team rule that stipulates the
starting pitcher must arrive at least an hour before the game; the
pitcher acknowledges that he arrived after 3 p.m. for a 4:05 start,
but insisted he was ready to take his turn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Florie was still stretching in the outfield and had not
yet begun to warm up when Martinez emerged from the dugout, where
he had had a heated exchange with Williams, and walked toward the
bullpen 25 minutes before the scheduled first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he were concerned that people would hold the incident
against him, Martinez responded, ``Why should people hold that
against me? We all make mistakes, don't we? We're all human, aren't
we?
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know I was on time to pitch. I wasn't the one who chose
not to start that game. It wasn't like I was sitting at home,
having a drink. I was having my therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has had the same personal trainer for the last six
years, Angel ``Nao'' Precinal, who also works with Texas Rangers
slugger Juan Gonzalez and numerous other Latin players. Precinal
was with him last weekend, said Martinez, and he plans to see him
again this weekend, when the Sox are in Texas to play the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I said to you guys Saturday, that came straight from the
heart,'' said Martinez, who was in the clubhouse at 3:40 p.m.
Monday, nearly 3 1/2 hours before the game, and later did some
running and long tossing while declining most interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I told you was the truth. I don't regret saying what I
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams did not address the matter before Monday's game. But
Lenny Webster, the catcher who was designated for assignment
Monday, said he spoke with Martinez, whom he has known since they
were together in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Williams) handled it great,'' Webster said. ``I hope it will
pass. I talked to Pedro about it. Pedro's a great kid. He doesn't
need any of this negativity to reflect on his personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Jimy's standpoint, Jimy's the manager, these are the
rules. What that says to all the players, the way he handled it, is
that nobody in here is off-limits. What's right is right. If there
were any players' respect Jimy didn't have, he gained it that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro knows he was wrong. He won't do it again. He realized
this is where you earn your money. You owe it to your teammates. We
show up on time. It was 3:30, and nobody knew where Pedro was.
`Shoot, where's Petey?' I'm sure Jimy felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro probably had a good excuse, but he didn't call. Had he
phoned in, I'm sure it would have been fine. Pedro's still young.
He'll learn from his mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, after talking for a short time with a reporter, picked
up his glove and excused himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got to go to work,'' he said brightly. ``You know me.''

TRI-DELTA SISTERS RUSH FOR DOLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ala., Texas, Ga., N.C.)   By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rose Kleyweg Mitchell was never much interested in
politics until she heard that Elizabeth Dole was running for
president. But what really got Ms. Mitchell excited about the
candidate wasn't so much her positions on issues or her experience
as a cabinet secretary or her Harvard law degree, but her
affiliation with a women's fraternity: Delta Delta Delta.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Mitchell, a 43-year-old vice-president for an Iowa-based
grocery store company and a ``Tri-Delta'' sister herself, became
one of a small group of Delta alumni in Iowa who called hundreds of
friends, relatives and fellow Tri Deltas, urging them to vote for
Mrs. Dole in last Saturday's straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she put her name into the hat, it didn't take any
convincing for me, because I felt I had known her for years,'' said
Ms. Mitchell, of West Des Moines. ``It was easy to call my alumni
friends and say, `Look, we need to help her.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts helped Mrs. Dole place third in the straw poll,
giving new hope to her struggling campaign. Aides and volunteers
estimate that get-out-the-vote operations spearheaded by Tri-Delta
sisters on Iowa campuses and among alumni brought out more than 600
voters on Saturday, a healthy share of Mrs. Dole's 3,300 vote
total. They said the campaign would be using a national network of
Tri-Delta members to build support for next year's Republican
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played a big role,'' said Ari Fleischer, Mrs. Dole's
campaign spokesman. ``It's just amazing to see how excited the
young women get. They see someone who is blazing a trail for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her third place finish behind Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and
Steve Forbes, the publisher, helped inject new energy into a
campaign that seemed to have lost steam in recent weeks and that
has struggled to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, who joined the fraternity in her freshman year at
Duke University, was not the only candidate to recruit Greek
society support in Iowa. Bush, who belonged to a fraternity at Yale
University, offered $500 to the favorite charity of the Iowa State
University fraternity or sorority that brought out the most
students for him in the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dole campaign, with its limited resources and untested
campaign machinery, seemed to use the fraternity system to far
greater extent than her rivals. (Created in 1888, before the advent
of sororities, Tri Delta has always called itself a women's
fraternity.)
</P>
<P>
   In one of her earliest campaign stops in Iowa last April, Mrs.
Dole stopped by the Tri-Delta house at Iowa State University in
Ames to kick-off an effort to recruit volunteers at all of the
school's fraternities and sororities. The tactic proved
particularly effective because many fraternity and sorority members
planned to be on campus during the straw-poll in preparation for
initiation drives that begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the straw poll, Mrs. Dole flew to Iowa City to
greet 300 fraternity and sorority members from the University of
Iowa before they boarded buses to Ames, where the poll was held.
The bus caravan, paid for by the Dole campaign, was organized by
the Tri-Delta chapter at the college.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Ames later that day, Mrs. Dole met with about 100
supporters from the Des Moines area who were munching on
Delta-shaped (triangular) chocolate cupcakes at an event organized
by Ms. Mitchell in Ames.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, a Republican campaign strategist, said the
effort might have had some unexpected collateral benefits. ``I saw
a lot of fraternity boys putting on Dole T-shirts and chasing after
the sorority girls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since its creation at Boston University, Delta Delta Delta has
tried to cast itself as more than a social group, one that, in the
words of its founder, Sarah Ida Shaw, should ``think more of a
girl's inner self and character than of her personal appearance.''
Its more prominent members include Dixie Carter, the actress, Katie
Couric, the NBC news anchor, and Doris Kearns Goodwin, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning historian.
</P>
<P>
   Though the fraternity, a non-profit organization, cannot endorse
Mrs. Dole, it will be running an article about her in its quarterly
magazine, The Trident, this winter. Its national headquarters has
also been directing a steady flow of phone calls from fraternity
sisters who want to help Mrs. Dole to her campaign. With more than
180,000 members nationwide and chapters on 132 campuses, it could
provide a formidable recruiting base for the Dole campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said the Dole campaign would be using Tri-Delta
members in Iowa to build support in preparation for next February's
Iowa caucuses. Ms. Mitchell said she has been in contact with
fraternity sisters in Alabama, Texas and Georgia who also want to
organize for the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited,'' said Ms. Mitchell, ``and that's probably an
understatement.''

GRAND CANYON ECHOES WITH THE NOISE OF PLANES 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 22)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than 12 years the National Park Service and the Federal
Aviation Administration have struggled to control the noise of
airplanes carrying tourists over Grand Canyon National Park. But
even now, in only about a third of the park is there something
approaching natural quiet most of the time, according to government
officials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And growth in air tourism, they say, is threatening further
progress toward the government's goal of quieting the skies over
half the park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In July, the bureaucracy produced the latest stanza in its
regulatory epic, a proposal to put more restrictions on the number
of air tours, effectively freezing the flights at recent levels. It
also proposed changes to the areas where planes are allowed to fly,
making them fly higher over some parts of the park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For air tour operators, who lost a court challenge to previous
FAA rules, the new proposals will significantly impede growth.
Industry groups argue that the park is quiet enough, and that
government studies showing otherwise are flawed. To
environmentalists, the changes have been a long time coming and
will be a welcome hiatus while even tighter restrictions are
developed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1987, Congress passed a law requiring the agencies to
substantially restore natural quiet in Grand Canyon National Park.
For almost a decade the government hemmed and hawed about what to
do. Then on Earth Day in 1996, President Clinton ordered the
agencies to limit the number of sightseeing aircraft immediately _
and to meet the law's demands completely by no later than 2008. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But how quiet is quiet? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Grand Canyon the rule of thumb adopted by the government is
that the law's requirements are met if in 50 percent of the park no
aircraft are audible for at least 75 percent of the day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years the FAA has been studying noise in the park. It
estimates that today only about 32 percent of the park area has had
natural quiet restored (still short of the 50 percent goal). And if
no additional action is taken, the agency projects, future growth
in air tours will reduce naturally quiet areas to only 25 percent
of the park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem, the agency said, is that when it capped the number
of planes given permission to fly over the park, it underestimated
the total and how many flights these planes could operate. As a
result there is still considerable overcapacity in the region, and
with the number of visitors rising over the years, the agency now
believes that unless flights, as opposed to aircraft, are limited,
the number will continue to grow 3 percent a year and the skies
will get noisier for a dozen more years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the proposed freeze on flights is in place for the next
two years, the agency plans to continue to collect information
about noise, and says that even more restrictions may be needed in
the future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The agency says that the two dozen tour operators in the region
carry about 600,000 passengers a year. It estimated that over 10
years the operators could lose $179 million in revenues under its
proposal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Air tour operators have complained for years that the
authorities are setting noise limitations far too low to be
realistic and that the industry's studies show that natural quiet
has already been substantially restored. The park service's past
noise studies are flawed, they say, and to freeze flights for two
years while more studies are done will not only hurt their business
but also deprive tens of thousands of people of the chance to see
the canyon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They call their services an environmentally friendly way to see
the park, and a big service to the handicapped and to older
visitors. And they say that their industry isn't growing any faster
than the numbers of visitors who hike or boat through the canyon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This canyon is 280 miles long and 10 miles wide,'' said Brenda
Halvorson, president of Papillon Grand Canyon Helicopters. ``There
is plenty of space for river runners to enjoy it the way they want
to, hikers to enjoy it, and air tour users to enjoy it their way.
It is a big, big place.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, on the other hand, were encouraged by the
latest proposal, though they say the park is still too noisy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been arguing since the very beginning that they need
to cap the number of flights, just as the river has an absolute
limit on the number of people who can float down,'' said Geoffrey
Barnard, the president of Grand Canyon Trust, an advocacy group
that has been fighting noise in the area since it was founded in
1986. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two and a half to three times as many flights as in
1987,'' he said. ``There are now 88,000 commercial tours per year
over the canyon, over 300 flights per day, which constitutes what I
would call an aerial carnival,'' Barnard said, ``and an intolerable
intrusion.''

MANAGER HOWE HAS A'S THINKING WILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Art Howe is not particularly fond of team meetings.
Like most major league managers, he believes his players are paid
to do a job, and the less said the better.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oakland manager broke his own rule last weekend in
Toronto, where a three-game sweep of the Blue Jays brought the
surprising A's neck-and-neck with Boston in the race for a wild
card slot in the American League playoffs. He summed up his message
that first day in two words: ``Have fun.'' It's pretty good advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meant it,'' said Howe Monday. ``This is what we play for.
I've been here since 1996 and in my first three years here we
weren't even close to being in this position. We're going to be
just fine as long as we play our brand of ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the other side. I've been with teams where everybody
starts talking about being in pennant contention and they start
trying to do too much. That puts added pressure on a player, which
is exactly the opposite of what he should be doing. Right now,
we're pretty relaxed. I think we're enjoying it. At the worst,
they're going to be better players and learn some things about
pressure baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   In every preseason poll, the A's were picked for last place in
the AL West. The days of the Bash Brothers were over, weren't they?
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe everything you read. These A's deserve the right
to be called contenders. Not only are they thinking wild card, but
they began Monay night within 4 1/2 games of the Rangers for first
place. They are relaxed. They are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is a lot more enthusiasm in coming to the
park,'' says second baseman Randy Velarde, considered one of the
keys to the Oakland resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Aug. 4, Oakland trailed Texas by nine games, but that
deficit was cut in half by an 11-3 start this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you're playing for something,'' said Velarde,
``instead of reaching August and September just being there to play
the games. You see a lot of individual situations because guys are
out of the race. Mostly, guys are trying to pad their numbers. It's
different here. The guys are all pulling together as a team.
Anything can happen once you get into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics are a small-market team whose biggest names last
spring were pitchers Kenny Rogers and Bill Taylor. But a flurry of
trade-deadline dealing brought them Kevin Appier, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde and Omar Olivares came in trade from Anaheim. For
Taylor, they got relievers Jason Isringhausen and Greg McMichael
from the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've added some experience during the season,'' says Howe,
``and more youth, too, if you count Isringhausen. To me, the key
was the acquisition of Randy Velarde. We had a .300 hitter in the
third spot. But we were having trouble finding someone to hit in
that spot and get on base for the middle of our lineup. He stepped
in there and is doing a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde was acquired July 29 to spark an infield that included
Tony Phillips at second. The team was 52-50 then. For three weeks,
the Athletics had just the right chemistry. Velarde went to second,
Phillips to center field. On Sunday, Phillips broke his leg sliding
into second and has been lost for the season. Ryan Christenson took
his place as leadoff man and center fielder. The beat goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Tony at the top, we had two guys who could get on base
which is why our production picked up,'' said Howe. ``I hope it
will continue with him gone. We'll miss him. Offensively, we're
swinging the bats better. I think we were .240 at the break. Now,
we're hitting .255. We're gettting more opportunities and we're
still hitting home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half we were hitting them with no one on. Now,
there are 2-3 guys on base. That can start a big inning real
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's may not be able to replace Phillips, says Velarde, but
that doesn't mean they won't play just as well without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Injuries are part of the game,'' he says. ``You've just got to
pick up and hopefully don't lose anything. No question we've been
helped by the acquisition of Appier and Omar. You have guys who can
go 6-7 innings pretty easy and when you can do that and go to your
bullpen, you have a chance to win ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole goal is to be playing for something in September,''
said veteran Mike Macfarlane, the former Red Sox catcher. ``It
hurts to lose Tony, a guy who has been around and gone through
these battles. But the last thing I'm sure he would want us to do
is feel sorry for ourselves and let it affect us. Tony would want
us to press on.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An emotional stone's throw from the scene of last
week's brutal gun attack on children at a Jewish community center
here, Sen. John McCain of Arizona warned Monday that public
officials bear their share of blame for ``an environment of
disaffection, contempt and hate that poisons our land,'' because
``there's too much `us' and `them' in our political discourse and
not enough `we.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we stand on a soapbox and denounce Jerry Springer, and
then go to the floor of Congress and behave like guests on his
show, it's little wonder that the American public has long since
stopped looking to us for guidance or leadership,'' the Republican
presidential contender told a lunchtime audience of the local
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith at the Stephen Wise Temple
at the start of a two-week campaign swing through the state. ``We
have failed to set the necessary example.''
</P>
<P>
   But minutes later, McCain's own voice rose and his tone
sharpened considerably as he addressed a listener who wondered
whether the senator, who had spoken of the need to keep assault
weapons from the hands of children, would support barring adults
from owning such weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to take every gun in California and dump it in the
Pacific Ocean,'' McCain said tersely, ``I'll still take you to a
web-site where it teaches children how to build a pipe bomb, and
children have already done that. And I'll teach you and take you to
a web-site where the worst kind of hate language that is terribly
offensive to all of us exists. I can take you to a video game
that's being sold to our children where the object of the game is
to kill police.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I understand the importance of this issue of the weapons,''
McCain said, ``but to somehow define it as that being the major
cause, there's a whole lot of causes.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's interrogator, Martin Bernstein, a retired lawyer, said
in an interview after the speech that the candidate's remarks, in
which McCain spoke generally of the need for some tighter gun
controls on hardened criminals and children but focused mostly on a
philosophical call to fight political cynicism, had left him
wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a group of people who did not want to insult their
guest,'' Bernstein said. ``But he begged the question. He
definitely did not answer it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a maverick who is often critical of his own party on
issues from campaign finance reform to pork-barrel spending, has
taken a more cautious approach on gun control, as a decorated Navy
veteran and member of Congress from a frontier state like Arizona
where hunting and fishing are popular. He pressured his Republican
colleagues to require background checks for purchasers at gun shows
in a Senate crime bill this year, though a weaker version than
ultimately passed by one vote, and he supported a requirement that
trigger locks be sold with handguns. But he opposed the two major
gun control measures of recent years, the 1994 ban on several types
of assault weapons and the Brady Bill, which required a five-day
waiting period for handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I could give you some reasons that there shouldn't
be,'' an outright ban on assault weapons, McCain said Monday, even
as he said there was a need for more hearings on the matter and
acknowledged that ``you're seeing a movement now toward greater and
greater restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would obviously want to respect someone's right to own a
gun,'' he said at one point Monday, instead mentioning his support
for new high-tech codes or tactile locking mechanisms that might be
developed to keep anyone but a gun's lawful owner from firing it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who plans to spend a total of about three of the next
eight weeks in California, began his remarks by saying that ``in
the shadow of the wrenching events of last Tuesday, now is not the
time for politics.''
</P>
<P>
   He had accepted the invitation to speak long before the
shootings at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in the
Granada Hills neighborhood wounded five people, three of them young
children, and a white supremacist was charged in the case. Aides
said Monday that in deciding to go ahead with the address, McCain
was determined to sound a higher note of collective responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passing bills is the easy part of holding public office,''
McCain said. ``The real challenge of public service is setting an
example of the kind of behavior that society expects from its
members. To that end, we have failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in one of the few passages in the brief speech that drew
sustained applause, McCain added: ``It is we elected officials who
have squandered the public trust,'' McCain said in one of the
handful of passages in the brief speech that drew sustained
applause. ``We who have, time and again, in full public view,
placed out personal and partisan interests before the national
interest, earning the public's contempt for our poll-driven
policies, our phony posturing, the lies we call spin and the damage
control we substitute for progress.''

MCI OUTAGE COULD DRIVE NET PROVIDERS OUT OF BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 10-day partial outage of MCI Worldcom's high-speed data
network took a cataclysmic toll on dozens and possibly hundreds of
small Internet service providers who were forced to shut down
altogether last week. Some say they may go out of business as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   These mom-and-pop players, along with more than a quarter of all
Internet service providers nationally, rely on MCI to route
subscribers onto the Internet. The network outage also took its
toll on regional and national Internet service providers, including
America Online, which said Monday that 2 million subscribers from
its combined America Online and Compuserve services may have been
affected.
</P>
<P>
   But small service providers felt the biggest impact because
unlike their larger counterparts they typically cannot afford a
backup _ that is, a contract with a second major network company.
So when MCI went down, they went down with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our industry, this is a killer _ a company killer,'' said
A.K. Jordan, president of Intellitech, a service provider in
Highland Park, N.J., with about 500 dial-up customers.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said that starting on Aug. 7, the company's subscribers
were no longer able to access the World Wide Web and were able to
get e-mail only from other Intellitech customers. He said he was
told MCI was assuring customers that the problem was due to
congestion and would be up and running in two hours _ a message he
passed along to subscribers who called to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out looking like liars and incompetents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the situation did not improve, Jordan and his business
partners took the extraordinary step of telephoning roughly
one-quarter of their subscribers to explain the situation and to
ask them not to quit the service. He said he now planned to give
his customers a free month of access.
</P>
<P>
   His situation is not unique, according to DataXchange, a
Washington-based company that buys Internet access wholesale from
MCI and sells it to small providers, like Jordan's Intellitech.
Mark Stutz, a spokesman for RMI.Net, the Denver parent of
DataXchange, said that of the 150 small service providers to which
it re-sells MCI services, 66 ``lost their networks completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Stutz estimated that due to those failures alone, some 250,000
subscribers lost Net access. He said that some of the providers
said they had seen so many subscriber cancellations they might go
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any worse than this,'' Stutz said. ``It's hard
to imagine a worse case scenario for our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   An MCI Worldcom spokeswoman, Linda Laughlin, said the company
would offer customers two free days of Internet access for each day
they had been unable to use MCI's network to access the Net. Ms.
Laughlin characterized the partial outage as an ``unsatisfactory''
performance and said MCI Worldcom expected it would take ``several
weeks'' to regain the trust of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts said MCI might be underestimating the
public relations toll.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne M. Schaff, senior analyst with Forrester Research, a
Cambridge, Mass.-based market research firm, speculated that
``most'' of the stranded Internet service providers would look to
one of the other major Network providers for access to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, MCI is the biggest player. According to a
survey released in July from Cahners In-Stat, a San Jose, Calif.,
market research firm, MCI Worldcom provides national backbone
access to 40.9 percent of national service providers and to 23.6
percent of small and regional providers _ defined as those serving
fewer than 25 area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Most, if not all, larger and regional providers rely on more
than one company for backbone Net access. For example, Earthlink
Network, a Pasadena, Calif.-based service with 1.4 million
subscribers, employs MCI and six other backbone providers,
including AT&AMP;T, IBM and Sprint, and thus experienced only minor
headaches last week, said Steve Dougherty, director of technology
acquisition for Earthlink. He said the company simply rerouted
traffic that would have gone over the MCI network to another
provider.
</P>
<P>
   At America Online and its subsidiary Compuserve about 2 million
of 20 million subscribers were vulnerable to the network failure
over the weekend because the primary access numbers they use to
dial into the Internet rely on the MCI backbone. In most of those
instances, America Online urged customers to try a different access
number; however, in the case of 50 communities, representing
roughly 500,000 subscribers, there was no second access number
available, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   For those customers, America Online created a toll-free number.
However, some subscribers might not have been apprised of the
change since they were unable to sign onto the Internet in the
first place to receive an update.

IMF DEMANDS INVESTIGATION OF INDONESIAN BANK SCANDAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund demanded Monday
that President B.J. Habibie of Indonesia order a quick and thorough
investigation of a banking scandal that has threatened to undermine
the fund's $40 billion bailout of the Indonesian economy.
</P>
<P>
   The fund said in a statement that its deputy managing director,
Stanley Fischer, telephoned Habibie Saturday, seeking the
Indonesian leader's pledge of a full investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, which has political implications for Indonesia as
the world's fourth most populous nation prepares for a presidential
election in November, began when an audit showed a newly
nationalized bank, Bank Bali, had paid nearly $80 million in
commissions to a company controlled by a close political ally of
Habibie's.
</P>
<P>
   Among those also implicated in the scandal was the No. 2
official at the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, a government
agency established last year at the fund's insistence to oversee
the rescue of Indonesia's banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians say they fear the so-called commissions
were intended for use by the ruling Golkar political party in this
fall's election campaign to help keep Habibie in power. The
payments were supposedly made to a finance company in exchange for
helping long-troubled Bank Bali collect debts from two other banks
that had already been taken over by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie, the former vice president, rose to the presidency last
year after his predecessor, President Suharto, stepped down after
more than three decades in power, in the face of public protests
over cronyism and government repression.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie and party officials have denied wrongdoing in the Bank
Bali scandal. The disclosure of the payments has startled foreign
investors and caused the already battered local currency, the
rupiah, to lose nearly 15 percent of its value over the last week.
The scandal broke just as the economy was showing signs of a
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF has followed reported developments in the Bank Bali
case with increasing concern,'' said Vasuki Shastry, a spokesman
for the fund. ``The IMF has emphasized that a satisfactory
resolution of the Bank Bank case requires a thorough and
independent investigation to be completed as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie, he said, ``assured the IMF that a full investigation is
being undertaken in order to bring this matter to a speedy
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Restructuring Agency, its reputation tarnished by the
scandal, has announced that an independent auditor,
PriceWaterhouseCoopers, will review the tens of millions of dollars
in commissions paid to a finance company controlled by the vice
treasurer of Golkar, the political party of both Habibie and
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie was facing a difficult reelection campaign in November
after his party's second-place finish in national parliamentary
elections in June. The latest scandal has buttressed allegations by
opposition politicians that Golkar is using government money to
help finance his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian police have named 10 people as suspects in what they
describe as an embezzlement and fraud investigation of Bank Bali,
including four officials of the Bank and the deputy chairman of the
Bank Restructuring Agency, Pande Lubis, who has not responded
publicly to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the Indonesian Parliament Monday, opposition lawmakers
threatened to call a vote of no confidence against Habibie's
government if he did not act swiftly in dealing with the banking
scandal. Even some members of Parliament from the ruling party are
demanding a thorough investigation.

FOR DAIMLERCHRYSLER'S DODGE CAMPAIGN, `NEW' IS OLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ For the last seven years, Dodge has been ``new.''
Starting next month, it will be ``different.''
</P>
<P>
   The DaimlerChrysler Corp. announced Monday that it would send
the tag line ``The New Dodge'' to the junkyard and replace it with
``Dodge Different'' in what the company said would be ``the largest
and most comprehensive print and television campaign in the
division's 85-year history.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodge refused to say how much it planned to spend on the new
marketing effort, but according to Competitive Media Reporting, it
spent $603 million on advertising last year. About 50 separate
television ads will be created for the campaign instead of the 20
Dodge uses in a typical year.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing experts questioned whether the new campaign would be
worth such big bucks, even as they applauded the end of the ``New
Dodge'' advertising era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not enough to be different,'' said Jack F. Trout,
president of Trout &AMP; Partners, a marketing strategy firm based in
Greenwich, Conn. ``I want to know why you're different.'' He cited
Volvo's ``Drive Safely'' tag line and BMW's ``ultimate driving
machine'' motto as good examples of car brand differentiation.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that unless the ads succeeded in conveying the
attributes that make Dodge different and just what it is different
from, the new campaign would flop, much like a previous campaign
for Merrill Lynch. ``They spent millions on `The difference is
Merrill Lynch,''' Trout recalled. Consumers' reaction, he said,
was, `` `Well, tell me, why are you different?''' (He added that he
was reserving judgment on the Dodge campaign until he saw the ads,
some of which were shown to reporters in an Internet news
conference Monday.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new Dodge campaign replaced one that has called the
brand ``new'' since 1992. Both campaigns were created by the
Omnicom Group's BBDO Detroit, the longtime advertising agency for
the former Chrysler Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this era of instant communications, something is new for
about 20 minutes,'' said Clive Chajet, chairman of Chajet
Consultancy, a brand and corporate identity consulting firm in New
York. ``Something new can only be `new' for a limited period of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990's, Dodge was struggling to shake its
reputation for building cars that combined sleep-inducing designs
with shoddy quality, so it called itself ``The New Dodge'' and
overhauled its lineup, coming up with a number of hits. Back then,
``awareness of the brand name was high but attitudes were
negative,'' Chajet said.
</P>
<P>
   That problem has largely been solved. Dodge, and its sister
brands Chrysler and Plymouth, have used bold designs to set
themselves apart from the offerings of Ford, General Motors and
other rivals. They have specialized in building cars, minivans or
sport utility vehicles a notch larger or smaller than their closest
competitors _ preventing their in-between vehicles from competing
head-on with other brands offering, say, midsize cars or sport
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The new ad campaign will be rolled out in two phases. First,
there will be a blitz of television, print and billboard ads in
September that introduce the ``Dodge Different'' tag line. No cars
will appear in the ads, which try to convey Dodge's nonconformity.
One shows two black stove-top burners and one red burner. Another
shows 18 candles with a stick of dynamite. Another juxtaposes
potatoes with a chili pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge will start showing its cars and trucks in October with the
second set of ads. Most will focus on one model at a time. For
instance, ads for the Dodge Dakota quad cab pickup used to carry
the tag line ``We're full of surprises.'' This fall, ads will start
with a title card, reading ``Different,'' and will then explain
that the pickup is the only one in its class with a back seat that
has a full-size door with a regular window. At the end, viewers
will see the motto: ``Dodge Dakota. Different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the product differences aren't obvious when you get to the
tag line, it won't be credible,'' acknowledged Jim R. Julow, vice
president of the Dodge division, who added that the ads had tested
well with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ``we had almost separate personalities by car
line,'' Julow said. The ``different'' theme, he added, ``will
provide a rallying cry'' for the various models and the brand as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   So Dodge will drop its ``We changed the rules'' slogan for the
Ram pickup, and it will eliminate its ``We thought of everything''
motto for the Caravan minivan and its ``We're covering new ground''
slogan for the Durango sport utility vehicle. Instead, viewers will
see ``Dodge Ram. Different,'' ``Dodge Caravan. Different'' and
``Dodge Durango. Different.''
</P>
<P>
   All this symmetry, the division hopes, will convince consumers
that Dodge vehicles are unique. &QL;

 &HT;    Jackets suspend two key players
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech football coach George O'Leary said Monday
the 11th-ranked Yellow Jackets will move forward without starting
cornerback Troy Tolbert and backup quarterback Jermaine Crenshaw,
who began serving academic-related suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both disappointed,'' said O'Leary, who would only
characterize the suspensions as being for conduct detrimental to
the program, and that they are not drug related. ``But we have
rules and we have to uphold them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people on the team who can replace them. We
just have to give them as many reps as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert will miss the Yellow Jackets' first two games against
Navy and Florida State. Crenshaw, who left spring practice in a
tight battle for the backup quarterback job, is suspended three
games, through the home opener against Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to the team about it,'' O'Leary said, ``and they can
help (Tolbert and Crenshaw) get through this. But kids have to
understand that when they mess up, it impacts the entire team.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Tolbert or Crenshaw would comment.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary actions bring the total of Tech players who
will have to sit out the opening games of the season to three.
Linebacker Matt Uremovich started four games last season before
being suspended through the season's first two games for violating
an unspecified team rule.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Dudley, a redshirt junior from Tallahassee, Fla., has
performed well as Tolbert's replacement at the boundary corner
position, and redshirt freshman Marvious Hester and true freshman
Selwyn Scott are also in contention for playing time.

<P>
   Starting Tuesday, when students at Appalachian State University
check their e-mail or course outlines online, they will be looking
at advertising from dozens of companies including Amazon.com, Dell
Computer and an apartment-locator service called SpringStreet.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar will be happening soon at Villanova
University, the University of Memphis, the University of Oregon,
the University of Idaho and more than 500 other institutions that
have signed up commercial companies to run campus Web sites and
e-mail services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas '98 was the first `e-Christmas.' We think this is
the first `e-back to school,''' said Chad Muir, chief executive of
Campus Pipeline, a company that says it has agreements to provide
Web services to 420 colleges and universities, including
Appalachian State, at little or no cost.
</P>
<P>
   While at many universities students continue to use Web pages
that the schools have created and paid for themselves, at these 500
schools advertisers will be paying the bills. And the placement of
advertising on what some regard as the purest area of the Internet
_ the educational domain _ has spurred an acrimonious debate.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is what place advertising should have in the college
environment, real or virtual, particularly in public institutions.
Some educators are alarmed at what they see as a crass commercial
intrusion, yet administrators and others argue that faced with
financial constraints, they have little choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place for commercial advertisements within the
precincts of any school that takes its educational mission
seriously,'' said Scott Rice, an English professor at San Jose
State University who is researching the effects of
commercialization on education.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Williams, director of information-technology services at
Appalachian State, said he had heard such arguments. But that is
not stopping Appalachian State _ a public institution in Boone,
N.C., with 12,500 students _ from adopting the advertising model
and avoiding the need to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to
create the Web sites on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will say that it's not ethical to advertise,''
Williams said. ``Given our druthers, we'd rather not ourselves. But
it's a pretty attractive model. We'll live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has rolled out the program by instructing 2,500
first-year students at Appalachian State to log into the system
this week. They will be among the first in the country to
experience such advertising-based pages on a university Web site.
Each page includes a square advertisement _ what the company likes
to call a ``sponsorship'' _ in the top right-hand corner.
</P>
<P>
   A page labeled Campus Central has information about campus
events as well as paid advertisements _ not labeled as such _ that
link to businesses offering textbooks, financial aid information,
educational testing services, auctions and housing. A Web shopping
section will provide additional links to online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Campus Pipeline will also try to learn more about what is
essentially a captive audience. When students first log into campus
Web sites, they will be asked to fill out an optional form about
their interests. If they do, they will receive product pitches in
their e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members at Appalachian State are just learning of the
deal _ and several are voicing concerns. ``We're throwing our
freshmen to the wolves,'' said Andrew Koch, an associate professor
of political science. ``The university has become a shill for the
corporate community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells volumes,'' he continued, ``about the university,
its funding, and the business mindset that has taken over.''
</P>
<P>
   But as campuses struggle with the costs of technology _ and the
constant need to upgrade it _ such deals are becoming more and more
attractive, administrators say. Creating an internal Web service,
known as an intranet, that seamlessly pulls information from
multiple databases around campus could cost as much as $2 million
for a midsized public university, if not more. Public universities,
especially, are finding it difficult to pay such costs while facing
tightening budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Campus Pipeline, a start-up based in Salt Lake City, began
approaching colleges late last year. It has investments from Sun
Microsystems, Dell Computer and McKinsey &AMP; Co., among others, and
says it intends to bring 100 of its 420 clients online by the end
of the fall term.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Campus Pipeline, at least one other company,
called YouthStream, is offering similar services, and says it has
signed up more than 100 schools. YouthStream, which is based in New
York City, has opened a site called MyBytes.Com, which provides
students with online calendars, materials to supplement their
classes, financial-aid information and Web pages for courses if
professors choose to use them. Each page includes an advertisement
or a link to an electronic shopping area.
</P>
<P>
   Some students are practically expecting to be awash in
promotions as soon as they log on to their college's Web site. ``I
don't see anything wrong with it, unless it gets out of hand,''
said Ken Greene, a junior at the University of Memphis. ``That's
all the Web is, is lots of advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   But the concept is a striking departure for most institutions of
higher education. Academia, after all, is where the Internet grew
up, and for years, as the Web has become increasingly
commercialized, colleges have kept their distance, priding
themselves on creating an online presence that is promotion-free.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, however, colleges have been bombarded by pitches
from companies that are eager to gain electronic access to the
Net-savvy student market. Many are approaching athletic
departments, hoping to strike deals to promote apparel or soft
drinks on pages about sports teams. Policy-makers at some colleges
are even being approached by administrators on their own campuses
who want to provide Web links to online stores like Amazon.Com, so
that the school can take in commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The academy is not a billboard community,'' said Margaret
Miller, president of the American Association for Higher Education.
``But it is also the case that the academy is subject to the same
economic strains as the rest of the world.'' The result, Dr. Miller
said, is a ``blurring line'' that is spurred on by the costs of
technology.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Appalachian State, Williams said, ``There is no way we could
have done it ourselves.'' As one of Campus Pipeline's first
schools, Appalachian State has not yet had to pay anything for the
services. Other schools may have to pay for installation, which
could cost as much as $32,000, but which administrators say is
still far less than the cost of designing and maintaining the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said Williams, colleges like Appalachian State do not
have much choice. Students now expect to be able to fill out
financial-aid forms and register for classes online. Colleges that
do not offer such services may lose their ability to attract
students.
</P>
<P>
   A similar approach was taken almost a decade ago by Channel One,
a program started by the Whittle Communications company that
supplied middle schools and high schools with television sets and
paid for them with commercials. It is still derided by some
educators as a channel for pushing advertising in front of captive
students.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest example, the executives of the Web-based
companies see their approach as nothing more than a continuation of
a trend that has already become a big part of higher education.
Public and private universities of all sizes have already turned
over dining services to Marriott, student unions to Taco Bell,
copying centers to Kinkos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are increasingly getting out of specialized services
that they would rather outsource,'' said Harlan Peltz,
YouthStream's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many educators say they want a line to be drawn,
particularly when it comes to spaces _ on- or off line _ where
students are supposed to be learning and exploring.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ehrlich, a former president of Indiana University, said
he is troubled by the idea of advertisements on sites where
professors hold online office hours or post syllabi. ``I think that
is much too intrusive,'' said Ehrlich, who is now a fellow at the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Other colleges with large endowments, like most Ivy League
schools, have declined to have commercially sponsored Web sites.
Many of them say that they have the resources to create online
services like admissions and registration without outside help.
That may lead students at less selective schools to be exposed to a
barrage of advertising, while students at elite schools are
insulated from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You create a different set of haves and have-nots, so to
speak,'' said Jose-Marie Griffiths, chief information officer at
the University of Michigan, where the idea of having commercially
sponsored Web pages was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   For those that have signed up, protecting students' privacy has
been a large concern. As Campus Pipeline and YouthStream collect
information about their students, university administrators say
that they want to make sure that the information is not sold or
traded to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hilton, an assistant director in the computing center at
the University of Oregon, said that her campus has been working
with Campus Pipeline to whittle down the list of questions they ask
students and to keep the information confidential. ``That took a
while to make that point,'' she said.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Gov. George W. Bush is expected on Tuesday to decide
the fate of a mentally ill death row inmate who murdered five
people but whose cause is being championed by mental health
advocates who say his case illustrates the state's inadequate
services for mentally ill people.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination
as a ``compassionate conservative,'' the case of Larry Keith
Robison is attracting attention, particularly in light of comments
attributed to the governor in a recent magazine interview in which
he seemed to mock the clemency pleas of a death row inmate, Karla
Faye Tucker, who was executed in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The execution by lethal injection of Robison, 42, is scheduled
for 6 p.m. Tuesday. He would become the 99th person executed since
Bush took office in January 1995. A total of 184 people have been
executed in Texas since the state amended its criminal code in 1974
to allow the death penalty. The first execution occurred in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Melodee Smith, who is also a lawyer and is handling
Robison's clemency petition, said she filed appeals Monday with
state courts that included a request for a delay to allow a state
psychiatrist to determine Robison's competency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no excuse for the crime,'' Ms. Smith said of the 1982
killings in Tarrant County. But she said the state's system for
serving mentally ill people had failed Robison, who has a history
of drug abuse and had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic
several years before the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush, said Monday that the
governor had not made a decision in the case. She said that the
Texas Board of Pardons and Parole voted 17-0 on Friday to deny
commutation of Robison's death sentence to life in prison. Without
such a recommendation, Ms. Edwards said that the governor could not
commute a death sentence under Texas law. Bush could grant a 30-day
stay of execution. ``He is carefully considering the facts in the
case as he does in all death penalty cases,'' Ms. Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, acting at the recommendation of the parole board,
Bush commuted the death sentence of Henry Lee Lucas, who was found
guilty of several murders in the 1980s but whose conviction in
Texas had been called into question. In every other case, the
parole board has recommended death, and Bush has followed the
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   If Robison is executed, he will become the 21st death row inmate
in Texas to die this year. In a state where executions have become
almost commonplace, four other inmates were executed earlier this
month with little fanfare. But Robison's case has attracted the
attention of mental health advocates from across the country and a
plea for mercy from Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   The details of Robison's case are particularly gruesome: He was
convicted of shooting, stabbing and sexually mutilating five people
in August 1982, and prosecutors also suggested that he committed
cannibalism. Prosecutors discounted his assertion of mental
illness, saying that he acted deliberately and with premeditation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be mentally ill,'' said Greg Pipes, the Tarrant County
prosecutor who handled the case. ``I'm just saying his mental
illness did not cause him to commit the crime. He knew what he did
and why he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for Robison place much of the blame on the state's
mental health system. His mother, Lois Robison, said she made
repeated efforts to get him psychiatric help before the murders.
She said she tried unsuccessfully to commit her son to state
hospitals after he was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.
``They couldn't keep him more than 30 days because he was not
violent,'' Ms. Robison said in a telephone interview Monday. ``If
he ever got violent then they could keep him on an involuntary
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Graham, vice president of the National Mental Health
Association, a national group of mental health agencies, said that
Texas ranked 42nd among the 50 states in per resident expenditures
for mental health services. Last spring, the state legislature
allocated an additional $27 million for mental health services, but
this month, as state officials discovered the possibility of a $30
million budget shortfall, the Texas Department of Mental Health and
Mental Retardation announced that $5 million would be cut for
medications and $2.4 million for state mental hospital beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has never adequately funded mental health services _ yet
it is perfectly willing to execute people for crimes that good
mental health care might have prevented,'' wrote The Dallas Morning
News, in a lead editorial that appeared on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards said state officials were ``working on finding funds
elsewhere.'' She said that financing for mental health and
retardation had increased by $670 million while Bush has been in
office.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1992 election, when President Clinton was governor of
Arkansas, he attracted criticism for deciding to proceed with the
execution of a brain-damaged felon who had been convicted of a
killing a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the Robison case also has political ramifications. The
governor has faced criticism for his comments in a recent profile
in Talk magazine in which he was quoted as mocking Karla Faye
Tucker in a whimpering voice.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials for Bush have denied the characterization of
his comments, saying that the governor was misread. But the article
has brought criticism even from putative allies. The columnist
George Will criticized Bush not only for his remarks about Ms.
Tucker but also for his salty language in the article.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the political backdrop, Ms. Smith said: ``We're hoping
he'll evaluate the case on its merits and be the compassionate
conservative he has proclaimed to be.''

MARKET PLACE: FUND MANAGER PLANS TO COME OFF THE SIDELINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a busy summer for Julian Robertson Jr., who runs $11
billion in several hedge funds at Tiger Management. The hedge-fund
manager is fighting to remove the chairman of SK Telecom Co., the
largest mobile-phone company in South Korea, while he tries to
raise the sagging stock price of one of his largest holdings, US
Airways Group.
</P>
<P>
   Now Robertson is pledging to become even more active, playing a
stronger role influencing the managements of some companies in
which he invests. In a letter dated Aug. 6, he told investors why
he is taking this position and described steps to improve Tiger's
recent poor performance, including a loss of 6.2 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, like most institutional investors, has generally
acquired stakes in companies and waited for things to improve. But
in his letter, he said to expect more 13-D filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Such filings, including one concerning US Airways on Aug. 2
saying it might seek a sale of the airline, are usually required
when an institutional investor with more than 5 percent of a
company's stock plans to influence management instead of remaining
passive.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson wrote that part of the reason for his fund's poor
performance was because ``in some cases we were too prone to take
the word of management and did not effectively substantiate
management claims.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he believes ``a number of our holdings have never
been valued at their proper levels,'' and noted that the recent
filing on US Airways gave Tiger ``the right to create value by
either a merger or recapitalization of the company. While we still
prefer to leave these strategies to management, particularly in the
case of a well-run company like US Airways, sometimes the
timetables of management and investors are disparate.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson does not say how much time he plans to spend
influencing management. Indeed, few big money managers have engaged
in advocacy of a significant scale. Perhaps the best known has been
Michael Price, whose Mutual Series fund group, now owned by
Franklin Resources, helped effect the merger of Chase Manhattan and
Chemical Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Relational Investors, an investment fund run by
David Batchelder and Ralph Whitworth; Lens Investment Management, a
fund in Washington; and the California Public Employees Retirement
System.
</P>
<P>
   Though Tiger has a terrific long-term record, this has been a
tough year. Through the end of last month, it was down 13.1 percent
for the year, compared with a gain of 8.9 percent for the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. Like some other hedge funds, Tiger has
had numerous changes in personnel, including some analysts who have
quit and others who have been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson, a North Carolinian who began his career as a
Kidder, Peabody stockbroker, has also lured top talent to Tiger
recently. They include Thomas Kurlak, who was an influential
technology analyst at Merrill Lynch, and other analysts who
specialize in retailing, health care, banking and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Their influence is apparent. In the second quarter, Tiger loaded
up on shares of Intel Corp., the giant semiconductor maker whose
stock often rose or fell based on comments from Kurlak when he was
at Merrill. As of June 30, Tiger owned 5.8 million shares of Intel,
making it the fund's 11th-largest stock holding, according to a new
securities filing. Tiger added to its Microsoft stake, now 3.2
million shares, and more than doubled its stake in Unisys Corp., to
5.6 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger also added some large positions in drug stocks, with new
stakes that include 1.95 million shares of Warner Lambert, 1.74
million shares of Amgen and 633,000 shares of Eli Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also eliminated what had been large stakes in General
Motors, International Game Technology and SBC Communications,
according to the new filing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for comment on the portfolio moves, a spokesman for Tiger
said the fund doesn't talk about its performance or its activity in
the market.
</P>
<P>
   But portfolio turnover has been immense lately, Robertson told
his investors. In all, the fund has bought and sold $31 billion
worth of securities in the past 10 months, mainly to reduce
leverage and to pay for investor redemptions, which totaled close
to $1 billion for the most recent period, according to people on

   ``The cost of liquidating these positions has been high,'' he
wrote to investors.

<P>
   Charles Elson, a law professor at Stetson University in St.
Petersburg, Fla., who specializes in corporate governance, said
that for Tiger, its increased advocacy constitutes a big shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means more traditional funds are moving into activism,'' he
said. ``Tiger is a very respected, very mainline investment fund,
and the fact that they would become more proactive is terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger did not identify which companies it might contact, though
its fourth-largest holding at midyear, Tricon Global Restaurants,
has declined 20 percent this year. And Waste Management, its
tenth-largest holding, has dropped 50 percent amid an accounting
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts who track shareholder advocacy note that while
money managers may succeed in changing a company's course now and
then, there is little evidence that portfolio managers who lean on
managements improve their average returns.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while Tiger's filing on US Airways caused an 8 percent
runup in the stock the day it was disclosed, the airline's shares
have fallen 12.8 percent in the two weeks since.

POISON FOUND IN EXHUMED BODIES OF FORMER DOCTOR'S PATIENTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa, Saudia Arabia, Ohio, Ore.,
Ill., S.D.)   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Federal agents investigating an imprisoned
former doctor who is suspected of poisoning patients in the United
States and Africa have found traces of potentially poisonous
chemicals in tissue samples from two of his patients, law
enforcement officials said Monday. The two patients died at a Long
Island veterans hospital in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of three patients who were under the doctor's care
have been exhumed, and tests are being conducted on two others,
based on tissue samples taken at autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   The former doctor, Michael Swango, is now serving a 3{-year
sentence in federal prison for fraudulently obtaining a medical
position at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Northport, N.Y.,
where he worked for about four months before the extent of his
criminal past was discovered. He had spent time in prison in the
1980s for putting ant poison in the food of co-workers in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the FBI, Special Agent James M. Margolin,
declined to discuss details of the investigation, which he said was
continuing. ``The FBI has been looking into the deaths of several
patients at the Veterans Administration hospital in Northport, each
of whom was under the care of Dr. Swango,'' he said in a brief
statement. ``We are also aware of deaths in other jurisdictions in
which a common denominator is Michael Swango.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors on Long Island said they hoped to obtain an
indictment against him in connection with the deaths before
Swango's sentence runs out next July. But if they are unsuccessful,
Swango could be extradited to Zimbabwe, where an outstanding arrest
warrant from 1995 accuses him of poisoning seven patients, five of
whom died.
</P>
<P>
   Tests to determine the presence of poisons are painstaking and
could continue for several months, investigators said. But in two
recent breakthroughs, analysts studying tissue samples from the
five Long Island victims have discovered in two of them traces of
chemicals that could be poisonous in large doses. Investigators
declined to say what chemicals had been found, but they did say
that neither patient should have received those substances.
</P>
<P>
   Swango, 44, a 1983 graduate of the medical school at Southern
Illinois University, denies that he killed anyone.
</P>
<P>
   After his conviction for poisoning his co-workers in Illinois,
Swango served two years of a five-year prison sentence. While he
was in prison, Swango came under investigation in connection with
the deaths of several patients during his internship at Ohio State
University's College of Medicine in Columbus, where he worked from
July 1983 to June 1984. Ohio authorities later concluded that they
had circumstantial evidence linking him to the deaths, but not
enough to bring criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after his release, Swango was able to obtain
residencies at a hospital in South Dakota and then at one on Long
Island, despite his criminal record. But in his interview for a
residency at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, which
has its residents work at the Northport Veterans Affairs Medical
Center, Swango claimed that his conviction was for a barroom brawl,
federal officials said. He was hired and worked there from July
until October of 1993, when SUNY officials learned of his past and
fired him.
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence has surfaced amid publicity surrounding a
new book about Swango, ``Blind Eye: How the Medical Establishment
Let a Doctor Get Away With Murder'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), which goes
on sale on Tuesday. The book, written by James B. Stewart,
chronicles the doctor's recurring encounters with the law in six
states and on two continents, beginning in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Swango began his residency at Northport on July 1, 1993. The
next day, Dominic Buffalino, a longtime official in the Suffolk
County Republican Party, died suddenly after entering the hospital
for lung congestion, his family members say. Four other patients
died mysteriously in the short time Swango was employed at the
hospital, law enforcement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until a year after his dismissal from Stony Brook
that the U.S. attorney's office in Uniondale issued a warrant for
Swango's arrest on the relatively minor charge of defrauding the
government in applying for the Northport residency.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that Swango fled to Zimbabwe, where within
months he was once again under suspicion, this time for five deaths
and two nonfatal poisonings. Yet he continued to elude arrest,
eventually moving to Zambia and then to South Africa, Stewart
writes.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until June 1997 that Swango was captured, federal
officials say, after he accepted a job at a hospital in Saudi
Arabia. The Saudi government insisted that he obtain a visa in the
United States, and he was arrested by immigration officials at
O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The moribund federal investigation on Long Island then kicked
into gear. Federal prosecutors even opened a new inquiry into the
suspicious 1984 deaths in Ohio, officials said. But much of the
evidence in those cases has disappeared, disintegrated or faded
from memory.
</P>
<P>
   Swango declined requests for an interview relayed to him by an
official at the Federal Correctional Institution, a medium-security
prison in Sheridan, Ore., 50 miles south of Portland.

 &HT;    Report: NBC wants to control Paxson stations
 &HT;    By Stephanie Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Paxson Communications is in talks with
No. 2 rated NBC about an alliance, a broadcasting industry magazine
reported.
</P>
<P>
   NBC was interested in the 72-station group even before the
Federal Communications Commission relaxed rules to allow one owner
of two stations in certain markets, according to the online version
of Broadcasting &AMP; Cable magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The story, which cited unnamed sources, said that Paxson walked
away from NBC's initial offer because the network did not offer
enough cash in a package that included minority ownership and
program commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the new FCC ruling, NBC wants controlling stake in
Paxson, the magazine reported. The network's interest is not in the
family-oriented Pax TV, but Paxson's stations that are scattered in
most of the major markets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Paxson's stations would allow NBC to get into
local sports broadcasting and also pursue the young adult market
similar to the WB network, without alienating its audience, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither NBC nor Paxson Chairman Lowell ``Bud'' Paxson would
comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Paxson (AMEX: PAX) closed at $16.44 a share,
pushing the company over $1 billion in market capitalization for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark came on the same day that the company reported a
loss of $83 million, or $1.35 a share, for the second quarter
compared to a loss of $4 million, or 7 cents a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The losses included a $70.5 million write down for syndicated
programming that Paxson decided against using because of low
ratings. Paxson reported a 90.5 percent increase in revenue for the
three months, to $57.9 million, from second quarter 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the West Palm Beach-based station group and family
entertainment network are poised to climb higher if its efforts to
find a partner come through.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst who asked not to be named said on Monday he doubts
NBC is alone in talking with Paxson, although the two would make a
nice match because Paxson owns stations in 12 of the 13 markets
where NBC owns stations.
</P>
<P>
   A network alliance could mean the end of Paxson's family
entertainment network, Pax TV, the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cares about that programming, they're buying the
distribution,'' the analyst said.

 &HT;    PAX: Officials hope to dissuade Pratt
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Palm Beach County, state and national
officials hope to test their powers of persuasion when they jet to
Connecticut in the next 10 days to try to keep Pratt &AMP; Whitney and
Sikorsky Aircraft from moving $300 million in annual salaries from
the area.
</P>
<P>
   The group not only is concerned about 3,300 military jet engine
and helicopter engineers and technicians that the company announced
last week would be laid off or moved. They are worried that Pratt
will move the remaining 1,000 employees who work for Pratt's Space
Propulsion unit and its ground test operations.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the companies represent about $300 million in salaries
and wages a year, said Larry Pelton, president of the Business
Development Board of Palm Beach County. Palm Beach County can ill
afford to lose such a large payroll, he said. With support
businesses, the loss to the county's economy is much greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a contraction in our economy of $600
million,'' Pelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Pratt announced the severance package it will
offer those not invited to move to Connecticut. Those workers will
be given severance packages of one week of pay for every year of
employment, a lump sum of $3,000 to $6,000 and insurance benefits
of one week for every year of service. Sikorsky has yet to detail
plans for its workers.
</P>
<P>
   Pelton is part of a governmental team that held a news
conference Monday to announce the Connecticut trip. He will be
joined on the trip by state Rep. Sharon Merchant, R-Palm Beach
Gardens; Palm Beach County Commissioner Karen Marcus and Ed Chase,
a legislative aide to U.S. Rep. Mark Foley, R-West Palm Beach. Each
government would pay the trip cost for its representative, Chase
said.
</P>
<P>
   The group's fallback position will be to persuade Sikorsky to
find another spot in the county _ Palm Beach International Airport
or North County General Aviation Airport _ or at least in Florida,
to base its commercial helicopter plant. It also wants a chance to
persuade Pratt to expand its rocket operation.
</P>
<P>
   But employees say Pratt is negotiating to buy Sacramento-based
Aerojet, and move space engineers to California from Palm Beach
County. Aerojet has 1,600 employees and 14,000 acres in California
where it makes the lower- and upper-stage rockets for Lockheed
Martin's Titan II and IV and the upper stage for Boeing's Delta II.
It also is developing the solid rocket engine for Lockheed's Atlas
V.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have excess capacity, and space propulsion as an industry
suffers from excess capacity,'' said Aerojet spokeswoman Rosemary
Younts.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt wouldn't comment. But it has a solid rocket operation in
San Jose, 116 miles from Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The Pelton group isn't the only one working on the
Pratt-Sikorsky move. Gov. Jeb Bush's office is forming a second
task force aimed at finding jobs for workers laid off, drumming up
business for Pratt's and Sikorsky's local vendors and recruiting
businesses to fill the 2.2 million square feet of space that will
be left empty in the next 18 months by the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket and ground test operations remaining in Florida will
occupy 300,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it won't know what it can offer Pratt until it
finds out what, if anything, the company wants.
</P>
<P>
   It might not find receptive ears in Connecticut. For one thing,
none of the group members was consulted by Pratt about the move
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   But it might have some leverage with a letter from the military
over security and other concerns as Pratt moves its military engine
unit to the same plants that administer its commercial engine
programs. The military says it won't block Pratt, but that doesn't
mean pressure can't be applied in the committee meetings concerning
the defense budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those questions may come up in Congress,'' said Chase, Foley's
aide.
</P>
<P>

Fla.

FACING TAX LIABILITY, UPS TAKES $1.4-BILLION CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Parcel Service announced Monday that it had revised its
second-quarter earnings to reflect a $1.4-billion charge covering
its potential liability from the court decision last week that it
had engaged in a scheme to inflate its tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
   UPS, which is the world's largest package-delivery company, also
said it would change the way it insures packages for its customers
to avoid any future run-ins with the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   UPS had previously set aside $230 million to cover its
liability. But the initial case covered only a 12-month period in
1983 and 1984, the first of 14 years in which UPS took the disputed
deductions. Monday, the company said its liability over the entire
period was $1.786 billion, including $915 million in taxes and $871
million in accrued interest. With a $344 million tax credit for the
interest portion of the claim, the charge announced Monday equals
$1.442 billion, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth B. Sternad, the chief UPS spokesman, said it had been
appropriate for the company to make the smaller estimate while the
case was pending, but that after the court ruled against the
company, it had no choice but to account for its potential
liability over all 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   UPS has 90 days to appeal the ruling, and Sternad said the
company was still mulling its options.
</P>
<P>
   One move UPS might make is to deposit an amount equal to its
maximum possible exposure, or $1.672 billion, with the IRS. That
would have the effect of freezing interest charges that have been
steadily compounding. Instead, the government would have to pay UPS
interest _ albeit at a lower rate than that at which the UPS
penalty is accruing _ and the deposit would be refunded if the
company won on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, UPS said it had enough cash on hand to make the deposit
with the IRS ``without affecting our ability to meet our
foreseeable operating expenses and budgeted capital expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed. UPS, which was crippled by a strike two years
ago, earned more than $1 billion in the second quarter, up nearly
25 percent. It has $2.5 billion in cash and is only one of a
handful of industrial companies that have triple-A ratings from
Standard &AMP; Poor's, the bond rating agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big number,'' said Robert E. Schulz, a director in
corporate ratings at Standard &AMP; Poor's, referring to the charge.
``But they have the cash, so we will have to see what happens with
the litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service, a competing rating service, confirmed
UPS' triple-A rating Monday but changed its outlook to negative,
citing the potential tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   UPS said again Monday that the tax case would not affect its
plans to offer shares to the public for the first time in its
92-year history. The initial public offering, which was announced
just last month, is expected to occur by the end of the year,
though the company has not announced a date.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Judge Robert P. Ruwe of United States Tax Court
ruled that UPS had illegally inflated its tax deductions by
charging its customers three times the competitive market price for
insuring packages valued at more than $100. UPS paid the money to
National Union Fire Insurance of Pittsburgh and took a tax
deduction. But the judge said that National Union was acting as a
front because it funneled the money to Overseas Partners Ltd., a
Bermuda insurance company owned and controlled by UPS
</P>
<P>
   UPS disputes that interpretation but said Monday it would
terminate its relationship with National Union Fire and set up a
subsidiary to offer insurance to its customers, though it said it
had no plans to reduce the rate of 35 cents per $100 of ``extra
value coverage'' that it now charges to insure parcels against
damage or loss.
</P>
<P>
   Because UPS rarely loses a package, Overseas Partners was hugely
profitable. Now those earnings _ and the attendant tax obligations
_ will go to UPS directly. ``We anticipate that UPS's net income
will increase in future years,'' Sternad said, ``thereby removing
this as an issue going forward.''

   After one of AT&AMP;T Corp.'s big data networks, based on equipment
from Cisco Systems Inc., failed last year, AT&AMP;T fully restored the
system in about 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   After a similar network run by MCI Worldcom Inc., based on
equipment from Lucent Technologies Inc., began having problems on
Aug. 5, the system was not fully restored until Sunday, 10 days
later.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public comments on the breakdown, in a conference
call Monday, Bernard Ebbers, MCI Worldcom's chief executive, said
that MCI Worldcom's plans to offer each of the customers who were
affected by the problems _ as many as 3,000 of them _ up to 20 days
of free service would cost his company only a ``very, very slight
downtick'' in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But the fallout for MCI Worldcom, the nation's No. 2
long-distance communications carrier, may extend far beyond the
next quarterly financial report.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers tried to shift ultimate responsibility for the problem to
Lucent, and Lucent _ which sells MCI Worldcom hundreds of millions
of dollars worth of products every year _ accepted it. Some of MCI
Worldcom's own customers, however, have been scathing in their
attacks on the company. And some analysts pointed out that the
network debacle raised unflattering questions about MCI Worldcom's
policies for handling such situations, especially in light of
AT&AMP;T's speed in dealing with a similar problem last year.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the problems ``unacceptable'' and describing as
``hollow'' MCI Worldcom's assurances last week that the problem was
under control, Thomas Donovan, president of the Chicago Board of
Trade, a big MCI Worldcom customer, wrote in a letter to Ebbers on
Friday: ``As a result of MCI Worldcom's failure to deliver on their
promises to me early last week, the CBOT is pursuing all available
remedies. We have lost all confidence in MCI Worldcom's ability to
provide reliable service.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's conference call, Ebbers apologized to his customers
and said any additional compensation beyond the 20 days of free
service would be negotiated privately with individual customers.
But he essentially disavowed responsibility, saying the problem was
related to an upgrade of Lucent's software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have a definitive cause of the problem,'' he said.
``That is something that Lucent continues to work on. Lucent has
acknowledged full responsibility.'' He added: ``Because we do not
as a company _ and no one else in the industry does either _ write
software for this type of switch and network, that it is not
something within our power, to determine the exact cause of the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers thanked the network experts from Lucent and its Bell
Laboratories unit who worked on the problem, but later in the call
he took a took a serious swipe at Lucent, wondering aloud whether
the company even employed the right people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason that there is some concern here is that
there has been a lot of consolidation in our industry and this
software was originally developed by Cascade Communications, who
was then acquired by Ascend Communications, who has since been
acquired by Lucent,'' he said. ``And so one of the concerns
obviously in this cycle of events is what happened to the people
and the process that did the development and wrote the software.
And was the capability to maintain this software retained through
these transactions?''
</P>
<P>
   That might sound somewhat obtuse, but for the telecommunications
industry those are very harsh words. Communications carriers
generally refuse to discuss their vendors at all, yet Ebbers
publicly questioned whether Lucent, which spent $20 billion of its
stockholders' money to acquire Ascend earlier this year, has been
managing that deal correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent took the high road, accepting responsibility, as indeed
it should if its software was at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts said that in the end, MCI Worldcom had to
bear responsibility for allowing the problem to continue for as
long as it did. After trying for more than a week to fix the
problem (or to have Lucent fix it) while the network remained
online, MCI Worldcom threw in the towel this past weekend by
shutting down the whole system and reloading an older but more
stable software version.
</P>
<P>
   But that raises the hard question of why MCI Worldcom waited
almost a week and a half to make that decision. In one way, the
choice was easier for AT&AMP;T because it had an almost complete
failure; that allowed AT&AMP;T to limit the length of the crisis by
reloading the proper software. MCI Worldcom spent all of last week
betting that it could fix the problem without shutting down, and it
lost that bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you delay something this long, this is not a vendor
problem,'' said Frank Dzubeck, the highly respected president of
Communications Network Architects, a networking analysis and
consulting firm in Washington. ``Somebody in the organization made
the decision to let this situation linger. What does the song say?
Sometimes you've got to hold 'em, sometimes you've got to fold 'em.
This was a great time to fold 'em, cut your losses and move on.''

APPELLATE COURT BACKS CONVICTIONS IN TERROR PLOT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS new 6th graf, 11 grafs at end.)  (rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court panel Monday upheld the
convictions of Omar Abdel-Rahman and nine others for plotting to
blow up New York City landmarks, validating the prosecution of
terrorists under a Civil War-era seditious conspiracy law that
makes it illegal to wage war against the government.
</P>
<P>
   The foiled plot involved bombing the United Nations, the Lincoln
and Holland Tunnels and other landmarks in what was to have been a
campaign of terror six years ago. Although the evidence showed that
Abdel-Rahman was not involved in the day-to-day planning of the
bomb plot, the government argued that his exhortations to his
followers amounted to directing the violent conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   It was this unusual prosecution of the Egyptian religious figure
known for his fiery Islamic sermons and strong denunciations of the
United States and Israel that led critics to assert that
Abdel-Rahman was being punished for his political and religious
views, in violation of the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But the three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said that ``freedom of speech and of religion do not extend
so far as to bar prosecution of one who uses a public speech or a
religious ministry to commit crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence justifying Rahman's conviction,'' the court said,
``showed beyond a reasonable doubt that he crossed this line. His
speeches were not simply the expression of ideas; in some instances
they constituted the crime of conspiracy to wage war on the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also upheld the conviction El Sayyid A. Nosair for the
1990 assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the extremist founder of
the Jewish Defense League, whose killing was also part of the broad
conspiracy, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's 165-page decision, which was unanimous, was not the
first to uphold the constitutionality of the seditious-conspiracy
law, which was last used successfully in the mid-1980s against
members of a group of Puerto Rican nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   But the unsigned decision by Judges John O. Newman, Pierre N.
Leval and Fred I. Parker, offers the most extensive analysis and
endorsement yet of the use of the law in prosecuting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said Monday
through a spokesman that the court's decision was ``an important
milestone in the continuing efforts by this office and the FBI's
Joint Terrorist Task Force to apprehend and prosecute those who
commit and plot to commit terrorist acts to the fullest extent that
our laws allow.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling may also help lay the groundwork for an eventual
prosecution of Osama bin Laden, the fugitive Saudi exile being
sought in the deadly bombings last year of the U.S. Embassies in
Tanzania and Kenya. Although bin Laden has not been charged with
seditious conspiracy, aspects of the cases are similar; Ms. White's
office has also accused bin Laden of issuing religious declarations
that have incited his followers to attack Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who handled Abdel-Rahman's appeal, Ramsey Clark, said
Monday night that neither he nor his client had read the opinion
and would not comment on it. Lynne F. Stewart, who defended
Abdel-Rahman in the trial said ``we are bitterly, bitterly
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial of Abdel-Rahman and his co-defendants, which lasted
nine months and involved more than 200 witnesses, was aimed at a
group of Muslim militants that prosecutors said had conspired in
the bomb plot, which also included as targets the George Washington
Bridge and 26 Federal Plaza, the federal government's main office
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Another target of the conspiracy, the government says, was the
World Trade Center, which was bombed in 1993. Six other men have
been convicted for that crime.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling was also significant because it comes from the
2nd Circuit Appeals Court in Manhattan, which takes appeals from
the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, site of four major terrorism
trials since the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. That
court is also where the government plans to try the associates of
bin Laden, charged in the bombings of the embassies in Africa last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The life sentences imposed on Abdel-Rahman and Nosair were also
affirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nosair's lawyer, Roger L. Stavis, said Monday: ``We're
disappointed in the result. We think it's a blow to the
Constitution. And we will be petitioning the Supreme Court for
review.''
</P>
<P>
   In arguing that Abdel-Rahman had not been part of any
conspiracy, his lawyers had said that he had little contact with
the others, little knowledge of their activities, and was
physically incapable, because of blindness, of participating in any
of the operational aspects of a plot.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel said that ``evidence showed that Rahman was in
constant contact with other members of the conspiracy, that he was
looked to as a leader, and that he accepted that role and
encouraged his co-conspirators to engage in violent acts against
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting his contention that he had been convicted ``solely
for his religious words and deeds,'' which he had argued were
protected by the First Amendment, the panel cited several examples
of what it said were examples of how Abdel-Rahman had crossed the
line.
</P>
<P>
   The panel cited, for example, Abdel-Rahman's statement to Emad
Salem, a paid FBI informant who had infiltrated the conspiracy,
that he ``should make up with God'' by ``turning his rifles barrel
to President Mubarak's chest, and kill him.'' Among the convictions
upheld Monday was Abdel-Rahman's for soliciting the murder of the
Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, on a visit to New York (that
attack was never actually attempted).
</P>
<P>
   The panel praised the performance of the prosecutors and defense
lawyers and singled out the trial judge, Michael B. Mukasey. The
panel said that he had appropriately sentenced the men to long
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``To plan the waging of war against the United States is
manifestly a grievous assault on the American people, meriting
extremely serious punishment,'' the panel said. ``When one
considers the huge scale of death and destruction contemplated by
the defendants,'' the panel added, the sentences were neither
unjust nor unreasonable.

DUTCH PUBLISHER TO BUY NIELSEN FOR $2.5 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Seeking to control the collection of raw data that
companies use to decide when and where to advertise, VNU NV, the
Dutch publisher of Billboard magazine and The Hollywood Reporter,
announced Monday that it would acquire Nielsen Media Research Inc.,
the largest television audience measuring company in the United
States, for $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nielson Media Research is relied on, sometimes begrudgingly so,
by television networks and advertising agencies as the main source
of how many households watch certain television programs.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is part of a strategy by VNU to expand to
American-based media companies that specialize in marketing to
businesses, rather than to consumers. VNU has gone on a shopping
spree in the United States over the last five years, buying 50
marketing and publishing companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch concern is paying a 15 percent premium for shares of
Nielson based on Friday's closing price, offering $37.75 a share.
The company will assume $200 million in debt in addition to the
$2.5 billion payout.
</P>
<P>
   VNU said it would sell new shares to help pay for the
acquisition. Shares of VNU rose 3.5 percent, to 36.7 euros, in
Amsterdam. In New York, Nielsen Media rose $4.50, to $37.3125.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts applauded the deal, commenting on the efficiencies that
the purchase should create. They added that the high margin and
relatively stable revenue stream should fuel growth for the
company. Analysts also said that Nielson's emerging Internet
metering business held much promise as a high growth area.
</P>
<P>
   Nielson is in a joint venture with Netratings Inc. to track
surfers on the World Wide Web. Nielson has a 14 percent stake in
the company that tallies how many times an advertising banner is
clicked along with demographic information.
</P>
<P>
   Nielson has an option to increase its stake to 47 percent, and
executives said VNU would like to get a majority stake in the
Internet business and consider taking the company public. Its
closest competitor, Media Metrix Inc., has a $650 million market
value.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nielson is the leader in measuring television
audiences, television network executives contend that the company
under-reports viewers. Nevertheless, ABC, CBS and NBC recently
abandoned an experimental measuring system called ``Smart'' (for
Systems for Measuring and Reporting Television) run by Statistical
Research Inc., that was supposed to compete with Nielson.

VENATOR'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE QUITS POST 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger N. Farah said Monday that he was stepping down immediately
as the chief executive of Venator Group Inc., the former Woolworth
Corp., which he tried mightily to rescue by turning it into a
sporting goods specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Farah will stay on as chairman, however, and Dale W. Hilpert, a
confidant who has been president and chief operating officer, will
succeed him as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Venator, which is based in New York, also said that it would
close eight additional businesses and incur a restructuring charge
and operating losses of about $48 million, or 35 cents a diluted
share, most of which will be recorded for its fiscal second
quarter. Excluding the restructuring charges, the company expects
earnings for the quarter to rise by 3 cents, to 5 cents, a diluted
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission with this company was to reshape the portfolio,
dramatically reduce debt and repopulate the management with great
talent,'' Farah said Monday. The decision to move on, he added,
``is based on the completion of the work.''
</P>
<P>
   When Farah took the helm of Woolworth in 1994, it was in
disarray. A conglomeration of barely related store chains that
included everything from dusty dime stores to outdated Kinney Shoe
Stores, the company was debt laden and bleeding cash.
</P>
<P>
   Farah acted sweepingly. He focused on the company's more
profitable sporting goods franchises _ holdings include Footlocker,
Lady Footlocker and Champs Sports _ and pared back nonperforming
chains, shedding nearly 4,000 stores and cutting the $1.1 billion
debt in half. He even closed the namesake Woolworth stores and
renamed the company Venator (Latin for ``hunter'') to fit its new
athletic image.
</P>
<P>
   But Venator stock continued to languish, a result of an
industry-wide slump in demand for athletic apparel and sneakers
that caused a loss of $113 million last year on sales of $4.56
billion. Since February the share price has risen from $3.1875 to
around $10 _ it closed yesterday at $10, up $1.125 _ on
expectations of a cyclical brightening in the business. Many
analysts suggested that Farah, who had signed a new contract in
April, was taking advantage of the recent surge in the stock to
make a graceful exit.
</P>
<P>
   Farah, whose previously golden career included such posts as
president of R.H. Macy &AMP; Co., got more than he bargained for when
he took over Woolworth's. The computer systems, for example, were
so antiquated that he could not get daily tallies of store sales,
something other merchants take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Critics second-guessed his strategy as chief executive. Greenway
Partners, the New York-based fund managers and biggest single
holder of Venator stock, with 14 percent, was a persistent
detractor. Over the years Greenway filed numerous proxy challenges
to Farah's management, most recently protesting the company's name
change.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred D. Kingsley, senior managing director of Greenway, would
not comment on Farah's leaving the chief executive slot or his
tenure, but lauded the moves to close the eight additional
businesses _ which range from the gift chain San Francisco Music
Box to Randy River, the men's apparel stores.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts said Venator might remain a dark spot on Farah's
record. ``Roger is a talented figure and well regarded in the
retail industry,'' said Kirk Palmer, president of his own executive
search firm, ``but the perception is that Venator is yet to effect
a full turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Farah, who expressed frustration at times that Herculean efforts
to revamp the company were not fully appreciated by Wall Street, is
more hopeful. ``I think as the earnings come through now that we
are a clean story we will get credit for it,'' he said.

FREDERICK HART, DESIGNER OF VIETNAM STATUE, DIES AT 56  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Md., S.C., Ga.)   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Frederick Hart, a sculptor best known for his
``Three Soldiers'' statue at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and for
his ``Creation'' sculptures at the National Cathedral in
Washington, died on Friday at a hospital in Baltimore. He was 56
and lived in Hume, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Lindy.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's three American soldiers seem to be emerging from a wooded
glen in Vietnam. The bronze was executed to resolve a dispute over
the design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   J. Carter Brown, the chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts,
recalled that many veterans protested when the commission selected
Maya Lin's stark pair of 200-foot walls to honor the Americans
killed in Vietnam, preferring a more realistic approach for a
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Hart had finished third in the competition, competing in a field
of 1,450 anonymous submissions, Brown said, and he was eventually
called on to do his sculpture as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rick Hart sculpture is deferential to the Maya Lin,''
Brown said. ``It solved the problem of the culture wars that broke
out over the monument.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lin's work, which lists the names of all the American dead,
was able to go forward because of the compromise and has since
become one of the most visited monuments in Washington. Hart's
sculpture was erected in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Hart in The Washingtonian magazine last
year, Barbara Matusow suggested that Hart was less attracted to
modern 20th-century sculpture than to the lush romanticism of the
19th century, and he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been a far more compatible personality if I'd
been born in that age,'' he said. ``I envied that world, which
adhered to the values I believe in _ beauty, decorum, elegance and
classicism.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is reflected in ``Ex Nihilo,'' a 1983 work that
depicts the Creation above the doors of the west front of the
National Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who posed for figures in the Creation were Hart's
wife. She survives him along with their two sons, Lain and
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics faulted Hart for directing his talent toward less
enduring themes, especially a line of acrylic sculptures, generally
busts of people, that he told Ms. Matusow had earned him $8 million
since he began selling them in the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   Hart was born in Atlanta and grew up in South Carolina. He
attended the University of South Carolina, the Corcoran School of
Art and American University.
</P>
<P>
   He told The Washingtonian that he learned sculpture by
apprenticing at Gianetti's, an ornamental plasterer in Rockville,
Md., that employed Italian immigrant artisans, and for Felix de
Weldon, the sculptor of the Iwo Jima memorial. After being turned
down repeatedly, Hart was hired as an apprentice by Roger Morigi,
the master stone carver of the National Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the contemporary spectrum,'' said Brown, the chairman
emeritus of the National Gallery of Art, ``he represents one end of
it in comparison to contemporary sculptors who are working in total
abstraction or dissolving the medium into mutations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his chosen end of it, he was as good as they get, a superb
craftsman, a deeply spiritual person who was concerned with
spiritual values.''

PATE EARNED THE GIG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw named Agoura Hills' Steve Pate to play on the U.S.
Ryder Cup team over Fred Couples.
</P>
<P>
   In other news: The shy guy outrivaled the quarterback for the
coolest girl in school, the indie movie with no marketing muscle
pummeled the overhyped studio flick at the box office and the
diligent worker got the office promotion over the slacker.
</P>
<P>
   After mulling his options, Crenshaw took his best shot and
brought justice back into play.
</P>
<P>
   Good for him for making the proper decision over the popular
one.
</P>
<P>
   Until Couples resurfaced at the PGA Championship in Chicago, we
assumed he had left the game _ another in 1999's exodus of beloved
sports stars _ and had simply forgotten to post his official
retirement announcement on his hometown newspaper's Web site or
something.
</P>
<P>
   Couples took off the entire month of July, thus missing the
British Open, the third leg of golf's Grand Slam. Between Memorial
Day and Monday's Judgment Day, Couples graced four PGA tournament
fields (three fewer than Pate and five fewer than Tom Lehman,
Crenshaw's other captain's pick).
</P>
<P>
   It was a curious scheduling quirk for anybody with serious
aspirations of improving his Ryder Cup standing. Imagine a UCLA
senior going on vacation the week of third-quarter finals, then
expecting to graduate alongside his class with honors anyway.
</P>
<P>
   At the British Open, Couples could have gone to school on the
European players the U.S. team will face at the biennial matches in
Boston Sept. 24-26. Instead, he rested his achy back and came to
Chicago a month later and tried to cram for the test. He didn't ace
it, finishing in a tie for 26th.
</P>
<P>
   Pate, meantime, broke par in three of the four rounds and found
himself in an eighth-place tie, seven shots behind the winner,
Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   After his clubs had done a less-than-convincing sell job,
Couples expressed hope that his record would speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   We understand that Couples is the only U.S. player under 50 who
has competed in five Ryder Cups. But if experience alone is enough
for selection, then why not just scrap next year's Republican and
Democratic primaries and vote for for either Al Gore or Dan Quayle
for President. After all, they have the most White House experience
of all the 2000 presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, character and consistency _ in both word and deed _
count as much as personal history when we're choosing a leader. And
so it was for Crenshaw when it came time for him to place his votes
for the 11th and 12th men to do battle against Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Couples said he wanted to play on the Ryder Cup team, but Lehman
was the one who added tournaments to his schedule, at the expense
of at least one European outing that had promised him a sweet fee
simply for showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Couples, 39, promised to practice really hard if he was named to
the team, but Pate, 38, was the one who has been putting in an
honest day's work all year. The former UCLA standout has quietly
posted nine top-10 finishes in 21 events, including two seconds and
a near-miss at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Couples has played 14 events and posted no top-3 finishes. In
the 12 PGA events that Couples and Pate both have entered, Pate has
placed higher in seven.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw said he believes Pate ``is right in his golfing
prime.'' To have seen the equanimity Pate exuded in the suffocating
stretch of the closing holes at the Masters on his way to a
fourth-place finish is to second Crenshaw's sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The guy with such a hair-trigger temper, his peers dubbed him
``Volcano''? He's nearly dormant.
</P>
<P>
   The golfer who has battled back from a series of freak injuries
that threatened to derail his career remains a fierce competitor.
He just no longer is dogged to the point of destructiveness.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just correct that Pate is on the Ryder Cup team, it's
good karma.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Pate was thrilled to be selected for the matches in
Kiawah Island, S.C. On the eve of the first day of competition, the
limousine Pate was riding in was involved in a three-car pileup.
</P>
<P>
   Pate was the only U.S. player injured. He suffered a deep bruise
in his left abdominal muscles and was only able to play one match.
Long after the pain disappeared, the disappointment lingered. Pate
never was sure he'd play again in golf's most esteemed team event.
</P>
<P>
   For the very reason he never took his inclusion in the Ryder Cup
for granted, Pate earned his way back.

REDUCING DAEWOO TO AUTO INTERESTS, 6 SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE SOLD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich.)  By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Daewoo Group's creditors will dismantle the
heavily indebted company by selling six of its 25 subsidiaries by
the end of this year, under terms of an unprecedented break-up plan
announced Monday that signaled the end of South Korea's
second-largest conglomerate
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited plan, signed by the Daewoo Group and its 13
creditor banks, was seen as a breakthrough in the South Korean
government's efforts to restructure the economy as it recovers from
the Asian financial crisis that began two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Seo Geun Woo, a deputy director at South Korea's Financial
Supervisory Commission, told a news conference that most of what's
left of Daewoo after the break-up will be tied to the company's
automobile business.
</P>
<P>
   The company once engaged in industries that ranged from
high-rise construction to shipbuilding to computer chips, and it
grew to become the largest South Korean conglomerate, behind the
Hyundai Corp. But Daewoo's unbridled expansion, inefficiencies and
estimated $50 billion in debts have come to symbolize South Korea's
economic mistakes of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other of the big conglomerates, known as chaebol,
Daewoo also has been notorious for avoiding government orders to
slim down and cut its money-losing businesses. When the South
Korean government first ordered major conglomerates to shed
money-losers last year, the Daewoo Group, along with many other
South Korean chaebol, surrendered only marginal affiliates that few
South Koreans had even heard of.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean and foreign business executives said the Daewoo
break-up could create a precedent for other chaebol to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company like Daewoo has had a lot of political support for a
long time, but the government is now forcing it to stand on its
own,'' said Jeffrey Jones, president of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Korea. ``This also shows that the government really
means business about restructuring the chaebols.''
</P>
<P>
   But the magnitude and timetable of the Daewoo bust-up plan also
generated some skepticism. The plan had been delayed several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan itself looks OK, but the real question is how fast
can they implement it,'' said Jang Ha Sung, an activist for
minority shareholder rights and professor of business
administration at Korea University. ``The question of how to revive
the company and how to sell it could be two different stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsidiaries to be kept are Daewoo Motor Co., Daewoo Motor Sales
Co., Daewoo Telecom, Daewoo Capital Co., Daewoo Corp.'s trading arm
and the machinery division of Daewoo Heavy Industries Co.,
creditors said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo will sell its lucrative securities and investment trust
firms, Daewoo Electronics, and its shipyard and construction
businesses, among others, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the sales of these assets would allow the company
to pare down some of its debts.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the Daewoo shock from spilling further into the
nation's finance sector, creditors will initially take over the
group's best-performing businesses _ Daewoo Securities and Seoul
Investment Trust companies _ before selling them off.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Daewoo agreed to sell Daewoo Electronics Co. Ltd.
to a Beverly Hills-based investment firm, Walid Alomar &AMP;
Associates, for $3.2 billion, a process which the financial
watchdog commission says must be completed by Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Ssangyong Motors, which Daewoo acquired last year, will be
merged into Daewoo Motor, but its passenger car division will be
opened later to foreign investment, while its bus and truck
divisions will be separated for sale by the end of December, the
watchdog agency said.
</P>
<P>
   About half a dozen South Korean conglomerates collapsed under
huge debts a few years ago, which contributed to an acute economic
crisis that forced the country to seek a $58 billion rescue from
the International Monetary Fund. A restructuring of chaebol was an
important condition for that rescue.

CNN DISMISSES EXECUTIVE AT FINANCIAL NEWS UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Top executives at CNN dismissed David Bohrman as
executive vice president of the financial news network CNNfn and
had him escorted out the door of CNNfn's headquarters in Manhattan
Monday, after a power struggle over who would control CNNfn. Lou
Dobbs, its longtime chief executive, quit in June.
</P>
<P>
   Bohrman's replacement, named hastily Monday, is Teya Ryan, the
executive producer of the weekly prime-time magazine program ``CNN
&AMP; Fortune.'' That program is co-produced with Time Magazine, which
is, like CNN, a unit of Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs, who left to start a new Internet venture, had overseen
all financial news coverage for CNN worldwide, on television and on
the Internet. He had been assisted most recently by Bohrman as
executive vice president of CNNfn and Jeff Gralnick as executive
vice president of financial news at CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, CNN/USA's president, Richard N. Kaplan, announced
plans to give CNN 3 1/2 hours of new financial and business news
programming, which would be broadcast at the same time on CNNfn and
would use some of CNNfn's staff. But the programs were to be under
the control of Gralnick, not Bohrman, and Bohrman objected to that
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Although both Gralnick and Bohrman were recruited by Dobbs,
Bohrman was seen as closer to Dobbs, according to several
executives at CNN and CNNfn.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the decision to replace Bohrman had anything to do with
his relationship to Dobbs, Steve Korn, the vice chairman and chief
operating officer of CNN News Group, said, ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Korn said, ``We were unable to reach an understanding with David
with respect to the way duties related to the new business news
programming would be handled'' and added that the dispute concerned
``the division of responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone at his home Monday, Bohrman said his
lawyers had begun discussions with CNN about whether the company
breached his contract.
</P>
<P>
   CNNfn has had difficulty competing with CNBC, the other
financial news network, because it reaches just 12 million homes,
compared with 76 million for CNN and 68 million for CNBC.

WARNER MUSIC GROUP NAMES AS CHIEF THE FORMER HEAD OF POLYGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to end years of management troubles in its record
business, Time Warner Inc. on Monday named Roger Ames, the former
president of the Polygram Music Group, as the chairman and chief
executive of the Warner Music Group.
</P>
<P>
   Ames was the top music executive at Polygram NV from 1996 until
the company was purchased by the Seagram Co. late last year. Since
April, he has been president of Warner Music International and has
been working on restructuring Warner's European operations. Ames
also owns his own record label, London Records, which has signed
such acts as All Saints and the Fine Young Cannibals.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Music, long the king of the American music industry, has
experienced management shakeups and declining market share in the
last several years. After a number of executives left or were
forced out in 1994 and 1995, control of the record business was
handed to Robert Daly and Terry Semel, the longtime leaders of the
Warner Brothers film studio.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to industry executives and analysts, Daly and
Semel did not have the experience to run the music business and
were stretched too thin, leading to problems in the movie business
as well. The two men announced last month that they would resign
from both the film studio and the record company.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Levin, the chairman and chief executive of Time Warner,
said that with Ames' appointment, for the first time in about two
decades the Warner Music Group would be led by someone from the
music business, rather than a general corporate executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's time to put an experienced music executive in,''
Levin said in an interview, calling the move ``the end of a long
journey to put in place the best management.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives praised Ames as having a good mix of
creative talent and business acumen, avoiding the extravagant
spending that sometimes occurs in the record business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the few people around who really has a grasp of
the overall business structure as well as someone who can judge
records and hear hits,'' said Chris Blackwell, the founder of
Island Records, which was sold to Polygram.
</P>
<P>
   Ames, who will assume his new post on Oct. 4th, was born and
raised in Trinidad and started his career in the music business
with EMI UK in 1975. He joined Polygram UK in 1979, and in 1991
became head of the company, whose roster included U2, Dire Straits
and The Cranberries. He ran Polygram's overall music business,
starting in 1996, as the company grappled with problems including
the integration of Motown Records, which it had acquired. ``He went
through a sort of baptism by fire,'' Blackwell said.
</P>
<P>
   With his experience in Europe, Ames, 49, is expected to help
Warner's international music business. Ames, who lives in London
but will relocate to New York over time, said his main goal at
Warner Music would be to ``make sure it operates as a worldwide
company.''
</P>
<P>
   While Warner was long the leading seller of recorded music in
the United States _ a position it lost because of the merger of
Seagram's Universal Music Group and Polygram _ it is only the
fourth largest worldwide. And it has relied on selling American and
British music overseas, even as some industry executives say it is
becoming more important to develop acts that are native to
individual countries.
</P>
<P>
   But Ames will also have to revive the American business as well.
Warner's share of album sales in the United States declined to 16.6
percent in the first six months of this year from 18.3 percent a
year earlier, according to Soundscan, which monitors retail sales.
In terms of sales of current albums, as distinct from albums from a
company's catalog, Warner Music ranked fourth in the United States
in the first six months with a 14.7 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts contend that Warner, whose main labels are Warner
Bros., Elektra and Atlantic, has relied too much on aging acts like
Phil Collins, Eric Clapton and Madonna and has not signed up enough
new performers. But Levin and other company executives disagree,
pointing to such newer acts as Jewel, Alanis Morissette, Kid Rock,
Sugar Ray and Missy Elliot.
</P>
<P>
   Levin of Time Warner tends to promote from within, although Ames
has been an insider only a few months. There had been speculation
in the industry that Val Azzoli, who runs the Atlantic label, was
the front-runner for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month Levin chose Barry Meyer, who had been chief
operating officer of Warner Brothers, as the chairman and chief
executive of the film studio. Both Meyer and Ames will report to
Time Warner's president, Richard Parsons.

KROLL-O'GARA TO RUN COMPUTER SECURITY SITE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kroll-O'Gara, the international security consulting firm, said
Monday it would take over an Internet site that not only posted
information about defending computer systems against attacks but
also told how to break into them.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadowy world of hackers and crackers, it is often hard
to tell the good guys from the bad. Computer-security experts
frequently test systems by breaking into them, and the site, Packet
Storm, posted descriptions of those break-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll-O'Gara's computer security unit, Securify, which declined
to discuss financial terms of its acquisition, said it planned to
maintain the site's tradition of high-quality information as a way
to market its services. But Kroll-O'Gara executives said that it
would rid the site of its more contentious publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it, from a corporate standpoint, as somewhat risky and
controversial,'' Charles Breed, Securify's vice president for
marketing, acknowledged. ``We'll be publishing a site with very
powerful tools and they can be used for good or evil. Our opinion
is that it's better to make knowledge available than keeping it
obscure or hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Ward, a project manager at Securify, said three Securify
employees would comb through the site, ``sanitizing content.''
</P>
<P>
   Until late June, Harvard University provided Packet Storm as a
service and picked up the costs of answering requests for more than
10 gigabytes of data traffic a day.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which was edited by Ken Williams, a security
consultant not associated with the university, proved popular with
many computer experts because it collected detailed technical
information about the methods intruders use to exploit weaknesses
in computers. These often-fascinating narratives were mixed with
discussions about how to help systems withstand assault.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard dropped the site in late June after the host of a rival
site complained that Packet Storm had posted defamatory
information. Joe Wrinn, a university spokesman, said, ``We're happy
that the site will be on line again. That's the original reason we
got involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams called the site ``a labor of love,'' but said it was
taking 60 to 80 hours a week to maintain. He will not be associated
with the site, which will be run by Securify employees at
Securify.com.
</P>
<P>
   Since Harvard pulled the plug, the site has been inaccessible;
computer professionals looked forward to its relaunch, expected in
late September. ``I'm glad that the compendium of information is
going to be preserved,'' said Adam Shostack, a computer security
consultant.

IN A TIDY TOWN, TINY FLAGS MAKE WAVES 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRATFORD, Conn. _ Michael Reekie has a thing for American
flags, especially miniature ones the size of school notebooks. ``I
buy them by the case,'' he said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   He also strings them up by the case, so that the front of his
Corner Deli, on Nichols Avenue here, looks like a cross between a
patriotic used-car lot and an Independence Day float. ``These are
not offensive in any way,'' Reekie, 34, said with some annoyance,
as he sat under 99 miniature cloth flags fluttering above the
deli's front door. ``It's a string of American flags.''
</P>
<P>
   He is annoyed because, offensive or not, around here his little
flags are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fall under banners-slash-streamers,'' said Gary
Lorentson, Stratford's planning and zoning administrator. And, as
he pointed out, according to Section 16.7 of the town code, banners
and streamers are strictly prohibited, as are sidewalk sandwich
boards, strobe lights, signs made of ``nonrigid material'' and
anything else that flutters, flashes, spins, buzzes, wags or
otherwise moves faster than an ice floe.
</P>
<P>
   In Stratford, even whirling barber poles are against the law.
</P>
<P>
   This blue-collar town of white church steeples and wood-frame
houses has its reasons for all the tough rules. Nestled between
Long Island Sound's North Shore and the western bank of the
Housatonic River, Stratford, now in its 356th year, is intent on
distinguishing itself from down-market neighbors Bridgeport and
Milford.
</P>
<P>
   Like its neighbors, Stratford's economic lifeblood is
manufacturing; most of its 49,000 residents have long ridden the
fortunes of Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., whose plant here builds the
Army's Black Hawk and Comanche helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   And, like principals that require their pupils to wear uniforms,
local officials believe neat appearances beget self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``That many flags, no matter how you arrange them, could be very
chaotic,'' Lorentson said.
</P>
<P>
   The town feels so strongly about removing Reekie's miniature
flags _ or banners, depending on which side you are on _ that it
dispatched letters, fined him $70 (which he refuses to pay) and
will soon haul him into court.
</P>
<P>
   He can't wait to tell all this to a judge. ``I'm not taking any
American flag down, you can't make me,'' said Reekie, a Stratford
native with moussed blond hair and tattoos crawling up his arms.
</P>
<P>
   Since the town ordered his flags removed about three weeks ago,
local folks have lined up behind Reekie. Behind his deli counter,
he keeps a handwritten petition with 315 names on it, demanding
that Lorentson back off. He has a card from the National
Association of Naval Veterans in neighboring Bridgeport, expressing
support. A local Vietnam veterans' group even called this week to
ask whether they could hold a flag-filled demonstration outside his
deli.
</P>
<P>
   None of this fazes Lorentson, who has presided over Stratford's
strict zoning laws since 1984. ``I can take it,'' he said. He can
also dish it out: In a typical year, he and his staff send about
400 official warning letters _ to people who have put up illegal
signs or violated other zoning laws.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have fought zoning laws in the past, and won. In 1985,
town officials ordered a local Christian group to stop gathering in
a local house not zoned for use as a church. The city lost that
case in Connecticut Superior Court, Lorentson said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Lorentson backed down and changed a prohibition
on displaying political signs out-of-season to a mere
``recommendation,'' after one resident refused to remove a
candidate's placard from his lawn, months before an election.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Reekie, whose deli has become a libertarian cause
celebre. ``I'd rather be driven out of business than cave in to
these people, it ain't right,'' he said, then corrected himself:
``Isn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Other local business owners have their own thoughts on
Stratford's advertising rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The zoning here stinks,'' said Michael Pantano, 53, who owns a
car dealership on Barnum Avenue, the town's main commercial strip.
He tried many times to put up something to attract business _
streamers, banners, sidewalk signs, you name it _ but each time a
town zoning official came by, sometimes within hours, and order it
removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hung a banner once _ `We Finance' _ they told us to take it
down,'' Pantano recalled. ``I've tried streamers running from the
building to the cars, they told me to take them down. I cannot put
anything on cars, I can't even put advertising on the antennas. If
I had known that coming in here 13 years ago, I wouldn't have
bought this property.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, at Laurel &AMP; Harley Motorcycle Accessories,
owner Dennis Conroy said his one American flag posted outside was
all he could do to attract attention to his little shop. ``I've had
people say they drove by here for three or four years and never
knew I was here until they saw a motorcycle out front,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Reekie hates Stratford Town Hall _ and he does so much that
he recently started a campaign to change the town manager's job
into an elected office _ he has his reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, he was fined $53 for refusing to take down a
flashing neon beer sign from his deli's window. Later that year, he
was warned that a three-by-three-foot banner he had put up
announcing fresh cappuccino required a permit. ``Real offensive,
right?'' he said, unfurling the banner, made to resemble an Italian
flag. ``I bought a $6,000 cappuccino machine; do you know who I can
advertise it to now? No one. It's sitting in my garage.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lorentson said he was indifferent to Reekie's
banners-slash-streamers. ``We're just enforcing laws,'' he said.
And yes, he said he enjoys seeing real American flags displayed
around town and even displays one himself at home on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   But not right now. ``The holder broke.''

FAA CLEARS WAY FOR KENNEDY TRAIN PROJECT, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Officials at the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey say the money for the $1.55 billion passenger train system
at Kennedy International Airport is finally secure with the
approval Monday of the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA again approved the use of $1.15 billion collected from
passengers at Kennedy and La Guardia Airports for construction of
the rail system, which includes a loop connecting the terminals and
routes to the Howard Beach subway station and the Long Island Rail
Road and bus stations at Jamaica, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   A previous approval, in February 1998, was thrown out by the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia last March
because the FAA and the Port Authority communicated privately
without an opportunity for the airlines, which dislike the project,
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' said Patty Clark, program manager for the
project, called AirTrain. Peter Yerkes, a spokesman for the Port
Authority, called it ``the final piece of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   The airlines had contended that the money should not be spent in
projects that extended off the airport grounds and that the money
should be used on taxiways, runways and other traditional airport
improvements at Kennedy, not on the congestion on roads leading to
the airport and between terminals.
</P>
<P>
   But Port Authority officials said that at times of peak
congestion, buses could take an hour to crawl around the central
terminal area, a route that the rail loop would cover in eight
minutes. The train is to go from Jamaica or Howard Beach to the car
rental area, the terminals and back in 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The court threw out the FAA's initial approval, said Arthur
Berg, a lawyer at the Port Authority, because after the public
comment period closed, the Federal agency had asked, and the Port
Authority had answered, questions about the effect of the project
from 2003 until 2013, including how many passengers it would carry
and its effect on roadway congestion. Berg said, though, that when
the airlines lost the point on whether the money could be spent
outside the airport and won only on the procedural point, they
dropped their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA made its announcement after the close of business
Monday. No one was available to comment Monday evening at the Air
Transport Association, the airlines' trade association. Calls to
the home telephones of the association's spokesman and senior vice
president for government affairs were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority takes in about $100 million a year from
Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Airports from its $3 tax per ticket.
The tax was first imposed in March 1992 and is to be collected
until at least 2009. The amount collected on each side of the
Hudson River is equal to the amount spent on each side, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   The authority is spending $300 million of its own on the
project. The FAA approved $100 million in 1992, but the project
dragged on so long that the grant expired; the Port Authority will
reapply.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the rail system began in September 1997 and is already
well under way. The court blocked further spending from the
``passenger facility'' charge in March 1999, but by that time, the
Port Authority had already paid contractors to begin the work. Work
on the off-airport part will begin shortly after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The link to Howard Beach is supposed to go into service in the
fall of 2002, and to Jamaica, early the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be very impressive to people sitting on
the Van Wyck Expressway to see the system operating from Jamaica,''
Berg said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clark said, ``When you see two or three trains pass and you
still haven't made it to airport, you'll think twice about how you
get to the airport next time.''

SIDNEY COHLAN, 84, DOCTOR AND RESEARCHER OF BIRTH DEFECTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., Mo.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Sidney Q. Cohlan, a New York pediatrician long
affiliated with the New York University School of Medicine, died
Thursday at the university's Tisch Hospital. He was 84 and lived in
Manhattan, Ocean Beach, N.Y., and Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Cohlan retired in 1990 from private practice and as a professor
of pediatrics at what is now Tisch Hospital. He was a past chief of
its department of pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Among Cohlan's scientific achievements was the discovery in the
early 1950s of the birth-deforming effects of an excess of vitamin
A in a pregnant woman's diet. His curiosity was piqued by previous
research on the need for the vitamin.
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrated that an overdose of it led to deformities in
newborns and, published his findings in the journal Science in
1953. He also did work on the impact of the broad-spectrum
antibiotic tetracycline on developing bones and teeth, and provided
insights into the effects of nutritional deficiencies in young
children.
</P>
<P>
   Cohlan, who was born in Brooklyn to immigrant parents, graduated
from Brooklyn College in 1935 and from New York Medical College
four years later. He spent World War II with the Army Medical Corps
in Europe and finished his residency at Beth Israel Hospital, where
he served as a research fellow from 1947 to 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Cohlan is survived by his wife of 49 years, Dr. Shirley Stone;
two daughters, Dr. Barbara Cohlan Perlmutter of St. Louis and
Deborah Cohlan of Manhattan; a son, John L., of Palm Beach, Fla.;
two brothers, Harold and Irving Cohen, both of Los Angeles, and
three grandchildren.

PHILIP KLUTZNICK, 92, BUILDER AND LEADER IN JEWISH AFFAIRS  
(DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Philip M. Klutznick, a Chicago real estate developer, investor
and philanthropist who was long prominent in Jewish communal
affairs and served as secretary of commerce in the Carter
administration, died on Saturday at his home in Chicago. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Klutznick was national president of B'nai B'rith, the service
organization, from 1953 to 1959 and president of the World Jewish
Congress, an umbrella organization of Jewish communities in 64
countries, from 1977 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Klutznick served at various times as chairman of the American
Housing Committee for Israel, president of the American Friends of
the Hebrew University at Jerusalem and president of the Memorial
Foundation for Jewish Culture. He was also active in raising money
for the United Jewish Appeal _ serving for a time as its general
chairman _ and for many other Jewish institutions and charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is considered by many to be the leading Jew in the U.S.,''
Rabbi Seymour Siegel, director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Council, said in 1985. But Klutznick's views on Middle East issues
were sometimes controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Klutznick was secretary of commerce in 1980 and 1981, after
being nominated by President Carter to succeed Juanita Kreps. By
then Klutznick had wide experience in business and finance and in
Democratic fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a strong supporter of Carter and had defended him
against criticism among Jews during the tense negotiating in 1978
that led to the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Klutznick and other moderate American Jews created a controversy
by meeting in Washington with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt in
1978 after some members of the organized leadership of Jews had
declined to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Other government posts that Klutznick held included commissioner
of the U.S. Public Housing Authority from 1944 to 1946. President
John F. Kennedy named him U.S. representative to the Economic and
Social Council of the United Nations with the rank of ambassador in
1961 and 1962. Klutznick was also a member of several American
delegations to the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Klutznick was the founder and head of the Urban Investment and
Development Co. in Chicago, which later became a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Aetna Life and Casualty Co..
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kansas City, Mo., he attended the University of Kansas
and the University of Nebraska and received a law degree in 1930
from Creighton University in Omaha. He worked as a lawyer and
became involved in housing construction.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the Roosevelt administration put Klutznick
in charge of building houses for defense workers in the eastern
United States. In this capacity he was involved in the building of
Oak Ridge, Tenn., where major work was done on developing the
atomic bomb. After the war, he was active in building suburban
shopping malls and other projects in the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
   He married Ethel Riekes in 1930, and she died in 1996. He is
survived by four sons, Robert, of Boulder, Colo., Samuel, of
Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Thomas and James; a daughter, Bettylu
Saltzman, of Chicago; 13 grandchildren, and nine
great-grandchildren.

TROJANS EXPECTING STEELE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Linebacker Markus Steele could arrive in training
camp today, after he informed USC that his junior college
transcripts are expected to be faxed to the university as soon as
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, considered one the top JC linebackers in the nation, has
been waiting for Los Angeles Southwest College to send his summer
transcripts to Long Beach City College, where he played football.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest has posted his grades and now he needs the school to
send the documents to Long Beach. That could happen today.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrives, Steele must practice in shorts for four days,
per NCAA rules. The Trojans will officially begin practicing in
full pads on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   USC probably won't get the transcripts of another transfer, wide
receiver Craig Mitchell, before the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to get one or both to scrimmage by Saturday,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Thin position: A potential rough spot could be weakside
outside linebacker, where Steele has yet to show and Darryl Knight
has been academically suspended for the opener against Hawaii. That
leaves sophomore Henry Wallace, who was originally a fullback.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who returns for the second game against San Diego State,
has not exactly solidified his position so far, leaving plenty of
room for Steele when he arrives.
</P>
<P>
   One consolation is that Hawaii employs a run-and-shoot offense,
so Hackett anticipates USC using five or six defensive backs and
taking a linebacker off the field.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sore hamstrings: Wide receivers R. Jay Soward and Windrell
Hayes and tailback Chad Morton skipped afternoon practice as a
precautionary measure to rest their hamstrings. Hackett said
Soward's training-camp performance has been ``inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drops are a concern. Not a surprise,'' Hackett said.
``(But quarterback) Carson Palmer's ball is a hard ball. It takes
awhile to get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fewer sprints: After running the Trojans extremely hard at
training camp last season, Hackett has abandoned wind sprints as
long as USC is practicing twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've decided we're not going to run. We're in much better
condition than a year ago,'' Hackett said. ``I'm a little concerned
about it, but we don't want to peak too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Trojans are running less is 40 of the 65
returning players attended every summer conditioning workout. Wind
sprints will resume Aug. 27.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fashion is a fickle business. One minute your name is on the
door, above a runway, on a label _ and the next your backers
withdraw support and you're wondering whether you should have got
that teaching certificate after all.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Isaac Mizrahi, who had the plug pulled on his business
suddenly last October, and is now contemplating a career in show
business. Or Carolyne Roehm, who lost both a husband and the
fashion business he underwrote, and who now writes books on flowers
and entertaining. Or Rob Freda, who went from menswear to software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great 15 minutes,'' said Michaele Vollbracht, who made
his name with boldly patterned evening wear before walking out on
his fashion company a decade ago and moving to Safety Harbor, Fla.
``My 15 minutes were a lot of fun. Now, I cultivate bamboo.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of what might seem a devastating trauma _ the loss of
prestige and renown from having attained the pinnacle of fashion,
one's own label _ many former designers move on to the second or
third acts in their lives. Not surprisingly, this often involves
careers within the fashion realm. And not a few maintain that they
are just as satisfied, though their names no longer appear in
lights.
</P>
<P>
   Vollbracht has reinvented himself as an artist and interior
designer. He is also working with Rizzoli on revising his 1985 book
about his fashion career, ``Nothing Sacred,'' for fall 2000
publication. ``I've got more stories to tell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, he was on his way to Miami to paint a backdrop on
a boat, in between working on three houses. (``How hard is it to
decorate a house?'' he asked innocently, as if it were a snap
compared with running a business on Seventh Avenue.) He also
abandoned his bamboo long enough to design a shoe exhibition in
Toronto. And he can be persuaded to whip up one-of-a-kind coats of
vintage fabrics decorated with antique ivory or mother-of-pearl
buttons. Vollbracht had been making some on special order for
friends when the Dimson Homma gallery at 20 East 67th St. in New
York asked him to make some for holiday sale last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finish up my last house here this fall, I'll do more
coats for this Christmas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he hasn't totally turned his back on fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Charlotte Neuville, who shuttered her signature
line in 1992 after seven years, then went to Cygne as executive
vice president for design, and is now Lerner New York's vice
president for design. There, in a little more than three years, she
has transformed it from a tired brand for the un-fashion-conscious
into a trendy line called New York &AMP; Co. that offers the latest
fashions at modest prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here,'' Ms. Neuville recalled the other day,
``I said, `How can I do this?' It was a tremendous challenge, but I
have a bigger staff than I ever had on my own. Being handed this
opportunity has been like having my own business without worrying
about the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Her labors have included being involved with updating the
company's 640 stores around the country as well as updating its
fashion image. The drastic change was a major step for Lerner, a
division of the Limited with a yearly volume of $1 billion. But the
change, in the year and a half that the New York &AMP; Co. clothing has
been in the stores, has attracted a new customer and offered the
old-line customer an opportunity to add more current styles to her
wardrobe, like a stretch cotton shirt with three-quarter sleeves
($29); a quilted down vest in white, red, yellow or gray ($49), and
a ball-gown skirt ($59).
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer is not reacting to basic styles, only to fashion
pieces,'' Ms. Neuville said. ``We're not selling loose tunics any
more, but body-conscious styles.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step, set for spring, is to bring New York &AMP; Co. to New
York by refurbishing the old Lerner store at 83 Nassau St. for
those upwardly mobile Wall Streeters.
</P>
<P>
   The Mary Ann Restivo label, a mainstay of the career woman in
the 1980's, succumbed to the changing fashion market in the early
90s, after it was sold to a large company.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the last seven years as a freelance consultant,
Ms. Restivo has gone into the scarf business with a line of luxury
mufflers and stoles in materials like cashmere trimmed with mink
pompons, reversible silk satin edged with feathers and tulle dotted
with tiny bows. Retail prices for the first collection, which will
be in Neiman Marcus and specialty stores this fall, range from
about $100 for a neck ring to more than $700 for a cashmere throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that I wanted to do something that was really me,'' she
said as she laid out samples of her wares on a table. ``I've always
loved beautiful fabrics and I've always loved accessories. There's
a lot of freedom in the accessories area. I plan to do evening bags
to go with the scarves, and maybe shoes. Eventually, my dream is to
have a boutique with these things and one-of-a-kind pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now it's a matter of showing her wares to more big
stores, stores that once counted on Mary Ann Restivo to dress their
customers in high-fashion clothes at less than couture prices.
Their response to her scarves will tell her whether she's on the
right track this time.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Francis Roth, who created a stir a decade ago at the
age of 20 with inventive ideas like dresses that looked like dollar
bills and daffodils, and patterns inspired by abstract art and
wrought iron before losing his financial backers two years ago, is
designing sportswear for QVC and looking to revive his designer
business.
</P>
<P>
   His sportswear for television sales has subtle references to
some of his earlier designs, with color blocking reminiscent of
abstract art and burn-out velvets with ``writing'' that recall his
``scribble'' collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first collection for QVC debuted in May and sold out in
half an hour,'' he said, in the midst of preparing his second
collection, for October selling, in a sunny TriBeCa loft.
</P>
<P>
   He actually sold 8,800 pieces priced from about $40 to $85 in 34
minutes, said a spokeswoman for QVC, who called the number
``fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for me right now,'' said Roth, who retains his
boyish look despite thinning hair that has turned gray. ``I'd been
doing nothing but taking care of my kids when QVC materialized. I'm
reinventing some old ideas. I'm not repeating specific pieces, but
it's more or less the same sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious to get back into ready-to-wear,'' he added, ``and
with QVC as my foundation I'll now have time to look for a new
backer. I love what I did before. It was right for the time. What I
would do now would be with a new point of view, more cutting edge,
something that doesn't look like anybody else. I'm 30 years old
now, and ready to come back.''

CELESTINE SIBLEY, 85, COLUMNIST WHO EMBODIED THE SOUTH 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga., Iowa)   By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Celestine Sibley, an Atlanta newspaper columnist who for 55
years wrote about the commonplaces of Southern life in a prose as
soothing as the hum of cicadas in summer, died on Sunday at her
vacation home on Dog Island, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sibley was 85, and her last column was published in The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution on July 25.
</P>
<P>
   In it, she writes of her own invalid's insomnia, when her
thoughts turn to Key lime pie (``you stumble a bit fishing it out
of the refrigerator, and Key lime has a tendency to slither'') and
quilts (``when they are old and faded and weightless, you pull them
up and remember the women who made them and the families they
`kivvered' with them'').
</P>
<P>
   There were few regional columnists who could match Ms. Sibley
for longevity, although the columnist Herb Caen of The San
Francisco Chronicle did stretch his career over 58 years before his
death in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other proud regional voices _ Mike Royko in Chicago
or Atlanta's own Ralph McGill _ Ms. Sibley was not forceful as she
passed on her musings about minutiae: choosing a Christmas tree,
baking a pie, daydreaming about a Civil War battle and forgetting
to pay a toll in the process. Echoes of the novelist Margaret
Mitchell's ability to describe and evoke nostalgia run throughout
Ms. Sibley's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a country-girl-come-to-the-city kind of column,'' said
Bill Kovach, a former editor of The Journal-Constitution, who is
curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard
University. ``She was the last voice of the white-glove,
tea-and-apple-blossom set that had not a sharp edge on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sibley was born near Pensacola, Fla., and joined The Atlanta
Constitution as a reporter in 1941, covering murder trials and
Georgia Statehouse politics. She was assigned her first column in
1944 when she had to take time away from the office to be with her
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``For generations and generations of Georgians, she embodied the
South, the simple, folksy, homespun South,'' said Cynthia Tucker,
the editorial page editor of The Constitution. But, Ms. Tucker
cautioned, Ms. Sibley ``was not as one-dimensional'' as her columns
about gardens and scotch pines, dogwoods and azaleas might
indicate. ``This was an intelligent woman with a lot of backbone,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   An article in The Journal-Constitution last week described Ms.
Sibley's rebuff to Gov. Jimmy Carter after he had sent a letter to
every state legislator disputing an article she had written about
the legislative maneuvering involving one of the governor's bills.
When Carter invited her to his office to discuss the issue, she
refused, saying, ``You mean you want to insult me publicly and
apologize in private.''
</P>
<P>
   Years after the racial turmoil of the 1960s that transformed the
South, Ms. Sibley wrote a 1990 column about the movie ``Driving
Miss Daisy,'' marked by a sharpness and almost rueful tone. Writing
of a scene in the movie when painfully complacent Atlantans hear
themselves chastised for inaction in the civil rights battles, Ms.
Sibley said, ``It was an Atlanta attitude at the time, and many
Atlantans took it like Miss Daisy, listening and looking at the
empty chair beside her where her black servant and best friend,
Hoke, should have been sitting if her courage had matched her good
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sibley also wrote 25 books, most of them mystery novels,
including some that featured Kate Kincaid, a reporter at The
Atlanta Searchlight.
</P>
<P>
   Her first husband, Jim Little, died at age 45. Her second
husband, James Strong, died in 1988. She is survived by two
daughters, Susan Sibley Little Bazemore of Des Moines and Mary
Everitt Little-Vance of Roswell, Ga.; a son, James W. Little V of
Alford, Fla.; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

LEHMAN PICK EXPECTED, BUT CRENSHAW PULLS A SURPRISE WITH SELECTION
OF PATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Ben Crenshaw continues to stun the golf world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Ryder Cup captain, who made headlines before the PGA
Championship by criticizing four of his highest-profile players for
selfish attitudes, threw another curve yesterday by selecting Tom
Lehman and Steve Pate as his at-large choices for the Sept. 24-26
matches at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who owns a 3-2-2 record at the Ryder Cup, was no
surprise. But Pate, who lost the lone match he played at the 1991
Ryder Cup, was selected over Fred Couples, a member of the past
five U.S. teams.
</P>
<P>
   In order to pick Pate, the No. 14 player in the final Ryder Cup
standings with 556.214 points, Crenshaw bypassed two players with
more points: Austin resident Bob Estes (No. 11, 625 points) and
Steve Stricker (No. 13, 571.429 points).
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw said both of those players were bypassed because they
lacked Ryder Cup experience. Crenshaw said Pate earned the nod over
Couples for the final spot on the team because he played well at
the PGA (eighth place), did well in the last major championship
played at The Country Club (third in 1988 U.S. Open) and showed a
greater willingness than Couples to work for his Ryder Cup berth.
</P>
<P>
   Couples, who finished 17th in the points race, has played just
twice since the U.S. Open (June 17-20). He skipped the British
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Pate, on the other hand, has played five times since the U.S.
Open and fired a closing 69 at Medinah Country Club to improve from
16th to 14th in the final U.S. standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Freddie, it really boiled down to a lack of playing. That
was the hardest call I had to make,'' said Crenshaw, who did not
decide between the two until late Sunday night and notified Pate of
his selection with an 11 p.m. phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Pate, 38, brings grit and emotion to the team. His nickname is
``Volcano'' because of his unpredictable temper. More important, in
Crenshaw's estimation, is the fact that Pate finished fourth at the
World Match Play Championship (Feb. 24-28), beating Couples and
Ryder Cup teammate Davis Love III during the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to look at that. Steve loves match play,'' Crenshaw
said. ``He's a very, very fierce competitor who would walk through
a wall for you. Everyone I've talked to in the past week about
at-large picks, from past captains to players, has mentioned his
name. I'm very happy to have Steve on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on recent track records, U.S. golf fans should be happy
Pate was selected over Couples as well. Although Couples had one of
the U.S. team's better records in the past two Ryder Cups (4-3-1),
he has struggled this season. Couples has only one top-10 finish on
the PGA Tour since March.
</P>
<P>
   During the same stretch, Pate has finished fourth at the
Masters, second at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic and eighth at the
PGA. Historically an erratic driver, his accuracy off the tee has
improved to 55th among PGA Tour pros this season. Pate ranked 133rd
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pate, who was injured in a car wreck during Ryder Cup week in
1991 that limited his participation to one match, said he looks
forward to having another shot at international competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having an immediate result, where one of you wins or loses by
the end of the day, for some reason that makes me focus better,''
Pate said. ``I seem to swing a little more freely in match play
because I can go ahead and make a 10 somewhere and it doesn't
matter. You just lost one hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw said Lehman, the No. 12 player in the Ryder Cup
rankings, was an ``obvious'' choice to be part of his third
consecutive Ryder Cup team. In addition to Couples, Crenshaw said
he placed calls to near-miss candidates Estes, Chris Perry, Steve
Stricker and Lee Janzen before making yesterday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Estes, a former University of Texas player, finished sixth in
Sunday's PGA Championship and missed securing one of 10 automatic
berths on the U.S. team by one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extremely hard not to pick a fellow Longhorn,''
Crenshaw said, ``But the thing lacking in his column was
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   With the at-large picks announced, the 1999 U.S. team will
feature only one Ryder Cup rookie _ David Duval, the No. 2 player
in the world golf rankings. The European team, on the other hand,
could have as many as seven rookies and will almost certainly
feature six.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman said he likes the Americans' chances to capture the Cup
for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a very strong sense of urgency to get it right this
time and kind of let our full firepower be evident,'' said Lehman,
who played on losing teams in 1995 and 1997. ``This is a pretty
stacked team, from top to bottom. It should be a very tough team to
beat.'' nn

GAILEY JOINS CROWD IN PRESEASON OVERREACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're Chan Gailey, it's OK to overreact. That's what NFL
coaches do this time of summer. They sit around and make a big
frown out of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, ``nothing'' is properly defined as the exhibition
football season, which is basically the most useless form of
outdoor activity known to mankind, except fishing.
</P>
<P>
   And I'll take fishing any time.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's postgame face in Oakland showed ample disgust. Then he
backed up that look with an accurate judgment of ``awful'' in
describing the offensive performance of players who are the
exhibition season version of ``household names.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in their own house do they have a recognizable name.
</P>
<P>
   By early September, the Cowboys will have played five preseason
games, which is at least three too many. Only one of the five will
have any importance _ watch the first half of the Denver contest at
Texas Stadium on Aug. 29. Those 30 minutes will be a full dress
rehearsal in preparing for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the exhibition format has value in only selected
areas, starting with the free money it stuffs in owners' hip
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   As a football event, however, these games can serve as a
showcase for certain rookies. For example, fourth-round pick Wane
McGarity has been taken off the roster-cut bubble (any pick below
the third round is considered bubble material) after these first
two contests. The former University of Texas receiver elevated
himself to the regular-season roster, even drawing praise from Troy
Aikman, who is normally tight-lipped on rooks.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the plus side _ Ernie Mills is a vital veteran coming
off a serious injury from last season. When Mills displayed his
receiving skills in Canton, Ohio, and Oakland, Calif., indicating
full recovery, it meant far more than the final scores of those
games.
</P>
<P>
   And there's been one more plus _ Flozell Adams has adapted well
thus far in his move to left offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the two losses have actually been wins, at least where
it counts the most. The Cowboys came out of both with good health.
</P>
<P>
   And while early negatives must also be considered premature,
keep an eye on defensive tackle Michael Myers. The Cowboys were
counting on him to fill the Leon Lett gap _ it could be for four
games, six games, maybe as many as eight _ but strangely, Myers was
MIA at both Canton and Oakland. Not good performances, but not
worth a panic just yet.
</P>
<P>
   With 26 days before the regular season kicks off in Washington,
the Cowboys remain in a holding pattern, which is normal for
mid-August. And no exhibition games will change that. Only health
will.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, a practice-field injury temporarily sidelined
`Rocket' Ismail, delaying his presence in the air game package.
Gailey is counting on `Rocketman' being a difference-maker, an
opinion that is up for serious debate around the league. In
addition, the still-recovering Everett McIver is not ready, and his
absence has the first unit offensive line in a scramble at the
moment. Rookie Solomon Page is a tackle playing McIver's spot at
guard, and he's struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo has been basically
satisfied with what's been seen thus far. But lingering questions
about stopping the run and rushing the passer remain as pertinent
as ever after Canton and Oakland. It's way too early to be pleased
with anything. And the same logic applies to being disgusted with
anything. Coaches, however, will be coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Gailey was hardly alone in the dour-look
department.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Dennis Green is feeling the weight of his Vikings being
made Super Bowl favorites by the Las Vegas sports books. Following
a Friday night loss to the Giants, Green had his players back on
the practice field the next day, wearing shoulder pads rather than
the usual shorts and T-shirts. All this turned into some kind of
big media deal in Minneapolis-St. Paul, a sure indicator the Twins
are having another bad baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Bill Parcells, screaming loudly after his backup
quarterbacks struggled when the Jets lost over the weekend. But if
not that, Parcells would have found something else. It's never too
early for Bill to be unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, Pete Carroll is under the gun, job-security
wise. With nearly a month before the regular season, Pete is
already publicly demanding vast improvement from his players _
after one exhibition season loss. Easy, coach.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe Pete Carroll was merely getting his troops
fired up for the Cowboys visit to Foxboro on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In exhibition football, only a coach cares enough to overreact.

TCU SEARCHING FOR PUNT RETURER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ TCU defensive back LaVar Veale insists he isn't
crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Veale isn't crazy if sanity means standing on the football
field, keeping your eye on a punt that's in the air while 10 guys
barrel at you with the sole intention of flattening you like a
pancake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't ask,'' Veale clarified. ``I ``begged'' them to let me
return punts.''
</P>
<P>
   What's that saying? Ask and you shall receive. Well, Veale
begged and received.
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs coach Dennis Franchione has had Veale and a few
other carefully selected players (wideouts Mike Scarborough, Terran
Williams and Johnny Collins along with defensive back Bo
Springfield) returning punts during two-a-days. He had little
choice. His usual return guy, Royce Huffman, was drafted by the
Houston Astros in June and somehow returning punts didn't seem like
the smartest thing to do once Huffman had a contract in hand. He'll
stick to punting only, thanks.
</P>
<P>
   So the race was on to find a replacement to return them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a chance, not to take anything away from
Royce, to get a little more athletic type person back there and
break some big plays,'' Franchione said.
</P>
<P>
   Athleticism isn't the only mark of a good punt returner, though.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione wants a guy with hands good enough to catch the balls
that come his way. He wants a guy with enough guts to want to catch
most of the balls that come his way. And he wants enough confidence
to make good, quick decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a special person. There is no doubt about that,''
Franchione said. ``Punt returning is not for everybody. Some guys
can't handle the fact that their head is looking at the sky while
people are beating down on them. They just can't do it. Others love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Count Scarborough among the others. Like Veale, he was begging
to get a chance last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most exciting play of the game,'' Scarborough
explained. ``Coaches always talk about the importance of big plays;
well, I think the punt return is the biggest play in the
football.''
</P>
<P>
   For good or bad, the punt return is one of those plays that can
change a game.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, the potential for a player to break a long
return and get his team good field position, maybe even score.
There is also the potential for a ball to roll past him and pin his
team deep in its end or a fumble that gives the other team
possession.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes the difference between a big play and a big
mistake?
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who is willing to go out there and catch it,''
Franchione said. ``Returning punts is a lot like playing corner in
our defense. You are on an island. You hope people are blocking for
you, but you have to make split-second decisions based on what you
think they are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The island is what Scarborough and Veale both said they loved
about returning punts. There is something about standing back there
all by yourself and knowing you are going to get the ball,
Scarborough said.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he should be scared or a little nervous, but he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a game, it is totally different. You can't hear anything in
a game, and all you see is the ball. I don't know why that is, but
in a game I think you are more focused,'' Scarborough said. ``You
do it so many times in practice it becomes automatic. It doesn't
matter that all these people are coming toward you. The ball just
floats up there and just comes down into your hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right when you catch it, that's when everything gets crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Veale, however, doesn't think he's crazy in the slightest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be crazy,'' Veale said, ``if you didn't want to do it.''

Ceballos turns down Sonics 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mavericks free-agent forward Cedric Ceballos has turned down a
six-year offer from the Seattle SuperSonics for approximately $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos' agent, Fred Slaughter, said the offer ``wasn't fair to
Cedric.'' Slaughter also said the Sonics had a sign-and-trade deal
on the table that would have paid Ceballos roughly $19 million over
four years, but that deal was nixed by Mavericks coach/general
manager Don Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle \Rgeneral manager Wally Walker\S called and said
Nellie frustrated the deal, changed it, tried to add some people
and take some people and just made it impossible to do a
sign-and-trade,'' Slaughter said. ``So the Sonics said they had to
go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sign-and-trade deal between Seattle and Dallas was a
week-and-a-half of work, and we never got it done. But I guess
Nellie can walk away and say Seattle frustrated the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   After being spurned by Nelson, the Sonics sent Hersey Hawkins
and James Cotton to Chicago for Brent Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is in China trying to lure center Wang Zhizhi to the NBA,
and could not be reached for comment. The Mavericks selected Wang
in the second round of the June 30 NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos has a two-year offer on the table from the Mavericks
for approximately $8 million. While Ceballos and Slaughter agree on
the money he'll be paid per year, Ceballos wants a four-year deal
instead of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to discuss the length of the contract when Nellie
comes back from China,'' Slaughter said. ``If not, we'll just
continue to talk to other teams and see what happens.'' nn

<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea _ Rwandan leaders traveled to Uganda and held
talks Monday night aimed at easing tensions after troops from the
two nations, once firm allies, fought for a third day in the
Congolese city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday night what might have been accomplished
in the talks. John Nagenda, a senior advisor to President Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda, said he expected any troubles to be worked out
given how close the governments have been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a meaningless bit of friction,'' Nagenda said of the
fighting in a telephone interview Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to suggest that Uganda was willing to end its
cooperation with Rwanda in Congo if some agreement was not reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they feel they can do without us, they will definitely be
the loser,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan officials could not be reached for comment Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day the Rwandan News Agency reported that the
fighting began after several hundred Ugandan soldiers were flown to
Kisangani to drive Rwandans from the city's main airport.
 &UR;  &LR; Both Uganda and Rwanda have soldiers stationed in Congo as part of
their mutual support for the rebels fighting to overthrow the
president of Congo, Laurent Kabila. But in recent months the two
allies have moved apart, backing rival rebel factions and
disagreeing over how to conduct the war and more recent efforts for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Those tensions erupted into fighting over the Kisangani airport
on Saturday night, opening a more complicated chapter in the Congo
conflict. Monday, artillery and mortar fire continued, reportedly
letting up before the evening meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors and aid workers reported that at least 50 people
have died in Kisangani, many of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of women and children were also trapped inside health
centers, where U.N. health workers were immunizing people against
polio. Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, condemned the
fighting, partly because it violated a temporary cease-fire to
allow the doctors there to work in safety.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the fighting between Uganda and Rwanda broke out
after they both signed an accord aimed at ending the year-long
rebellion in Congo. The accord was signed on July 10 by the six
nations fighting inside Congo, but its chances for success seemed
slim because the three rebel factions refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was aimed at ending the fighting between Rwanda,
Uganda and the rebels on one side, and Kabila and his outside
backers, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, on the other.
</P>
<P>
   But few people could have foreseen that Rwanda and Uganda would
turn their guns on each other, particularly since both signed the
peace accord, and that complication seemed only to endanger the
accord further.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that there may be a separate bilateral issue
between Rwanda and Uganda _ that concerns us greatly,'' said one
U.S. administration official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The United States _ allies of both Rwanda and Uganda _ has been
helping the search for peace. Gayle Smith, the top official for
African affairs in the National Security Council, traveled to the
region on Friday to try to convince the rebel groups to sign the
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday she ended up meeting with Rwandan officials and later
traveled to Uganda, where Museveni, met with President Pasteur
Bizimungu and Vice President Paul Kagame of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan officials could not be reached for comment Monday night.
Earlier in the day the Rwandan News Agency reported that the
fighting began after several hundred Ugandan soldiers were flown to
Kisangani to drive Rwandan soldiers from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Nagenda denied that Uganda had begun the fighting. A statement
from the rebel group backed by Uganda said the fighting started
after Rwandan soldiers blocked the road to the airport and fired at
Ugandan soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   When the rebellion began last August, both Rwanda and Uganda
supported the same rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy.
But since then Uganda and Rwanda began to back different elements
within the group _ a split that became formal in May when the group
ousted its original leader, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
   Wamba dia Wamba, claiming he remained the movement's true
leader, maintained the support of Uganda and established
headquarters in Kisangani. The Rwandans backed the new leader, Dr.
Emile Ilunga, a longtime opposition leader in Congo.

<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ As much as a billion dollars has
disappeared from public funds or been stolen from international aid
projects through fraud carried out by the Muslim, Croatian and
Serbian nationalist leaders who keep Bosnia rigidly partitioned
into three ethnic enclaves, according to an exhaustive
investigation by an American-led anti-fraud unit.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-fraud unit, set up by the Office of the High
Representative, the international agency responsible for carrying
out the civilian aspects of the Dayton peace agreement, has exposed
so much corruption that relief aid agencies and embassies are
reluctant to publicize the thefts for fear of frightening away
international donors.
</P>
<P>
   The report names several officials linked to the governing
nationalist parties as profiting from the fraud. Even though the
Office of the High Representative has dismissed 15 officials or
prevented them from holding office, most retain their authority.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident cited in the report, 10 foreign embassies and
international aid agencies lost over $20 million deposited in a
Bosnian bank, but only the Swiss Embassy has publicly acknowledged
its losses.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-fraud unit, which requires special security measures
and does not make public who is working for the organization in
Bosnia, is now investigating 220 cases of fraud and corruption. It
documents the current cases in a 4,000-page report that has not
been released to the public. Its contents were made available to
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations as diverse at the Office of the High
Representative, the United Nations and the U.S. Agency for
International Development, all dedicated to rebuilding the country,
have lost tens of millions of dollars, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread corruption is viewed by many here as a severe
blow in the long, frustrating struggle to build a democratic
Bosnia, a country that has received $5.1 billion in international
aid since the end of the war in 1995. The corruption has also
played a pivotal role in driving away foreign investment, seen as
the only way to free Bosnia from dependence on foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The missing funds were supposed to have been used to rebuild
Bosnia's roads, buildings and schools, as well as to provide
municipal services in towns throughout Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, along with other
senior nationalist leaders, has dismissed the allegations of
official corruption made by the international investigators. While
conceding that corruption takes place, the president disputes the
scale of the charges, denying that as much as a billion dollars has
been misappropriated as stated in the long and detailed report.
</P>
<P>
   Izetbegovic has repeatedly denied these charges, most recently
in a local press interview. ``It would be nonsense to claim that
there is no corruption, or that it is irrelevant, in a country that
has just come out of the war,'' he said, adding that Bosnia is a
country ``which does not have established borders, where joint
institutions are still not functioning, and which has at least two
armies and two police forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton agreement, which was signed by Muslim, Croatian and
Serbian warring factions in 1995, called for the creation of a
single state and the return of about two million displaced people
to their homes. But Bosnia remains partitioned into three
antagonistic ethnic enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Serb-held Bosnia continues to operate as a separate entity. The
internationally created Muslim-Croat Federation has no authority
and has been unable to raise revenues. The two million refugees and
displaced people have not gone back to their homes. And the Office
of the High Representative, the chief civilian international agency
in Bosnia, has been reduced to promising money and aid projects to
towns and cities that say they will allow some refugees to return,
promises that are usually never kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dayton stopped the violence, but it did not end the war,''
said Jacques P. Klein, the chief U.N. representative here, ``and
the war is still being fought bureaucratically through obfuscation,
delay and avoidance by a group of leaders who do not want to lose
power. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a patient on life support
assistance _ political, military and economic.''
</P>
<P>
   International donors say the endemic fraud is making it harder
to justify continued aid levels. Without the huge infusions of
money, it is unlikely that the Muslim, Croatian and Serbian
enclaves will be able to continue to pay pensions and salaries and
reconstruct the country. The Sarajevo government, for instance, has
asked the World Bank for loans to make its April pension payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is running out,'' said James Lyon, the director of the
international Crisis Group, an independent research organization.
``The international community has no enforcement mechanism. The
international administrators beg, plead, cajole and in some case
engage in what looks like bribery, promising cities infrastructure
projects if they allow some refugees to return. This tactic might
work if we continue the present aid levels, about a billion dollars
a year, over the next 20 years. But as aid declines, what will make
these people even promise to comply?''

   Tuzla, a Muslim city, is one case study of widespread corruption
that infects many local governments, the report says. The report
charges that $200 million was missing from this year's budget, in
addition to $300 million missing over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Tuzla's schools were painted four times last year alone by the
city government, although they were rebuilt and painted by
international aid organizations as well. Tuzla officials paid two
or three times the normal price for such work and sold many of the
cans of paint on the local market, the auditors found. Many of the
schools, meanwhile, still lack heat, and students must wear their
coats to class in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Sanski Most, heavily damaged during the war,
municipal funds are being used to build a horse racing track, much
to the consternation of aid agencies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report charges the town's mayor, Mehmed Alagic, with 358
counts of corruption. The charges include the theft of $450,000 in
relief aid from the government of Saudi Arabia. That money was
supposed to be used to provide feed and farm equipment, but the
report alleges that the mayor gave the money instead to his brother
to start a bank. The mayor has denied the charges and accused the
Office of the High Representatives of mounting a campaign against
him.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive case under investigation by the anti-fraud
unit concerns the Bosnia and Herzegovina Bank, or BiH, in Sarajevo.
The bank took in tens of millions of dollars from international
agencies and 10 foreign embassies. The money, the investigators
maintain, was lent to fictional businesses or given as personal
loans to friends by the two owners.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has now collapsed. The collapse underscores a
near-total failure to establish a viable banking industry. Of the
some 50 banks in Bosnia, Western diplomats say, only six are
solvent.
</P>
<P>
   The Agency for International Development, which has not made its
losses public, had at least $4 million in the BiH bank, according
to Western diplomats. At least half of the $20 million lost by
international organizations deposited in the bank was to have been
used for reconstruction projects, the anti-fraud investigators said
in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fear is that once the extent of the theft is known,
international donors will get disgusted and walk away,'' said an
official at the Office of the High Representative, who asked not to
be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Until the bank collapsed, the U.S. Embassy had asked it to act
as an agent to screen and approve small businesses that should
receive low-interest loans and then collect the funds, Western
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   AID has also filed suit in Bosnian courts against 19 Bosnian
companies, which have failed to repay business loans worth more
than $10 million. The loans, for sums ranging from $100,000 to $1
million, are part of a $278 million revolving credit established in
1996 by AID to help kick-start the Bosnian economy. The agency,
unable to collect $1 million in loans from Hidrogradnja, one of
Bosnia's largest companies, is trying to seize its assets.
</P>
<P>
   The rampant corruption has discouraged foreign investment. Most
foreign companies, including McDonald's, have refused to set up
operations after demands by officials to pay bribes and do business
exclusively with local party officials.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies _ like the Italian construction firm Aluveneto
and Gluck Norm, Germany's largest manufacturer of door and window
frames _ have pulled out with heavy losses, complaining of
interference from the state, an inability to collect debts and
demands by officials for kickbacks and bribes to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen is also considering pulling out of Bosnia, according
to European diplomats. Volkswagen officials would not comment. The
German government pushed hard to get the company to reopen its
heavily damaged plant in the Sarajevo suburb of Vogosca. Volkswagen
did so on condition that the Bosnian government buy official cars
from the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the government reneged on its promise, forcing
Volkswagen to go to court, but the state company in partnership has
refused to pay the $1 million it promised to invest.
</P>
<P>
   The money-losing Volkswagen plant does only final assembly on
car bodies shipped from the Skoda auto plant in the Czech Republic.
Sixty workers assemble about six cars a day from the kits. Few
sell, in part because of the thousands of stolen cars brought into
the country from Europe by local gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   The used car market in Stolac, which convenes every Sunday in
the Croat-controlled part of Bosnia, has one of the largest
collections of stolen vehicles in Europe, according to
international police.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent Sunday, some four hundred cars, most with forged
registration papers and German, Swiss and Italian license plates,
were being sold for large wads of German marks. The gangs that
bring the cars into Bosnia oversee the sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of the High Representative has outlawed the market.
It pressed in January to have the market's organizer, Jozo Peric,
arrested. But the local Croat court released him a few days later
and dismissed the charges. Now Peric is in hiding. When federal tax
officials showed up last year to try carry out an audit they were
beaten so badly they were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   OHR officials and western diplomats say that one of the
wealthiest and most powerful men in Bosnia is Bakir Izetbegovic,
the son of the president .
</P>
<P>
   Bakir Izetbegovic controls The City Development Institute, in
charge of determining the occupancy rights of 80,000 publicly owned
apartments in the city. The apartments, many of which belonged to
Serbs or Croats before the war, have been given to members of the
ruling Muslim-led Social Democratic Party. Others who want
occupancy rights must pay Izetbegovic $2,000, said several Bosnians
who have paid the required fee.
</P>
<P>
   Izetbegovic owns 15 percent of Bosnia Air, the state airline,
and takes a cut of the extortion money paid out by local
shopkeepers to Sarajevo gangsters, said these diplomats.
Izetbegovic has consistently denied any involvement in such
activities.
</P>
<P>
   When foreign aid agencies or even the Office of the High
Representative itself try to turn to Bosnian courts for redress,
they run up against an overwhelmed and corrupt system.
</P>
<P>
   The Agency for International Development is moving against
several large state-owned firms. But creditors are rarely able to
collect. The Tuzla courts, for example, have a backlog of over
30,000 cases of organized and violent crime. There were a total of
1,050 convictions last year, and in most of those cases, those
convicted were released on parole.
</P>
<P>
   Even when laws are passed to try to contain the fraud,
politicians have blocked or ignored them. For example, a law was
passed last year in the Bosnian Assembly that would allow the
government to tax the oil and gas trucked in from Croatia. The
revenue was expected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
But when the law appeared in the official gazette articles 24 and
26, the ones that stipulated such taxation, were inexplicably
missing.
</P>
<P>
   The Croat Mafia that brings in the oil and gas continues to pay
no taxes. Although the case is in a Sarajevo court, western
diplomats say the judges, fearing retribution, are afraid to try
it.
