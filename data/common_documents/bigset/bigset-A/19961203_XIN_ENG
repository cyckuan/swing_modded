<HEADLINE> Chinese President's Speech Applauded in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin today became the first foreign head of state to make a
speech to Pakistani senators.
</P>
<P>
Senate Chairman Wasim Sajjad said that his colleagues felt
honored to have Jiang speak about China's policy toward South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang put forth five principles guiding China's
cooperation with South Asian countries in forging a "friendly and
good-neighborly relationship that is long-term, stable and
oriented toward the 21st century".
</P>
<P>
Joining the senators to listen to Jiang's speech were local
politicians, business executives, senior Islamabad-based diplomats
and local and foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
Also present were Pakistani President Farooq Ahmed Khan
Leghari, National Assembly Speaker Yousuf Raza Gillani and
Caretaker Prime Minister Malik Miraj Khalid.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also dealt with Sino-Pakistani relations
and briefed the 800-member-strong audience on China's economic
growth during his 20-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
The senators tapped on the tables in front of them to applaud
Jiang's speech as he pinpointed the ways to establish and maintain
friendship and seek common development while setting aside
disputes.
</P>
<P>
It is customary to tap on the tables instead of clapping hands
when senators applaud and express their agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president rated stability and development in South
Asia as a guarantee for peace and prosperity in Asia as a whole in
that South Asia is home to one third of Asia's population.
</P>
<P>
In a prelude speech, the Pakistani senate chairman described
Pakistani-Chinese relations as "being based on trust, mutual
regard and understanding for each other's point of view".
</P>
<P>
He hailed the relationship as a model of inter-state ties.
</P>
<P>
The senate chairman also thanked China for supporting his
country's principled stand on the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
He said a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir dispute would
remove the main irritant in the normalization of relations between
Pakistan and India and help in promoting peace in the region.

<HEADLINE> France Wants to Put Zairean Ambassador on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it wants
to put on trial Zairean ambassador to France Ramazani Baya, who
killed two French adolescents in a traffic accident on November 23
in Menton, southeast France.
</P>
<P>
"We ask Zaire to lift the (diplomatic) immunity of its
ambassador so that he could, as he has proposed himself, stand in
a French court of justice," said vice-spokesman of the French
Foreign Ministry Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Ramazani Baya ran over Raphael Lenoir and Ronald Lehartel, both
13, in a zone of priority over secondary roads on a highway, when
he was speeding in a rented car to meet President Mobutu Sese Seko
in the latter's private villa in southeast France.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that according to the Vienna Convention, a
diplomat is not exempted from the law of the country which sends
him, indicating that Zaire can use its own law to put Baya under
legal procedure.
</P>
<P>
Five thousand people demonstrated in Menton last Saturday to
protest the fatal accident, calling for the lifting of diplomatic
immunity of Baya.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Lenoir, father of Raphael Lenoir, said that he would
not accept any compensation from the government and only wanted to
see Baya be put on trial in France.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government has recalled Baya after the accident.

<HEADLINE> African Family Planning Meeting Held in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A five-day African regional
family planning conference started here today, aiming at
involving men in family planning activities.
</P>
<P>
In her opening address, Zimbabwe's Information, Posts and
Telecommunications Minister Joyce Mujuru said the success of
family planning programs in Africa depends on building a national
consensus on reproductive health issues involving both men and
women.
</P>
<P>
Mujuru said men should be provided with appropriate
information and education about sexual responsibility to
demystify family planning methods.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out when family planning services were first
introduced, they were targeted at the female population while men
were minimally involved.
</P>
<P>
''Men were a forgotten 50 percent in reproductive health
programs and their objectives were not clearly presented and this
to some extent created mistrust and misconceptions among the
general public, particularly in the minds of men,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Mujuru said, ''Family planning is all about sharing in the
daily responsibilities of parenthood, so men should be encouraged
to play their part. When men and women are aware of each other's
health needs, they are more likely to request or accept needed
services.''
</P>
<P>
More than 100 delegates from 15 African countries are
attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was chosen as the venue for the conference because of
its leadership role in Africa in promoting men's participation in
family planning. Through the Zimbabwe National Family Planning
Council's male motivation and family planning methods expansion
project.
</P>
<P>
This and other projects from Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria and
Swaziland will be used as case studies during the conference
which will provide participants with a model from which they
could formulate programs in their own countries.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Female Condom to Start in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Marketing of the female condom
will start in April or May next year, Zimbabwe's National AIDS
Coordination Program (NACP) Coordinator Everisto Marowa said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement the NACP has sought assistance of the
British Overseas Development Administration and the United States
Agency for International Development to assist in bringing the
condom for sale at the subsidized price.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe approved the sale of the female condom last month
after 30,000 women petitioned the government to ensure
availability of a female-controlled device for the prevention of
transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.
</P>
<P>
The Drugs Control Council also agreed to the sale of the
condom, which costs about two U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, with a population of 10.5 million people, has an
estimated one million people carrying HIV while it is estimated
that about 200,000 people would have developed full blown AIDS by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Women have perceived the condom as an empowerment tool which
would enable them to enhance their protection against HIV
infection.

<HEADLINE> US Construction Spending Scores Big Gain in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Construction spending in the
U.S. increased by 1.8 percent in October, the biggest gain in
seven months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that overall spending on construction
totaled a record 581.2 billion dollars at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate in the month, the largest increase since a 2.3 percent
gain last March.
</P>
<P>
It was the third straight advance after the U.S. construction
spending slipped by 0.8 percent in July. But the increase mainly
resulted from a jump of government spending other than the
important residential construction.
</P>
<P>
The report said that government spending rose by 4.3 percent in
October, to 150.1 billion dollars, after a 4.4 percent jump in
September.
</P>
<P>
But residential spending fell to 243.9 billion dollars, a
decline of 0.7 percent. Outlays for single-family homes, which
amount to nearly 30 percent of total spending, dropped by 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline in single-family outlays, the second straight drop,
followed a decline in housing starts in October to a 1.37 million
annual rate, the lowest since 1.35 million in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
Spending on multi-family projects such as apartments and
condominiums, which are not as sensitive to the change of mortgage
rate, increased by 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Non-residential spending jumped by 5.1 percent, including an
11.4 percent surge in outlays for factories and other industrial
buildings.

LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
here today that it did not see any reason to send a large-scale
multinational force to Zaire because of a comparatively small
number of refugees in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
British defense sources said that a British reconnaissance
mission over eastern Zaire had found the "comparatively small
number" of 20,000 refugees, compared with the UN's estimated
700,000 in the region.
</P>
<P>
One of two British battalions standing by to join an
international force was very much likely to be stood down this
weekend, they said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported 14 countries gave the go-ahead over a week ago
to send a Canadian-led international force to Zaire, but they were
still discussing details of the mission.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 countries including the United States, Britain,
France, Belgium and some African countries have decided to
contribute troops to the peace mission.

<HEADLINE> Serbia's Speaker Accuses Serb Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Serb government
official today accused opposition parties organizing mass protest
rallies as a means of seizing power.
</P>
<P>
"The protests held in the past days in Serbia were not caused
by the election results, but by a wish to seize power,"
Yugoslavia's official news agency Tanjug quoted Serbia's
Parliamentary Speaker Dragan Tomic as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two weeks, tens of thousands of people, led by
the four-party Zajedno (Together) coalition leaders, have held
demonstrations and rallies in the capital Belgrade to protest
against the government's decision to annul part of results of the
second round of municipal elections on November 17.
</P>
<P>
The Zajedno coalition had claimed victory in the election.
</P>
<P>
Tomic said the results of the local elections in Serbia
represented a big victory for the leftist coalition, which
consisted of the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia, the Yugoslav
Left and the New Democracy party, and which had won mandates in
about 150 of the 189 districts in the republic.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations under way in Belgrade are the largest
in Serbia since March 9, 1991. The demonstrations five years ago
were crushed by the police.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Serbia's Interior Ministry warned the protest
organizers to abide by the law or the police would "act in line
with the law to protect the safety of citizens and their
property."

aid was 124 million dollars, Power-Stevens said that donor
countries came up with just under half this amount.
</P>

In order to boost awareness of the acute problems facing
Afghanistan --- a country stricken by 17 years of continuous war
-- the UN in association with non-governmental aid agencies (NGOs)
has invited potential donor countries to attend its launch.
</P>

in the northern capital of Mazar-i-Sharif, another eight foreign
representatives will show their flag.

loss of limbs due to landmines, and deprivation of shelter due to
factional fighting are the daily realities in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Launches Campaigns Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has intensified its
efforts to fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic by launching
campaigns to raise the people's awareness about the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
Latest official statistics showed that a total of 4,344
carriers of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), including 80
foreigners, had been registered across Vietnam by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 353 had developed full-blown acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 184 had died.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology
estimated that HIV carriers in Vietnam would total 356,000 by the
year 2000 and 15,000 of them would be killed.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the epidemic further spreading in the country, the
government has taken the HIV/AIDS prevention program as one of the
major tasks in its socio-economic development plan.
</P>
<P>
A national AIDS committee has been established to coordinate
national and local agencies to encourage all people, particularly
youth, to be involved in an effective combat against the disease.
</P>
<P>
Facilities with broadcasting equipment are expected to be set
up in 5,000 communes across the country between now and 1997 as
part of joint efforts to warn local people of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
According to the government plan, by the year 2000, at least 90
percent of Vietnamese aged between 15 and 50 will be provided with
general knowledge about the epidemic and its devastating effects
so that they will know how to protect themselves against HIV.
</P>
<P>
They will also target young families across the country,
including 90 percent of households in 16 HIV/AIDS-prone cities and
provinces to lead a healthy, cultured life.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities are asked to develop detailed plans to ensure
drug addicts and prostitutes in all communes to reverse the trend
of rising infection rates.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic has reportedly spread across 41 of the total 53
provinces and cities. Of the victims, 90 percent are at the
working age.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Vietnam has received an aid package worth 10
million U.S. dollars for HIV/AIDS prevention. In addition to
United Nations' programs, the Vietnamese government has cooperated
with seven governmental and 10 non-governmental organizations in
the fight against AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Greek Farmers Continue Protest Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek farmers in the country's
northern prefectures of Salonika, Imathias, Pella and Pieria
continued their protest actions today by cutting off Western
Macedonia from the city of Salonika, demanding cheaper fuel and
increased subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Transport to northern Greece is at a standstill as National Bus
Company Lines is prevented from passing the blockades and the
farmers have also blocked the railway line at Larissa in central
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Using up to 5,000 tractors, farmers have placed road blocks at
a number of points on the Athens-Salonika national highway.
</P>
<P>
Another group of farmers have threatened to block access to
Salonika's Macedonia Airport but there has been no such action as
yet.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Aigion, in the Peloponnese, have blocked both the
new and old highways and the railway line in the town and there
were reports that they will block the Patras-Pyrgos road, a main
highway in the Peloponnese.
</P>
<P>
The protest actions have threatened to cause heavy losses to
the country's economy. According to the Federation of Industries
of Northern Greece today, the country's export firms were facing
inestimable damages due to the continuing blockade of roads by
farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Many members are facing serious difficulties in meeting
deliveries and the danger of the cancellation of orders from
abroad if the blockade of the country's major roads continues," an
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Exporters of fresh produce were expected to face enormous
problems in the next few days, it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, acting government spokesman Yiannis Nikolaou today
called on the farmers to show the same good faith and willingness
for dialogue as the government. The recently-tabled 1997 budget
would resolve many of the farmers' problems, he added.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the government "cannot solve in a few days
problems created over many years, nor can it solve certain problems
which directly imply a change in European agricultural strategy."

LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
here today that it did not see any reason to send a large-scale
multinational force to Zaire because of a comparatively small
number of refugees in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
British defense sources said that a British reconnaissance
mission over eastern Zaire had found the "comparatively small
number" of 200,000 refugees, compared with the UN's estimated
700,000 in the region.
</P>
<P>
One of two British battalions standing by to join an
international force was very much likely to be stood down this
weekend, they said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported 14 countries gave the go-ahead over a week ago
to send a Canadian-led international force to Zaire, but they were
still discussing details of the mission.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 countries including the United States, Britain,
France, Belgium and some African countries have decided to
contribute troops to the peace mission.

<HEADLINE> Sidebar Story: Jiang Reunites With Old Pals in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- It was a reunion of purae
dost (or old friends).
</P>
<P>
They first met 20 years ago and worked in close tandem for four
weeks and then they were separated by a hiatus of two decades.
</P>
<P>
When they finally reunited today, the old pals are already in
their fifties, sixties and even seventies, and most already
retired with only a few exceptions.
</P>
<P>
One exception is Jiang Zemin who came here in April 1976 as
head of an inspection squad of 30 but returned as the president of
a country of 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
The visiting president greeted the 11 old friends from the
Heavy Foundry and Forge Project and Heavy Mechanical Complex at
the entrance to his makeshift home at the Pakistani presidential
palace.
</P>
<P>
The old pals shook hands, bringing to mind the names and deeds
of each other.
</P>
<P>
Though they were apart for 20 years, the old pals could still
fetch out from deep memory the couple of words they had learned
from each other and used back then to greet and inform each other.
</P>
<P>
"I could still remember the words for the direction of right
and left," Jiang said before trying out his Urdu vocabulary.
"Bain for left and dain for right," said Jiang who was the foreign
affairs director of China's First Ministry of Machine Building
Industry when he came to Pakistan in 1976.
</P>
<P>
As soon as they met, old friendship overwhelmed the etiquette
reserved for presidential meetings inside the presidential
residence.
</P>
<P>
While looking at an old photograph of him on an inspection
round of the complex, Jiang said that he looked much thinner at
that time and all his Pakistani friends burst into heartfelt
laughter.
</P>
<P>
Jiang quoted an old Chinese saying that goes: "The elapse of
time is like a flying dart and the sun and the moon shuttle back
and forth."
</P>
<P>
Though time went by quickly, the Chinese president was clearly
remembered by his Pakistani friends as the chief inspector who
frequented the construction site to check whether the construction
and installation were being implemented in accordance with the
blueprint and to see if there was any impromptu problem.
</P>
<P>
"We were impressed with your brilliance, intellect, decision
making ability, professional acumen and leadership," Sheikh said
in an informal speech delivered on behalf of all Jiang's Pakistani
friends and the three CEOs of the mechanical complex who were also
present at today's reunion.
</P>
<P>
Jiang threw a family-style dinner for his friends, old and new,
who were treated to four courses of Chinese dishes and an
appetizing soup prepared by a Chinese chef.
</P>
<P>
The dishes were made of sea cucumber, fish, hatchling pigeon
and vegetables while the soup was made of sharp fins which are
believed by the Chinese to be a super delicacy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese host knew well as to serve his Islamic guests with
soft drinks instead of alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
Prior to settling down at the dinner table, Jiang and his
guests traded gifts with one another.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of all the Pakistanis at the reunion, Sheikh
presented Jiang with a pair of rocking chairs, a coffee table and
an album showcasing seven photographs of the Chinese president and
his Pakistani friends taken together in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, in return, presented each guest with a cloisonne vase, a
plate made of either china or cloisonne and a multi-band radio
set.
</P>
<P>
The old friends were sorted out from some old photographs kept
by Sheikh who is now chairing Pakistan's state engineering
corporation.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sheikh said: "We are proud of the fact that you are now
president of a great country."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Jiang will remain in the hearts of his
Pakistani friends who all wish him good health and a long life.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Calls for Exploiting Salt Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will earn more than
eight billion U.S. Dollars a year through exporting crude
salt-based products when the resources are maximally exploited, a
senior researcher said here today.
</P>
<P>
When fully exploited, the country can export about five
million tons of certain categories of crude salt like sea water,
inland brine and rock salt, according to Abdullahi Aliyu, chief
executive of the Raw Materials Research and Development Council.
</P>
<P>
Aliyu also suggested the establishment of a chlor-alkali plant
to process common salt into caustic soda, chlorine, hydrogen
peroxide, soda ash and hydrochloric acid.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigeria has had to import about 700 million
Dollars worth of the minerals a year to meet the demand of local
industries.

<HEADLINE> SADC Calls for Open Market in World Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende
today called for an end to quotas and for open markets in
developed countries to correct injustices in multilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
This was reported by the South African Press Association from
Windhoek, capital of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on the effects of liberalization on beef
and maize in Windhoek, Mbuende said: "Under the twin processes of
globalization and structural adjustments, industrialization will
be still-born in Africa unless something drastic is done."
</P>
<P>
Mbuende said developing and least-developed countries have
liberalized faster than developed countries, taking into
consideration the openness of markets in world trade.
</P>
<P>
The SADC countries have seen the negative social impact of
liberalization on employment and poverty, despite some positive
results on inflation reduction and macro-economic stability.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the SADC region is expecting an increased flow of
foreign investments leading to sustainable growth and development
from the process of liberalization, said Mbuende.
</P>
<P>
The SADC chief also urged the developed countries to abolish
quotas and open their markets to SADC products in an attempt to
correct injustices introduced into the world trading system
through structural adjustments in some member states.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> UK Building Societies Raise Mortgage Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Abbey National, Britain's
second-largest mortgage lender, triggered a new round of mortgage
rate rises today by increasing its borrowing rates by 0.25 points
to 7.29 percent as a direct response to last week's new budget.
</P>
<P>
The change will raise the payment on the average 50,000 pound
(84,000 US dollar) Abbey mortgage by 1.65 pounds (2.8 dollars) a
week.
</P>
<P>
The new rates will apply immediately to new borrowers, and to
existing borrowers after December 18.
</P>
<P>
Charles Toner, deputy chief executive of Abbey National, said
that the rate rise was a response to the 0.25 point rise in base
rates by the Bank of England on October 30.
</P>
<P>
Abbey National said it was raising rates now also because it
did not think base rates were likely to be raised again in the
short term.
</P>
<P>
"If the budget had been a giveaway, then another rate rise
would have come soon and we would have waited until then to avoid
having to raise rates twice," said Abbey National.
</P>
<P>
The mortgage lender, which has 12 million savers and 1.6
million borrowers, said that savers, who had been suffering from a
"low interest rate environment" for years, were the main target of
its rate changes.
</P>
<P>
Rates for savers will rise by between 0.25 percent and 0.5
percent, with the details to be announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Two other lenders today followed Abbey National's move and
increased their mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Rock announced today that it is raising its rate
by 0.5 percent and the Coventry by 0.26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other lenders, like the Halifax, the UK's biggest mortgage
lender, and the Woolwich, are thought likely to follow.

<HEADLINE> Elections in Zambia Calm: OAU Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The OAU Elections
Monitoring Team to Zambia said today despite disagreements over
the clauses of the new constitution, the elections in Zambia
generally took place in a calm, orderly and peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
A press release of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
issued here said, leader of the OAU team F. Maidera of Mozambique
has stressed that voting in Zambia last month was unfettered.
</P>
<P>
There was no perceptible evidence of any attempts to influence
or corrupt voters on the election day despite the fact that in
some polling stations some voters did not know how to vote and
had to be assisted, Maidera said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The OAU team was sent to Livingstone, Ndola and Chipata to
observe elections in South, on Copperbelt and in Eastern
Provinces as well as in Lusaka, in addition to local observers
including the women's lobby of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The release added national consensus, as observed by Maidera
in the just released report, on such important issues as the
constitution, an independent national electoral commission and
the process of voters' registration, would enhance sustainable
peace and stability not only in Zambia but also in the region and
Africa as a whole.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Leaders Take Tough Stance Against EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Institute of Directors
(IoD), which is composed of major British business leaders, has
launched a fierce attack on claims that Britain would benefit from
the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
In a briefing note entitled "The Dark Side of Euro" issued
today, IoD economic research executive Stephen Davies dismissed
suggestions that British membership of the single European
currency would mean higher growth, cheaper borrowing and lower
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"The more the economic arguments are analyzed for British
membership of EMU, the more convincing is the case for staying out
for the foreseeable future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also argued that membership of EMU would be "most unlikely
to have more than a transitory effect on British real interest
rates" and consequently little impact on economic growth.
</P>
<P>
British businessmen were also sceptical about the idea that
there would be little difference in the policies adopted by an
independent Bank of England and the proposed European Central Bank
(ECB), he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England "would set interest rates to achieve an
inflation objective for the UK. The ECB will set interest rates as
it judges appropriate for the EMU area on average."
</P>
<P>
"These will either be normally too high or too low for the UK,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Five Militants Sentenced to Death in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian State Security
Emergency Court today passed death sentences to five Moslem
militants on charges of terrorist crimes.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution had demanded the death penalty for 15 out of 32
defendants, who were implicated in the killings of eight police
officers and two civilians in 1993 in the province of Assiut, 320
kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The defendants are accused of illegal possession of firearms
and explosives, affiliation with Egypt's biggest anti-government
organization, the Islamic Group, and planning to topple the
incumbent government by force.
</P>
<P>
It took the court three months to finalize proceedings of the
case, which was conducted in more than 20 sessions after. The
trial was once suspended for two months after a defendant asked
to be tried before another judge. The court of appeal turned down
the request.
</P>
<P>
Standing behind bars, the defendants chanted anti-government
slogans and shouted "rule by God."
</P>
<P>
Judge Ahmed Aalah-Eddin Badour, however, refuted their claims
and branded them as "dissidents."
</P>
<P>
Under the Egyptian law, the death sentences passed out is
subject to an approval by the office of the mufti, the highest
religious leader appointed by the government. It is almost always
granted.
</P>
<P>
The country's Moslem militants have waged a campaign of
violence since 1992 in a bid to overthrow Egypt's secular
government and replace it with strict Islamic rule. More than
1,000 people have died in the conflict ever since.

<HEADLINE> UK's 3 Key Objectives for WTO: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A comprehensive program of work,
which carries forward trade liberalization, is Britain's key
objective for the ministerial conference of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in Singapore next week, a senior British
official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Outlining his three key objectives for the WTO Conference,
President of the British Board of Trade Ian Lang told a press
conference this afternoon that his first aim for Singapore was
agreement on a comprehensive program of work, carrying forward
trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
"A substantial work program is needed covering standards,
government procurement, tariffs, trade facilitation, rules of
origin and investment," Lang added.
</P>
<P>
On his second objective, Lang said he would seek the completion
of an Information Technology Agreement, at least in outline, aimed
at the progressive elimination of tariffs on ITA products with the
widest possible participation by WTO members countries.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, the president said "there should be real progress on
negotiations to liberalize basic telecommunications. Talks are
scheduled to conclude in February 1997."
</P>
<P>
Britain regarded the Singapore gathering of world trade
ministers as a "major opportunity" to canvass support for further
trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Ian Lang said that trade barriers still existed and in a global
market these should be eradicated.

MAPUTO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has called on the international community to protect
children's human rights.
</P>
<P>
Chissano's speech was read by Minister of Economic and Social
Affairs Eneas Comiche on the president's behalf when opening the
third International Conference on "Children, War and Prosecution

But "we will spare no effort in placing children's human
rights, survival, protection and development at the top of our
agenda," said the President.

<P>
According to the data from the U.N. Children's Fund, a total
of 250,000 Mozambican children and youth suffered psychological

them were sent to fight in the battlefields.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing third international congress on children and war
will last till Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Institute of Psychological Trauma of
Mozambique, it is attended by 300 delegates from 33 countries who

<HEADLINE> Defense Minister: Israeli Army Ready for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said today that the Israeli army is prepared
for any eventuality if the country's security is threated.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee of the
Knesset (Israel's parliament), Mordechai sharply criticized
senior army officers who told the Time magazine that Israel is not
ready for a war with Syria, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
In its latest edition, the Time magazine quoted a high-ranking
reserve officer as saying that the current situation remined him
somewhat of the things before the 1973 War when Israel was totally
caught by surprise.
</P>
<P>
Denying any authenticity to such report, Mordechai said he
thought the magazine misunderstood the army officer, if there was
actually anyone behind the report.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister told the Knesset committee that contrary
to the Time report, the Israeli army is prepared for all odds. "I
am sure that the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) have everything it
needs to carry out its mission."
</P>
<P>
"IDF, one of the modern forces in the world and one of the
strongest forces in the Middle East, has excellent commands,
excellent units, and all the capabilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mordechai reiterated Israel's strategy to continue the
peace process. "We are looking forward to continuing the peace
negotiations with Syria and all the other Arab countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said the Israeli army is closely
monitoring Syrian military development. He accused Syria of
rearming its forces with chemical weapons aided by Russia.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai also spoke of the need for a bigger defense budget to
enable the Israeli army to improve its combat capabilities.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies New Military Agreement With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish Foreign Ministry
official denied here today that Turkey had signed a new military
agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to clear up worries of the Middle East countries,
Deputy Foreign Ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that there
is nothing new to what has been agreed upon between Turkey and
Israel, a reference to the military training agreement and the
defense industry cooperation agreement signed between the two
countries earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Referring the joint military exercises to be held between
Turkey and Israel in 1997, the spokesman said: "I don't
have full information."
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Arab world, which is worried about the
agreements drawn up one after the other by Turkey and Israel,
would now feel even more uneasy over the joint manoeuvers
scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the military cooperation between the two countries
also came across criticism when Turkish Islamist Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan strongly slammed the 600-million-U.S.-dollar
Turkish-Israeli deal to refit Turkish F-4 fighters last week,
saying that Israel had to change its credit conditions if it wants
the contract.
</P>
<P>
According to the current package provided by Israel and the
upgrade deal, the first modernized F-4s would be delivered 33
months after the credit deal for the modernization was signed,
but Turkey would have to pay 150 million dollars in advance and
have to start repayments on the credit just 23 months after the
deal was signed.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said current credit conditions would raise the total
cost of the deal to around 800 million dollars, which was against
Turkey's state interests. He had asked the cabinet ministers
from the Welfare Party (RP) not to sign the agreement until he
allowed them to, despite the signing of the deal by the
ministers from RP's coalition partner the True Path Party.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Adopt Export Development Strategy in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The government of
Tanzania will in the near future adopt an export development
strategy so as to enhance economic growth and alleviate poverty
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Launching the U.N. Special Initiative on Africa
(UNSIA)-Tanzania here today, Principal Secretary to the Planning
Commission Richard Mariki said despite economic revival programs
taken by the government since mid 1980s, more efforts are
required to increase income in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mariki said despite all the efforts have been making, 53
percent of the population in Tanzania are still living below the
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
He said substantial economic growth could only be realized
from export development, greater participation of the private
sector, human resources development and development of social and
economic infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The principal secretary further said that a bill to effect
changes in the investment promotion policy to encourage greater
private sector participation in the economy is to be presented to
parliament next month.
</P>
<P>
The UNSIA initiative, which was launched last March, aims to
strengthen African capacities to take charge of the development
progress. It has 14 components, concentrated on basic education,
health, governance, food security, water and sanitation, and
peace building.
</P>
<P>
The principal secretary thanked the United Nations for the
initiative and proposed that African governments be the owners of
the program and not donors.
</P>
<P>
"The government should take charge of the formulation,
implementation and evaluation of programs and projects arising
from UN system and other external support," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during launching of the program, UNDP country
representative Victor Angelo said the initiative was aimed at
identifying and developing practical proposals to maximize the
support provided by the UN system to Africa development, and
raise the priority given to Africa in the international agenda.
</P>
<P>
Costs and details of of the UNSIA-Tanzania are not immediately
known. However, according to a report, the UN system wide special
initiative on the whole Africa is budgeted to cost 25 billion
U.S. Dollars in a ten years period.
</P>
<P>
The Launching of the country's UN special initiative on Africa
was attended by heads of UN agencies in the country, ambassadors
and high commissioners accredited here and senior government
officials.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM, Palestinian Speaker Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti held here today consultations with Palestinian
Council Speaker Ahmed Queria over the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations on the long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the
West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Their talks also focused on the regional and international
efforts to bypass the current crisis and overcome hurdles in the
way of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the negotiations with Israel, the Palestinian
legislator said there was nothing encouraging whatsoever and
Israel was still trying to amend the peace deal and renegotiate
various issues.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians would continue to insist that the
peace agreement be implemented and Israeli violations, including
settlement expansion, cease.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and the Palestine National Authority (PNA) intensified
their coordination and consultation in the past week after the
Palestinians and Israelis failed to reach an agreement on the
long-delayed Israeli redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti visited the Palestinian self-rule areas last Thursday
and discussed with the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and obstacles facing them.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told the Jordanian prime minister here Saturday en
route to the United Arab Emirates that the negotiations had
produced no tangible results.
</P>
<P>
The intense coordination and consultation between the
Palestinians and Jordanians coincided with Jordan's sharp
criticism of Israeli hardline government headed by Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu for its failure to abide by the peace
agreements it signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti recently accused Netanyahu of double talk in Middle
East peacemaking, saying that Jordan was frustrated over hearing
something from Israel but seeing something else on the ground.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Politician Demands Ouster of British Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot party leader today
called for an all-out campaign to send packing the two British
bases in southern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"It would not be feasible for the British bases to leave
Cyprus at present but that does not mean we do not want them to
leave," Socialist Edek Party leader Vassos Lyssarides told a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he pointed out, Cyprus has neither the
international backing nor the power to abolish the status of
the bases.
</P>
<P>
Lyssarides' remarks followed calls from President of the House
of Representatives Spyros Kyprianou to raise the issue of the
presence of the British bases.
</P>
<P>
After years of struggle against British colonial rule, Cyprus
gained independence in 1960. But under the 1960 Treaty, Britain
retained two military bases on Cyprus' southern coast and other
facilities in various parts of this East Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, Britain appears to be a friendly country and
on the other it has been the cause of much calamity right from the
start," Lyssarides said.
</P>
<P>
The Edek leader has also lashed out at a proposed meeting
between British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in the Turkish-controlled part of
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time something like this happens, and
Britain must understand that we shall not stand idle and be
slapped in this manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind is expected to arrive in Cyprus for a 24-hour visit in
mid-December to discuss the Cyprus problem with Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has rejected a statement by Rifkind last week that
Cyprus' accession to the European Union would be very difficult
if the country is not reunited.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized 37 percent of the island following an Athens-backed
coup.

<HEADLINE> More New Gold Medal Winners in UK Public Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A record breaking 323 public
services in Britain have won a 1996 Charter Mark, the prestigious
award for organizations which provide an excellent service to
millions of people who use them.
</P>
<P>
The number of award winners for 1996 is 99 more than last year
-- 323 against 224 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Charter Mark scheme was launched in 1992 when up to 50
awards were available. They are awarded for three years, after
which organizations must apply to renew their award.
</P>
<P>
To win a second Charter Mark organizations have to be able to
show real improvements in service since they first won the award.
</P>
<P>
Any public service providing a service direct to the public
which controls its own budget is eligible to apply for a Charter
Mark.
</P>
<P>
Charter Mark winners receive a trophy and a certificate, signed
by the prime minister. They have the right to use the Charter Mark
logo on their stationery etc for three years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the awards ceremony here today, Deputy Prime
Minister Michael Heseltine said, "Charter Mark winners are not
winners because they get more money than other services. They are
winners because they are committed to quality."
</P>
<P>
"Charter Mark measures what is most important to all of us --
the quality of service we actually receive," he added.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine reminded the winners of the important role their own
users had in acting as a stimulus to improved services. He said,
"We want people right across the country to have the reassurance
of knowing that they will get a Charter Mark level of service."
</P>
<P>
Charter Mark is now an established award for excellent public
services in Britain. This year there is a significant increase in
the number of schools, further education colleges and hospitals
which have won.
</P>
<P>
Public Service Minister Roger Freeman said at the awards
ceremony, "Nearly 3,000 organizations have now applied for the
award and there were 645 Charter Mark winners in Britain."
</P>
<P>
Britain is now well on course for its target of 2,000 award
holders by the year 2000, Freeman added.

JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Development Community (SADC) would support a call to lift the ban
on trading in elephant products at an international conference in
Zimbabwe next year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Windhoek, SADC Executive Secretary
Kaire Mbuende said elephants in southern Africa are not an
endangered species; therefore, "we don't understand those who are
against trade in elephant products," the South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
There are large elephant populations in Zimbabwe, Malawi,
South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. Quite a number of elephants
were killed in some of these countries in the past few years
because they posed a threat to human beings and brought serious
damages to the farms.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Mbuende said: "We would like to push a line
that will allow us to cull elephants at the next Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Harare."
</P>
<P>
The CITES banned trade in elephant products, mainly ivory, in
1989 to discourage the poaching of animals of endangered species.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade
Unions (COSATU) held a meeting here today to discuss a new-look
alliance with the African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
In terms of a recently-released COSATU's draft program, the
ANC-led tripartite alliance is not functioning and ANC structures
are in disarray.
</P>
<P>
The program also proposed an accord binding the ANC to
policies negotiated with its partners, and a minimum framework
for the Reconstruction and Development Program.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, SACP Deputy General
Secretary Jeremy Cronin said his party is interested in the
COSATU's program for a new-look alliance, but the document needs
more work.
</P>
<P>
"We are very interested in the proposal, not necessarily as a
pact but certainly as a program of action," said Cronin.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after the meeting, the SACP and the
COSATU said, however, they are concerned that political oversight
over the process of change is being lost.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed a clear program is needed as a basis for
going forward, believing a socialist perspective is essential for
deepening democracy in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The meeting further reaffirmed the ANC's central role and the
COSATU and SACP's commitment to the ANC-led alliance.

<HEADLINE> Peres Concerned over Stalemate of Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel's opposition leader
and former prime minister Shimon Peres today expressed his deep
concern over the stalemate of the Middle East peace process,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the caucus of the Labor Party in the Knesset
(parliament) here this afternoon, Peres said that the crisis in
the Israeli-Palestinian talks will affect the entire Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He said that peace negotiations with Syria are delayed
indefinitely and this will result in many casualties of the
Israeli troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Peres, one of the architects of the Oslo agreement signed at
the White House Lawn on September 13, 1993, lost to the rightwing
Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu in the May 29 elections. But he
vowed to continue his pursuit of peace between Israel and its Arab
neighbors and of the creation of what he called a new Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He warned that 1997 will be critical in the relations between
Israel and the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Peres stated that he had never said conditions were ripe for
a national unity government, but a new reality could create a
situation calling for the establishment of such a government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister David Levy tried to play down the
current wave of Arab verbal attacks on Israel, particularly on
Prime Minister Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Levy told Israel Radio that the attacks were aimed at
isolating Israel in the international arena. But he added that
this will pass and there is no reason for panic.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Israel must continue dialogue with
Arab neighbors to advance the peace process, and, at the same
time, seek support from friends in Europe and the United States
against the Arab campaign.

TUNIS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
arrived in the Libyan capital of Tripoli Monday afternoon and was
welcomed by leader of the Libyan revolution colonel Muammar
Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
In an arrival statement to the Libyan News Agency, Mubarak said

the commitment to relevant U.N. resolutions and the principle of
land-for-peace in realizing a just and comprehensive peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's visit to Libya was not previously announced.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been under a U.N. ban on air travel and limits on
diplomatic relations since 1992 after Libya refused to hand over
two Libyans allegedly involved in the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner that killed 270 people over Lockerbie, Scotland.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Warlord Alleges Attack by Other Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Fighters loyal to warlord
Charles Taylor have accused a rival group of attacking their
positions in Grand Gedeh County in northeastern Liberia,
according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) said through
Taylor's private radio station in Monrovia, capital of Liberia,
that rival fighters from the Liberia Peace Council (LPC) on
Saturday attacked its position in Tuzona, some 280 kms east of
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Tuzona is the home of Liberia's late president Samuel Doe.
</P>
<P>
The NPFL described the renewed attack as "provocative by
unscrupulous and lunatic people", adding that it was "flagrant
violation of the revised Abuja accord by the LPC."
</P>
<P>
In a press statement over the radio, the NPFL said it "will
not continue to yield to acts of provocations," while calling on
the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) to "speedily create
a buffer" to end the factional clashes between the rival factions
in the area.
</P>
<P>
The faction said it was prepared to withdraw its forces from
Tuzona to Toetown, 250 kms east of the capital, to allow the
ECOMOG to deploy and create a buffer between the belligerent
forces.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the ECOMOG deployed forces in Tappita, 215 kms east
of Monrovia, to create a buffer between the NPFL and the LPC, but
reports of factional skirmishes in the area have prevented the
peacekeepers from further doing so, the report said, quoting
ECOMOG sources.

<P>
BEIRUT, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
today expressed his hope that China will play a greater role in
the stagnant Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hariri described the Middle East peace process as having
reached "cross-roads," saying he hoped that China, in its capacity
as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, would play a
greater role in bolstering the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made the remarks here this evening while meeting with Ji

<P>
He added that Lebanon is undergoing a reconstruction phase, and

On his part, Ji said that China supports the peace process on

the Arabs for the implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolution 425, which stipulates the unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon and west Bekaa.

<HEADLINE> Plavsic Satisfied with Equal Treatment of Bosnia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic said Monday she was satisfied with the equal treatment of
Bosnia's two entities, the Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat
Federation, on the part of Britain that will host a conference on
Bosnia on December 4-5.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before leaving for London, Plavsic said
officials of the two entities had been invited to the conference
together with officials of the Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
because further implementation of the Dayton peace accords largely
depended on them, Tanjug news agency reported from Banja Luka, the
largest city in Serb territories.
</P>
<P>
Describing such an attitude as positive, Plavsic said all
aspects of the implementation of the peace agreement would be
discussed at the London conference on the strength of High
Representative for Bosnia Carl Bildt's report.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the recent conflict between Muslim refugees and
Serbs in northeastern Bosnia, the Serb president said attempts to
populate the Zone of Separation with armed soldiers constituted a
major obstacle to the implementation of the peace agreement,
adding the NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) was well
aware that the attempts had nothing to do with the repatriation of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic also said the issue of Brcko and international aid to
Bosnia would also be on the agenda. The Republika Srpska had
received only between 1-2 percent of the international funds sent
to Bosnia so far.
</P>
<P>
Brcko is a town in northeastern Bosnia, situated at the
corridor linking northwestern and eastern parts of the Republika
Srpska. The status of the controversial town was supposed to be
solved later this year under the Dayton agreement.

BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor Li
Guixian expressed the hope here today that Fujitsu Ltd of Japan
would reinforce its co-operation with China in electronic

</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Fujitsu's president, Tadashi Sekizawa, Li
expressed satisfaction with the fruits of the cooperation achieved
so far between Fujitsu and the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
Since electronic telecommunications, one of China's pillar
industries, will surely witness rapid development during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), Li said, he hoped that Fujitsu
would take advantage of this to make its ties with the Chinese
side closer.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked the company for its efforts to help train
Chinese computer software professionals, saying this is beneficial
to both sides from a long-term perspective.

both software development and personnel training.

<HEADLINE> China To Open Energy Sector Wider: Senior Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China will consistently promote
overseas cooperation in the energy industry to support the
country's rapid development, She Jianming, vice-minister of the
State Planning Commission (SPC), stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the "Energy Efficiency Improvements: Coal

He said that China will actively seek and use loans from
international financial institutions, foreign governments, export
credits and commercial credits, while attracting direct overseas
investment via joint ventures, BOT and project finance.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is faced with a gigantic task in energy
construction.
</P>
<P>
In power industry, he said, China still needs to build some
large hydropower and nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
"In the coastal regions, where the economy is more developed
and the shortage of energy is more apparent, China will develop
nuclear power stations to an appropriate degree, increasing the
domestic content of the nuclear power station equipment while
importing overseas technology and equipment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China will also broaden the spheres of
cooperation with overseas businessmen in oil exploration and
extraction both offshore and onshore.
</P>
<P>
He said that, while maintaining a stable crude oil output in
the eastern part of the country, China will try to build the
middle and western parts of China into new crude oil production
bases in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Other spheres for Sino-overseas cooperation are coal, wind
power energy, solar energy, renewable energy sources development
and clean technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day seminar, attended by about 200 Chinese and
overseas officials and specialists, She said that China will also
pay great attention to conserving energy as well as to finding
more energy sources in the coming 15 years.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that China will produce more than 1.4 billion
tons of coal, 155 million-165 million tons of crude oil, 25
billion cu m of natural gas and 140 million kwh of electricity by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
China's primary energy production and consumption reached 1.287
billion tons and 1.29 billion tons of standard coal last year
respectively, making China the second-largest energy producer in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of coal in the total primary energy dropped to 75
percent while those of crude oil, natural gas and hydropower rose
17 percent, two percent and seven percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The IEA, established in 1974, has 23 industrialized nations,
which include Australia, the Netherlands, Germany and Turkey. The

<HEADLINE> Bahrain's Emir Reaffirms Boycott of GCC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Emir of Bahrain Sheikh Isa
Bin Suleiman al-Khalifa has reaffirmed that his country wouldn't
participate in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit due to
be held in the Qatari capital of Doha on December 7-9.
</P>
<P>
A written message to this effect has been conveyed through
diplomatic channels to Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa al
Thani, Bahraini press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain's decision to boycott the Doha summit is due to the
Bahraini-Qatari border dispute. The two countries disputed over a
chain of islands and shoals, territorial water boundaries and the
Zubara land strip in Qatar, where Bahrain's ruling family lived
200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said Monday that the emir of Qatar had announced
that he was ready to go personally to Bahrain in order to invite
his Bahraini counterpart to attend the Doha summit.
</P>
<P>
The other GCC members, including Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates, have done their best to solve the
Bahraini-Qatari dispute and convince Bahrain of attending the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The GCC was formed in 1981 to strengthen economic and
political ties among the oil-rich Gulf countries.

<HEADLINE> Japan July-September GDP Grows Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan's gross domestic product
(GDP) rose a real 0.1 percent in July-September from the previous
quarter, the government said today.
</P>
<P>
The slight growth in Japan's inflation-adjusted GDP underscored
that economic recovery is only moderate, the Economic Planning
Agency (EPA) said.
</P>
<P>
The growth, annualized at 0.4 percent, came after the Japanese
economy shrank at a revised annual rate of 1.1 percent in
April-June, the EPA said. In the January-March quarter, the
economy registered a strong growth of 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference following the release of the GDP data, EPA
Vice Minister Shimpei Nukaya said, "The latest statistics indicate
that the Japanese economy is continuing to stage a recovery,
although the pace is moderate."
</P>
<P>
The marginal GDP growth in the latest period stemmed mainly
from this summer's sluggish personal consumption amid the e-coli
food-poisoning epidemic, Nukaya said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand pushed GDP down by 0.2 percent, while external
demand pushed GDP by 0.3 percent, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of the
GDP aggregate, declined 0.1 percent, and corporate capital
spending, another pillar, rose 1.6 percent, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The nation's real gross national product (GNP) -- GDP plus net
income from abroad -- grew 0.5 percent, or at an annual rate of
2.0 percent, in the July-September quarter, it said.

<HEADLINE> Swedish PM Urges OSCE to Focus More on Pan-European Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Prime Minister Goran
Persson said today that the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) should focus more on pan-European
security.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the OSCE summit in Lisbon on Monday, Persson urged
the OSCE, which is in danger of being overshadowed by the
expansion of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), to pay more attention to the security matters
of the whole Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said it was necessary to find pan-European cooperation
patterns which went beyond the frontiers which existed for NATO, the
EU and the Western European Union.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also welcomed the agreement reached on
Monday between 30 OSCE countries (NATO countries and former Warsaw
pact countries) to make changes to the Conventional Forces in
Europe (CFE) pact to adapt the accord to the new geo-political
climate in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The pact, which commits many of the 54 OSCE states to cut
military hardware such as tanks, aircraft and artillery, was
concluded during the Cold War. Russia claims that with the
dissolution of the Soviet Union, NATO forces are superior and a
new balance of power must be worked out.
</P>
<P>
The two-day OSCE summit, bringing together more than 50 leaders
from Europe and North America, has discussed issues ranging from
Russia and NATO enlargement to peacekeeping in Bosnia.

<P>
TUNIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestinian
Council, Ahmed Queria, has ruled out the possibility of purchasing
the Israeli settlements that the Palestinians hope to be evacuated
under a final-status agreement.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by Tunisian newspaper Assabah today,
he emphasized that settlement was an illegal act of aggression on
Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official, who had recently visited Tunisia,
said that talking about purchasing one's rights from the party
that usurped them was a philosophy that sounded unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the Israeli missiles deployed along
the joint border with both Syria and Lebanon, as well as the
possibility of the outbreak of a war in the region, Queria said he
could not exclude the possibility.
</P>
<P>
Queria added that Israel, if it wants peace, has to accept the
terms of peace in their entirety, and has to take its obligations
seriously on both the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, as well as the
Palestinian one, otherwise it will meet with complications with
the Palestinians and all the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the U.S. policy towards the Middle East peace
process, the Palestinian official said that the U.S. is required
to act as an arbitrator, not as a mediator.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Rejects Multilateral Agreement on Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia still rejects the
attempts by some developed countries to control international
investment through the Multilateral Agreement on Investment
scheduled to be discussed at the upcoming World Trade Organization
(WTO) meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia needs foreign investment and it is the concerned
country, not the international forum, which has the right to
decide on the kinds of investment and where investments could be
done," Minister for Industry and Trade Tungky Ariwibowo said here
today after meeting with President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Ariwibowo will attend the first WTO ministerial conference
scheduled for December 9-13 in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Once investment is arranged internationally, he said, every
country which hopes for investments will no longer have the
freedom to decide what kinds of investment that country badly
needs.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming WTO meeting, he said it has been proposed
that the agenda should include the arrangement of investment, the
agreement on information technology products and textiles, and the
purchase of goods and services by governments.
</P>
<P>
The economics ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) have rejected the inclusion of the Multilateral
Agreement on Investment in the agenda of the WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has also rejected efforts to include issues which have
nothing to do with trade affairs, such as corruption and social
causes, in the WTO conference agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia wants to express its dissatisfaction on the
implementation of the textile and garments agreement and demands
that importing countries fulfill their obligation to abolish the
quota for qualified goods imposed on exporters," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia also has a clear position that the WTO must not
discuss irrelevant issues such as human rights and labor rights,
he added.

TEHRAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Venezuela announced
here today that the two countries decided to upgrade their
diplomatic relations and exchange ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued by Iran and Venezuela said:" The
governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Venezuela have
decided to upgrade diplomatic relations and exchange ambassadors."
</P>
<P>
Tehran-Caracas ties had been strained since 1994 following
allegations by the Venezuelan government that some of the
Iranian embassy staff tried to force an Iranian family to
return to Iran.
</P>
<P>
But the Iranian Foreign Ministry denied such a claim and
said that Venezuelan government took the action to reduce
the diplomatic relations because Iran did not give vote for
the Venezuelan candidate for the presidency of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that following
constant contacts and proving baselessness of the allegations,
the two countries expressed the willingness to upgrade ties to
the ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Venezuela are both members of the OPEC.

BRUSSELS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today announced a package of humanitarian aid worth 2.2
million Ecus (2.9 million U.S. dollars) to civilian victims
of the conflict in the breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The aid, managed via the European Community Humanitarian
Office (ECHO), will enable the International Committee of the Red

relief program.
</P>
<P>
This will bring ECHO aid for victims of the crisis to a
total of 33.4 million Ecus (about 45 million dollars) since the
beginning of the war.
</P>
<P>
The 21-month conflict ended officially in August. An estimated
40,000 people, mainly civilians, died in the war between Chechen
rebels and Russian troops. But the situation in the whole region
is still volatile, and the population there remains heavily
dependent on foreign humanitarian assistance.

TOKYO,December 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan is trying to team up with
China and South Korea to gain the lead in the race to develop
mobile phones that can make calls to anywhere in the world, a
major daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Asahi Shimbun said that Japan's Post and Telecommunications
Ministry has already agreed with its South Korean counterpart on
an exchange of technologies. The two countries will use the same
mobile phone terminals during the World Cup soccer finals in 2020,
which they are jointly hosting.
</P>
<P>
Japan will hold its first talks with China on December 13 in
Beijing on a joint experiment ahead of the targeted debut of the
advanced mobile phones in 2000, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Europe, the United States and Japan use
different frequencies and wireless communication systems, so users
in different countries cannot make calls to each other.
</P>
<P>
Only when the frequencies and systems are standardized, will
mobile phone users be able to make and receive international calls.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese telecommunications ministry launched a study group
in October with phone-makers in the United States, Europe and
South Korea in its move to begin a comprehensive development of
mobile phones in fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the world's first developer of mobile phones, was left
behind as Europe's GSM system prevailed worldwide, and is
determined not to be left behind in this development.

TEHRAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government is ready
to have dialogue with the United Arab Emirates at any level to
solve the problem on the disputed islands in the Gulf, a senior
Iranian official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi said at a press
conference: "We don't have any problems with any of our neighbors
to have dialogue."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome any kind of dialogue at any level, either on the
level of foreign minister or deputy foreign minister, it doesn't
matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We used to have dialogue with UAE. Dr. Velayati went
to Abu Dhabi and had long discussion. We used to have a
dialogue. It has been about three months since we have not had
any. But we will have in the future."
</P>
<P>
"Our new ambassador there has a mandate to talk with them and
arrange a good meeting. He used to be our director general for
the Persian Gulf affairs," he added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the statement by the senior Foreign
Ministry official is a positive response to the call by UAE
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Al Nahyan for dialogue between the two
sides on the disputed islands in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi also voiced the
readiness of the Iranian government for talks with the UAE but
reiterated that the three islands in the Gulf belong to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi expressed his government's welcome to the willingness
of Sheikh Zayed for bilateral talks to remove the
misunderstandings on the subject and emphasized that "Iran has
always announced its readiness and good intention to peacefully
solve the problem with its Muslim neighbor UAE."
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need to resolve existing misunderstandings
through friendly talks in order to foil what he called the "plots
of foreigners" in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Today's English daily Tehran Times published an editorial,
calling "Misunderstanding with the UAE should be settled through
bilateral talks."
</P>
<P>
The editorial termed the statement by the UAE president
"contradictory" regarding the disputed islands.
</P>
<P>
The three Iranian-held islands of Abu Musa, Lesser Tunb and
Greater Tunb are also claimed by the UAE. The islands are
strategically located on the route of two thirds of the world's
oil near the Strait of Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has said that it will refer the dispute with Iran to
the International Court of Justice in the Hague. However, Iranian
officials have rejected the demand.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Attends Civic Reception in Lahore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAHORE, Pakistan, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin today reiterated that friendly relations and
cooperation between China and Pakistan have developed rapidly with
effective results.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told a civic reception given in his honor late in the day
and attended by over 1,000 citizens from Lahore that the rapid
development and effective results were achieved thanks to the
concerted efforts of the successive governments and peoples of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He cited as proof of bilateral cooperation such projects as the
Taxila Heavy Mechanical Complex, Karakoram Highway, Saindak
Copper-Gold Mines and Chashma Nuclear Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have shown fully that the Sino-Pakistani friendship is
deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and can stand the tests
of time and meet the challenges of the international storm," the
Chinese visitor said.
</P>
<P>
The friendship was overwhelming as hundreds of students, folk
dancers and musicians gathered around main crossroads to greet the
Chinese visitor who came in by the special plane of Pakistani
President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari who accompanied Jiang on the
trip to Lahore and is to see him off early on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some primary and middle school students turned out at the civic
reception. The students, in their Sunday best, lined up a neat
path leading up to the central podium set up inside a local park
which is dedicated to Pakistan's founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president extended his gratitude to the reception
host and described the occasion as "another opportunity to meet
friends from various circles and renew friendship".
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised Pakistan as a country that has nurtured an
ancient civilization and said that the new look of Lahore
demonstrates the progress, prosperity and development the country
now enjoys.
</P>
<P>
Jiang visited Lahore in early 1976 when he led a Chinese
inspection team to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Lahore municipal administrator Tariq Shafi Chak said at the
reception that his people always throw cordial welcomes to Chinese
visitors as they treasure the visits by their Chinese brothers.
</P>
<P>
"Bilateral relations have enjoyed sustained development in the
past half century," the municipal administrator said.
"Mutually-beneficial cooperation has climbed up a new level as
China and Pakistan have set up some sister cities and sister
provinces."
</P>
<P>
Chak said that bilateral cooperation is developing in the
fields of economy, education, science, technology, industry,
culture and sports.
</P>
<P>
Present at the reception were Pakistani President Leghari,
Punjab Province Governor Khawaja Ahmed Tariq Rahim.
</P>
<P>
Along the street from the State Guest House to the Jinnah Park
were streamers showing slogans in Chinese and English praising the
Sino-Pakistani friendship.
</P>
<P>
One slogan read "Pak-China friendship all-weather friendship"
while another said "Pak-China friendship higher than the
Karakoram".
</P>
<P>
Karakoram is a high mountain located in between China and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Punjab governor is giving a banquet this evening in honor
of Jiang who is on a a three nation South Asian tour which had
earlier brought him to India and will take him to Nepal tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Evictions of Muslims Continue in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 Muslim families
have been evicted from a northwestern village by Bosnian Serbs
over the past two and a half months, defying a peace agreement
that stipulated a halt to such actions, a U.N. spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
Two Muslim families have been expelled in the past few days
from the village of Dubrava, near Bosanska Gradiska in northern
Bosnia, said Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for the U.N. international
police monitors in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Seven to 10 families, sensing lack of safety, have left the
area of their own accord, he said.
</P>
<P>
The expulsions were carried out by Bosnian Serbs who lost their
homes in central Bosnia last year when the area was captured by
the Muslim-led Bosnian army.
</P>
<P>
"Local authorities are doing nothing to stop them (the
evictions)," said Ivanko.
</P>
<P>
During the 43-month war, Bosnia's three ethnic factions fought
one another and displaced over half of the population. They were
obliged to stop further evictions under the Dayton peace accord
signed last December which ended the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"It is outrageous that one year after Dayton we again see
minorities being thrown out of their homes," Ivanko said.

trio, world No. 1 Pete Sampras, second ranked Michael Chang and
Todd Martin all pulled out because of injury.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Secret Coordination with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran today denied any secret
coordination with Syria on the critical issue of alleged
involvement in the bombing of U.S. base in Saudi Arabia in
June.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi said at a press
conference here that the current visit by Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati to Syria was normal.
</P>
<P>
Some Arabian sources said that the main agenda of Velayati's
visit to Damascus was to coordinate stance with Syria on the
American pressure on Saudi Arabia to name Iran and Syria for the
involvement in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Actually this is the second visit by the Iranian foreign
minister to Syria in three month. Velayati was reported to
carry a special message from Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
to his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi said: "Our relations with Syria are good. We have high
level exchange of delegations every one or two months."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Our bilateral relations with Syria are very huge
and we both have common interests in the region. We exchange
views on a lot of issues regularly and usually."
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's official news agency IRNA, Iranian
Foreign Minister Velayati conferred with his Syrian counterpart
Farouk al-Shara Monday. The two sides discussed the latest
developments in the region, with both condemning Israel as the
main source of tension and instability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the bombing in Saudi Arabia in June, the
Iranian government denied "any form of Iran's involvement" in
the Dhahran explosion which killed 19 U.S. soldiers and injured
386 others.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, accused
both the United States and Israel of brewing joint plots to
mar the prestige of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Visits Tunisia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held tete-a-tete talks with Tunisian President Zine al Abidine Ben
Ali today, after he flew from Libya to the southern Mediterranean
country on a 24-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will hold a joint conference at the end of
the meeting at al-Saada Palace in Jerba city, 500 kilometers south
of Tunis.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's visit falls within the brotherly relations between
the two presidents, said Egyptian Ambassador to Tunisia Mokhilis
Kotb.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia and Egypt are interested in the peace process and are
equally keen on activating its tracks.
</P>
<P>
"Israel must honor all its previous obligations and implement
all agreements signed with the Palestinian Authority," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel also has to abide by the land for peace principle and
the withdrawal from all occupied Arab lands including the Golan
Heights, south Lebanon and the West Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries hold identical view regarding the relations
between the northern and southern countries on the Mediterranean
coast, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are keen to encourage dialogue between the
northern and southern Mediterranean Sea, he added.
</P>
<P>
European countries, namely France, Italy, Spain and Portugal,
have decided to establish a military force capable of intervening
in the countries of the southern Mediterranean basis.
</P>
<P>
The southern coast of the Mediterranean, which is deemed to
include Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya and Egypt, was quick to
voice opposition to such a force. Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan
went ahead with plans to form their own military task force.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Cairo and Tunis have expanded recently,
especially in the economic field and trade exchange between the
two countries has increased, he said.
</P>
<P>
Several joint investment projects are under study, he said,
adding that the Tunisian-Egyptian Committee under their premiers
will meet in early March, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries resumed diplomatic relations in January 1988,
nine years after Tunisia severed ties with Egypt, which signed the
Camp David Accord with Israel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak ended a two-day visit to Libya, where he held talks
with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi Monday in the Libyan capital
Tripoli on Mideast and bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also reviewed joint electricity and railway
projects, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been under U.N.-imposed bans on air travel and arms
sales and limits on its diplomatic missions abroad since 1992
because Gadhafi has refused to hand over two Libyans suspected in
the 1988 bombing of an American airliner that killed 270 people
over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has been trying to work out an end to the sanctions. But
Britain and the U.S. have refused to try the two men in the World
Court in the Hague, in Scotland or in another neutral country.
</P>
<P>
Gadhafi was last in Egypt in June when he violated the air
travel sanctions and flew to Cairo to attend an Arab summit.

The oil contracts signed by Iraq and foreign companies will be
sent to the U.N. sanctions committee following their conclusion and
checking by four supervisors from Russia, Norway, the U.S. and
France.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will export 800,000 barrels of oil a day worth 1 billion
U.S. dollars every three months through Al-Bakr port in the south
of the country and the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Iraqi oil facilities have been ready
for months for export through the two ports.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Iraq has huge oil exporting potential and the
amount allowed to be exported under the oil-for-food deal
constitutes only a quarter of Iraq's capacity through Al-Bakr and
Al-Ameeq ports.
</P>
<P>
Iraq signed the oil-for-food deal with the U.N. in May this
year, under which Iraq is allowed to export 2 billion dollars
worth of oil in six months to buy food and medicine for its people
who have been suffering over six years of U.N. embargo.

NEW DELHI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- As the world today observed
the international day for disabled, India's joint action committee
for the rights of disabled organized a demonstration and a protest
rally in New Delhi demanding speedy implementation of law for
disabled.
</P>

</P>
<P>
They also submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister Deve Gowda,
demanding a time-bound program for rehabilitation of the deaf and

included the appointments of commissioners in states within three
months, constitution of central and state coordination committees
and a central executive committee for proper implementation of the
laws on the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Disabled activists resolved to intensify their stir if the

<HEADLINE> Asian Development Bank Grants Loan to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
will help fund a project to promote marine aquaculture in China's
Bohai and Yellow seas, the ADB announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 185 million U.S. dollars, nearly half of
which is expected to come from the ADB's loan.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based bank said that the project area is one of the
most intensively fished places in the world and accounts for about
30 percent of the total marine fishery landings in China.
</P>
<P>
Over 90,000 registered fishing vessels employing over one
million people operate in these waters and their hauls have long
exceeded the levels deemed sustainable in the 1980s, it said.
</P>
<P>
The resulting disappearance of large predatory fish has led to
the rapid increase in the number of their prey -- sardines and
anchovies, which are now the main fish caught.
</P>
<P>
The bank warned that the fishing industry would face a collapse
once these stocks are depleted.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB, a major component of the project -- North
China Marine Culture and Coastal Resources Management -- is to
help fishing families move from fishing to working in 30 to 35
processing ventures of marine culture and aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
The project is described by the bank as the best solution to
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the ADB announced its approval of a
4.9-million-dollar concession loan to Tonga to improve the
country's electricity service.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Macao government has decided
to distribute cotton-padded quilts to street vagrants next week as
the weather turns colder.
</P>
<P>
Maria Ferreira, director of the Social Affairs Department, said
Monday that the government has prepared quilts and is ready to
distribute them to more than 50 street sleepers from next week.
</P>
<P>
"The Social Affairs Department has always paid attention to
those roamers, and has repeatedly advised them to move into the
welfare center," she said. "But they prefer to live a free life in
the street."
</P>
<P>
Temperature in Macao has dropped to between 15 to 19 degrees
Centigrade over the past few days because of a cold front from the
north.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira said that the government will take care of the elderly
people as the priority next year. The government has agreed to
increase its expenditure to the department by six percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During an unexpected cold spell last winter, several elderly
people, including some street vagrants, died of coldness-related
diseases.

BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The Sino-Japanese
mountaineering team suffered a blow on Tuesday due to bad weather
in their third joint effort to scale the 6,740-meter Mount Meili,
on which 17 people died five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The team, including two Chinese and eight Japanese, was forced
to go back to the 3,500-meter base camp from a camp at 5,670
meters after it was forecasted that there will be a very heavy
snow.
</P>
<P>
The mountain, located on the border of Yunnan Province and the
Tibetan Autonomous Region, is shrouded in mystery after the
previous two attempts made in 1989 and 1991, also by Chinese and
Japanese climbers, failed, with the 1991 effort ending in
disaster.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Japanese and six Chinese climbers died in what was
believed a sudden avalanche on January 3, 1991.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers only found a camera and films in the lowest camp
before their further rescuing work aborted due to bad weather. No

<HEADLINE> Abacha Plans To Retire to Peace Foundation: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Nigerian military
government General Sani Abacha plans to retire to a peace
foundation named after him upon his handing over power in 1998,
the "Nigerian Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Farouk, a member of the Organizing Committee of the
Sani Abacha Foundation for Peace said the foundation is being
prepared as a forum through which Abacha could continue to
contribute to Nigeria's socio-political development once he
stepped out power.
</P>
<P>
Coming to power in November 1993, Abacha announced in October
last year that he will hand over the power to an elected
president in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Farouk, who is also the Kaduna State Commissioner for
Information, said that Nigerian leaders have always been troubled
by the thought of not being relevant to the system once they are
no longer in office, adding that the concern has often
discouraged some of them from surrendering their power.
</P>
<P>
The idea of setting up foundations for past leaders to put
their energy and experience to the advantage of the public was
sugguested by a committee especially founded by former President
Ibrahim Babangida, he said.
</P>
<P>
The seriousness with which General Abacha has responded to the
idea of the foundation for peace is an enough indication that the
head of state is already thinking beyond his days in power, he
added.

HONG KONG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's property market
saw more than 15,900 transactions in November, which was 15
percent busier than in October, according to a report in today's
Hong Kong Standard.
</P>
<P>
The report said the total transactions for 1996 are predicted
to hit 145,000. If this comes true, 1996 will be the busiest year
for the property market since 1991, when 180,964 flats changed
hands.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 boom in the property market, which followed a sharp
downturn in 1989, was curtailed when the government asked banks to
cut the maximum mortgage to 70 percent of a flat's value.
</P>
<P>
The report said the luxury end of the market enjoyed the
fastest rise in current deals, while the small- and medium-sized
mass market had smaller increases.

Kuwait officials have warned they will pull out of the

play in the Finals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Withdrawal from the finals is very serious not only from the
sporting point of view but also due to monetary damage from
sponsorship, TV and media deals. Normally countries are banned
from the next Asian finals," Verlappan said.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary said the championship will prove that
Asia will be a force to be reckoned with come the 1998 World Cup

</P>
<P>
At a routine press conference this afternoon, Cui noted that
the two sides held a meeting on November 27 on the issue of the

According to an official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and

the money would be used on 40 projects. Nevertheless, the talks on
the 1996 loan program was held only not long ago.
</P>
<P>
China has always hoped that cooperation in funds between the
governments should be developed normally on the basis of mutual
respect, equality and mutual benefit, without any interferences

LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Kenneth Clarke won "copper-bottomed" guarantees from
European Union partners on Monday that Britain would be exempt
from budget sanctions if it stayed out of a single currency. But
the finance ministers' meeting failed to reach agreement on new EU
because of German insistence on strict terms.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister John Major will in the next few
months give the clearest possible signals that sterling will not
join a single European currency in the first wave if the
Conservatives win the general elections.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Sir Nicholas Scott, the former Tory minister who was found
lying in the street at this year's party conference, Monday night
lost the battle to save his political career. A meeting of about
l,000 Tories in his Kensington and Chelsea constituency voted by
509 to 439 to deselect him as their candidate for the next
election, despite his pledge to give up alcohol for as long as he
held public office.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor is winning the battle for public opinion over the
Conservatives' crucial pre-election Budget. As MPs prepare to
vote tonight at the end of the five-day Commons Budget debate, the
latest Guardian/ICM opinion poll shows that Kenneth Clarke's
measures last week have had the thumbs-down from the voters, have
failed to generate the long-awaited feel-good factor for the
Conservatives, and have fueled the sharpest swing in favor of
Labor since the spring.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Confident of China's Reform, HK's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is confident
that China's economic reform process will continue and its
conditions favorable for maintaining high growth will be
preserved, a senior world bank official said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a business conference held here today, Pieter Bottelier,
chief of the World Bank's resident mission in China, said that the
World Bank will continue to support China's development, reform
and anti-poverty drive with capital and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
According to Bottelier, China is already the bank's largest
customer. The annual commitment level has hovered around three
billion US dollars in recent years and the accumulated total
exceeds 26 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
About half of the sum has been used for the development of
infrastructure including ports, roads, railways and power. Close
to 30 percent goes to agriculture, water conservancy, soil
improvement and forestry development.
</P>
<P>
The remainder is used to improve the environment, strengthen
health and education services in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Bottelier said, "Our experience with the quality and timeliness
of project implementation in China is, with relatively few
exceptions, very good, and better than almost anywhere in the
world."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, China has been very punctual in the
servicing of our loans and credits.
</P>
<P>
He said that the World Bank is and expects to remain an
important development partner of China for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
On the future development of Hong Kong, Bottelier said that
Hong Kong's greatest economic usefulness to the Chinese mainland
was as a bridge to the rest of the world, noting that the role
will undoubtedly remain important after 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that those who worry about the economic future of Hong
Kong under Chinese sovereignty tend to forget that there will not
only be new challenges, but also new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
When China decided in late 1978 to begin a gradual process of
opening up and market economic reforms, many in Hong Kong feared
that the territory's special role as entrepot center and
manufacturing supply base for China will soon be over.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, Hong Kong quickly adapted to the new situation,
taking advantage of new opportunities despite the fact that quite
a few Chinese coastal cities and special economic zones did indeed
develop very rapidly and began to compete with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that with growing convertibility of the Chinese
currency and accelerating commercially financed infrastructure
investment all over Asia, Hong Kong can participate in and gain
from rapid domestic capital market development in China.

one o'clock early in the morning when he returned to his hotel
room on December 1, 13 hours after he checked in.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the lock of the room remains well.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two British women travelers, a US tourist and a
Chinese mainland businessman in a row were robbed on the same day
either in the street or while checking in at hotels.
</P>
<P>
Local media have kept urging the government to step up
crackdown on crimes. Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira vowed to
take special measures to fight crimes after a top government
official was severely wounded last week.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President to Visit Japan in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam will visit Japan on January 25-26, 1997, at the
invitation of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
Presidential Spokesman Yoon Yeo-joon announced here today.
</P>
<P>
In return for Hashimoto's visit to South Korea's southern
island Cheju in June this year, President Kim will make a working
visit to Beppu, Oita Prefecture, of Kyushu Island in south Japan,
Yoon said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit, Kim and Hashimoto are expected to
exchange views on matters of mutual concern, including ways to
build forward-looking relations between the two countries, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"President Kim's forthcoming visit will not only constitute
working diplomacy at the highest level, free of formalities, but
will also further consolidate the trust between the two leaders,"
Yoon added.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, relations between South Korea and Japan have
been hurt due to the remarks made by Japanese leaders and
officials beautifying Japan's colonial rule of the Korean
Peninsula, and because of Hashimoto's visit to "Yasukuni Shrine,"
a place with memorial tablets of specters of Japanese aggressors,
as well as Japan's claim to Tokto Island.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until
its World War II defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Last February, Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihito Ikeda said
that Tokto, called Takeshima in Japanese, is part of the Japanese
territory, triggering angry response from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda's remarks followed South Korea's announcement that it
will build a wharf on Tokto Island, an outcropping rock in the
East Sea (Sea of Japan) about midway between South Korea and
Japan. The rocky islet has an area of 0.186 square kilometers.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government will hold
a new round of peace talks later this month with the country's
last ethnic armed group -- the Karen National Union (KNU), a
ranking officer said at a news briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
Kyaw Win, deputy director of the Defense Services Intelligence,
 confirmed that no concrete results were produced at the latest
round of peace talks on November 27.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the KNU must abandon armed struggle and return
to the legal fold, which is an essential principle for national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the abandonment of armed struggle does
not mean laying down arms and surrender as armed groups can still
keep their weapons in their regions after returning to the legal
fold.
</P>
<P>
Kyaw Win said that mutual respect and understanding between the
two sides are needed to ensure the success of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The KNU is the only armed ethnic group left in the country that
has not made peace with the government after the other 15 groups
have done so.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Liberal Democrats' Nostalgia for Militarism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A handful of Japanese Liberal
Democrats, out of their heart-felt nostalgia for Japanese
militarism and history of aggression, have made a despicable
proposal that foreign leaders pay homage to the notorious Yasukuni
Shrine housing tablets of key Japanese war criminals.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Policy Committee and the parliamentary group for
foreign affairs of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
unanimously made a decision on November 28 to propose that foreign
heads of state and leading statesmen pay homage to the Tokyo-based
Yasukuni Shrine, where tablets of 14 Class-A war criminals,
including wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo, are enshrined.
</P>
<P>
This proposal sounds so unbelievable and is nothing but a
reflection of the nostalgia cherished by certain political circles
in Japan for the country's militarism and history of aggression
that brought great suffering to other nations.
</P>
<P>
"Japanese emperors and prime ministers on visits to foreign
countries usually lay wreaths at monuments for the fallen in
battle. Why do not the visiting foreign heads of state and
leading statesmen pay homage to the Yasukuni Shrine?" said
Nakayama Taro, chief of the LDP Foreign Policy Committee and
former foreign minister, and key politicians of his ilk.
</P>
<P>
It might be forgivable if the remark came from young Japanese
knowing little about historical facts, but it was so astonishing
when it was made by key Japanese politicians like Nakayama Taro.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as it was part of the decision made by the two
authoritative organs of the ruling LDP, the remark cannot but
arouse indignation.
</P>
<P>
If a country which repeatedly launched wars of aggression
against other nations requires foreign leaders to pay respects to
a place housing tablets of prime war criminals and cannon fodder,
people will double whether there is any sense of right or wrong in
this country.
</P>
<P>
What did the Japanese militarists do in history? Their Fascist
crimes were too numerous to record. What is the Yasukuni Shrine?
It is a place that enshrines tablets of Japanese servicemen killed
in wars of aggression and the 14 Class-A war criminals, who were
stained with the blood of peoples of other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Evidently, these Japanese politicians have totally disregarded
all these historical facts.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the World War II, particularly in recent
years, popular opinions in the Asian countries have kept
denouncing a handful of Japanese who try to revive the dying
embers of militarism.
</P>
<P>
However, some Japanese, turning a deaf ear to the voice of
justice, have continued their shameful acts as before, seriously
blaspheming justified actions and feelings of Asian peoples to
maintain regional and global security.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the performances of the handful of Japanese
politicians have just exposed a sad reality in Japan's political
life: confounding black and white, or confusing right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
That's why Japanese of insight have lamented that Japan has
hardly grown up politically.
</P>
<P>
Japan's political circles can absolutely not win the confidence
of other nations if they allows the country's politics to be
manipulated by politicians like the handful of Liberal Democrats,
whose day dream of a political power will surely end up in
nothing, but a dream.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Officials Refute Israeli Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian senior official
has accused Israel of igniting sectarianism among Palestinians by
spreading rumors about alleged Muslims' intentions to demolish a
Christian site on the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem,
today quoted Palestinian Minister of Islamic Waqf (the Muslim
religious authority) Hassan Tahboub as saying Israel did so to
cover the political impasse they are locked in due to the stalled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel believed that a building inside the Al Aqsa Mosque on
the Temple Mount, which is the alleged target of demolition,
belongs to Christians.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Qandalaft, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's aide
for Christian affairs, refuted the Israeli allegations and
stressed the national unity for both Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Jerusalem police had recently received
intelligence information on plans by the Waqf to demolish a
Christian site on the Temple Mount, and sent an urgent report to
Israeli Minister of Public Security Avigdor Kahalani warning of
dire consequences should this happen.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said Monday that the threat remains.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kahalani said that he was assured by Waqf Director
Adnan Husseini that the site, known to Christians as "Jesus'
Cradle," would not be harmed.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that Kahalani may have spoken too
soon. They claimed that the intelligence information needs to be
thoroughly investigated.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is a holy site for three religions of Judaism,
Islam and Christianity. But Israel claims an exclusive
sovereignty over the whole city.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Criticizes Netanyahu's Comments on Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has assailed an
assertion by Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Natanyahu that the
Jordan Valley area in the West Bank would remain part of the
Jewish state, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The area was part of the occupied territory that should be
returned to the Palestinians, said Jordanian Information Minister
Marwan Muasher Monday, one day after King Hussein expressed deep
concern over the fate of the Middle East peace process under the
policies of the hardline Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told Jewish settlers in the Jordan Valley
Sunday that the area would be "an integral part of Israel
whatever the definitive solution with the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
Muasher told reporters that the Jordanian position was "clear
that all the occupied territories must return to Palestinian
sovereignty" and that the kingdom opposed any Israeli move to
create new facts on the ground or alter the status of the
occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we are anxious to ensure that Israel and the
Palestinians reach an agreement over Israeli redeployment in (the
West Bank town of) Hebron" and move swiftly to resume the final
status talks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation,
King Hussein said that "without visible progress in implementing
agreements reached earlier between the Israeli government and the
Palestinians in particular, we are at the mercy of events."
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a dilemma," said Hussein. "I don't know how long one
can wait and risk something terrible happening."

<HEADLINE> Statue Of Chinese Adventurer Erected in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A two-meter tall statue here
would usually commemorate a Chinese revolutionary martyr, but this
one is different.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese have erected a statue for the first time, in memory
of an adventurer, the late Yu Chunshun, in his hometown of
Shanghai. An unveiling ceremony will be held at the gravesite on
Dec. 5, what would have been Yu's 45th birthday.
</P>
<P>
More than a thousand people are expected at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Yu dead body was discovered in northwest China's Lop Nor Desert
on June 18, after he had left on an expedition into the
desert. Medical examiners concluded that cause of death was
dehydration and exposure to extreme temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Yu had already completed journeys across the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region during an
eight-year period, when he covered as much as 42,000 kilometers on
foot.
</P>
<P>
Yu was praised as a hero and won the respect of many people,
especially in his hometown, because of his great courage. An
exhibition on the events of his life caused quite a sensation in
the city.
</P>
<P>
The statue of the adventurer in mid-stride was chosen from
about 100 designs that were submitted, and the work was done by a
craftsman who volunteered his time. A map of the route of Yu's
expedition is engraved on the base of the statue.
</P>
<P>
When the story of his trek, entitled "An Adventurer in China --
Yu Chunshun Walks Across Tibet" was published, all 35,000 volumes
sold out quickly in Shanghai's bookstores. A publishing house is
planning to publish another collection of Yu's diaries and
travelogues.

<HEADLINE> China Improving Technology in Retrieving Sulphur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China has made rapid progress
in technology to retrieve sulphur from emission gases.
</P>
<P>
The technology has the ability to desulphurize massive
quantities of emissions from the petrochemical industry per year,
according to the China Petrochemical News, helping to ease the
growing global problem of acid rain.
</P>
<P>
The technology was developed by Yangtze Petrochemical Company,
which produced a desulphurization catalyst to improve the
retrieval rate to 92-95 percent.
</P>
<P>
Such a development has reduced sulphur in exhaust gases to one
percent, and will mean the recycling of over 10,000 tons of sulphur
every year, valued at 10 million yuan ( 1.2 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the environmental monitoring
department, about 30 percent of the Chinese territory is covered
by acid rain. Sulphides produced in the petrochemical industry are
the main cause of acid rain, a pollution problem linked to the
destruction of vast forest areas.

DAR Es SALAAM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Dar es Salaam Regional
Commissioner Bigadier General Hassan Ngwilizi has ordered all
Zairean and Burundi refugees staying in Dar to report to the
immigration office by Thursday this week.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded statement issued here on Monday, Ngwilizi
also asked city residents to cooperate in a massive hunt for
refugees who would default the order which will start on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Dar es Salaam residents will offer maximum cooperation
so that we can control he influx of refugees who are now
threatening peace and tranquillity in the region," said the
regional commissioner.
</P>
<P>
He said in the statement that there had been an unchecked
influx of refugees mostly reportedly from Zaire ever since civil
strife was eruptedan in Eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the presence of the refugees has been
linked to numerous armed-robberies, and has also raised public
concern over the laxity of state organs in tackling the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commissioner asked the refugees to cooperate
the moment they get the order by reporting to district
immigration offices without fail.
</P>
<P>
He also urged hotel and guest house operators to ensure that
all guests are duly registered and to report to local government
leaders any suspicious character.
</P>
<P>
"It is forbidden for a Tanzanian citizen to shelter a refugee
and there are reports that there are some Dar es Salaam residents
who are doing this contrary to regulations," Ngwilizi added.

history," Zeng Jianhui, director of the Information Office of the
State Council, pointed out at the reception.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that the service has also provided information about
every victory and achievement of the Chinese people, and about
every major international event to the world, in a truthful,
accurate, and timely way.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with new headquarters for CRI, and the use of
short wave and long wave broadcasts with greater power, the
service will enter a new stage of development.
</P>
<P>
China's international broadcasting began on December 3, 1941 at
the revolutionary base of Yan'an, as a tool to help fight the
Japanese invaders. Now, it has grown into one of the most
influential radio stations in the world, broadcasting 192 hours of
airtime each day, in 43 languages, to listeners scattering
throughout 180 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that many foreign listeners have called China's
international broadcasting service "the voice of China, the voice
of truth, and the bridge of friendship," and "the most direct,
timely, and effective channel with which to understand China."
</P>
<P>
"CRI has been in a very important position to promote
foreigners' understanding of and friendship with China, and to
safeguard and develop world peace and human progress," Zeng said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Official Defends Role in Anti-Drug Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has
played an active and effective role in fighting against illegal
drugs, an official said at a monthly press briefing here today, in
response to recent U.S. criticism of Myanmar's anti-drug measures.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar authorities have seized 20,160 kilograms of narcotic
drugs and destroyed 23 opium refineries since the State Law and
Order Restoration Council (SLORC) took power in 1988, said Kyaw
Thein, head of the Office of Strategic Studies of the Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He noted that military operations in the past few years have
brought about the unconditional surrender of drug warlord Khun Sa
and his Mong Tai Army of 14,945 men with 9,037 weapons.
</P>
<P>
In an article carried in the November 21 issue of the Far
Eastern Economic Review, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Robert
S. Gelbard said that drug traffickers can launder their money with
impunity in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Kyaw Thein refuted the accusation, saying that his country's
strict banking laws make it impossible for anything like a
laundering system to exist.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is now providing intelligence and other assistance to
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in implementing anti-drug
laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled that Myanmar fully cooperated with the U.S.
agriculture department and anti-narcotics center in two studies on
opium yields in 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that Myanmar accounts for a major production of
opium in the infamous Golden Triangle area, but one ought to study
the problem in depth rather than commenting superficially and
putting the blame on one country alone," Kyaw Thein said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Currency Up Against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's currency Shilling has
since mid-November appreciated against the U.S. Dollar ending a
steady trend of depreciation since July this year.
</P>
<P>
The inter bank trading rate at present is 1053.22 Shillings to
one Dollar, nearly back to its mid-July trading levels at 1052
Shillings to the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The open market rate here yesterday stood at 1080 Shillings
selling up from 1150 Shillings in October this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a source from the Bank of Uganda, the main reason
for this is ''the relative high supply against demand for
Dollars.''
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the high supply of Dollars to the peaking
of the coffee season, increased non-government activity in the
country and the presence of the United Nations multinational
force for Zaire.
</P>
<P>
On another reason, he said the low demand for foreign exchange
in Uganda has put pressure on the Dollar.

<HEADLINE> Secret Deal Between Iran, Germany Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian information authorities
has revealed a secret deal between Germany and Iran for release of
an Israeli pilot and canceling the Mykonos case, according to a
press report.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Iran News today quoted Iranian Information
Minister Ali Fallahian as saying "Germany had offered to cancel
the (murder) trial of four Iranian Kurdish dissidents in return
for help from Tehran in securing the release of missing Israeli
airman Ron Arad."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the trial, in which Iranian leaders have
been implicated in the killing of the Kurds in a Berlin
restaurant, went ahead following Israeli and U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans and Israelis pressured the Germans to use the
trial to force Iran to help free Arad," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "the Germans asked us to do something to secure Arad's
release and promised in return to dismantle the trial. They meant
to blackmail us."
</P>
<P>
He said "We did not succumb to the pressure and they insulted
our leaders."
</P>
<P>
The Mykonos case has led to a crisis in relations between Iran
and Germany. Thousands of Iranian students staged demonstrations
in front of German Embassy in Tehran and some parliament members
threatened to degrade the bilateral relations between Bonn and
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian and four Lebanese have been on trial in Berlin
since 1993 for the killing and a verdict is expected early
next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Judiciary Chief Mohammad Yazdi said Monday
that the German prosecutor handling the Mykonos case has
ignored most evident legal principles.
</P>
<P>
Based on investigations and legal surveys made by legal
experts, he added, there were some mistakes made by the
German prosecutor that showed he was under the influence of
others.
</P>
<P>
"The prosecutor has filed suit against a defendant whom had
never met or questioned," he noted.

NEW DELHI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- India's trade deficit up to
October this year dropped by 426 million US dollars, largely

<P>
NANNING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese farmer survived for
eight days without any water and food after he lost his way in
a mountain cave.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hanfen, a 48-year-old farmer of Fusui County, southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, was later found near
to death outside the cave.
</P>
<P>
His life was saved even though he suffered serious kidney
failure and damaged lungs, according to a recent "Guangxi Daily"
report.
</P>
<P>
Liu's risky experience started when he found the cave
accidentally on October 30, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Out of curiousity he entered into the cave with only a ray of
light, which he lost after he fell down from a high ridge.
</P>
<P>
Liu lost his way, and had to crawl in the dark and cramped cave,
eating and drinking nothing for eight consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the hospital affiliated to the Guangxi Medical
College said that a strong constitution and ardent desire for
survival gave Liu the will to live on.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
voiced its readiness for talks with the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) on disputed islands.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi welcomed UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Al Nahyan's
suggestion of bilateral talks to settle the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mohammadi reiterated Iran's sovereignty over the
disputed Abu Musa, the Great and Lesser Tunbs islands.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi emphasized that "Iran has always announced its
readiness and good intention to peacefully solve the problem with
its Muslim neighbor UAE."
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need to resolve existing misunderstanding
through friendly talks in order to foil what he called the plots
of foreigners in this regard, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed earlier that it had completed defensive projects
on its all strategically important islands in the Gulf. Missile
bases were also built on the islands.
</P>
<P>
The disputed islands are strategically located on the edge of
the Strait of Hormuz, through which much of the world's oil passes
as the only gateway to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has said that it will refer their dispute with Iran
to the International Court of Justice in the Hague. However,
Iranian officials have rejected the demand.

<P>
The regional police chief said 96 suspected hardcore bandits
were arrested with 53 guns this year and charged in court, but

<P>
HANGZHOU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The scenic city of Hangzhou,
capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, has strengthened its
unemployment insurance through a variety of channels.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 880,000 workers and staff from 6,718 units
in Hangzhou have insurance against unemployment, accounting for 95
percent of the total number of employees in the units.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Hangzhou City Labor Bureau said that
unemployment insurance has played an important role in helping
enterprises change their management mechanisms, and for
maintaining social stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that the unemployment system serves to ensure people's
basic living standards, and strengthen people's psychological
capability towards reform and possible unemployment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, 53 million yuan of relief fund had been
paid to 388,100 people under the system, greatly relieving the
burden previously shouldered by the government and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Under the assistance of the Unemployment Insurance Foundation,
the departments concerned have offered training classes to some
3,000 displaced workers, with many soon finding new jobs.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Three Minor Gorges
Hydroelectric Development Co. Ltd. of Gansu Province is the first
hydroelectric company to operate independently in China.
</P>
<P>
The new company is under the control of the State Investment
and Development Company, the Gansu Provincial Power Investment
Company, and the Gansu Provincial Power Company. It will design,
handle finances, and be responsible for building three
hydroelectric power stations on the Yellow River in Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The company marks a change in China's previous hydroelectric
power projects, where the state was responsible for providing
funds, engineering, and construction, and the power plant was
responsible for producing electricity.
</P>
<P>
The three hydroelectric power stations will have a combined
generating capacity of 650,000 kw and will be able to generate 3.1
billion kw/hour of electricity a year when completed.
</P>
<P>
The stations are expected to cause fewer problems from
inundated land because of the new building methods, and will cost
less because of their proximity to Lanzhou, the provincial
capital, and Baiyin City, a non-ferrous metal producer, two major
electricity consumers.
</P>
<P>
Work on one of the three, the Daxia (Big Gorge) Hydroelectric
power Station, started in November 1991, while the other two, the
Xiaoxia (Small Gorge) and Wujin Gorge stations, have gotten
approval on their feasibility studies.

<HEADLINE> Organic Potash Fertilizer Fills World's Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- An organic potash fertilizer
developed in China has been described by the international
information network service as the first of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
Developed by the Shaanxi Provincial Academy of Agriculture
Sciences and other institutes, the new fertilizer has won praise
from some experts, who describe it as "a revolutionary progress in
China's fertilizer sector."
</P>
<P>
According to experts, potash fertilizers presently used in
China are mostly inorganic, and usually have some negative
influences and are not easily assimilated.
</P>
<P>
"A series of experiments indicate that this new potash
fertilizer is very effective in increasing the output of grain, as
well as in improving the quality of earth," said a researcher at
the Shaanxi Provincial Academy of Agriculture Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the southern part of China nearly all the
grain-lands lack potash, and in the north 65 percent of the
grain-lands are in great need of the nutrient.
</P>
<P>
"Though every year huge amounts of money are spent importing
potash fertilizers, the supply is still very limited. We believe
that with the batch process, and wide application of this new
fertilizer, China's grain products will take a new step forward,"
he said.

the country's major cement producers.
</P>
<P>
One fourth of the cement turned out by large and medium-sized

</P>
<P>
Anhui plans to further expand its cement manufacturing sector,

output capacity will be added.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, over 70 limestone deposits have been proven in the

<P>
Meanwhile, Anhui is an energy-rich province, with sufficient
coal and power to meet the needs of the cement industry.
</P>
<P>
Most of local cement plants are or will be located in areas
along the Yangtze River, since 70 percent of Anhui's limestone

<HEADLINE> China's 'Red Earth' Province Getting Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Jiangxi Province in east China
is known as a "Red Area", both because of its uniquely red earth
and because of its having been a revolutionary base for the
Communist party's Red Army in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
But in 1984, when the Honghai Electronics Company moved to the
provincial capital of Nanchang and became Jiangxi's first
foreign-funded firm, the red earth began to attract overseas
investment. Since then, around 4,000 companies from 45 foreign
countries and regions have brought over two billion US dollars in
funds for such industries as communications, energy, agriculture,
and machinery.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi has been opening up to the rest of the country and the
world gradually, especially after the completion of the
Beijing-Kowloon Railway, which was intended by the central
government especially to go through the poverty-stricken province.
</P>
<P>
Surface and air transport has also improved, with a large
number of roads, ports, and airports being built in recent
years. The province has also increased its power capacity by 1.77
million kw and telephone service.
</P>
<P>
The red area has an abundance of land, with more than two
million ha., and forest coverage of 50.9 percent, as well as rich
reserves of 96 kinds of proven minerals, 11 of which rank first in
the country in reserves.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to provincial efforts to draw more foreign investment,
simplify procedures for foreign investors to register businesses,
by August this year, the overseas-funded firms in Jiangxi had 28
billion yuan in output value, 800 million yuan in net profits, and
paid one billion yuan in taxes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students To Get Agricultural Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Students at primary and
secondary schools in Zhuhai in south China's Guangdong Province
will have access to land that can be used for agricultural
training, starting this December.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese students have never had any contact with farm work
and have no idea about the significance of work, so the Zhuhai
City Education Commission decided that students should have some
kind of practical experience to improve their ability to work, to
help them understand what it means to work under tough conditions,
and give them a taste of farm life.
</P>
<P>
To do so, Zhuhai gave 2.67 hectares of farmland to the program
so that students can experience the hardships and joys of
ploughing, planting, and using farm tools.

<HEADLINE> American Professor Donates Books to Chinese Research Institution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A 6,000-volume collection of
palaeontology books from a late American professors have been
donated to a research institute in Nanjing, capital city of east
China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Geologist Charles Jack Smiley, who died in January, was a
leading professor who contributed his life to the study of
palaeobotany, palaeoecology and palaeozonic lakes. He also took
part in DNA fossil research.
</P>
<P>
During his lifetime, Professor Smiley visited China for several
times to conduct scientific cooperation projects with Chinese
researchers, and give lectures to young scientists. He thought
that the palaeontology data in China played an important role in
the establishment of a global ecology system in the Palaeozonic
Era.
</P>
<P>
According to the Professor's testament, his wife donated the
books to the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology last
month. Mrs. Smiley said that the donation was aimed at helping
Chinese researchers find English statistics and data in the field.
</P>
<P>
With the books, the library of the institute will set up a
special reading room in honor of Professor Smiley.

<HEADLINE> Pyrethrum Production Drops in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's pyrethrum production
sharply declined in 1993/94 cropping season and the declining
trend continued in 1994/95, according to a survey issued by
Kenyan Ministry for Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Kenya produced 10,551 tons of pyrethrum
in the 1994/95 cropping season, compared with 11,979 tons the
previous year which registered a 32 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
Pyrethrum faced unfavorable weather in the first half of 1994,
which adversely affected the production, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Current annual demand for pyrethrum in the world market is
about 20,000 tons of dried flowers, of which Kenya produces about
70 percent, with Tanzania, Australia, Rwanda and Papua New Guinea
supplying the rest.
</P>
<P>
The East African country exports an average 9,000 tons
annually of pyrethrum which is an important foreign exchange
earner in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pyrethrum was introduced into Kenya in 1928 and grown
commercially for production since the finding of pyrethrum in the
flower heads.
</P>
<P>
Extracts from pyrethrum powder contain pyrethrins which are
used as active ingredients in the manufacture of insecticides.
</P>
<P>
Pyrethrum products have become popular in recent years after
it was established by researchers that pyrethrins are practically
non-poisonous to mammals, have a rapid breakdown with no residues
in the environment and hardly show any build-up of resistance in
insect populations.
</P>
<P>
Because of the increasing consciousness of the risks
associated with widespread use of synthetic insecticides, the
demand for pyrethrum products has continued to increase in recent
years.

GUANGZHOU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The appliance of science and
technology has led to great economic returns for Guangzhou, the
capital of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during the Eighth Five-Year (1991-1995)
plan period, the Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences
applied over 80 percent of its scientific and technological
achievements to practical use.
</P>
<P>
An official said the academy implemented a series of measures,
including setting up experimental farms, combining experiments
with application, and allocating a special fund to support the
application of promising and lucrative scientific ideas.
</P>
<P>
The academy has set up 385 scientific development stations
across Guangdong, and a dozen promotion centers in the province's
five cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
An recent survey conducted by relevant departments shows that
the academy tops the list among the academies of agricultural

<HEADLINE> Regulations on Wild Animal Protection in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province, which is rich in plant life, has adopted a number of
regulations to protect its wild animals.
</P>
<P>
The province's varied terrain makes it a perfect home for
animals. It has 1,638 types of vertebrates, accounting for 54.9
percent of China's total.
</P>
<P>
Of the 335 animals with state-level protection in China, Yunnan
has 162, and 22 types, such as the Asian elephant, the wild ox,
and the green peacock are found only there.
</P>
<P>
However, a taste for wild animals at the supper table that has
been in vogue in recent years has meant that hunters, motivated by
the enormous profits to be made, have gone looking for the rare
animals.
</P>
<P>
The regulations state the range of protection clearly, and
provide stiff sentences for violators. No one is allowed to buy,
sell, process, transport, or deal in wild animals or products made
from them in any way, according to the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who wishes to deal in wild animals must get a government
permit, and governments at all levels have been asked to take
steps to protect animals.

<HEADLINE> HK to Tap Opportunities in ASEAN Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's businessmen will
continue to tap the enormous opportunities in the ASEAN economies,
both in direct trade and investment, a senior Hong Kong government
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
At the Hong Kong Business Summit held here today, Donald Tsang,
financial secretary, said many commentators have predicted that
next century will be the Asia-Pacific century because of the
region's dynamism and potential for growth.
</P>
<P>
He said a prime example of the dynamism can be found in the
economic area comprising the ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN, or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
presently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN economies have achieved a growth rate consistently in
excess of 7 percent since the 1990s, and are forecast to sustain
this level of growth in the remainder of this decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fueled by high economic growth and rich in natural resources,
the ASEAN economies present a great opportunity as well as
challenges to Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong's entrepreneurs would not let these
opportunities pass.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's trade with the ASEAN economies has been increasing
substantially at an average rate of almost 30 percent a year over
the last five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that eyeing the fast growing market and favorable
environment offered by the ASEAN economies, Hong Kong
entrepreneurs have also been making substantial direct investments
there.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show a total cumulative value well in
excess of 190 billion HK dollars (24.58 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is now the second largest foreign direct investor in
Thailand and the third largest in Indonesia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is also increasingly recognized as an attractive
place for direct investment from its ASEAN partners.
</P>
<P>
As a major financial center and the principal gateway to China,
Hong Kong is also helping most of the ASEAN countries to channel
or raise funds for investing in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong will continue to provide an important
operational base for ASEAN companies to conduct business in the
Chinese mainland.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Minister
Stan Mudenge said there is need to foster coordination between
the United Nations and Bretton woods institutions intact in the
current process of reforming the world body.
</P>
<P>
Addressing resource persons attending a workshop on U.N.
reform in the economic, social and related fields on Monday,
Mudenge said a discussion of the reform process of the world body
needed to look at ways to increase the coordination between the
U.N. and the financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said, ''a discussion on economic and social reforms
would be incomplete without an examination of the present
ambiguous relationship between the U.N. systems and the Bretton
woods institutions (International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank).''
</P>
<P>
''Bretton woods institutions should become more democratic and
transparent in their decision making process and not act merely
as the enforcers and debt collectors on behalf of the rich and
powerful nations of the north,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said Zimbabwe is worried about the current efforts to
streamline the functions of the U.N. which were forcing it to
diminish its role in promoting development to the Bretton woods
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Any contemplated reforms in the U.N., he said, should look
into the adverse effects of the phenomenon of globalization of
the economic and social situation in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
''There is a need for an effective mechanism for coordinating
the activities of the world trade organization and those of the
U.N. system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, organized by Nordic countries, is the third part
in a series of consultations in the south on U.N. reforms.

<P>
NANJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Exhibition of Achievements
in Juvenile and Children's Book Publishing, being held here, is
attracting thousands of children and their parents.
</P>
<P>
"I like to read books specially written for us. They give me
great help in expanding my vocabulary," said a second-grade
elementary school pupil at the event.
</P>
<P>
Many of the most popular books among children and juveniles
visiting the exhibition were published by Jiangsu Juvenile and
Children Publishing House (JJCPH), based in this capital of east

<P>
It has organized many reading activities for elementary and
middle school students.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the social benefit, it also receives considerable
economic returns.
</P>
<P>
It made 19.85 million yuan in profits last year. The first

to be signed within a week.
</P>
<P>
According to sources here today, the draft formula for
resolving the long-standing issue was worked out during the just
ended 6-day visit to Dhaka by India's West Bengal state chief
minister Jyoti Basu.
</P>
<P>
"We have prepared a draft which will be submitted to the
central government of India," Basu confirmed before flying back
home Monday, adding that Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
has expressed her desire to visit India on December 9 or 10 "to
sign a final agreement on the water-sharing issue."
</P>
<P>
The date of Hasina's visit will be finalized by the Indian
government and if the Indian government accepts the draft it is
likely to be effective from next January.
</P>
<P>
But even in this conclusive stage of bilateral talks, the
fears, hesitation and lack of satisfaction on the part of
Bangladesh are obvious and the tangles are still there even at the
end of Basu's visit, an local English daily said.

<HEADLINE> Japan to develop global-use mobile phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 3 (Xinhua) Kyodo - Japan is trying to ally with
South Korea and China to gain the lead in the race to develop
mobile phones that can be used to make calls to anywhere in the
world, Kyodo reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Kyodo quoted Asahi Shimbun as reporting that Japan's Posts
and Telecommunications Ministry has already agreed with its South
Korean counterpart on an exchange of technology to this end. The
countries will use the same mobile phone terminals during the
World Cup soccer finals in 2002, which they are jointly hosting.
</P>
<P>
With China, Tokyo will hold the first such talks on December 13
in Beijing on a joint experiment ahead of the targeted debut of
the advanced mobile phones in 2000, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Because Europe, the United States and Japan use different
frequencies and wireless communication systems, users in different
countries cannot make calls to each other.
</P>
<P>
Once the frequency and the systems are standardized, they can
make and receive international calls.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese posts ministry formed a study group in October
with phone makers in the U.S., Europe and South Korea in its move
to launch a comprehensive development of mobile phones in fiscal
1997 starting April 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The International Telecommunications Union, which will decide
on standardization of mobile phones, in October set a frequency of
2 gigahertz for the next-generation phones and is to select one
wireless communication system by the end of 1999 from among the
three used in Japan, the U.S. and Europe, the daily said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, India Renew Bilateral Trade Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India today renewed
a 46-year-old bilateral trade treaty as officials and traders here
expected its contribution to a less trade deficit with India.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Commerce Secretary Mohan Dev Pant and his Indian
counterpart Tejendra Khanna signed the agreement on the renewal
here today soon after the arrival of the Indian official in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The renewed treaty will help Nepali exports' free entry into
the Indian market by waiving the existing provision of at least 50
percent of Nepali labor and material content, Nepali officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from several items on an already shortened negative list,
Nepali goods could get preferential entry into India without any
conditions after the renewal of the treaty, they added.
</P>
<P>
According to Nepali Commerce Secretary Pant, the treaty will
give a new thrust for the liberalization of Nepal-India trade.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, first signed in 1950 and renewed every five years
since then, will have a new provision of "automatic renewal," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will also help Nepali goods get concessions on
excise and other charges like the countervailing duties in the
Indian market, which have made Nepali products more expensive than
those made in India, Nepali exporters said.
</P>
<P>
An understanding on the trade treaty's renewal between the two
countries was reached five months ago on the commerce secretary
level in Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has a trade deficit of over 300 million US dollars with
India every year, about one-third of the country's total trade
deficit.

VIENNA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices remain constant
after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
decided to retain a production ceiling at the end of last month.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning to Have More Beautiful Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Top town planners from the US,
Canada and Japan are to be called in to help northeast China's
Liaoning Province create more beautiful cities.
</P>
<P>
The new-look cities will have perfect urban functions, and
spectacular ethnic characteristics, Vice-Governor of Liaoning
Mo Suixin announced at a conference held here recently.
</P>
<P>
The provincial urbanization rate stands at 43.6 percent, the
highest among provinces in China.
</P>
<P>
Mo noted that for geographical and historical reasons,
Liaoning's cities could neither be as impressive as cities in
Jiangsu and Zhejiang in terms of cultural background, nor compete
with such cities as Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen in aspects of
modernization.
</P>
<P>
He said that competent departments of the province became aware
of the limitations some years ago, and have done painstaking work
since then which seems to have paid off.
</P>
<P>
He gave the example of Dalian, a coastal city known as "North
Hong Kong", which has its own peculiar characteristics in
aspects of urban afforestation, building style, as well as its
function as a city.
</P>
<P>
Mo said that the province plans to invite city planners from
the United States, Japan and Canada, in a move to ensure that key
communities and important projects are planned in a more
scientific way.
</P>
<P>
One expert pointed out that as the province's city planning
pursues a more scientific path, Liaoning will witness the
emergence of a conspicuous city group, both multifunctional and
modernized.

<P>
JAKARTA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers at the
Soekorno-Hatta international airport arrested two Singaporeans for
smuggling a record 70,431 ecstasy pills into the country, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Sugijata, director of prevention and investigation at
the customs, said the pills, which have an estimated street value
of at least 4.2 billion rupiah (1.8 million US dollars), were
packed in three plastic bags kept in camouflaged toy boxes.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the pills were mixed with peppermints," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest haul we've ever made so far, after the
seizure of 60,000 ecstasy pills in the airport in April," Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
The two traffickers said the pills were ordered by members of
an ecstasy drug traffickers syndicate, who they met several times
in discotheques overseas.
</P>
<P>
A total of 239,000 pills have been seized along with dozens of
suspects by the airport officers since March 1996, Thomas said.

<HEADLINE> Second Peruvian Aircraft Buy Upsets Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Galo
Leoro today expressed concern over the supposed Peruvian
acquisition of Russian aircraft, the second in a fortnight.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of 25 former Soviet Union Sukhoi aircraft was
further complicating the peace process between the two countries,
he said..
</P>
<P>
The Sukhoi purchase would be the second in a fortnight,
following the Peruvian acquisition of 12 Russian Mig-29 combat
planes last month which, Ecuador claimed, raised the risk of an
arms race with its neighbour on the eve of resumed formal peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador and Peru agreed in October to definitively settle
their border dispute by the end of the year through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
While calling on the guarantor countries of the peace process
between the two nations - Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United
States - to speak out about this situation, Leoro said the Ecuador
Foreign Ministry was still waiting for official information from
the Ecuadoran ambassador to Lima.
</P>
<P>
"I trust that the information that he will provide will be
truthful and opportune," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two South American countries, with about 1,600 kilometers
of common border, have been embroiled in war in 1981, 1991 and
1995. They signed a peace deal in February, 1995 under
international mediation to end the latest conflict in which
hundreds of people died.
</P>
<P>
Leoro said Ecuadoran President Abdala Bucaram would name
negotiators in the next few days to go to Brasilia to deal with
the issue.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Ecuadoran delegation would be there by
December 20 to help tackle the underlying deadlock between Ecuador
and Peru.

<P>
LISBON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A summit of leaders from the
54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) opened here today to discuss issues ranging from Russia and
NATO expansion to peace-keeping in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit brought together the United States and
Canada with all European nations to map out a blueprint for
European security in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The gathering will focus on issues such as the OSCE's function
and role under new circumstances, operation and reform of the
European security mechanism as well as the organization's role in
shoring up peace in Bosnia, say informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Contrary stances taken by Russia and the United States over
NATO's enlargement are attracting world attention at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Agreement was reached to start a new round of conventional arms
talks which would adapt and extend a 1990 treaty that reduced
military hardware across the continent, Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres announced at the opening session.
</P>
<P>
Guterres urged participants to cooperate with sincerity in
building mutual trust and prompting the process of European
security.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that since the 1990 Paris summit of the
organization, things had greatly changed in Europe, resulting in
greater challenges and risks, and severe armed conflicts had
occurred in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the OSCE was shouldering more responsibilities in
limiting conflicts, facing challenges and maintaining peace and
stability in the continent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Guterres expressed hope that this summit would come up with
something creative for designing a new framework of European
security.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants are Vice President Al Gore of the United
States, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Prime Minister John Major, French
President Jacques Chirac as well as Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Urged to Grow Three Crops Yearly in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Myanmar have been
urged to grow three crops per year to increase paddy output.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister for Agriculture and Irrigation Myint Aung made
the call on Monday when meeting farmers who grow crops in the area
irrigated by Zaungtu Diversion Dam in Bago Township, 50 kilometers
from Yangon, the official paper The New Light of Myanmar reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The building of the Zaungtu Diversion Dam was completed, while
its hydro-electric power project is being implemented, irrigating
1,215 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
Usually one to two crops are grown in Myanmar. However, up to
three or four crops are cultivable for its soil and climate.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar possesses a large land area in the Southeast Asian
region with a vast potential of land resources for cultivation and
for further expansion of the cultivable land.
</P>
<P>
Of the total area of 67.6 million hectares, only about 13
percent is under cultivation. The total cultivated area under
irrigation accounts for about 17 percent of net area sown.
Endeavors are being made to raise the irrigation coverage of the
cropped area to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The output of paddy, which is the main crop of Myanmar, was
recorded at 19 million tons in the last 1995-96 fiscal year, while
rice export was at 353,100 tons. Myanmar has set a target of
producing 20 million tons of paddy and exporting one million tons
of rice in 1996-97.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Opposes Modification of Regional Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- South America's biggest
trade bloc, Mercosur, will oppose the liberalization of industrial
products and modification of regional agreements at the upcoming
World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today quoted Jose Alfredo Graza Lima, head of
the economic department of Brazil's Foreign Ministry, as saying
the Mercosur member states will take a common stand at the WTO
meeting to be held in Singapore on December 9-13.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay with a
combined population of 200 million and a GNP of 800 billion
U.S. dollars. Chile is an associate member of the group.
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Graza said the South American trade bloc will push for
speedy negotiations on tariff barriers in the agricultural sector
and will encourage debate on investments in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and its Mercosur partners are questioning the inclusion
of a phrase defending "progressive liberalization and the
elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers."
</P>
<P>
Argentina, which wants the WTO to take more concrete steps to
prepare the ground for planned negotiations on agriculture by
1999, suggested last month a separate paragraph in the draft
ministerial meeting dealing specifically with agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was accepted by some Latin American countries as
well as Austria and Thailand, but faced fierce opposition from
Japan, South Korean, Switzerland and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
According to Alfredo Graza, the elimination of all tariffs on
imports is a "very ambitious but not a very realistic goal."
</P>
<P>
"What gives consistency to a customs union, such as the
Mercosur, is precisely the existency of a common external
tariff," Alfredo Graza explained.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Set to Take off from More Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China's airline industry is set
to take off with the construction of 41 more airports in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The airports will be designed in accordance with transportation
capacity anticipated within the next five to 15 years, today's
China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Strewn across China in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and
provincial capitals and coastal cities, the 41 airports will
handle approximately 95 percent of the country's air passenger
flow, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
It quotes unnamed sources with the Civil Aviation
Administration of China as saying that 6.32 billion yuan were
poured into civil aviation infrastructure construction and
technological innovation, 26.9 percent more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, nine airports were officially put into operation.
</P>
<P>
This year, China has finished constructing eight civil aviation
projects, including the Guilin Liangjiang International Airport,
the fourth largest airport in the country.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the Capital International Airport, whose
investment totalled eight billion yuan, is expected to be
completed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The four-runway Shanghai Pudong International Airport will be
constructed in four phases and, when completed, it will become the
largest airport in the country able to handle 70 million
passengers and five million tons of cargo each year.
</P>
<P>
CAAC predicts that the volume of airway freight will reach 14
billion tons-kilometers while passengers will number 100 million
by the year 2000, an average increase of 14 percent annually.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Presses MILF to Expand Truce Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Monday said that the government will press the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) for an expanded truce before formal talks
begin, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
"Our immediate objective is to attain ceasefire in Mindanao,"
Ramos said, adding the ceasefire coverage should expand from
Basilan to other parts of southern Mindanao "where there are still
conflicts and struggles."
</P>
<P>
Among the areas which Ramos wanted covered by the ceasefire is
Carmen town in Cotabato, which will host two major government
irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
Expressing displeasure over the prolonged delay in the formal
peace negotiations with the MILF, Ramos said he wanted the talks
to start as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine Defense Secretary Renato Villa blamed the
MILF for the rash of kidnappings and terrorist activities in
Mindanao, warning that the military will continue to enforce the
law against them during the 60-day ceasefire unilaterally declared
by the president.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) which has signed a peace accord with the government,
has notified the government that it has formed a technical working
committee to prepare for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has sought its own peace negotiations with the
government as it refused to honor the peace agreement forged last
September between the government and the MNLF, but the talks
remained stalled as government troops battled MILF groups in
Basilan in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent bid to attract the MILF to the negotiating
table, the government has offered to distribute to some 1,200
families of MILF rebels certificates of land title covering about
2,000 hectares of alienable and disposable lands in
MILF-influenced areas in Maguindanao.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Apparel Sales to Reach 3 Billion Dollars in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Mexico is expected to
record 3 billion U.S. dollars of apparel sales this year, mainly
supported by strong export market, said a top official of the
National Chamber of Apparel Industry today.
</P>
<P>
Ramzy Casab Velazquez, president of the chamber, also said that
the apparel industry grew 20.3 percent between January and
September this year.
</P>
<P>
The growth was sustained on the integration of the
fiber-textile-clothing chain, which accounts for 1.8 percent of
the gross domestic product and nearly 10 percent of the nation's
output of manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
According to Casab Velazquez, the apparel industry currently
creates 350,000 jobs in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, due to the stagnated domestic market, the
development of the industry has been leaned on only 5 percent
of the more than 6,000 companies in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Casab Velazquez said that a greater integration of small and
medium-sized companies is needed in the supply of raw materials
and export-oriented finished products.
</P>
<P>
He added that the consolidation of the apparel industry would
only be possible with an economic growth based on a stable
monetary policy and lower interest rates.

TIRANA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Albania's government annulled
its suspensions of several Albanian soccer federation officials in
an attempt to get the country back into international soccer,
according to local reports on Monday.
</P>
<P>
World soccer's governing body FIFA suspended Albania
indefinitely after the sports ministry ordered the suspension of
Albanian Football Association (AFA) general secretary Eduard
Dervishi and dissolved its executive committee.
</P>
<P>
Albanian sports secretary Marjeta Pronjari said Dervishi had
broken the country's civil law by consistently postponing new
executive committee elections and he had therefore been suspended.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, however, did not recognize the suspensions and still
considered Dervishi and the dissolved executive as their only
official contacts in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi on Sunday appealed to
his country's soccer federation and the state sports secretariat
to settle their dispute, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
He had also recommended that new executive committee elections
be held in February, added the reports.

RIO DE JANEIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's petroleum

<HEADLINE> Dictionary Records Usage of Chinese Language Cross-Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The first dictionary explaining
different usages of the Chinese language on the mainland and
Taiwan is being compiled.
</P>
<P>
The dictionary will contain over 40,000 daily-used terms on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits, according to a report of China
News Service.
</P>
<P>
Scholars and experts from Beijing Language and Culture
University and the Taibei Language Institute are jointly working
on the dictionary, which is scheduled to be issued simultaneously
in Beijing and Taiwan next year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese language has been developed along different tracks
on both sides of the Taiwan Straits over the past 40-plus
years. Many objects are therefore differently named and the same
word may be differently pronounced.
</P>
<P>
This sometimes has brought confusion to cross-Straits exchanges
as well as to overseas Chinese and foreigners, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The dictionary does not aim at synthesizing or standardizing
the terms but is designed to objectively reflect differences," Cui
Yonghua, a chief compiler and vice-president of the Beijing
Language and Culture University, was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Four enterprises signed
contracts Monday for manufacturing water turbines, generators and
other equipment for one of China's largest water diversion
projects to be built on the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The four enterprises are Harbin Electrical Machinery Co.,
China's leading generator manufacturer, a Guangzhou-based research
institute under the Ministry of Machine-building Industry, Tianjin
Gec Alsthom Co and Shanghai Hydropower Equipment Co, according to
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Wanjiazhai Water Diversion Project will
purchase more than 492 million yuan worth of equipment from the
above-mentioned four units in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Wanjiazhai Water Diversion Project is designed to divert water
from the upper reaches of the Yellow River to North China's
coal-rich province of Shanxi, which suffers a serious shortage of
water. The project is scheduled to retain water and start
generating electricity in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Zou Jiahua attended the signing ceremony and met
the general managers of the four companies. Zou hoped that
manufacturers would try their best to ensure that production of
the equipment can be completed in accordance with the contract,
with high quality and good after-sales service.
</P>
<P>
The project, which began construction in 1994, will cost 7.5
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Located on the eastern bank of the middle reaches of the Yellow
River, the project in Shanxi will pump water from the Yellow River
to Shuozhou after treatment in a reservoir at Wanjiazhai. The
water will then be send Datong and Taiyuan, Shanxi's two major
industrial cities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- An agreement involving 3
million US dollars provided by the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) was signed yesterday in Beijing to help spread
compulsory education in China's rural areas, according to "China
Daily" today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed Monday by Long Yongtu, assistant minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, and Arthur Holcombe,
UNDP representative to China, marked the fourth batch of
assistance by the UNDP to fuel China's education development.
</P>
<P>
The allocation will be geared over the next five years to help
popularize nine-year compulsory education in the country's central
and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Special target areas include those provinces whose economy is
relatively underdeveloped and the illiteracy rate is higher, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said the money will be used to train more qualified
teachers, to improve school buildings, teaching materials and
instruments, and to enhance professional education.
</P>
<P>
Basic education in these areas will focus on girls' schooling,
the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
The country's poverty-stricken areas see one million school
children age 7-11 drop out of school each year due to financial
burdens, with girls making up 70 percent of this number.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the State Education Commission,
the first three batches of assistance involved a total of 14
million US dollars from 1980 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
International aid is of great help to the Chinese government's
endeavor to educate all. Many non-governmental organizations have
also dedicated themselves to the cause.

<HEADLINE> New Medical Foundation Set up in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zhang Xiqi Foundation, named
for an ophthalmologist and professor, has been established at
Anhui Medical University in Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has a fund of 630,000 yuan at present, to be
used for encourage diligent study and for helping poor students.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who was one of the first Chinese to study modern medical
science abroad, graduated from a Japanese university in 1925, and
set up an eye clinic in Shanghai in 1930.
</P>
<P>
In 1938, he became director of the Shanghai Southeast Medical
Institute, but it was almost completely destroyed by the Japanese
soon after that.
</P>
<P>
Zhang spent all the money he had made through his clinic to
ensure the survival of the institute.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China in 1949, he moved the institute
to Anhui to support the cause of medicine there, and its name was
changed to Anhui Medical Institute, and later to Anhui Medical
University based in Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
After Zhang's death, a book on ophthalmology that used his
manuscripts was published and the royalties from the publication
were used to set up the foundation.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan-funded enterprises
have become the top selection for job-seeking graduate students
from agricultural universities in the island province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Some Taiwan-funded agricultural firms have accepted nearly four
hundred students from Hainan University, South China Agricultural
Institute and Hainan Agricultural College, for training on their
farms.
</P>
<P>
A number of the students expressed the wish to work for the
enterprises after graduation.
</P>
<P>
Over two hundred Taiwan-funded enterprises are engaged in
planting fruit, vegetables and flowers, breeding poultry and
livestock, and fish farming, and carrying out hi-tech biological
engineering research.
</P>
<P>
The firms, usually of a large size and highly profitable, are a
great attraction to college graduate students.
</P>
<P>
"It isn't the excellent pay and conditions that attract me. I
like their advanced technology and standardized management. I
believe I can learn a lot, and make great progress there," said
one student from Hainan University who will graduate next year.
</P>
<P>
"The school encourages students to work, or have training in
Taiwan-funded enterprises, from which they can learn modern
agricultural ideas and practices," said a teacher at Hainan
Agricultural College.
</P>
<P>
The teacher added that the move is conducive to fostering
modern agricultural technicians and managerial personnel in China.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Confirms Letter on Normalization with Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
confirmed on Monday that he had received a letter in 1993 from
Indonesian businessman Mochtar Riady urging him to normalize
relations with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In answering to reporter at a medal presentation ceremony about
a Wall Street Journal article, which disclosed Cliton's connection
with the Indonesian businessman's family, the president said:
"It's a letter like tens of thousands of other letters I get of
people, suggesting... what our policy ought to be in various
areas."
</P>
<P>
Riady's family, which owns the Lippo Group Banking and real
estate conglomerate based in Indonesia and Hong Kong, was
reportedly involved in a controversy alleging that Clinton and the
Democrats has accepted his business's contributions against the
U.S. campaign law.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wall Street Journal, Riady was most
straightforward in his letter to urge U.S. normalization of
relations with Vietnam, confiding the president that two of his
managers were in Vietnam scouting investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Clinton responded on April 5, telling Riady that his letter
had been forwarded to Robert Rubin, then the White House's
National Economic Council chairman and now the Treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a year later, in February 1994, the Clinton
administration lifted the embargo against Vietnam. and in July
1995, the United States fully normalized relations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said: "You will see it's a straightforward policy
letter, the kind of thing that I think people ought to feel free
to write the president about."

<HEADLINE> White Couple Get Two Years for Assaulting Black Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A white couple in Manning,
South Carolina, who tied a 9-year-old black boy to a tree and
fired a shotgun past his face received a two-year prison sentence
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The boy, who is now 10, and his parents said they thought the
sentence handed to Benjamin and Betty Mims was too lenient.
</P>
<P>
"I think they should have had more, five to 10 years," The
Associated Press quoted Dwight Miller as saying. "What they did to
me was wrong."
</P>
<P>
The Mimses could have received up to 10 years for aggravated
assault and battery. They were acquitted November 22 on another
charge, second-degree lynching, the state's term for mob violence.
</P>
<P>
Dwight said the Mimses tied him to a tree, beat him and fired a
shotgun at him on January 5 after accusing him of stealing from a
truck.
</P>
<P>
The boy, who lives across the road in the rural New Zion
community, said he had come over to play with the couple's
9-year-old son and 13-year-old niece, but that the children also
turned on him.
</P>
<P>
Prosecution witnesses asked Circuit Judge Thomas Cooper to give
a stiff sentence to help heal racial divisions.
</P>
<P>
Defense witnesses denied the Mimses felt any racial hatred and
urged leniency because the two are in poor health and must care
for their children.
</P>
<P>
The Mimses continued to maintain their innocence. "I have never
hurt nobody and I never had it in my heart to hurt nobody," Mims
said.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Government Condemns Political Abuse of Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government
condemned on Monday the use of children in street protests and
political actions by opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Information Ministry quoted the government as
saying in a session, chaired by Premier Mirko Marjanovic, that
this was an uncivilized, inhuman and irresponsible act to incite
students and pupils to participate in anti-government rallies.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno (Together) resumed its protest
rally Monday, joined by university and high school students,
against alleged irregularities in the city elections despite heavy
snow in Belgrade. The University of Belgrade students had declared
a strike last week.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators went past the city council, the federal
parliament and the newspaper Borba, chanting slogans and demanding
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to step down. Serbian police
said Monday 32 protesters had been arrested for violating the law.
</P>
<P>
While reviewing the implementation of measures of the current
economic and social policy and preparation of measures for the
realization of the 1997 economic policy, the government said
unexpected problems had arisen in the realization of economic and
social measures.
</P>
<P>
"The problems have primarily been triggered by opposition
parties that manifest their dissatisfaction with election returns
through demonstrations, especially in Belgrade," the government
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to considerable material damages, incurred through
vandalistic acts by protesters in rallies staged by the Zajedno,
the country's economy and population are affected also by
disruptions in public transport, utility services and other
disruptions, the government said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Querying about S. Korean Missile Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has raised
a question with South Korea about allegations that the Seoul
government is building a long-range cruise missile in violation of
a bilateral agreement, an administration official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official said the subject was being discussed during
U.S.-South Korean talks on nonproliferation issues at the State
Department that began on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times reported on Monday that South Korea is
moving ahead with plans to develop missiles with ranges greater
than 112 miles beyond, the restriction set by a U.S.-South Korean
agreement, to "counter the threat posed by North Korea's
missiles."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said South Korea is going to request at the talks
to alter the 1979 agreement between the two countries to permit
Seoul to build missiles with ranges up to 186 miles, which it said
was the range allowed under the 31-nation Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTCR).
</P>
<P>
But the United States has opposed the change because of its
fear that allowing South Korea to build longer-range missiles will
set off a new arms race in the region, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns declined to comment
of the Washington Times report.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Supreme Court to Uphold Brady Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Monday urged the Supreme Court to uphold the "Brady Act," which
goes before the justices this week.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it's constitutional," Clinton told reporters. "And I
believe that we have clearly preserved the right to keep and bear
arms, consistent with the Constitution in this country, but we
have also made America a safer place."
</P>
<P>
"I think we're better off and I certainly hope that the
constitutionality will be upheld," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The law passed in 1993, was named after the press secretary to
former President Ronald Reagan, James Brady, who was injured in
the 1981 assassination attempt on Reagan.
</P>
<P>
It requires gun dealers to give local authorities the name of
prospective handgun buyers and wait five days before completing a
sale. The background checks include a review of state, local and
national crime records.
</P>
<P>
The high court hears oral arguments in a case on Tuesday with
opponents arguing that Washington is forcing too much on local
authorities. Some local sheriffs say the law is unfair because it
forces background checks on innocent citizens who are entitled to
their rights under the Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said, "There are tens of thousands of people with
criminal backgrounds and other serious problems that couldn't get
handguns because of the Brady law. People are alive today because
of it. It's a better country because of it."

leading to the deterioration of the peace process, he warned.
</P>
<P>
He described the extraordinary session of the Arab League (AL)
permanent delegates as an important meeting which reaffirms the
unified Arab stance on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In separate statements to MENA, the ambassadors of France,
Japan and Canada joined voices in calling for an end to building
new Jewish settlements in Arab lands to avoid complicating the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member AL held an emergency meeting to map out a joint
Arab strategy against Israel's plans to build thousands of new
Jewish homes in Gaza, the West Bank and Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The AL condemned the Israeli expansion of settlements in
occupied Arab territories and warned the Jewish state such
practices could destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel should not only stop building new settlements but also
dismantle existing ones immediately, said a statement issued after
the AL's two-hour emergency session Sunday.

LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
ended mixed today, with British shares falling sharply while
Frankfurt surging strongly to close at a new record high.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index were pinned near the day's lows at the
close of trading after a dose of US profit-taking, ending 19.5
points down at 4,038.5, as traders were concerned about sterling's
strength and possible interest rate rise.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast, German shares in Frankfurt finished the
session at a new record close, with the DAX-30 share index having
hit an intraday high of 2,860.24 before ending 13.08 points up at
a record 2,858.60.
</P>

Dealers said that the market retained last week's rally and
remained underpinned by a firm dollar, which benefits German
exporters, and hopes of another cut in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, share prices ended slightly higher following a quiet
session and despite losses on Wall Street, with the CAC-40 share
index up 2.97 points at 2,318.63, boosted by the firmer dollar,
strength in bonds and hopes of interest rates cut in France and
Germany.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls on Attending to AIDS in Developing World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- President of UN General
Assembly Razali Ismail today called on the international community
to address HIV/AIDS epidemic in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In a message delivered on the occasion of World AIDS Day,
Razali said that the HIV and AIDS epidemic continues to take its
toll with an estimated 8,500 people newly infected each day.
</P>
<P>
"Over 21 million people currently live with HIV/AIDS, ninety
percent of whom live in the developing world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though medical science promises new combination drug therapies
which offer renewed hope of arresting the AIDS virus, the
exorbitant cost of such treatment, at up to 20,000 dollars a year,
delivers hope to high-income groups only, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"In some countries of sub-Saharan Africa, public expenditure on
health services totals no more than 10 dollars a person a year.
The majority of those with HIV worldwide are therefore excluded
from any treatment using drug therapy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Preventive strategies are particularly important in developing
countries where under-development and poverty inhibit the spread
of accurate information about AIDS, and diminish access to and
provision of health service, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the rate of HIV infection is reduced in developed countries,
the possibility that it may continue to spiral out of control in
developing countries poses serious social, political and ethical
questions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the transmission routes of HIV infection are acknowledged
to be variables of poverty, the international community must
attend these root causes," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said that HIV/AIDS
is a global problem. No country or region is immune.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has taken a lead in promoting vital
education and prevention programs in partnership with member
states, which will promote greater cooperation and coordination in
the field and develop new policy initiatives and mobilize new
resources at the global, regional and country levels.
</P>
<P>
World AIDS Day was established on December 1, 1988 by the WHO,
and its annual observance is mandated by General Assembly
resolution 43/15.

<HEADLINE> US Students Studying Abroad in Record Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW York, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of American
students studying abroad rose 10.6 percent over the previous
school year to 84,403 in 1994-95, continuing a 10-year upward
trend, according to a report released yesterday by the New
York-based Institute of International Education.
</P>
<P>
A fast-growing economic market in China led to a 30 percent of
increase in American students studying there in 1994-95, said the
institute which has conducted an annual statistical survey of
foreign students population in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Foreign student enrollment in U.S. schools, meanwhile, rose
less than 1 percent in the past two years. Some 453,000 foreigners
were enrolled into U.S. campuses this year, representing only 0.3
percent more than a year ago and continuing a six-year trend of
slow growth.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason for the rising wave of Americans signing
up for study abroad, Richard M. Krasno, the institute's president
said that American students are warming to the idea to studying
abroad because they are being exposed to other cultures on their
own campuses. Many also recognize the importance of a second
language and international experience in competing for good jobs,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Calls for Continuous Ban of Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The National Union of Textile,
Garment and Tailoring Workers of Nigeria (NUTGWN) has urged the
government to continue banning import of finished textile
products from Asia in the 1997 budget year.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria today quoted Adams Oshiomole,
General Secretary of the NUTGWN as saying that Nigerian textile
products cannot compete favorably with those produced under
conditions of "child labor and strings of incentives in the
export processing zones of Asia".
</P>
<P>
He described the government's ban on importation of finished
textile products announced in the 1996 budget as "a very
appropriate and patriotic decision" and called on the retention
of the ban in the 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
According to him, textile is the largest sectoral employer
after the government and a major foreign exchange earner in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the government to beef up the fight against
smuggling and ensure the strict enforcement of the ban.

<HEADLINE> OPC Force to Leave Turkey Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Operation Provide Comfort
Force (OPC), comprising troops of major western powers, is
reportedly to leave Turkey before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Many parliamentarians support the move not to extend the
mandate of the OPC force, making it more possible to end its
existence on the Turkish territories.
</P>
<P>
The OPC force was deployed in an air base in Incirlik
of Adana, southern Turkey, in line with a Turkish parliament
decision made on January 17, 1991, to provide air protection
for the Iraqi Kurds in the wake of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
At a latest session of the National Security Council, Chief of
General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi reportedly said that the OPC
force, including Turkish, U.S., British and French troops, should
leave the country since its aim of stationing in Turkey has no
longer existed.
</P>
<P>
Some parliamentarians said that the government should reach
an agreement with the countries concerned on the departure of the
OPC force, but do not give the impression that Turkey was
taking a stance against the Western coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the departure of the OPC force would prevent
the regional countries from being upset over this situation.
</P>
<P>
As for the concrete steps, Kamuran Inan, deputy of the
main opposition Motherland Party, suggested that the U.S. planes
stay at Incirlik base for some more time in case of a possible war
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The current mandate of the OPC force will expire on
December 31.
