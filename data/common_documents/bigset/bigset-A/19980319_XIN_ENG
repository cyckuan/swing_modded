<HEADLINE> Greek Dockworkers Stage Warning Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Dock workers in Greece's two
largest ports Wednesday began a one-day warning strike to protest
the Greek government's decision to privatize the ports.
</P>
<P>
In Piraeus, about 15 kilometers southwest of Greece's capital
Athens, some 800 dock workers marched through the streets, Athens
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The dockworkers chanted slogans such as "hands off the ports"
and called on the government to revoke its privatization plan and
reform the ports in line with the institutional framework.
</P>
<P>
Dock worker representatives also held talks with Greek
Merchant Marine Minister Stavros Soumakis, who urged the
dock workers to continue their dialogue with the government.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki, angry dock workers
 warned that if the Greek government refused to change its
decision, they would stage a long-term strike.
</P>
<P>
To speed up economic reforms, the Greek government decided to
step up the privatization drive.

<HEADLINE> Secrets of Segregation Revealed in Mississippi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- After a two-decade court
battle, newly unsealed files are revealing the extent of
Mississippi's efforts to thwart desegregation between the 1950s
and the 1970s using the state sovereignty commission.
</P>
<P>
The files opened in Jackson Tuesday show the extent to which
some people in Mississippi acted to block integration, news
reports said.
</P>
<P>
During the height of the civil rights struggle, the commission
allegedly spied on activists and fought efforts to integrate
blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
The agency engaged in a comprehensive campaign from 1956 to
1973 aimed at sabotaging integration efforts and extolling the
advantages of a segregated state in propaganda films it produced.
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit filed 21 years ago led to the unsealing Tuesday of
132,000 pages of documents at the Mississippi State Archives.
</P>
<P>
The commission's files contain more than 87,000 names of
individuals caught up in its efforts, from victims of spying to
the spies themselves and other agents.
</P>
<P>
Revealed in the files for the first time are Mississippi's
attempts to undermine federal law with its own clandestine agency,
and they detail the commission's fear and loathing of the civil
rights movement.

<HEADLINE> Ericsson to Invest $16 Million in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Swedish telecommunications
giant Ericsson plans to invest 80 million Rand (16.1 million U.S.
Dollars) in South Africa through the establishment of a microwave
equipment manufacturing facility, the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new facility would double Ericsson's capital investment in
South Africa to 160 million Rand (32.2 million Dollars), the
company's Managing Director Christer Hohenthal said.
</P>
<P>
The facility would be backed by South Africa's booming
microwave equipment market, which had doubled its revenues each
year for the last three to four years, a Star paper report quoted
Hohenthal as saying.
</P>
<P>
Telkom, South Africa's state-controlled telecommunications
company, was currently the largest consumer of the equipment and
the company expects more business as the South African
authorities plan to award one or two more cellular network
operators licenses this year.
</P>
<P>
Last week Ericsson signed a partnership agreement with the
South African Trade and Industry Department, which would enable
the company to focus on long-term operations, including research
and development, production and transfer in South Africa,
Hohenthal said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian President Urges Earlier Return of Axum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negasso
Gidada said Wednesday that the process for the return of the Axum
Obelisk, now in Rome, should gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman from the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry,
Negasso made the remarks when he held talks with visiting Italian

here.
</P>

According to the spokesman, Volpe explained the current state
of the technical works being carried out concerning the return of
the obelisk.
</P>
<P>
Volpe said a thorough technical survey is being conducted on
the foundation and the joints of the different sections of the
obelisk with a view to ensuring its safe return.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Italy have agreed to return the Axum Obelisk, now
standing in Rome, which was looted by then Italian aggressors in

over the reaction of Israel to the visit by British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook to a Jewish settlement in the Arab part of

to criticize the colonization, a freezing of which is a necessary
condition for the resumption of the peace process," he said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu snubbed Cook by
canceling a dinner with him, after the British foreign secretary,

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
arrived here from Amman late Wednesday on his first visit to Egypt
since he took the helm at the world organization on January 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the airport, Annan expressed thanks to
Egyptian leaders for their support of his work. "I got a lot of
support from Egyptian leadership during the critical weeks (of the
Iraq crisis over arms inspections) and had been working closely
with" them, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was looking forward to "constructive and helpful
discussions" with President Hosni Mubarak on Thursday. The
U.N. chief was greeted by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Mubarak are expect to focus on the Mideast peace
process, the latest developments of the situation in Iraq and
relations between Egypt and the U.N. as well as the U.N. role in
pushing forward the peace process and clearing the Middle East of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
They will also exchange views on the issue of U.N.-imposed
sanctions on Libya, the situation in Somalia and other topic.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit here, Annan will hold talks Wednesday
with Moussa and the Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid on the latest regional and international developments
as well as the envisaged reform of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Coming from Jordan, Annan is going to visit Syria, Israel and
the Palestinian self-rule area on a nine-day trip. He denied
earlier reports that he was carrying a specific U.S. peace plan to
breathe life into the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative, said to be unveiled by U.S. President Bill
Clinton soon, is aimed at unblocking the peace logjam through
direct U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that Annan, with a deal at hand which defused
the Iraq-U.N. crisis, will confer with regional leaders the
implementation of the U.N resolutions on the decades-long
Arab-Israeli conflicts and cooperation between these countries and
the world body.
</P>
<P>
Annan, a Ghanaian, replaced former secretary-general Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian who retired at the end of his five-year
term on New Year's Day in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Complaints About UK Train Service Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Rail travel complaints in Britain
rose sharply in the final quarter of last year as the country's
train service deteriorated, according figures released Wednesday
by the Central Rail Users' Consultative Committee.
</P>
<P>
The national rail watchdog said that complaints about poor rail
standards rose by 155 percent between October and December last
year, compared with the same period in 1996, the highest recorded
for any quarter and was 40 percent up over the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, travelers had to wait months for their complaints to
be answered, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
It added that almost half the complaints it received concerns
punctuality, cancellations and overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
Complaints about inaccurate information from the national rail
inquiry service increased by 422 percent although they only made
up 6 percent of the total complaints.
</P>
<P>
The watchdog's chairman David Bertram said that with so much
public funding supporting the railways, the industry "must quickly
find ways of meeting the ever rising expectations of their new
passengers as well as of those who have suffered so long."

<HEADLINE> Canada's B.C. Province to Be in Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's British Columbia (B.C.)
province is "essentially in recession, weakened by the impact of
the Asian crisis and lower consumer and business confidence," said
reports Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
B.C.'s real gross domestic product will grow only 0.5 percent
in 1998, according to Toronto-Dominion Bank, which forecast a 3.1
percent growth rate for the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Next year, the B.C. economy is going to grow 1.5 percent, the
bank said in its quarterly forecast.
</P>
<P>
Though in strict economic terms, a recession is defined as two
consecutive quarters of negative growth, which isn't the case in
B.C. yet, the bank said that could still happen.
</P>
<P>
"Our outlook is that the economy is flat," Teresa Courchene,
the bank's senior economist, was quoted as saying. "Just about
everything across the board is weak."
</P>
<P>
The main culprit in the B.C. weakness is said to be the natural
resource sector, which accounts for more than a third of its total
exports.
</P>
<P>
Demand for natural-resource products from key markets such as
Asia has been low and has pushed down prices, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some B.C.-based forecasters are calling for even
weaker growth for Canada's west-coast province.
</P>
<P>
The provincial economy is likely to contract 1 percent this
year and suffer another contraction in 1999, they said.
</P>
<P>
High taxes and red tape in the resources sectors are largely to
blame, though the Asian financial crisis has accelerated the
decline, they noted.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Erupts in Somali Border Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting has been
reported in the border region of Gedo between forces loyal to the
Somali National Front (SNF) and heavily armed militiamen of the
fundamentalist Islamic group of Al-Itihad.
</P>
<P>
According to General Omar Hagi Massalle, the chairman of the
SNF faction in Gedo region, the fighting started in the border
town of El-waq two days ago between his forces and others from
the town of Kismayu under the name of Al-Itihad Al-Islam.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the area said the SNF faction has lost 13 of
their fighters while those who attacked the town of El-waq have
suffered nine deaths.
</P>
<P>
A well-known businessman has been reported as one of the
leaders pioneering the fighting.
</P>
<P>
At least two technical wagons belonging to the SNF forces were
also destroyed during the fighting in which more than 10 battle
wagons were involved.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of civilians were also wounded while the citizens of
El-waq took refuge in neighboring villages along the border with
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
General Omar Hagi Masalle said the plan to destabilize the
region and the attack has been continuing in the port town of
Kismayu, 50 km south of Mogadishu, in the past month, according
to their intelligence information.
</P>
<P>
The attack has been in retaliation for the repetitive raids on
the Southern port town of Kismayu by the Marehan militiamen.
</P>
<P>
General Omar has declined to mention the name of the clan that
attacked the region, but by mentioning the name of Kismayu people
he refers to the Majerten clansmen who ousted his clansmen of
Marehan from the town last year.
</P>
<P>
Muse Sheikh Omar who claims to be the chairman of an alleged
intellectuals council for the SNF faction has called on the two
sides to stop the renewed hostility and make a cease-fire
agreement and solve their differences through dialog.
</P>
<P>
There has been no Al-Itihad officials to confirm the fighting
or any involvement of their forces in any kind of fighting with
any faction.
</P>
<P>
The border region of Gedo has been a battle field for the
Ethiopian forces who invaded Somalia twice last year pitting
themeslves against the forces of Al-Itihad who were then driven
out of their main headquarters of Dolow, Luq and Bulo Hawo. The
Ethiopians had then accused Al-Itihad for masterminding terrorist
attacks inside Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> More Iraqi Children, Elderly Die in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 8,000 Iraqi children
and elderly died in February due to lack of food and medicine,
statistics released by the Iraqi authority on Wednesday showed.
</P>
<P>
The figures made public by the Iraqi Health Ministry indicated
6,623 children under the age of five died of diarrhea, pneumonia
and malnutrition last February, compared with 356 cases registered
in February 1989 before the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the death of the elderly over age 50 reached 2,326,
four times that of February 1989. They died of hypertension,
diabetes and malignant neoplasms, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry blamed the deaths on the lack of food, medicine
and basic medical equipment caused by economic sanctions the
United Nations imposed since 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
which barred Iraq from exporting oil, its main revenue earner.
</P>
<P>
During the day, a funeral procession was held in the capital
Baghdad for 35 children, who are victims of the crippling economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The procession headed for the U.N. Office in Baghdad, to which
the families of the dead handed over a letter condemning the
United States' "oppressive acts" to delay the lifting of the
sanctions against Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that since Baghdad lost the Gulf war to
the U.S.-led allied forces in 1991, a total of 1.3 million Iraqi
children have died because of the shortage of food and medicine.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Attracted to Canada by Cheap C. Doller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- More Americans traveled to Canada
in January and fewer Canadians went south thanks to a weak
Canadian dollar, Statistics Canada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Americans made 2.3 million cross-border car trips to Canada in
January, the highest level since May 1981.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Canadians made only 2.6 million similar car
trips to the United States, the lowest level since February 1988,
according to the statistics agency.
</P>
<P>
All this came against the backdrops of a falling Canadian
dollar, which dropped to its lowest level of about 68 U.S. cents
in January.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Canadian dollar was still quite strong compared with
most Asian currencies, which depreciated significantly due to the
Asian financial turmoils.
</P>
<P>
In January, the number of Asian tourists visiting Canada were
down 16.9 percent from the same period last year.

LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
will go ahead with his Middle East tour as scheduled despite his
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's row with Israel over visiting a
disputed Israeli settlement, according to a Downing Street
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who accused Cook of
breaking an agreement not to meet Palestinians while visiting Har
Home in east Jerusalem, canceled a planned dinner with Cook, who
is on a Middle East tour, Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Blair, due to visit the Middle East
next month to revive the Middle East peace process, had given his
full support to Cook's handling of the current dispute with
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Blair also held a telephone conversation with Cook, who is on a
Middle East tour, Tuesday night "to convey his (Blair's) support
for the foreign secretary," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On Blair's visit to the same region, the spokesman said, "I
have no doubt at all that the prime minister's trip will be going
ahead. It has been in the planning for some time."

<HEADLINE> Cook Wants to See Israeli Withdrawal From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 18 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook arrived here Wednesday afternoon from Damascus in a regional
tour aimed at reviving the stalled Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
After talks with his Lebanese counterpart Fares Boueiz, Cook
told reporters that he wanted to see Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon as part of a broader Arab-Israeli peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
He said he was very pleased to visit Lebanon at a time when the
country was to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the adoption of
the United Nations Security Council resolution 425 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted by the U.N. in 1978 calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer area in south
Lebanon in 1985 as a "security zone" to allegedly protect its
northern border areas from Lebanese resistance guerrilla's
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the European Union (EU) will be working to resolve
the Arab-Israeli conflict in the framework of a comprehensive
solution. The British foreign secretary was representing the EU on
the visit to help advance the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that progress should be achieved on all tracks
involved in the peace process rather than on only one track, a
reference to Syrian and Lebanese negotiations with Israel, which
have been suspended since 1996 when Benjamin Netanyahu took the
premiership in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz told Cook that Lebanon had rejected Israel's offer to
conditionally pull back from south Lebanon, adding that the U.N.
resolution 425 calls for its unconditional withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Cook visited Syria before his arrival here. He called for the
implementation of the U.N. resolution, but said security issues
need to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
Cook is due to hold talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri on Israeli offer later in the night.

<HEADLINE> EU to Continue Efforts for Mideast Peace: Cook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook said on Wednesday that the European Union
(EU) intends to follow up its efforts to help revive the stalled
Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with his Syrian counterpart
Farouq al-Sharaa before leaving for Lebanon, Cook said that he has
expressed the EU's deep anxiety over the deadlock in the peace
process during his current Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that his visit could contribute to the progress
in the peace process in terms of a comprehensive peace on Syrian,
Lebanese as well as Palestinian tracks.
</P>
<P>
He said that EU's envoy for the Middle East Miguel Moratinos
would keep contact with Syrian and Lebanese officials to exert
continued efforts.
</P>
<P>
Representing the EU to mediate peace in the region, Cook
arrived here early in the day on the fifth leg of of his regional
trip. He has visited Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian self-rule
areas and Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with al-Sharaa and Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, Cook discussed ways of resuming peace talks between
Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinians, and Israel based on the United
Nations resolutions and the latest developments of regional
situation.
</P>
<P>
Those talks have been in a standstill for more than a year due
to Israel's hardline policy and settlement expansion in the
occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, Cook told
the press conference that he has discussed with the Syrian side
the prospects of implementing the United Nations resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The resolution demands an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon, which the Jewish state has been occupying to
allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraq issue, Cook said he exchanged views with al-Sharaa
on a British plan to convene a conference to study humanitarian
needs of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
He said there are differences between the EU and Iraq over the
ways of ensuring food supply to relieve the sufferings of Iraqi
people. But he hoped the differences would be resolved through
diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, al-Sharaa described Cook's visit to
Syria as "fruitful and positive."
</P>
<P>
He said that during the visit to Damascus the British foreign
secretary has got acquainted with Syria's views on the peace
process, which he hoped would be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
He added that both of them also dealt with the issues of
cooperation between the EU and the Middle East, particularly
between the EU between Syria.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. Troops in Bosnia Can Be Reduced to 6,900 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen urged Congress Wednesday to keep U.S. troops in
Bosnia, but said the force could be cut to 6,900 from 8,500.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and military
chiefs urged the House National Security Committee to support the
Clinton administration's active role in implementing the terms of
the Dayton accord signed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government had initially planned to station the troops
in Bosnia for one year, later extend the mandate of the troops for
18 months.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, President Bill Clinton decided to extend
their mission indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some members of Congress are challenging the
constitutionality of the action, Albright said a withdrawal "would
do severe harm to U.S. credibility."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the U.S. contingent could be cut from 8,500 to 6,900
if the mission was not changed. He said Clinton did not order the
reduction but advised the Pentagon to make a judgment based on
"military requirements."
</P>
<P>
However, Cohen said he did not know how long the U.S. troops
would remain in Bosnia.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A survey released here Wednesday
shows that leading multinational companies are confident in Asia
despite the financial crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia as a destination for foreign direct investment
remains unshaken, according to the survey conducted in
mid-February jointly by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) ad the International Chamber of Commerce
(ICC).
</P>
<P>
One in four of the companies polled said it plans to increase
direct investments over the short and medium term, while 62
percent are continuing with their existing plans.
</P>
<P>
Almost all firms covered by the survey make a positive
long-term assessment, taking the view that direct investment
prospects are either unchanged (81 percent) or have improved (13
percent).
</P>
<P>
Announcing the outcome of the survey at a news conference
Wednesday, UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens Ricupero said, "The
results clearly show that multinational corporations are keenly
interested in the region for direct investment in the production
of goods and services. This augurs well for recovery in the
region."

ICC Secretary General Maria Livanos Cattaui said, "This is a
resounding vote of confidence in the economic fundamentals of East
and Southeast Asia and the region's long-term prospects."

derived from the projected growth of Asian markets in the 21st
century," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The ministry of justice of
Ethiopia said on Wednesday that it would take legal measures
against 110 development and aid agencies which it said are
operating without legal registration.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the ministry said only
180 foreign and indigenous development agencies have so far
applied for registration to the ministry of justice.
</P>
<P>
Despite registration with the disaster prevention and
preparedness commission of the country to operate in more than
one region, some 103 foreign aid agencies have failed to appear
for registration with the ministry, the ministry said, adding
that seven non-governmental organizaitons were denied legal
personality for failing to meet the requirements.
</P>
<P>
It said, agencies working without legal permission will be
held responsible in accordance with the Ethiopian law in spite of
their contribution to the public welfare.
</P>
<P>
The importance of the registration emanates from the need to
make public their activities to the populace as well as to donors
in addition to reflecting accountability for their undertakings,
the ministry added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Reject Proposal on EU Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has refused to participate in Cyprus' accession
negotiations with the European Union (EU) on March 31, Cyprus News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted the EU sources as saying that the EU
member states have already been informed of Denktash's rejection
of a proposal for Turkish Cypriots' joining in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was put forward by Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides in London last week, which has been described by the EU
as "fair and generous."
</P>
<P>
In the proposal, Clerides offered that "the Turkish Cypriot
community nominate representatives to be included as full members
of the Cypriot team, which will conduct the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
He also assured Turkish Cypriots that their views will be
discussed "freely, seriously and in good faith and that the
conclusions reached will constitute an important element in
formulating the negotiating positions of the Cypriot team."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Clerides' proposal was passed over to
Denktash by British High Commissioner to Cyprus David Madden in a
meeting with the Turkish Cypriot leader on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Madden was quoted as saying that Britain will continue its
efforts to persuade the Turkish Cypriots to participate in
accession talks, and hoped that this goal could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has maintained that the application for EU membership
by the government of Cyprus, filed in July 1990, does not
represent the Turkish Cypriots, and argued that Cyprus can not
join in the EU unless Turkey becomes a EU member.
</P>
<P>
He has accused the EU of derailing the U.N.-led peace effort on
Cyprus with its decision to begin accession talks, and refused to
meet any EU official since.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974, when
Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern third of the
island following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia: Foreign Interference Complicates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin said on Wednesday that foreign interference has
further complicated the situation in the war-ravaged Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Ethiopian News Agency, Seyoum
said that Somalia continues to be traumatized by anarchy largely
due to parochialism and self-centeredness of the warring factions
as well as foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) is
ready to complement the initiative of the interfering parties
only if they genuinely intend to help the Somali people, said
Seyoum.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ethiopia, mandated by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and IGAD, and the sub-region group itself were
bringing the Somali peace process back on track when it was
suddenly derailed, citing the recent Cairo event as a case in
point.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that outside interference will only
lead to mushrooming of warring factions and will not help bring
about lasting solution to the Somali problem.
</P>
<P>
Embracing factions alone is no solution to the Somali problem
and it needs to put pressure on belligerent factions through
broad-based support, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. Troops in Bosnia Can Be Reduced to 6,900 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen urged Congress Wednesday to keep U.S. troops in
Bosnia, but said the force could be cut to 6,900 from 8,500.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and military
chiefs urged the House National Security Committee to support the
Clinton administration's active role in implementing the terms of
the Dayton accord signed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government had initially planned to station the troops
in Bosnia for one year, later extend the mandate of the troops for
18 months.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, President Bill Clinton decided to extend
their mission indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some members of Congress are challenging the
constitutionality of the action, Albright said a withdrawal "would
do severe harm to U.S. credibility."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the U.S. contingent could be cut from 8,500 to 6,900
if the mission was not changed. He said Clinton did not order the
reduction but advised the Pentagon to make a judgment based on
"military requirements."
</P>
<P>
However, Cohen said he did not know how long the U.S. troops
would remain in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of S. Leone Civilians Held Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of local men in eastern
Sierra Leone's diamond-rich area are still being held hostage by
remnants of the ousted military junta and rebel allies more than
one month after their fall, the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These men are possibly used as fighters and porters in the
battle the combatants of the ousted regime launched against the
west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG, according to the UNHCR
African representative.
</P>
<P>
While the men were held hostage, more than 1,000 local
residents fled to neighboring Liberia and Guinea, mostly women
and children, the UNHCR said, quoted by the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The reason the women and children were allowed to flee might
be that the junta members want to send their families out of
Sierra Leone, it said.
</P>
<P>
The junta, which seized power through a coup last May, has
vowed to fight to the last drop of blood since its overthrow by
ECOMOG in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
As most junta soldiers either surrendered to or were arrested
by ECOMOG, it is not easy for the remnants to resist the attacks
by ECOMOG, whose ultimate task is to clean up the junta forces
and allied Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels.
</P>
<P>
That is why so many men are held by the ousted junta, the
UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has
been allocating four million U.S. dollars on its work for
children in Sierra Leone after nearly ten months of chaos under
the military regime.
</P>
<P>
The money will firstly be used to provide commerical food and
drugs to children in the country, especially those in the
countryside, according to UNICEF's representative in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF also called on ECOMOG to take care in treating the RUF
child soldiers, noting that they are also victims of the civil
war.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian House Speaker on Parliament Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian speaker of the
House of People's Representatives Dawit Yohannes described on
Wednesday the past six-month performance of the parliament as
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference to local press, Dawit said the
house had endorsed 18 proclamations at its 21 regular sessions,
adding that the proclamations approved would strengthen legal
institutions, endorse budget requirements and provide for eight
international agreements.
</P>
<P>
Deputy speaker Petros Olango said at the press conference that
the house ratified the international intellectual property
patent, the agreements Ethiopia reached with Kuwait and Italy to
avoid double taxation, the convention on the right of the child
and others.
</P>
<P>
He said over ten executive bodies including the prime minister
have presented their performance reports to the house.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on how the house verifies the
veracity of the reports presented to the parliament by the
various ministers and commissioners, speaker Dawit said the house
utilizes every available mechanism to ensure the authenticity of
the reports.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the capacity of the house, Dawit said the house is
affected by shortage of experts who he said often join private
institutions where they are better paid.
</P>
<P>
The house is doing its level best to ensure competence with
the help of the experts it has and cited enhancing the house's
professional capability as one of the house's future priority
areas, he added.

<HEADLINE> Russian Mideast Envoy Visits Lebanon on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
and Middle East envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk arrived here Wednesday to
deliver a letter from Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov to his
Lebanese counterpart Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
The letter reportedly concerns Russia's position on Israel's
offer to withdraw from south Lebanon on the conditions that
Israel's security is ensured by Lebanese government troops.
</P>
<P>
Israel said that it is willing to implement the United Nations
Resolution 425 and pull back from Lebanon, if the Lebanese
government agrees on security arrangements including disarming the
Islamic resistance movement Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the Israeli offer, arguing that the U.N.
resolution demands an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from the
area it invaded in 1978.
</P>
<P>
After holding discussion with Boueiz on the issue, Posuvalyuk
said Russia always supports the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
However he expressed welcome to Israel's recognition of the
U.N. resolution, saying it is a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Israel now occupies an area of 1,200 square kilometers in
south Lebanon to allegedly protect its northern territories from
cross-border attacks by resistance guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Referring to peace talks between Lebanon, Syria and Israel,
Posuvalyuk deemed it important that Lebanon and Syria open
negotiations simultaneously with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government is under increasing pressure to pull back
from south Lebanon because of the high price it has been paying
for the occupation in terms of human casualties. An average of
half a dozen Israeli soldiers lost their lives each month in an
attrition war with guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
But the latest Israeli offer of conditional withdrawal is seen
as a ploy to drive a wedge between Lebanon and Syria, which is
demanding the return of its Golan Heights captured by Israel in
1967.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk said that Russia, as a co-sponsor of the Middle East
peace process, is working in coordination with the United States
and the European Union to revive the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace process, including the Palestinian-Israeli track, has
been deadlocked for more than a year due to Israel's hardline
policy and settlement expansion in the occupied Arab territories.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Called to Fight Cross-Border Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian police Wednesday
blamed the increasing incidents of armed banditry in the border
areas on lack of cooperation by the traditional rulers and the
public.
</P>
<P>
"It is not right to expect the police to fight crime alone
without the traditional rulers and the public volunteering
information on the movement of suspects," a police officer said
here, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).
</P>
<P>
"We must pool our resources together for collective security,"
said Young Arebamen, the public relations officer at the force
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"The public knows who the criminals are or when they come into
town. We are not magicians who are expected to be everywhere all
the time," said Arebamen, who is also a deputy commissioner of
police.
</P>
<P>
Arebamen's words followed the call of Internal Affairs
Minister Alhaji Bashir Dalhatu that security agents at the
country's border posts should be more vigilant to ensure maximum
security at the frontier.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection of one border post near Benin Tuesday,
the minister expressed concern about the rising wave of
cross-border crime and its damaging effects on the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged the security officials to reduce them to the barest
minimum.
</P>
<P>
According to NAN, Nigerians in the border areas, especially in
the northeast, are still crying out about the increasing
incidents of armed robbery and rustling.
</P>
<P>
A crime fighting outfit named "Operation Zaki" has been
deployed in the northeast with police helicopters and armored
personnel carriers.

<HEADLINE> Latvia Seeks Friendly Relations With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Latvian Foreign Ministry
Wednesday expressed willingness to soften the tension that emerged
recently between Russia and Latvia, according to the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Latvian Foreign Minister Valdis Birkavs told a briefing in Riga
that the Baltic country still seeks friendly, good-neighborly
relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries became more tense after
Latvian police dispersed a Russian-speaker rally by using batons
in Riga on March 3.
</P>
<P>
Birkavs said that at the 54th session of the U.N. Committee for
Human Rights, which will take place in Geneva, he would "rebuff
reprimands by Russia" accusing Latvia of violating the rights of
ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Riga cannot be reconciled with the passive
attitude by Russian authorities towards extremists threatening
Latvian diplomatic missions in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he hopes that relations between Russia and
Latvia will not come to a situation similar to Soviet-Chinese
relations in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Birkavs also said that Latvia plans to draw up a program by
June 30 to integrate its numerous Russian speakers into the Baltic
country's society.
</P>
<P>
About 700,000 people in Latvia, or one-third of the population,
are Russian speakers, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The program's main goals are to achieve "understanding between
citizens and noncitizens, between (ethnic) Latvians and
non-Latvians, avoiding the emergence of a two-community state on
Latvian territory," Birkavs said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Welcomes "Impartial" Mediation: Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday said Israel only welcomes
"impartial attitude" in advancing the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Prior to talks with visiting Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides here, Netanyahu told reporters that every related party
should take "impartial, balanced and constructive attitude" in a
bid to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after he snubbed British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook during his visit to the Jewish state Tuesday. Israel
accused Cook of leaning toward the Palestinians by changing his
itinerary without consulting with Israel and meeting with
Palestinian officials in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Defying Israel's dissuasion and apparent anger, Cook braved
soaking rain to tour Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem to "send a
message that the European Union is concerned with expansion of
Jewish settlements."
</P>
<P>
Israel broke ground for the construction of a Jewish settlement
on the disputed Har Homa a year ago, setting off Palestinian
protests and violence, and bringing the peace process to a
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu piled on Cook's move as "biased against Israel and
constituted a challenge to Israel's exclusive sovereignty over
Jerusalem", and even canceled a dinner in his honor.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed it has sovereignty over the whole Jerusalem,
including the Arab east part it captured in 1967 Middle East
war. The Palestinians, however, want East Jerusalem as capital of
their future state.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu added that the peace process should be advanced
by bilateral negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors,
indicating that Israel would not bow to any pressure from outside.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that Israel still remains open to "positive
suggestions" from Europe to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure the European Union and Israel have joint interests,
not only in bilateral relations, but in our common quest to
achieve security peace in the Middle East," he said.

<HEADLINE> Angola, Zambia Seek to Enhance Border Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luanda, March 18 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan military delegation
left for Zambia on Wednesday to seek to enhance their border
security.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry of Angola made this announcement here
Wednesday, disclosing that the Angolan military delegation headed
by Agostinho Nelumba, Commander of the Eastern Command, will hold
talks from March 18 to 23 with their Zambian counterparts. They
will discuss about the security problems existing across their
border and seek proper measures to enhance safety there.
</P>
<P>
Between their talks, delegates from both countries will go to
the border area to find out where their future frontier
inspection station are to be set up.
</P>
<P>
The delegations will also discuss about the establishment of a
communication and liaison system among commands in the bordering
provinces of Moxico and Kuando-Kubango of Angola and provinces of
Mongu and Saluese of Zambia so that they can contact and
communicate with each other in time to assure common security
across the border.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there are some differences between Angola
and Zambia on the issue of border security. The Angolan
government criticized some people in Zambia for violating
resolutions of the Unted Nations Security Council and taking
advantage of the common border to provide support to the National
Union for Total Independence of Angola, an anti-government
organization.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan side said that such activities had an impact on
the friendly cooperative relations between the two nations and
damaged security in the border area. The Angolan government
called for the Zambian government to take steps to halt such
activities.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, Zambia has deployed 500 more
troops to the border for enhancing security.

BERLIN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A Berlin court Wednesday opened the
trial of four former East German swimming coaches and two sports
doctors who are accused of harming underage athletes by giving
them performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that the six defendants, all worked for the
former SC Dynamo Berlin club, had caused irreversible bodily harm
on 19 female swimmers by giving them steroids between 1974 and
1989.
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Kielgass, who got a gold medal in January this year in
Perth as a member of the German 4x200 free-style relay team, was

prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
It is the first trial in Germany dealing with the alleged
organized doping practice in former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers, however, asked to stop the trial for reasons
including superannuated cases. One lawyer also complained about
lopsided handling of the German doping history because doping
research had also being allowed in former West Germany until the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Former East German leader Egon Kreuz described the trial on
Wednesday as "a revenge" against East Germany which was always
better than West Germany in sport.
</P>
<P>
Judges said they would decide next Wednesday whether to go on
with the proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Promote Free Trade With Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government plans to
develop its own free trade agreement in Latin America whether the
U.S. is on board or not, says Trade Minister Sergio Marchi.
</P>
<P>
"Canada would like to see the U.S. at the forefront of the
proposed free trade agreement of the Americas (FTAA)," Marchi was
quoted as saying by the Financial Post newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But "Canada will not allow a delay in securing fast track to
slow down our own trade agenda," he told a U.S. business group.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has failed to get from Congress the
so-called "fast-track" negotiating authority with the planned FTAA
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
No country will seriously negotiate with the U.S. when it has
no "fast-track" authority.
</P>
<P>
"We will move ahead with other key trading partners in South
America, the Caribbean and Central America in order to create the
framework for a more open and predictable trading system in the
hemisphere," Martin noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Canada and Chile signed their own free trade
agreement after the U.S. could not deliver on a pledge to bring
Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement
</P>
<P>
In mid-April, leaders of 34 countries in the Hemisphere are to
meet in Santiago, Chile, to formally launch talks aimed at
creating an FTAA.
</P>
<P>
But there is increasing concern that the talks may flounder
because Congress will not give U.S. President Bill Clinton
fast-track negotiating authority, the paper said.

<P>
ANKARA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Balkan nations agreed
in principle on Wednesday to set up a Balkan multi-national peace
force for fast response to crises in the region.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here after a three-day meeting attended
by Turkey, Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Romania said the peace
force is to be formed within the Partnership for Peace program of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization of which Turkey is a member.
</P>
<P>
The peace force will be open to participation by "all able and
willing countries in the region that would like to join this
initiative at a later stage" and transparency should be adhered to
in its follow-up work, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Slovenia were present at the meeting as
observers.
</P>
<P>
The release said the force should not be evaluated only within
the Balkan context, and the force will be available in principle
for NATO or Western European Union-led conflict prevention.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Bulgaria have offered to host the headquarters of
the force, which Turkey's Anatolia News Agency said would comprise
3,000-5,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Turkey first proposed the formation of the peace force last
May. This meeting in Ankara was the first concrete step toward its
materialization.
</P>
<P>
Romania offered to host the next meeting in its capital
Bucharest, at a higher level to further substantiate the
establishment of the force.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Anatoly Chubais said Wednesday that Russia will be
seriously affected by the fall of oil prices on world markets,
according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Chubais has instructed the Economics, Finance, and Fuel and
Energy ministries to analyze the consequences of the lowered
prices, and their findings have been submitted to the government.
</P>
<P>
"The figures are significant," he said, adding this does not
imply that Russia will reduce excise rates or other taxes.
</P>
<P>
The first deputy prime minister said it would be premature to
speak of the nature of decisions that would be made.
</P>
<P>
Russian oil companies had asked the government to reduce
their tax burden to counter the effect of falling prices.
</P>
<P>
Ministers are actively working on the problem, Chubais said.
He and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov have held several
meetings with oil company managers on this issue.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Promote Free Trade With Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government plans to
develop its own free trade agreement in Latin America whether the
U.S. is on board or not, says Trade Minister Sergio Marchi.
</P>
<P>
"Canada would like to see the U.S. at the forefront of the
proposed free trade agreement of the Americas (FTAA)," Marchi was
quoted as saying by the Financial Post newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But "Canada will not allow a delay in securing fast track to
slow down our own trade agenda," he told a U.S. business group.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has failed to get from Congress the
so-called "fast-track" negotiating authority with the planned FATT
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
No country will seriously negotiate with the U.S. when it has
no "fast-track" authority.
</P>
<P>
"We will move ahead with other key trading partners in South
America, the Caribbean and Central America in order to create the
framework for a more open and predictable trading system in the
hemisphere," Martin noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Canada and Chile signed their own free trade
agreement after the U.S. could not deliver on a pledge to bring
Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement
</P>
<P>
In mid-April, leaders of 34 countries in the Hemisphere are to
meet in Santiago, Chile, to formally launch talks aimed at
creating an FTAA.
</P>
<P>
But there is increasing concern that the talks may flounder
because Congress will not give U.S. President Bill Clinton
fast-track negotiating authority, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> AIDS to Cost S. Africa Heavily: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Dealing with AIDS and HIV
infection will cost South Africa over 8 billion Rand (1.61
billion U.S. dollars) or one percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) a year by 2000, Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Releasing her department's 1997 HIV survey of pregnant women,
Zuma said studies by the World Bank and other organization had
indicated that AIDS and HIV would cost the country at least one
percent of GDP by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The cost would probably be even higher if consequences such as
AIDS orphans were taken into account, South Africa Press
Association quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Department estimated last week that GDP would
total 809.6 billion Rand (163 billion dollars) in the 2000/2001
financial year.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said the 1997 survey, which included more than 12,000
women attending public health service antenatal clinics
nationally, showed an infection rate of 16 percent, 13 percent up
from the 1996 HIV level.
</P>
<P>
HIV infection had risen in eight of the country's nine
provinces, she said.
</P>
<P>
The eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, which has the highest
prevalence of the disease, had shown an increase in HIV infection
from 20 percent in 1996 to 27 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
HIV (human immuno-deficiency virus) leads to full-blown AIDS,
a fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
However, Zuma said the government believed that through mass
mobilization, South Africa would be able to reverse the course of
the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
She urged the country to increase its input into this deadly
disease, both in terms of financial resources and in terms of
government's efforts.
</P>
<P>
Published figures showed that of the country's 41 million
population, an estimated 2.2 million to 3.5 million are
HIV-positive or have developed AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said last month that 1,500 South Africans are infected
with the disease every day.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa Region Leads Canada in R&AMP;D </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ottawa region continues to set
the pace for research and development in Canada, leading the
nation in per capita investment, a report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, an estimated 2.3 billion dollars (1.6 billion USD) in
total R&AMP;D investment flowed from the region, amounting to about
3,200 dollars a person.
</P>
<P>
Northern Telecom Ltd. is leading the private-sector pack. The
company spent more than 1.2 billion dollars on R&AMP;D in 1997, and 90
percent of that in the Ottawa region.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Canada's largest city of Toronto generated 3.7
billion dollars in R&AMP;D spending, or about 800 dollars a person.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal area, with its focus on pharmaceuticals, accounted
for 3.3 billion dollars or 1,000 dollars in per person spending.
</P>
<P>
Taken together, Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa contributed about
75 percent of Canada's total R&AMP;D spending of 13.4 billion dollars
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This helped to keep Canada among the top 10 nations in the
world in terms of research investment, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Arab Parliamentarian Call for Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The 31st session of the Inter-Arab
Parliamentary Union Council ended here Wednesday afternoon with a
call for Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
In a closing statement, the Arab parliamentarians reaffirmed
the principles issued by the Cairo extraordinary session in 1996,
and urged for actions to implement them forcefully, particularly
those related to consolidating Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
The statement appealed to the Arab states for closing ranks,
taking concerted actions, and enhancing the efforts to achieve a
just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
The Arab parliamentarians stated the unified stance of
rejecting Israel's policies which endanger the peace process,
Israel's denial of the land-for-peace principles and its refusal
to abide by agreements reached since the 1991 Madrid Middle East
peace conference.
</P>
<P>
The statement underlined the Arab nature of Jerusalem and its
religious status, condemning all Israeli attempts to change the
demographic, geographic, political and cultural characteristics of
the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The three-day session was attended by the representatives of 19
Arab countries, as well as of the Arab League and the Organization
of the Islamic Conference.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Horticulture in Kenya Booms with New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Horticulture in Kenya has been
booming in recent years with high expectation that it will soon
overtake tea and coffee to become the country's second largest
foreign exchange earner after tourism.
</P>
<P>
The east African state, which surpassed Israel in 1995, now is
the biggest supplier of cut flowers on the European Union market,
Xinhua learned from East Africa's Fifth International
Horticulture Trade Exhibition opening on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The growth in volume for fresh horticultural exports recorded
a steady increase from 57,364 tons in 1992 to 84,824 tons in
1996," said Minister of Agriculture Musalia Mudavadi on Tuesday
night. The 1996 figure was 18 percent higher than that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Although the El Nino-charged rains caused an estimated 50
percent drop in fresh production for the last three months in
1997, the country saw only a slight decline in the sector
throughout the whole year and is fully confident for a quick
recovery in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Fresh Produce Exporters Association of Kenya, an umbrella
body of over 170 growers, exporters and processors of fresh
produce, said Wednesday that horticultural yields went down to
84,148 tons in 1997 from 84,824 tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The vegetables sector recorded the worst drop of over 2,000
tons from 32,980 tons to 30,880 tons while the volume of cut
flowers remained stable with a marginal growth from 35,212 tons
to 35,811 tons.
</P>
<P>
The strongest sign forecasting the quick recovery of fresh
produce in Kenya was shown definitely clear from the current
Hortec show, said Dick van Raamsdonk, a senior organizer of the
event.
</P>
<P>
The three-day show has raised its size by an average of 20
percent per year since 1994, from 600 square meters to the
present 1,250 square meters of indoor space exhibition. Among the
very many exhibits are greenhouses, irrigation, finance, freight
services and equipments.
</P>
<P>
"There are over 70 companies participating the exhibition, but
they represent many more firms, possibly over 100," said Charles
Campbell-Clasue of Events and Conference Organizers, the hosting
firm.
</P>
<P>
Foreign firms, which have always had a strong presence, now
account for an average 50 percent of the space booked. Most of
them come from Holland, Britain, Germany, Israel and southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya is very competitive in the long run" as a leading
flower exporter in the world, top horticultural experts from
Europe concluded at a seminar ending here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Favorable climates and good air freight connections are main
reasons behind the boom, which is also attributed by loosened
governmental controls, better training of expertise and
well-funded research to ensure growth in both quantity and
quality, said the experts.
</P>
<P>
However, a series of new challenges is facing with Kenya which
"needs to find new markets if the growth is to be sustained,"
Raamsdonk warned, citing the nation's over-reliance on the EU
market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, high interest rates, poor roads, currency
fluctuations and high freight rates form possible bottlenecks for
future expansion of Kenya's horticultural production and
exporting.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, discussions over whether to cancel the duty-free
treatment which Kenya produces has enjoyed in Europe for years
are underway within the EU member states, a Dutch merchant told
Xinhua at the show.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya must be on alert. Things are changing and there is
competition from other countries," said Raamsdonk, specifying
that Ethiopia, Tanzania, Colombia and Ecuador will pose stiffer
competition for Kenya in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Kenya should focus attention on the Middle
East and Far East markets and diversify its marketing channels.
Most Kenyan fresh produce are now sold through the Dutch Auction.

<HEADLINE> Arab FMs to Discuss Israeli Intransigence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Arab foreign ministers will convene
a meeting here next Tuesday to discuss ways to tackle Israel's
stance on the Mideast peace process, the Middle East News Agency
(MENA) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 109th session of the Arab League Council comes amid a new
wave of Palestinian protests against Israeli killing of three
Palestinian workers on March 10 near West Bank city Hebron, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Saeed Kamal, assistant secretary general
of the Arab League for Palestine affairs, accused Israel of
"pushing matters to the brink" by creating a climate of violence
and counter-violence.
</P>
<P>
On European initiative to salvage the peace process, Kamal said
European efforts are needed, voicing hope that Europe would
succeed in getting Israel to accept ideas aimed at rescuing
Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
Kamal denied any knowledge of a new American initiative, but
hoped Washington's "ideas" would make Israel respond positively to
efforts to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to MENA, Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat will address the meeting of foreign ministers on
Israel's attempts to judaize Jerusalem and impede the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He will brief the ministers on the outcome of his recent
contacts with Islamic and European countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Ready for Pope's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
released the program for the pastoral visit of the Pope John Paul
II, scheduled for the coming Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the program released by the Ministry of
Information and Culture, the Pope is expected to arrive in the
captal Abuja Saturday afternoon and later pay a courtesy visit to
the head of state, General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The Pope will leave Abuja early on Sunday for Enugu in the
south enroute Onitsha, where he is billed to conduct a holy mass
and beautification of the late Nigerian Catholic priest Rev.
Father Cyprian Iwene Tansi, who died in Leicester, Britain, in
1964.
</P>
<P>
A meeting with Muslim leaders in Nigeria is scheduled for
Sunday evening when the Pope is back in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
After an open air mass near Abuja and a meeting with members
of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria, the Pope will
leave for Rome Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This is the second visit to Nigeria by the 77-year-old Pope.
During his last visit between February 12 and 17, 1982, he
visited four major cities of the country, including the then
national capital Lagos.
</P>
<P>
It will be the 13th visit to Africa since he became Pope and
his 82nd visit abroad.
</P>
<P>
As part of the preparation for Pope's tour, the police in
Abuja already announced that adequate security has been arranged
for a hitch-free visit.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements have also been completed for special ambulances
to accompany the Pope on air and on land throughout his visit to
the country, Health Minister Rear Admiral Jubrila Ayinla said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Catholic community in Nigeria has been in high gear to
prepare for Pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, about 54 biships in Nigeria and 10 other
brother bishops from Africa will support the team from the
Vatican during the high mass, according`to the Catholic
archbishop of Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Between 600 and 700 reverend fathers and priests would also be
assisting his holiness at the Kubwa Praying Ground, where the
Pope is scheduled to officiate before returning to Rome.

<HEADLINE> Report: NATO Invitees Lag in Meeting Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, the three which have been invited to join the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), lag behind in meeting the
requirements of joining the alliance, a leading U.S. paper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post quoted diplomats and defense experts from
the three as saying that the three invitees have fallen behind in
key areas designed to ensure military compatibility with the West.
</P>
<P>
"Training in English, NATO's standard operating language, is
lagging in all three countries," the report said, adding none of
three armies has more than a few hundred officers "who have
achieved a level of fluency in English acceptable to NATO."
</P>
<P>
In addition, each country is having trouble in meeting or
maintaining promised changes such as providing for adequate
civilian control of their militaries, installing safeguards to
protect NATO secrets and modernizing their air defense systems.
</P>
<P>
The problems are not expected to derail NATO's plan to accept
the three. However, they have raised concerns about their ability
to meet their commitments to the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
"In assessing applications for membership last year, NATO
settled on largely political criteria," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Czech Parliament member as saying, "I know
many of our politicians are lying to themselves...My feeling is
that people here still don't understand how much we need to change
our system."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has approved a
173-million-Rand (35 million US dollars) arms sale to Algeria,
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted National Conventional Arms Control Committee
(NCACC) chairman, Kader Asmal, as telling the parliament that the
arms in the contract included both sensitive and non-sensitive
equipment.
</P>
<P>
He said the deal was first approved by the NCACC, but because
of the sensitivity of the issue, it was submitted to the cabinet
for final decision.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet decided on February 18 that it concurred with the
NCACC and decided that weapons could be sold to Algeria only for
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet made it clear that these armaments must not be
used for internal repression, Asmal said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Donation for Palestinian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief Kofi Annan Wednesday
asked the international community to donate more to the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to help it accomplish
relief work for Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to all the countries who have the capacity to give
freely and generously so we can offer the assistance that is so
urgently required," Annan said at a press conference here after he
visited some of the refugee camps in Jordan Wednesday morning and
held talks with Jordanian officials in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
While visiting the camps, Annan said that "I had with me
Mr. Peter Hansen, the head of UNRWA and he explained to me the
difficulties that he is working against, odds that he has been
confronting."
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here Tuesday evening on the first leg of his
regional tour aimed at helping revive the long-stalled Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Here he (Hansen) has millions of people (refugees) in the
region and yet the international community is giving him the
resources," added the secretary general.
</P>
<P>
"This is not enough," he said, "the international community has
to do its part and I have undertaken to work with Peter Hansen and
the international community in raising the funds necessary to get
the job done."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations believes that the human being is in the
center of everything we try to do," he added.
</P>
<P>
UNRWA, the only U.N. organization officially responsible for
the care of Palestinian refugees, has been facing financial
problems in recent years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, UNRWA raised 126 million U.S. dollars
from the international community, falling far short of its 1998
general fund budget of 343 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Due to the shortage of finance, the Amman-based organization
had to decide to cut off its assistance for the refugees in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1.5 million out of a total registered number of 3.4
million refugees in Jordan have been affected by the reduction of
the agency's services.
</P>
<P>
Annan has left here for Egypt to continue his Mideast tour
which will also take him to Lebanon, Syria, Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Cautious About Investing in S. Korea: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners remain cautious about
investing in South Korea despite the crisis-engulfed country's
efforts to boost foreign investors' confidence, a survey by the
Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners listed administrative red tape, rigid labor
practices and hostility to foreign firms as the barriers against
the inflow of foreign money into the country, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
The federation urged the South Korean government to restore
sagging investor confidence and overcome the economic crisis by
trying harder to restructure ailing financial institutions and
industrial conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
FKI surveyed 500 foreign businessmen and economists residing in
Seoul. More than 57 percent of the 105 respondents said that South
Korea's investment environment is less attractive than that of
Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
However, 14.3 percent said the nation enjoys an advantage over
Southeast Asia due to its superior market potential and better
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the major obstacles preventing foreign direct
investment in South Korea, 39.7 percent identified bureaucratic
red tape, lack of flexibility in industrial relations, and a
hostile attitude toward foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Some 67 percent cited South Koreans' anti-foreign sentiment and
boycott of imports as a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted between February 23 and March 5, was
answered by 46 Europeans, 17 Americans and 31 Japanese. Ednitem

<HEADLINE> Annan Denies Unveiling News Idea on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan on Thursday said he did not carry with him any new
ideas on reviving the peace process during this Mideast tour.
</P>
<P>
"The time is not opportune for new peace proposals while the
U.S. was mediating between the various parties for a Middle East
settlement," he told reporters after meeting with Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid here.
</P>
<P>
U.S. diplomatic sources said earlier this week that the U.N.
chief was to float a fresh U.S. initiative to break the
Palestinian-Israeli peace impasse during his nine-day Mideast trip.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he will encourage Mideast leaders to further the
peace process during his trip, which also includes Jordan, Syria,
Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Abdul-Meguid, Annan discussed the
situation in Iraq in light of the February 23 U.N.-Iraq arms
inspection agreement, the Middle East peace process, the sanctions
imposed on Libya, the situation in Somalia and the political
crisis in the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
In the coming phase, the U.N. and the Arab League need solid
bilateral cooperation and cooperation with other organizations to
achieve more effective and positive results for the institutions,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who will visit Lebanon on Friday, called for the
implementation of U.N. Resolution 425 on unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"My talks with Lebanese and Israeli officials will address this
issue in detail," said Annan who arrived in Cairo Wednesday on his
first visit to Egypt since he took the helm at the world
organization.
</P>
<P>
Later, Annan and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks on
the Mideast peace process, the latest developments of the
situation in Iraq and relations between Egypt and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said to reporters after
the meeting that the U.N. has made it clear that the solution of
the Mideast issue must be based on relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is playing its special role in safeguarding
world peace. Whatever step Secretary General Annan has taken is
based on United Nations resolutions," Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
Later Thursday, Annan will hold talks with Moussa on the
envisaged U.N. reform and Egypt's cooperation with the world
body. He will then give a press conference.

<HEADLINE> HK SDB to Be Restructured to Raise Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- An organizational restructuring
will soon take place within the Hong Kong Sports Development Board
(SDB) and the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) so that the
integrated statutory body could raise its efficiency in providing
better service to sports development in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), it was announced here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Ma, SDB's Chief Executive, said that the restructuring,
set to be started on April 1 this year, will bring a number of
existing offices based at the Sports House, SDB's headquarters in
downtown Hong Kong Island, into HKSI's sports complex in Shatin.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims at streamlining the working staff of the SDB,
raising its efficiency, increasing commercial income and
maximizing the use of the land at the HKSI site through renovating
existing facilities and constructing new office space.
</P>
<P>
Through the restructuring plan, HKSI will no longer exist while
the name will remain only as an address of the Shatin sports
complex.
</P>
<P>
More money would be made through various means and they should
be spent to meet the real needs, including the development of
elite sports and other major sports initiatives in Hong Kong, Ma
said.
</P>
<P>
An overall plan to expand and reconstruct the Shatin complex is
being discussed and detailed arrangements shall be decided by a
new SDB board of directors which is soon to be elected, according
to Ma.

<HEADLINE> Visit by Taiwan's Koo to Mainland Welcomed, ARATS Leader Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, deputy executive
chairman of the Association for Relations Across Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), today said that he welcomes Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), to visit the Chinese mainland
at an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
ARATS will give a positive response under the authorization of
the central government if SEF sends a letter to ARATS concerning
the issue, Tang said, reponding to questions raised by reporters
from both sides of the straits and the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Tang said the opportunity for political negotiations between
the two sides has matured, and the Chinese mainland has been
calling for a formal end to the hostility between the two sides as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The two sides can resume consultations at any time once the
Taiwan side sends us a clear signal indicating that it would like
to conduct procedural talks for the political negotiations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tang emphasized that China's stand for unequivocally opposing
the "independence of Taiwan," "two Chinas" and "one China, one
Taiwan" remains unchanged. It is illegal, futile, and dangerous to
decide Taiwan's future through calling for a referendum, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the relationship between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait is more relaxed in general terms, with more and more
Taiwanese realizing that it is to the benefit of Taiwan to develop
a cross-straits relationship and realizing that there is no way
out for the "independence of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the relationship between the two sides will
continue to grow more relaxed so long as the Taiwan authority
relinquish the activities of "independence of Taiwan," "two
Chinas" and "one China one Taiwan" and stops collaborating with
foreign influences.

<HEADLINE> Smuggling Historical Relics Rampant in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 19 (Xinhua) -- In the past eight years, many
valuable relics have been smuggled out of Romania, a country that
does not have a national heritage law, the daily Romania Libera
reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper commented on the problem when a minibus
containing many Romanian national heritage objects was captured at
the Giurgiu border check-point near the Romanian-Bulgarian border.
</P>
<P>
The value of the smuggled objects was estimated to be one
billion lei (about 120,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two most valuable objects were a painted bronze harlequin
and an oil painting from the 19th century of Hunyads' medieval
castle in central Romania.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper noted that many objects retrieved in Giurgiu
could be "important to Europe and the world."
</P>
<P>
Deploring the removal of these objects and their sale to
foreign countries, the newspaper called for an explanation on why
the authorities are not able to prevent smuggling. The paper also
called for the formulation of a National Heritage Law.

<HEADLINE> Pak Industrial Production Rises Sharply in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's industrial
production recorded a growth rate of 16 percent in January, taking
the average growth rate for the current fiscal year so far to 4
percent, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The average growth rate of 4 percent for this fiscal year (July
1, 1997 - June 30, 1998) so far was achieved against the minus 1.4
percent for last year, Sartaj told a news conference held at the
end of the 2nd Economic Cooperation Conference of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
He said in the first four months of the current fiscal year,
industrial growth rate was around minus 2 percent, whereas it was
10 percent in December 1997 and 16 percent in January this year.
</P>
<P>
He said if the trend in December and January continued, "we
will be able to achieve the industrial growth target set for the
current fiscal year."
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, the real picture will come clear
after the figure for February is recorded.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Sartaj said the target of fiscal deficit as
agreed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is 148 billion
rupees (about 3.2 billion U.S. dollars), adding that "we will be
able to remain within it."

<HEADLINE> Karachi Stock Exchange Index Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE)-100 Index rose 7.87 points Thursday to close at 1528.13
against Wednesday's closing index of 1520.26.
</P>
<P>
A total of 72 million shares were traded Thursday against 70
million shares on the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that the recovery of the KSE-100 Index was in
response to a patch-up between the government led by the Pakistan
Muslim League (N) and its coalition partner in Sindh, the Muthhida
Qaumi Movement (MQM).
</P>
<P>
The government and the MQM Thursday held a meeting which lasted
for three hours. Both parties announced that the talks had been
successful.
</P>
<P>
The MQM also said it had resolved its differences with the
government and would continue its coalition agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the stock market reacted positively to this
news although some major scrips closed lower than on the previous
day.
</P>
<P>
The MQM had given a 48-hour ultimatum Tuesday night for solving
differences with the government and threatened that it would
otherwise break away from their coalition.
</P>
<P>
One trader said, "We were afraid that the city's (Karachi's)
law and order situation would have been adversely affected if the
MQM broke away from the ruling party."
</P>
<P>
Brokers predicted a leveling off at the 1600 mark by the middle
of next week. Prior to this, there will be some small drops in the
KSE index.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for Better Biodiversity Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Environment Program
(UNEP) Thursday called for more attention paid by the world to
biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of biological
resources.
</P>
<P>
"The adverse effects of human impacts on biodiversity are
increasing dramatically and threatening the very foundation of
sustainable development," said Hamdallah Zedan, the chief of the
UNEP Biodiversity Unit.
</P>
<P>
The loss of the Earth's biological diversity is one of the
most pressing environmental and development issues, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The world's biological diversity, comprising every form of
life, from the tiniest microbe to the mightiest beast, and the
eco-systems of which they are a part, provides humanity with an
abundance of goods and services, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, loss of biological resources and their diversity
threatens mankind's food supplies, sources of wood, medicines and
energy, opportunities for recreation and tourism and so on, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
"Eco-system services are worth trillions of Dollars annually,
but because they are normally not traded in the market place,
there are no market mechanisms in place to alert society of their
rapidly declining status," he signed.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP, as the coordinator within the U.N. system over the
global environmental issues, has always been playing an active
role in worldwide biodiversity protection especially by providing
technical guidance in the funding of biodiversity projects, he
added.

<TEXT>

QINGDAO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A joint campaign was kicked off
today to inspect law enforcement on marine resources development,
environmental protection, and ecological environment maintenance
in the Bohai Sea area of north China.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, sponsored by the Beihai branch of the State
Oceanic Administration and local administrative departments, is
the first cross-regional joint law-enforcement inspection
operation since the country began to carry out comprehensive
administration over the ocean, according to a news conference
today in Qingdao, a coastal city in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
With a 3,784-kilometer-long coastline, the Bohai economic
region consists of coastal areas of Shandong, Liaoning and Hebei
provinces and the cities of Tianjin, and Beijing, and has been
developed into the most-developed region in northern China.
</P>
<P>
The region's pollution situation has worsened with the
increasing exploitation of marine resources. There are 54 outlets
along the Bohai Sea coastal region which discharge 2.8 billion
tons of wastewater and 700,000 tons of pollutants into the sea
each year.
</P>
<P>
The law-enforcement operation will take advantage of
sea-monitoring planes which can fly long distances at a high rate
of speed. Land and sea cruising will be combined to inspect the
fields of marine waste discharge, oil exploration, utilization of
marine areas, coastal erosion, key pollution outlets and natural
marine environmental protection zones.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia signed the African
maritime transport charter here Thursday, thus becoming the
fourth African state to sign the charter after Tunisia, Mauritius
and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The charter was inked by Abdulmejid Hussein, Minister of
Transport and Communication in the presence of Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The African Maritime Transport Charter was adopted by the
conference of African Ministers of Maritime Transport at its
third session held in Addis Ababa on December 13-15, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Salim said the adoption of the
charter was predicated on the importance of maritime transport in
promoting foreign trade and economic development.
</P>
<P>
"It is also a major factor for regional and continental
integration and the development efforts of Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the OAU chief, the participation of Africa in the
carriage of sea-borne trade is minimal. Africa's global share in
the trade is only one percent and in terms of oil tankers Africa
has a share percentage of only 0.8 percent while the percentage
for general cargo is 2.2 percent.

LUSAKA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) is to support two environmental programs in Zambia
at a total cost of 5.7 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect was signed Thursday by UNDP
resident representative Garry Davis and Peter Mwamfuli, Permanent
Secretary for Environment and Natural Resources, according to
Zambia News Agency Zana.
</P>
<P>
The 5.7 million Dollars is broken into two components, 5.6
million for an environment support program and 100,000 for a
national action program to combat desertification and drought.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony held in Lusaka, Davis
reiterated UNDP's interest in helping communities exploit their
environment in a sustainable way.
</P>
<P>
UNDP's program focuses on dealing with alleviation of poverty
as it is linked to the degradation of the environment in which
people tend to overgraze their land or cut trees for charcoal,
said Davis, stressing that all these are a vicious cycle that
leads to poverty.
</P>
<P>
He added that the honey production in North Western province
is one classical example where communities are involved in
improving the environment by making bees available to make honey
for the communities.

<P>
MANIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos on
Thursday hailed the successful conclusion of the 25th Islamic
foreign ministers meeting of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Ramos said the Philippines followed with great
interest the meetings and resolutions of the OIC.
</P>
<P>
Ramos expressed thanks to Indonesia for its "mention of the
need to extend support for the Muslim communities in Southern
Philippines" at the meeting, which opened in Doha, Qatar last
Sunday and ended on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he authorized the participation of Autonomous Region
in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Governor Nur Misuari at the 25th OIC
foreign ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has undertaken diplomatic efforts
toward amending the existing OIC resolution on the question of
Muslims in the southern Philippines, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos expressed the hope that the OIC resolution would shift
its focus to the peace and development efforts being undertaken in
the region within the framework of the OIC-brokered peace treaty,
which was signed between the Moro National Liberation Front and
the government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is not a member of the OIC. But the country's
Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao is an observer of the Islamic
group.

Telecommunications Company Limited (AsiaSat) and Germany's DeTeSat
announced here Thursday the signing of a lease agreement on the
Germans' use of AsiaSat 2 for voice, data and image transmission
across the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"With the AsiaSat 2 capacity, we are able to expand our service

WUHAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Hubei Province in central China has
planted 464,000 hectares of trees since the early 1990s, by using
89.2 million US dollars in foreign funds.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arabs Welcome EU Peace Initiative: Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestine Permanent Delegate to the
Arab League Mohamed Sobeih Thursday attacked Israel's "harsh"
treatment of British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, saying Arabs
and Palestinians welcome the European peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih told the Middle East News Agency that the initiative
carried by Cook to the Mideast is based on international
legitimacy resolutions and on a clear-cut European stance on the
Mideast peace march as well as on the implementation of signed
agreements between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Cook's just-ended trip to the region was aimed at stressing a
European keenness on realizing just and comprehensive peace in the
Middle East in view of the EU's trade and economic interests in
the area, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the European attitude angered the Israeli
side, which dealt "roughly" with Cook within the context of
attempts by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to abort the
European peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih also accused Israel of being determined to expand
settlement and Judaize Jerusalem while failing to implement the
"most simple peace procedures" of the transitional phase of the
Oslo agreement like the airport and seaport.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel "fabricated" the row with Cook over his visit to
the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem to get rid of the
European participation in the quest for peace. Israel began the
construction of the settlement in March last year, bringing the
Mideast peace process to a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"This is in line with Netanyahu's policy which neither wants a
European role nor a United Nations one, and only wishes to deal
with the United States, which uses double standard in tackling the
issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged Europe to back Cook's attitude and called on the
U.S. to adopt a "serious and credible" stance.
</P>
<P>
Cook met a snub when Netanyahu canceled a scheduled dinner with
him Tuesday during his visit to Israel in the capacity of the
rotating presidency of the European Union (EU) to help revive the
peace process by supporting the Palestinian demand for ending
Israeli settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Despite Israel's angry protests, Cook visited the controversial
Har Homa site in Arab East Jerusalem. He also met with Palestinian
Council members at the site to hear their complaints.
</P>
<P>
The disputes between the Palestinians and Israelis mainly
focused on two issues: Israel's continued efforts to expand
settlements in the territories, and Israel's refusal to carry out
the delayed further troop redeployment in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Appears in Court Over Rugby Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Thursday appeared in Pretoria High Court to
explain his decision last year to appoint a commission of inquiry
into the affairs of the South African Rugby Football Union
(Sarfu).
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a South African sitting president
has been called to account for his executive decisions in a court
of law. Mandela's legal team has already expressed concern that
his court appearance could set a "dangerous precedent."
</P>
<P>
The court was hearing a Sarfu application to have the
investigation commission set aside.
</P>
<P>
The commission was set up last year to investigate allegations
of nepotism and financial irregularities of Sarfu.
</P>
<P>
Sarfu accused Mandela of acting unconstitutionally by merely
"rubber-stamping" a decision of Sports Minister Steve Tshwete to
investigate the union.
</P>
<P>
Sarfu held that Tshwete had a personal vendetta against Sarfu
boss Louis Luyt and resented that Rugby is run by whites, not the
government.
</P>
<P>
Mandela denied the charges and said: "I and I alone made that
decision."
He insisted that Tshwete's decision was correct.

<HEADLINE> New Premier Says China Will Strive for Eight Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today that his government will strive to ensure an eight
percent economic growth rate for the country's national economy
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will also manage to keep inflation at
below three percent this year, Zhu said at a press conference
right after the closing of the First Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
China is confronted with severe challenges in the face of
financial crisis in southeast Asian countries, he said,
reaffirming that China is determined not to devalue its currency,
the renminbi yuan.
</P>
<P>
Such efforts have a bearing not only on the development of
China but also on the prosperity and stability of other Asian
countries, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"The major means through which we accomplish our goals is to
stimulate domestic demand," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past years, we have succeeded in macroeconomic
controls, implemented a relatively tight monetary and fiscal
policy and restrained money supply, enabling us to keep inflation
at a low level," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Given the conditions," he said, "it is possible for us to
channel more financial resources to stimulate domestic demand, by
committing more investments in infrastructure construction such as
railways, highways, farmland and water conservation projects,
urban public works, environmental protection facilities, high and
new technology industries, technical upgrading of industrial
enterprises, and housing development."
</P>
<P>
With regard to China's market potential, the premier said that
China's market is far from being saturated and that all foreign
investors are welcome to invest actively in the country.
</P>
<P>
China is the biggest potential market in the world but, because
the country has failed to resolve the problem of duplicated
construction for years, supplies exceed demand for many kinds of
products now, he said.
</P>
<P>
In spite of this, China remains the biggest market in the world
for many products, he said, explaining that China's annual output
of steel has exceeded 100 million tons, and annual addition of
program-controlled telephone switch equipment exceeds 20 million
lines -- indications of a huge market in China.
</P>
<P>
"What China needs now is to restructure its economy," he said,
noting that China intends to increase the pace of infrastructure
construction in the future and to explore and open up a vast
market in its rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"We also strive to step up housing construction, which is of
great concern to the people," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his new cabinet, the new premier expressed
confidence in his government's successful performance.
</P>
<P>
"I have the confidence that as long as we hold high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and rely on the entire Chinese
people under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, the current government will be
able to surmount any difficulties and win one success after
another," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier pledged to dedicate himself to the service of his
country and the Chinese people till the last day of his life, be
there "landmines or an abyss that might lie ahead."

<HEADLINE> New Government on Policies Towards Hong Kong and Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Newly-elected Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji said today that the eight-point proposal for cross-Strait
relations put forward by President Jiang Zemin in early 1995 is
the basic principle to guide the development of relations across
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark at a press conference with four
vice-premiers in his new cabinet today.
</P>
<P>
On cross-Strait relations, Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) has extended its welcome to a visit by Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), as
well as any preparatory talks for his visit.
</P>
<P>
When asked on a huge surplus Taiwan enjoys in cross-Strait
trade, Qian said Taiwan last year had a surplus of 17 billion US
dollars with the mainland. "It is very much in Taiwan's favor," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Qian urged the two sides to work together to expand the trade
and said that "the best way to do that is to establish direct
postal, air and shipping links and trade between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait."
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji pledged today that China will spare no effort in
safeguarding Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, but at the
request of the Hong Kong regional government.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question by a Hong Kong reporter, Zhu said the
central government appreciates very much the measures and policies
adopted by the Hong Kong SAR government in dealing with the impact
of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
With a sound economic structure, strong economic strength and
foreign exchange reserves of some 98 billion US dollars, the
central government is convinced that Hong Kong will not encounter
insurmountable difficulties in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
But "If the Hong Kong SAR government should be in need of
support from the central government in exceptional circumstances,
in case the Hong Kong government should request help from the
central government, the central government will try to maintain
the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and protect its US
dollar-pegged currency system at any cost," said Zhu.

<HEADLINE> New Premier Outlines Major Areas of Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Newly elected Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji said today that China's reform in 1998 will concentrate in
the five areas of grain distribution, investment financing,
housing, medical care, and fiscal and taxation system.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made known the reform focuses at a press conference held
immediately after the Ninth National People's Congress had
concluded its first session this morning.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China's successful agricultural policies have
resulted in good grain harvests for three consecutive years and
that the state grain reserves have reached a record high.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that even if China meets with serious natural
disasters for two years running, the country will not be short of
grain supplies," he told the press.
</P>
<P>
However, as huge grain reserves have also led to an increase in
government's subsidies, there is the need to reform the existing
grain marketing system, he said.
</P>
<P>
On reform of the investment and funding system, the premier
said the current system cannot bring into play the role of the
market in resources allocation as its functions are mainly
administrative examination and approval.
</P>
<P>
"This has given rise to a lot of duplicate construction," he
said. "So we must conduct a fundamental reform of this system to
bring it into conformity with international practices and in line
with a socialist market economy."
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the housing reform, according to Zhu, is to get
rid of the welfare housing allocation practice, or commercialize
all housing so that all people will buy their own houses.
</P>
<P>
He said the central government will issue a new policy in this
regard in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Also in the second half of the year, the government is expected
to launch a nationwide medical care reform program with a view to
ensuring basic medical care for all, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
The last reform focus is the fiscal and taxation system. The
premier said the 1994 reform in this field has achieved great
successes, with government revenue keeping increasing yearly by a
large margin.
</P>
<P>
The pressing problem is that the amount of various charges
collected is larger than taxes collected, Zhu pointed out. Many
local government institutions have levied additional charges and
fees which are not in keeping with the central government's
regulations, making people heavily burdened and causing public
complaints.
</P>
<P>
"We must take vigorous steps to rectify and change the
situation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Three Years Enough for China's SOE Reform: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said here
today that three years are sufficient time for China to bring most
of its loss-making state-owned enterprises out of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we're absolutely able to attain the goal of
bringing most state-owned enterprises now suffering losses out of
their difficult situation in a period of three years, or by the
end of this century," he said in his first press conference since
becoming China's fifth premier.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some foreign media have overestimated the
difficulties of China's state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"When we say that the percentage of loss-making state-owned
enterprises is more than 40 percent, we're referring to the number
of these enterprises which is about some 79,000 in total and many
of them are very small, with only several or dozens of people,"
Zhu explained.
</P>
<P>
But among the 500 giant state enterprises, whose profit and tax
contributions to the state account for 85 percent of the national
total profit and tax receipts, only 10 percent are suffering from
losses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Though declining to comment on the operation of conglomerates
in the Republic of Korea, which has been seriously affected by a
recent financial crisis, Zhu said that China should draw upon the
experience and lessons of various countries concerning this crisis
and "is doing so".
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out the possibility that the Southeast Asian
financial crisis would have an impact on the pace of China's
reform of state-owned enterprises, nor would it affect the set
agenda and schedule of China's financial reform.
</P>
<P>
China's policy of opening its banking and insurance sector to
the outside world will remain unchanged, the premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
In response to a reporter's question about the convertibility
of Chinese currency RMB, Zhu said that China has made RMB
convertible under the current account, but it will take some time
to make the Chinese currency fully convertible, and that will be
when the central bank's capability of supervision and regulation
meets required standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about restructuring of government institutions, the
premier said that the number of ministries and commissions under
the State Council has been reduced from 40 to 29, and that the
number of employees working in government institutions will be cut
by half in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Correspondingly, local governments at various levels are also
expected to accomplish their own streamlining programs in three
years' time, he said.
</P>
<P>
"By three years, I mean we need the time to train and assign
the redundant staff to new posts that suit them in terms of their
ability and personal wishes."

<HEADLINE> More Knowledge of Laws to Help Traders Complete Central Tasks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official has called for
the country's foreign trade officials and traders to use the
knowledge of laws to help complete their central tasks of the year
-- increasing exports and improving the investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiangdong, assistant Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, told a recent conference of the ministry on the work
of law popularization that more attention should be paid to the
risk in expanding exports of receiving foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Liu said decisions should be made with caution in the method of
payment and the settlement currency in signing export contracts.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, he said, traders should learn more about
international practices of payment and comparing the risks of
various payment patterns to increase the awareness of risks.
</P>
<P>
The official added that management training should be
intensified to help Chinese companies standardize their internal
management, form a system of scientific policymaking and increase
their ability to resist risks.
</P>
<P>
While making an effort to increase exports, Liu said,
enterprises should maintain operation order and prevent vicious
competition.
</P>
<P>
He explained that anti-dumping cases in recent years have
threatened China's exports, and that exports would face more
pressure once there are more anti-dumping lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
Liu stressed that the role of legal departments and legal
personnel should be given a bigger say in improving management and
in coping with possible disputes.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Warns Against Alliance With Far-right FN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Socialist French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin gave a severe warning to the right-wing opposition
Thursday against establishing an alliance with the far-right
National Front (FN).
</P>
<P>
As prime minister, one of the authorities of the state, it is
my duty to comment on the situation created by the attempt to form
an alliance between the regional leaders of the right and the
extreme-right, said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Such an alliance ``will threaten the meaning of universal
suffrage, the will of the voters who are against alliances with
the National Front, and endanger the essential values and the
fundamental laws of the republic,'' said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Some regional parliament deputies of the Rally for the Republic
(RPR) and the Union for French Democracy (UDF) are reportedly
negotiating terms with the FN to set up an alliance in the six to
eight regional parliaments, where the RPR and UDF are running
shoulder-to-shoulder with the Socialist-led coalition.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the French leftist parties, including Socialist
Party First Secretary Francois Hollande and Communist Party
national Secretary Robert Hue, also sent a joint warning to the
RPR and UDF against an alliance with FN at a press conference
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 22 regional councils of France will elect their presidents
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The left is expected to win the presidency in about nine
regional councils or parliaments, the right will win seven, while
the FN will play an arbitrary role in the remaining six councils.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Democratic Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said here
today that, with regard to the procedure of democratic election,
China is different from other countries and that the east is
different from the west.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question raised by a reporter from US-based
"Time" magazine on democratic election at a press conference here
today, Zhu said that one US foundation once organized an
investigation into village elections in China and that they
expressed very positive views.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the democratic system has been carried out in
both rural areas and enterprises, where workers have the
democratic rights to assess the performance of enterprise
directors, examine account books and elect factory directors.
</P>
<P>
With regard to direct election of the premier and the state
president, he said it is a question of political reform and
should be done in accordance with legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard for me at present to predict when such elections
will take place in China," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tian Jiyun on NPC Standing Committee's New Tasks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Tian Jiyun, newly-elected
vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, described the just-closed
Ninth NPC First Session as "a meeting crowned with success".
</P>
<P>
The NPC session is expected to exert a far-reaching
significance on arousing the people of all ethnic groups
throughout China in holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, implementing the guidelines of the 15th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and advancing the great
cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics into the 21st
century, he said in a televised speech here today for viewers
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the system of the NPC is China's fundamental
political system, Tian said that adhering to and improving this
system and strengthening the work of the NPC is an inevitable
requirement for the implementation of administering the country
according to law and developing socialist democracy.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth NPC and its Standing Committee will, taking Deng
Xiaoping Theory and the Party's basic line as their guidance, make
conscientious efforts to exercise various powers vested with the
Chinese Constitution and relevant laws and actively advance the
course of administrating the country according to law and building
a socialist country ruled by law.
</P>
<P>
Legislation is the prime task of the NPC and its Standing
Committee and also the prerequisite and basis for administrating
the country by law, he said. So the NPC and its standing committee
will continue beefing up the work of law-enacting, he said. They
will strive to, with the tenure of this term, to formulate some
major basic laws that standardize socialist market economy and
further improve laws in other aspects, in a bid to lay a sound
basis for building a relatively complete legal system with Chinese
characteristics by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
It represents a major duty of the NPC and its Standing
Committee that has been endowed by the Constitution to supervise
the implementation of the Constitution and other laws and the work
of the State Council, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme
People's Procuratorate, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Implementing this duty well is of great importance to the
advancement of administering the country according to law, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Ninth NPC and its Standing
Committees will redouble its efforts to enhance the work of
supervision, further improve the supervisory mechanism and
procedures, and increase efficiency, so as to promote the work of
administrating in accordance with law and a fair judicature.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth NPC and its Standing Committee are entrusted with a
cross-century task, he noted, and its five-year term of office
will be a crucial period in which China will achieve the second-step
strategic objective and begin to march toward goal for its
third-phase growth.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue doing the work well in all fields, give
still better scope to the role of the organs of state power and
contribute to the accomplishment of the cross-century goal for
China's development," NPC Vice-Chairman Tian Jiyun said.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Leader's Bodyguards Registered in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The former rebel UNITA movement
has finished the registration of a 400-men bodyguard squad for
its leader Jonas Savimbi, clearing another obstacle for the peace
process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
This was said by U.N. Special Representative to Angola Blodin
Beye to the press at central city Andulo after his talks with
Savimbi Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Beye noted that the registration is a victory achieved with
the common efforts of the government and leaders of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
A retirement ceremony of over one hundred generals and other
senior officers is scheduled to be held in UNITA headquarters of
Bailundo Thursday, Beye disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this is another major action of UNITA for
the peace process, which will promote the accomplishment of other
tasks outlined by the 1994 Lusaka peace protocol.
</P>
<P>
Beye said he was satisfied that so far half of the tasks laid
down on March 6 about the peace process have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
He said during the talks, Savimbi asked him to convey a
message to all Angolans that UNITA would strive for the final
peace in the country and that Angolans would see their hope
materialized.
</P>
<P>
The formation of Savimbi's bodyguards and the dismobilization
of UNITA's senior military officers have been the most sticky
issues in the peace process. UNITA insisted on forming a
400-strong squad, and then after several rounds of discussions,
the government and UNITA at last agreed to cut Savimbi's
bodyguards from 400 at first gradually to 150 at the end of nine
months.
</P>
<P>
This is Beye's first meeting with Savimbi this year and Beya
returned to Luanda after a heart surgery in Germany three month
ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A local tourism official has
announced that an ancient mountain pass on the famous Great Wall
will open to visitors on March 28 after a five-year renovation
project.
</P>
<P>
The Juyong Pass, located in Changping County to the southwest
of downtown Beijing, includes a 4,142-meter-long portion of the
Great Wall and a group of ancient buildings such as military,
cultural and religious facilities.
</P>
<P>
The pass is only 60 kilometers from Beijing proper and five
kilometers from the popular tourist spot of Badaling on the Great
Wall.
</P>
<P>
Like other passes along the 6,700-kilometer-long Great Wall,
Juyong Pass has a strategic location and difficult
access. Ministers of the Board of War in the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644) considered it the last line of defense for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall was constructed during the Warring States period
(475-221 B.C.) and was expanded until the Ming Dynasty.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
on Thursday expressed confidence that the remaining contentious
issues blocking the signing of the final peace agreement between
the government and the leftist rebels will all be finally hurdled.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his weekly press conference, Ramos said the
resolution of the human rights and international humanitarian law
issues is one positive indicator of progress toward a peace
agreement between the rebel National Democratic Front (NDF) and
the government.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, a leftist alliance led by the Communist Party of the
Philippines, initialed an agreement on human rights and
international humanitarian law with the government early this
week, paving the way for the talks on political issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed a draft joint agreement on the
socio-economic issues, which will be finalized soon.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also cited the proposal by the government for a
nationwide general ceasefire agreement with the NDF's armed wing,
the New People's Army (NPA), from March 31 to July 31 for the May
general elections.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the government, NDF chairman Jose Ma.
Sison will come back to Manila soon to sign the accord on the
human rights and international humanitarian law from the
Netherlands, where he has lived in exile since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The NDF's strength has been shrinking since the mid-1980s due to
factionalism, lack of funds and crackdown by the military.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, IMF Agree to Find Solution to Debt Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday agreed to seek the best solution
to the Indonesian private sector's debt problem as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Radius Prawiro, head of the Indonesian Foreign Debt Settlement
Team, said the Indonesian government and the IMF hope the private
sector's debts could be solved soon.
</P>
<P>
Radius made the remarks after a meeting between his team and
IMF Asia-Pacific Director Hubert Neiss.
</P>
<P>
"Businessmen with foreign debts could renegotiate with their
respective creditor banks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Radius said that the IMF and the World Bank pay close attention
to the problem of the Indonesian private sector's foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's foreign debts last December totaled 137.424 billion
U.S. dollars, including the government's debts of 63.462 billion
dollars and the private sector's 73.962 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Given the depreciation of the rupiah (the national currency)
against the U.S. dollar, the settlement of the private sector's
foreign debts has become an urgent matter," said Radius.
</P>
<P>
He said his team will soon meet again with the IMF team.
</P>
<P>
Neiss arrived here on Tuesday to discuss with the Indonesian
government the economic and monetary crisis in the country.

<HEADLINE> Legislation to Be Strengthened, Says New Top Lawmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, newly elected chairman
of China's highest legislative body, pledged here today to step up
legislative efforts and guarantee the country's reform with a
legal system nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
Efforts of the Ninth Chinese National People's Congress (NPC)
will go along with the building of a socialist market economy and
the country's economic development, said Li, chairman of NPC's
Standing Committee, during his meeting with former French Prime
Minister Raymond Barre.
</P>
<P>
Barre, who is here to attend the Fourth China-French Economic
Symposium which opened this morning, is the first foreign guest Li
has received since assuming office on Monday.
</P>
<P>
As China's reform deepens, the NPC will try to codify those
positive reform experiences into law, improve legislation and help
propel the country's social and economic development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He discussed the just-concluded first session of the Ninth NPC
with Barre, and expressed his hope that the relationship between
the NPC and the French parliament advances.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed to the sound development momentum of bilateral
relations and the rapid progress in economic and trade cooperation
in recent years, saying China has always attached great importance
to its relations with France and the European Union as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government highly values French President Jacques
Chirac's policy of engaging in friendly relations with China, said
Li, who also expressed his appreciation with Barre's efforts to
improve Sino-French relations during his term.
</P>
<P>
Li said he hopes the ongoing economic symposium will further
stimulate bilateral cooperation in economic, trade, scientific and
technology sectors which, as Barre said, is the purpose of the
symposium.
</P>
<P>
Barre offered his congratulations on the success of the NPC
session and Li's election as NPC chairman, and expressed his wish
that the new government would achieve more during its five-year
term.

LOS ANGELES, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Some start-up companies in
the city of New York, in an area of Manhattan called "Silicon
Alley," are attempting to attract investment from California's
Silicon Valley.

About two dozen companies, many of them Internet content and

Trade's Shanghai Huadong Steel Market and the Miyunlu Market, is
expected to grow to 100,000 sq.m. in future. And, at least 20
other steel marketplaces in Shanghai are quite likely to be

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese exchanges with foreign
countries in the field of military science are increasing,
according to Lieutenant General Zhang Gong, political commissar of
the Academy of Military Sciences of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told a ceremony for the academy's 40th anniversary on
Wednesday that his academy has formed academic ties with military
institutes in 27 countries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he said, exchanges have increased. In 1997, at
least 500 Academy staff members went abroad on academic visits and
the academy had 27 groups of military science specialists and
scholars visiting from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that this open style of research has helped the
academy widen its scope and improve its research quality, and in
the past few years it has gained valuable ideas from foreign
counterparts in the field of technologically-advanced warfare,
arms control, and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The Academy was founded in 1958 as a think-tank for China's
armed forces and has become a strategic research center for the
Central Military Commission.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Fix Pyramid's Fallen Stones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The stones that have fallen off the
Mycerinos Pyramid, the smallest of the three Great Pyramids in
Giza, Cairo, will be reinstated, English daily Egyptian Gazette
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the restoration plan was launched earlier
this week for Egypt's third most famous pyramid, which has
weathered more than four millennia in the Giza plateau, about 14
kilometers southwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture Farouk Hosni was quoted as saying that
foreign archeologists and Egyptian restoration experts will work
together on the project which is expected to last ten years due to
the huge amount of work.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary General of the Supreme Council for Antiquities,
Gaballah Ali Gaballah said the plan's initial step involves a
thorough registration of the stones that peeled off and scattered
around the pyramid before putting them back in their original
place.
</P>
<P>
Zahi Hawas, director of Giza Antiquities, pointed out that the
removal of the stones scattered in the vicinity of the pyramid is
likely to facilitate the process of unearthing the boats of King
Mycerinos (2532-2503 BC), owner of the third pyramid and grandson
of King Khufu.
</P>
<P>
The original height of the third Giza pyramid, 66.5 meters,
has been reduced to 61.5 meters, which is less than half that of
its two towering neighbors, pyramids of Khufu and Khafra, Egypt's
major tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Egypt has announced the closure of Great
Pyramid of Khufu to tourists for eight months since April 1 to
make way for interior and exterior repairs.
</P>
<P>
There are estimated 6,000 tombs in the pyramids area alone,
only 46 of which are open to the public.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mandela to Appear in Court for Rugby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela appears in the high court in Pretoria Thursday to
explain why he was involved in a sport conflict.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will be asked to explain why he gave orders last year
to set up a judicial commission of inquiry into the affairs of
the South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu), which stands
accused of nepotism and financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the summons of a sitting president is without
precedent: never before has a head of state been called to
account for his decisions in front of a court of law.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's legal team has already expressed concern that his
court appearance could set a "dangerous precedent" that would
compromise the head of state's decisions and lead to a flood of
litigation against the president.
</P>
<P>
But Justice William de Villiers, who last week issued the
order for Mandela to submit to cross-examination, said the
interests of justice "outweighed all other considerations."
</P>
<P>
Sarfu is contesting the validity of the commission of inquiry
into its affairs, alleging that the president acted
unconstitutionally by merely "rubber-stamping" Sports Minister
Steve Tshwete's wish that the union be investigated.
</P>
<P>
For Sarfu, the probe represents government interference in
what it believes an essentially private organization.
</P>
<P>
According to Sarfu, Minister Tshwete has a personal vendetta
against Rugby union boss Louis Luyt, and resents that Rugby is
run by whites -- mostly Afrikaners -- and not by the government,
which has a policy of affirmative action for blacks.
</P>
<P>
For their part, Mandela and Tshwete said Rugby has an
important role to play in developing the nation, that allegations
of bad management within Sarfu are of national interest and that
the commission must continue its probe.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana confirmed that the
president would appear in court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has said that he intends to honor the court's order to
testify, even though he is aware of the precedent it may set.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Rebels Agree to Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have agreed to resume
negotiations that may lead to formal peace talks, Philippine
President Fidel Ramos said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued during his weekly press conference, Ramos
said the recent technical committee meeting between the government
and the MILF has decided to create a quick response team to
address alleged violations of a cease-fire between the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he is optimistic that with this positive
development, the government and the MILF panels can now proceed
with preparations for the conduct of the formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction from the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) and now the biggest Muslim rebel group in the
country, refuses to be part of a peace agreement signed between
the government and the MNLF in 1996 and wants its own peace accord
with Manila.

BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China's chambers of commerce say
they will play a role in increasing the nation's exports as a
bridge between government and business, today's International
Business Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
All of them list service as a priority, in the same way the
light industry chamber of commerce did when it helped enterprises
to decide proper prices by providing them with information on
domestic and international exporters. It also provided an
information package on 32 commodities.
</P>
<P>
Information is the biggest service they can provide, according
to Zhou Shijian, who is from the minerals, metals, and chemicals
chamber of commerce. That's why the chamber has joined the network
of world information services like Reuters and the London Metal
Exchange, he explains.
</P>
<P>
It also obtains business data from Chinese offices overseas as
reference material.
</P>
<P>
Modern technology is what the machinery and electronic products
chamber of commerce made use of. According to its deputy head, Li
Guangyuan, it has put data for fellow enterprises on disc, and
provides them for overseas traders.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Aims to Keep Obsolete Spindles Out of Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, a major textile
producer in China, has tightened efforts to eliminate obsolete
spindles and to keep them from re-entering the market.
</P>
<P>
Individual spinning mill owners and agents from joint ventures
reportedly have brought cash to purchase spindles eliminated from
large textile factories in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Kuangyu, chairman of the Shanghai Textile Holding Co.,
which is controlled by state-owned shares, told Xinhua that many
private and township spinning mills intend to expand production
for a larger market share while state-owned textile plants are
shrinking capacity in accordance with government orders.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has 682,000 spindles scheduled for elimination
this year. Each of the spinning frames has been registered with
its date of birth and mode, and that information will be checked
when each is destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Textile Holding Co. has 50 million yuan of
overstocked products and 1,500 workers to be laid off after its
reduction of spindles, Zhu said, but it has determinedly joined
the fight by refusing cash offered by private buyers for the
spindles.
</P>
<P>
So far, 120,000 spindles manufactured prior to 1979 have been
transported to a yard at the Pudong Steel Company in the city to
be destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Vows to Fight against Dynamite Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will take every
means to fight against the illegal and destructive dynamite
fishing along its coastline, Vice President Omar Ali Juma has
said.
</P>
<P>
Juma told a three-day seminar on "Wage War Against Dynamite
Fishing" held here on Wednesday that if the illegal practice is
not checked, it would end up depleting the country's marine
resources.
</P>
<P>
"We must fight the illegal dynamite fishing to protect our
marine resources for the benefit of our nation and our future
generations," he said, urging the participants to review existing
laws and regulations governing dynamite fishing with emphasis on
penalties.
</P>
<P>
Juma noted that strategies and methods for dynamite fishing
prevention must include action to combat poverty and
environmental degradation in the coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
"People living in the coastal areas are extremely poor and
highly dependent on fish for both their nutrition and income
generation," he said, adding "Therefore, a sound management of
the coastal resources and of the environment is essential for
their well being."
</P>
<P>
With an 800-km coastline in the western Indian Ocean, Tanzania
gets some 10 percent of its Gross National Product from the
fisheries, and two million tons of fish worth 176.7 billion
Tanzanian Shillings (one U.S. dollar is exchanged to 660
Tanzanian Shillings at present) were harvested in the period of
1990-1996.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Reigning Boston City marathon
champion Lemeck Aguta, who was injured in a near-fatal car

his title.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG May Shift Base to S. Leone from Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG) has finalized plans to move its headquarters from
Liberia to Sierra Leone, the Guardian newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A reconnaissance and logistics team sent by ECOMOG High
Command has traveled to Sierra Leone to work out details of the
movements, including the location of the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Though no date has been fixed for the final movement, sources
in both Sierra Leone and Liberia said the move was based on the
need to be close to ECOMOG's major operational area in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The hostile posture of the government and people of Liberia to
the sub-regional force is another reason for the movement of
ECOMOG headquarters, they said.
</P>
<P>
But ECOMOG Force Commander Maj.-Gen. Timothy Shelpidi has
rebuffed speculations that the force is to withdraw from Liberia.
</P>
<P>
He said: "ECOMOG is not withdrawing from Liberia. What is
happening is that troop-contributing countries are relocating
their troops, And the relocation is going on fine. No problem."
</P>
<P>
Under the envisaged plan, said the newspaper, ECOMOG
will station about two battalions in Liberia to protect Nigeria's
vital interests.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops have already been withdrawn from Liberia's
borders with Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea. The bulk of the troops
remaining in Liberia are concentrated in the capital Monrovia and
its environs, as well as the Sierra Leonean side of the border
with Liberia.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has also withdrawn the Nigerian troops which were part
of the presidential body guards attached to Liberian President
Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
They were replaced by the Burkina Faso contingent who are
expected to remain after ECOMOG has relocated its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
In Sierra Leone, ECOMOG is expected to monitor and execute the
disarmament and demobilization of every armed group in the
country. It will also handle the retraining and restructuring of
the Sierra Leonean armed forces, police and other security
agencies.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was sent to Liberia in 1990 at the heat of the
country's civil war triggered off by Taylor's fighting against
the government, a move that might have prevented Taylor from
taking the seat of president at that time.
</P>
<P>
The force at last helped bring an end to the seven-year civil
war in Liberia, which led to the establishment of the Taylor
administration last August.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force, meanwhile, had to go to neighboring
Sierra Leone to reinforce economic sanction and blockade after
coupists forced the legitimate government to flee out of the
country last May.
</P>
<P>
Since it droved the military junta out of Freetown, ECOMOG has
been stepping up efforts to clean up the remnants of the junta
and its allied rebels.

<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Commodity inspectors in east
China's Shandong Province have played a major role in promoting

</P>
<P>
Shandong's commodity inspection departments inspected some 50
percent of the province's total imports and exports during 1997,
with related products valued at well over 10.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors disqualified imported commodities valued at 107
million US dollars during the year, with obtaining 30 million US

Inspectors also uncovered foreign investors submitting
excessive property value declarations of over 18 million US
dollars.

DHAKA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will construct some
3,000 cyclone shelters in the country's coastal areas to save
human lives and livestock, Minister for Local Government and Rural
Development (LGRD) and Cooperatives Zillur Rahman said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The international community, expressing its strong concern over
the recurrence of the natural calamities, has offered financial
and technical assistance for constructing the shelters in the
high-risk coastal regions in the country, Rahman told a seminar on
"Cyclone Shelter Project Preparatory Study Report."
</P>
<P>
The shelters could bring down the loss and devastation of crops
and property caused by natural calamities every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, sponsored by the LGRD and Cooperatives Ministry
with assistance from the European Union and the World Bank, was
designed to prepare concrete proposals with detailed survey for
the construction of the cyclone shelters.

<HEADLINE> 40 Percent of Tanzanians Have No Safe Water  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Though Tanzania has been
striving to supply water to its people since its independence in
water for their daily life.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Ministry of Water Thursday quoted Deputy
Minister for Waters Ismail Iwvata, as saying that 27 years have
passed since the National Water Supply Program began, but only
about 60 percent of the people have access to safe water.
</P>
<P>
Iwvata told a seminar on environmental water quality
assessment here on Wednesday that it was the government's wish
that the remaining 40 percent be provided with safe water in 2002
when a Water For All Project finishes.
</P>
<P>
"The government does not have the capacity to provide all the
people with clean and safe water," he admitted, appealing for
full participation of beneficiaries in planning, construction,
operation and maintenance of their own water supply systems.
</P>
<P>
He also urged an effective monitoring of the quality of water
in the distribution networks as well as the boreholes against
contamination in order to guarantee a smooth socio-economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"Water from the Ruvu River is contaminated by agro-chemicals
while there could be some more contamination from domestic and
industrial seweage due to leakage and variations in pressure in
the distrubution systems," the deputy minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Iwvata also stressed the importance of ground water, saying it
was the gound water that the government relied on to ease the
unusual 1996/97 drought nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Plans Personnel Cut Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen state agencies with
offices overseas have submitted plans to cut down operations and
the number of staff in order to help the government tide over the
current currency crisis, a government source said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The reduction is expected to save the government some 700
million baht (about 18 million U.S. dollars), the source said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
He said the scale-down includes a saving of 325 million baht
(about 8.5 million U.S. dollars) by the Foreign Ministry as a
result of its decision against replacing 73 diplomats whose terms
expire in June.
</P>
<P>
The 80 embassies overseas will be in deep trouble if the
government does not provide the ministry with more money by the
end of next month, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Ministry proposed closing its offices in
Beijing and Jakarta, while keeping open those in Canberra,
Brussels, Rome, Tokyo and Washington, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry proposed saving 216.12 million baht
(about 5.7 million U.S. dollars) by temporarily closing 15 offices
and eight trade centers by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry offices in Tokyo, London and Washington
will be staffed by only one person each, while the Industry
Ministry is to close its offices in Washington and London by the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Authority, the Education Ministry, the Civil
Service Commission and the Public Relations Department also plan
personnel cuts overseas.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Phone Company to let Customers See Caller's Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Pacific Bell, a local
telephone service provider in the U.S. west including California,
will soon let its customers see the name of the person calling.
</P>
<P>
To be more exact, customers starting from April 5, when the new
Caller ID service is available, will be able to see the name of
the phone service subscriber on the calling phone.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell sells its new version of Caller ID unit for 19.95
U.S. dollars. The caller's name could be on the Caller ID box.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the California Public Utilities Commission
approved the new service. And Pacific Bell is planning a six-week
media promotion campaign to make the new feature a hot seller.
</P>
<P>
The company said 760,000 residential consumers of Pacific Bell
now subscribe to Caller ID, which costs 6.5 dollars a month. New
customers are signing up at a rate of 5,600 per day.
</P>
<P>
Even so, only 7 percent of Pacific Bell customers subscribe to
the highly profitable service, compared with 60 percent in Taxas,
the heartland of Pacific Bell's partner company, SBC
Communications.
</P>
<P>
The difference reflects the high level of concern over privacy
issues in California, which was one of the last states to approve
Caller ID.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the California Public Utilities Commission instructed
Pacific Bell and other local phone companies to offer all their
customers the cost-free option to block their numbers from being
read by other subscribers with Caller ID service.

<HEADLINE> Many Zambian Doctors Seek Greener Pasture Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- About 80 percent of the doctors
Zambia trained have sought greener pasture overseas, a senior
health official disclosed in Livingstone in southern Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Thursday quoted Deputy Health Minister
Nkandu Luo as saying that Zambia has trained a lot of
doctors in the last two decades but most doctors have opted to go
and work outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Opening a workshop Wednesday on the assessment of training and
the role of licentiate in Zambia and the region, Luo said it will
be sad for Zambia to continue training doctors for other
countries while most rural hospitals in Zambia are being run by
expatriate doctors whom she said are junior doctors in their
respective countries.
</P>
<P>
Lack of doctors is a major problem in the country, she said,
urging the government to find a way of attracting back the
doctors into the country.
</P>
<P>
Most Zambian doctors are unwilling to work in the rural
hospitals and the government are forced to send under-qualified
personnel to those hospitals, she noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the health official, training for clinical
officers must be upgraded in order to equip them with better
skills to run rural clinics and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Health officials from Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Kenya,
Ethiopia, Sweden and Zambia attended the workshop.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and Israel signed an air services
agreement here Thursday, which provides the legal framework for
the further expansion of bilateral air links.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Economic Services Stephen Ip signed the accord on
behalf of the SAR government while Consul-General of Israel Zohar
Raz did so on behalf of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"The air services agreement signed today marks a new phase in
the aviation relationship between Hong Kong and Israel," Ip said
at Thursday's signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Since October 1994 when El Al Israel Airlines started services
to Hong Kong, passenger traffic on the Hong Kong-Israel route has
increased by 50 percent and cargo throughput more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has so far signed 25 air services accords with
different countries. Acting under the authorization of the Central
People's Government, the SAR government will negotiate and
conclude air services agreements with more aviation partners,
according to Ip.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that an extensive network of air services helps
strengthen Hong Kong's economic and trade ties with the rest of
the world and maintain Hong Kong's status as an international
aviation center.

<HEADLINE> HK's Insurance Chief Welcomes 1998-99 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Alan Wong, commissioner of
insurance of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
Thursday welcomed the newly-approved 1998-99 budget, noting that
it can help Hong Kong's status of a regional reinsurance center.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the SAR government building,
Wong praised Financial Secretary Donald Tsang's proposal in the
budget to promote Hong Kong's reinsurance business by offering a
concessionary profits tax rate to professional reinsurers in
respect of their offshore business.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal to offer a concessionary tax rate at 50
percent of the normal profits tax rate is one of the major
measures recommended in 1997 by a working group set up to promote
Hong Kong as a center for reinsurance and captive insurance.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budget, entitled "Riding Out the Storm, Renewing
Hong Kong Strengths," to the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)
on February 18, Tsang said: "I propose to provide a concessionary
tax rate at 50 percent of the normal Profits Tax rate for the
offshore business of professional reinsurance companies authorized
in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"This will allow Hong Kong to compete on level terms as a
regional reinsurance center," the financial secretary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The budget was approved by the SAR legislature Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wong told reporters on Thursday afternoon: "The Office of the
Commissioner of Insurance also implemented a series of promotional
measures to coincide with the (SAR) government's initiative to
encourage the development of reinsurance and captive insurance
business in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The office produced in 1997 a leaflet and a video promoting
Hong Kong as an ideal location for captive insurance companies, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the growth of the insurance industry in 1997,
Wong said that according to provisional data, general business
showed a marginal growth rate of 2 percent last year whereas
long-term business maintained its double-digit growth of 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
At the end of February this year, there were 214 authorized
insurers operating in Hong Kong, of which 151 were general
insurers, 45 long-term insurers and 18 composite insurers. Among
these insurers, 101 were incorporated in Hong Kong and the rest in
27 different countries including Britain and the United States.

<HEADLINE> 1.4 Million S. Africans Infected with HIV, TB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- About 1.4 million South
Africans have been infected with both HIV and tuberculosis, the
National AIDS Coalition of South Africa (NACOSA) has said.
</P>
<P>
"HIV infection increase the risk of TB illness, and TB
accelerates the progression of HIV," the local daily the
Citizen quoted NACOSA as reporting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
NACOSA, the umbrella organization for those working in the
AIDS field, said the significance of the duel epidemic had been
recognized for some time.
</P>
<P>
TB had been declared in South Africa a national health
priority while HIV/AIDS had been accorded status as a
Presidential Lead Project of the Reconstruction and Development
Program.
</P>
<P>
Proposing dual training in HIV and TB, NACOSA said in some
cases up to half of patients in TB hospitals were also infected
with HIV.
</P>
<P>
"But staff at these hospitals have limited HIV training, are
over-burdened and cannot cope with the psychological and social
needs of HIV patients," it said.
</P>
<P>
NACOSA said people should be alerted to the fact that an
epidemic which was predicted to infect 25 percent of the
population in seven years' time would require significant
intervention and funding between the HIV/AIDS and TB programs.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, links should be made in relation to training,
education, advocacy, policy formulation, referral mechanisms,
home-based care, and provision of treatment," NACOSA stressed.

MACAO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals to Macao in the
first two months of 1998 reached 1.2 million, down 6.4 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Latest official figures released by the Macao Census and
Statistics Department on Thursday say that passenger arrivals in
February dropped more than 121,000 from the same month last year,
to only 584,592.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of passengers to Macao added up to
1,205,936 in the first two months.
</P>
<P>
Passengers from Hong Kong, who account for 70.9 percent of
the total, increased 9.4 percent from the same period last year. But
those from the Republic of Korea, Japan and Europe all declined.
</P>
<P>
Macao received about seven million passengers last year, down
14 percent from 1996. The drop in tourist arrivals was blamed
mainly as a mixed result of a wide coverage of Macao rising crime
rates and the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a leading sector of Macao's economy, contributing
to about 40 percent of Macao tax revenues each year.

PARIS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- One after another, French companies reported strong figures
of growth in 1997. Since the beginning of 1998, the stock exchange
values of France have risen 20 percent. These profits are linked
with the resumption of economic growth in the country, but they
also reflect an inequality between the stock holders and those
whose living depends on payrolls.
</P>
<P>
-- The Gaullist Rally for the Republic president Philippe
Seguin has expelled Jean-Francois Mancel, former number two of the
party, for negotiating with the far-right National Front (FN) over
the election of the president of a cantonal council. Moreover,
Mancel publicly expressed the wish that the FN ``will become a
rightwing party of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The rapprochement between the right wing opposition and the
far-right National Front deputies of regional councils or
parliaments is obtaining momentum. The president of the Rally for
the Republic (RPR) Philippe Seguin summoned to Paris on Thursday
all the RPR leaders at provincial and regional levels to announce
new expulsions of those who are engaged in dialogue with the FN.
</P>
<P>
-- More than 200 delegates representing 84 countries will
attend a conference in Paris on the protection of water resources
and its relations with durable development under the auspices of
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO). The conference comes against the backdrop
that one quarter of the world's population cannot have direct
access to potable water.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Pandas Find Better Home in NW China Mountain Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 80 giant pandas can now
roam freely in the dense bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountain
in Shaanxi province, northwest China, as their ancestral home gets
better protection.
</P>
<P>
The pandas were seen chewing on bamboo leaves, playing or
making noises alongside highways.
</P>
<P>
Before 1995, when the Qinling Mountain was set aside by the
State Council as the Evergreen State Nature Reserve, the primitive
forests had been severely damaged by 20 years of indiscriminate
logging.
</P>
<P>
When the state nature reserve was established, it put a halt to
the logging, picking of medicinal plants, and highway
construction. As a result, the bamboo forests have rapidly
re-established themselves.
</P>
<P>
Seventy patrol groups with trucks, motorbikes, communications
equipment and computers provided by the World Bank help maintain
the nature reserve. Thanks to the modern facilities, five injured
or sick pandas were found and saved in time.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province
recorded major 1997 advances in opening its fisheries sector.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics through the end of last year show that
Fujian's fishing industry, which benefits from abundant marine
resources, has attracted World Bank and Asian Development Bank
loans totalling 40 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has approved some 520 foreign-funded enterprises
specializing in aquatic products, with total foreign direct
investment (FDI) standing at 435 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in Fujian's aquatics sector hit 85 million
US dollars in 1997, double the level for the previous two year
period.
</P>
<P>
Fujian plans to use a World Bank loan of 70 million US dollars
to implement a sustainable coastal development project during
1998. The province's deep-sea fishing industry has witnessed major
development since 1985, with 196 deep-sea trawlers currently in
operation.
</P>
<P>
The province exported aquatic products valued at 600 million US
dollars during 1997.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise Sharply on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed sharply
higher on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) surged by 53.45 points to finish at
1698.75 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted that propelled by expectations of a further fall
in interest rates, the property stocks took the lead in the robust
rise. The Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) announced a cut in
its prime lending rate by half a percentage point to 7 percent as
of Thursday and other banks are expected to follow suit soon.
</P>
<P>
The dealers said lower interest rates are good news for
equities as this also means lower business costs and interest
expense, especially for highly geared companies.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased sharply to 726.59 million
units, valued at 919.53 million Singapore dollars (about 574.71
million U.S. dollars). Advances overwhelmed declines by 385 to 28,
while 198 other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Renong Bhd was the most actively traded stock as it registered
a turnover of 45.92 million units. It was followed by M. Resources
which had 36.19 million shares traded. MBf Capital was next with
34.86 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
DBS Foreign led the gainers of the day as it rose by 1.1
dollars to finish at 14.2 Singapore dollars. Bukit Sembawang
increased by 1.05 dollars to end at 10.9 Singapore dollars. OCBC
(Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation) Foreign was up by 1 dollar
to close at 9.95 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Jardine Matheson Holdings (JMH) 400 was the
biggest loser as it declined by 14 cents to end at 4.74 U.S.
dollars. MISC Foreign fell by 12 cents to close at 3 Singapore
dollars, while SPH (Singapore Press Holdings) lost 10 cents to
finish at 19.8 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Armenia's PM, Former Leader Enter Presidential Runoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Armenian Prime Minister Robert
Kocharian and former Communist Party chief Karen Demirchian are to
enter the country's presidential runoff.
</P>
<P>
The two, the Central Election Committee (CEC) was quoted as
saying Thursday by an Itar-Tass news agency report, survived the
first round of the presidential race Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Initial returns indicated that Kocharian won 38.82 percent of
the popular votes while Demirchian had 30.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
By Armenia's electoral law, as both were below the 50 percent
mark, they have to go into the second round of election, now
scheduled for March 30, to decide who will run the office.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election was prompted ahead of schedule
following President Levon Ter-Petrosyan's resignation in February
over a political crisis triggered by the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.

TAIYUAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province
plans to use 3.5 billion US dollars worth of overseas investment
during the 1996-2000 period, accounting for 10 percent of its
fixed assets investment.
</P>
<P>
The province recently developed regulations to encourage
overseas investment and improved management of local
overseas-funded businesses. It will give priority to direct

<HEADLINE> Technology Turning Wool Pollutants Into Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- An Australian company has
developed world-class technique for converting dangerous
pollutants in wool processing into fertilizer, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A company based in Geelong, a city about 80 km southwest of
Melbourne, "has scored a world-first by converting dangerous
pollutants in wool (processing), which have forced other wool
processors around the world to close down, into fertilizer", AAP
said.
</P>
<P>
The wire service, however, did not name the pollutants.
</P>
<P>
In Melbourne Thursday, Geelong Wool Combing (GWC) was presented
with an international Environmental Quality Certificate by
Australian Industry Minister John Moore for its breakthrough in
environmental waste management.
</P>
<P>
The minister said overseas wool processing plants in Western
Europe and Japan were forced to close in recent years because of
pollution control and effluent disposal difficulties.
</P>
<P>
But GWC is the first plant of its type with the technology to
convert fully the waste produced in wool processing into
additive-free composts and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
"This sets a world-class precedent for other Australian
industries to follow," said Moore.
</P>
<P>
GWC's organic topsoil was developed with assistance from the
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's
Division of Wool Technology and Victoria's State Chemistry
Laboratory, AAP said.

<HEADLINE> New Government to Adhere to Established Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government "has never
considered any change" in its policy towards Russia, Premier Zhu
Rongji said here today.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning China's policy toward
Russia when meeting the press with four vice-premiers of the new
cabinet, Zhu said, "I've never thought of having any change in
China's policy towards Russia."
</P>
<P>
"The new government will pursue unswervingly the foreign policy
decided by President Jiang Zemin and (former) Premier Li Peng,"
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that when he was a vice-premier in the previous
cabinet, he took charge of economic work. "I didn't attend to
diplomatic work very much," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to another question about whether or not a cabinet
member who once studied in foreign country A would be pro-A,
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, pitched in, "We just don't have the
logic. I think no matter where the members once studied, or what
experiences they have had, they are the cabinet of China."
</P>
<P>
When an Indian reporter asked if he has message to bring to the
new Indian government, Zhu Rongji said he hoped very much to have
an opportunity to meet his Indian counterpart Atal Behari Vajpayee
at an appropriate time in the future.
</P>
<P>
"So that I can consult him," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he had sent a message of congratulations to
the newly-appointed Indian prime minister yesterday and asked the
Indian reporter to forward his "best greetings" to the Indian
government and people.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his last visit to India in 1994, Zhu said the visit
had left him a "very fine impression".
</P>
<P>
Taking the question on China's entry to WTO, Vice Premier Li
Lanqing said the World Trade Organization (WTO) will find it hard
to play its due role as a world trade organization without the
participation of China, which is already the 10th largest trading
nation in the world.
</P>
<P>
Li said, "Important progress has been made in the negotiations
on this issue, and we hope that this matter would be resolved very
soon."
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's attitude toward the accession into the WTO
is a positive one, he recalled that China has been working for that
objective for 11 years, taken part in the whole process of the
Uruguay round and signed the final packaged agreement of the
Uruguay round.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for us to adopt the positive attitude on this issue
is because the world trade and economic cooperation needs a
unified set of rules," he said, "Otherwise, that may give rise to
regional protectionism, or even trade conflicts or wars in the
interests of nobody."
</P>
<P>
The problem is that some members of the WTO think that China
needs the WTO more than the WTO needs China, this is not a very
correct view, he said.
</P>
<P>
After joining the WTO, he added, China is prepared to undertake
the obligations for a developing country meanwhile enjoying its due
rights correspondingly.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade and more, great progress and achievements
have been made in China's reform, although the country is still
not a member of the WTO," he said. As a matter of fact, the
results of many of China's reforms have already gone far beyond
the commitments it has made.
</P>
<P>
"But our reform must proceed in a step-by-step manner in
accordance with the preset objective and plan, and this has been
proved entirely correct in our practice," the vice-premier said.

<HEADLINE> Lifting of State of Emergency Facilitates Aid to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's major donors, Germany
and Norway, have revealed that they will fulfill their aid
commitments to the country following its lifting of the state of
emergency, state-controlled Zambia Daily Mail reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Joe Lamoy, Norwegian Ambassador to Zambia, as
saying Wednesday that the latest political developments in Zambia
will facilitate bilateral talks between Norway and
Zambia, which will focus on long term development projects
especially those dealing with the reduction of poverty.
</P>
<P>
This is obviously a positive response to the lifting of the
nearly five-month state of emergency which has caused all the
western donor countries to freeze their aid to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba revoked on Tuesday the
state of emergency imposed five months ago after last year's
foiled military coup, saying there is no more threat to public
security now.
</P>
<P>
Lamoy noted that the political developments in Zambia will
pave the way for the normalisation of relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
With the lifting of the state of emergency, said the Norwegian
ambassador, his country is willing to resume talks with Zambia on
aid and further bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
German Ambassador Helmuth Schroeder told the daily paper
Wednesday that the conditions for a bilateral meeting between
Germany and Zambia are now "conducive" and aid of various kinds
will be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
A meeting concerning Germany's aid to Zambia scheduled last
February was put off because of the state of emergency. However,
it will be held later this year, according to Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Germany is among the major contributors to the balance of
payments support to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Zambia needs 425 million U.S. Dollars in external financing
for this year's budget, of which 129 million Dollars is expected
to be given by donors.

<HEADLINE> Abacha May Contest Presidential Polls: NGO Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The National Council of Youth
Associations of Nigeria (NACYAN) disclosed Wednesday Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha, has accepted in
principle to contest the August 1 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Abacha did so because of the passionate appeal to him by
youths in the country, said Alhaji Mohammed Ibn Yakubu, zonal
coordinator of NACYAN in Minna, western Nigeria's Niger state.
</P>
<P>
"He (Abacha) is such a man who does not speak but act, his
declaration would soon be made public," Yakubu said, quoted by
the Daily Times Thursday.
</P>
<P>
NACYAN, reportedly the largest non-governmental organization
in the country which embraces more than 100 pro-Abacha groups,
organized a two-million-man rally in the capital Abuja early this
month to ask Abacha to contest the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
According to Yakubu, the youths would continue to clamor for
the head of state to succeed himself until he made his
pronouncement public on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, one of Abacha's aides said the head of state
would make his decision known in a few weeks after consultation
with his family, friends and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
There are less than five months to go before the August 1
election starts and almost everyone is waiting for the decision
of Abacha, who has repeatedly promised to hand over power to an
elected civilian government on October 1 this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Comments On Financial Turmoil In Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, in a
written statement today to the Fourth Sino-French Economic Forum,
outlined China's methods for dealing with the financial turmoil
in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China's economy had had a soft-landing with "high
growth, low inflation" and had continued to grow despite the
financial crisis in Southeast Asia. It has given aid and support
to countries severely hurt by the financial crisis, he said, and
provided Thailand and Indonesia with one billion US dollars worth
of aid each.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining the value of the renminbi at its present level is
one means of support for the region's economic stability, he said,
and China will take positive steps against financial shocks.
</P>
<P>
It will improve its micro-economic controls and maintain
economic growth by optimizing the industrial structure, expanding
domestic demand, fostering new economic growth areas, increasing
exports and use of overseas funds, maintaining a high savings rate
at around 40 percent, keeping a balance of payments in the current
and capital accounts, and keeping adequate foreign exchange
reserves.
</P>
<P>
China will see to it that short-term debt continues to account
for only 12 percent of its foreign debts, he said, adding: "We
will continue to strictly control the total scale and the
structure of foreign debts."
</P>
<P>
He said that China will try to speed up the restructuring of
state-owned enterprises and introduce a modern enterprise system
in most major state-owned enterprises within three years, in order
to markedly improve their performance.
</P>
<P>
He added that efforts will be made to accelerate the reform of
the financial system, institute a modern financial system, a
financial market system and a financial regulatory and monitoring
system, in a bid to cut financial risks to a minimum.

<HEADLINE> Deputies Hail NPC Successful Conclusion (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua)-- The just concluded First Session
of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's parliament, has
drawn applauses from its deputies who described it as
"democratic, practical, united and encouraging."
</P>
<P>
Luo Zhongli, a professor of arts from Sichuan Province,
southwest China, said the meeting is highly democratic as its
agenda and reports to the session were adopted only after
extensive discussions by the deputies.
</P>
<P>
The display of democracy is also shown by a record 830 motions
the deputies submitted to this session, which have expressed the
will and opinions of the general public, Luo said.
</P>
<P>
Li Jianchang, mayor of Baoding city in north China's Hebei
Province, said he felt satisfied with the democratic election
procedures. "The fact that the top leaders all received
overwhelmingly favorable votes indicates that the election results
represent the aspirations of not only us deputies but of the
people across the country.
</P>
<P>
As the lawmakers elected to the office of new top legislature
are better educated as compared with their predecessors, they tend
to be more conscientious, outspoken and insightful when discussed
the state affairs and issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xijun from Hunan province, central China, said the
Government Work Report is solid and down-to-earth, the reform
package for restructuring and downsizing government institutions
is practical and the new leadership strong and competent.
</P>
<P>
"All these have pushed China a big stride forward towards
the new century," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Many deputies held that the session has underlined the
importance of the rule of law, which is indispensable for a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jie, general manager of the Lihuachun Wine-Making Group in
Shanxi Province, said, "The current NPC session is crowned with a
success and is really inspiring."
</P>
<P>
The plan for institutional restructuring takes shape on the
basis of repeated experiments with extensive deliberation and
meticulous preparations. Government officials have fully prepared
themselves for the reform, which has won the full support from
the masses of people.
</P>
<P>
The current government restructural reform is differing from
the previous ones as it has started from the top to the bottom
and it plays an examplary and directory role, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Ethnic Minority Areas Enjoy Healthy Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Economic development of China's
five ethnic autonomous regions has entered a virtuous circle,
according to deputies from these areas to the Ninth National
People's Congress, which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
The financial revenue of the five autonomous regions rose to
38.42 billion yuan last year. The revenue of Inner Mongolia and
that of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region each exceeded 10 billion
yuan for the first time in history, up by 15 and 17.5 percent
respectively over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Restricted by geographical and historical conditions, the five
ethnic minority areas have a poor economic foundation and have had
lower economic growth than other parts of China though they are
rich in such natural resources as petroleum, gas, coal and water.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in
south China, has invested 208.4 billion yuan in capital projects.
A total of 18 berths have been built in three key port cities,
increasing their port handling capacity to 9 million tons
annually, said regional government chairman Li Zhaozhuo.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has given priority to the development of cotton and
petrol-chemical production since 1993, said Abul' Ahat Abdurisit,
chairman of the regional government.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has built a number of chemical,
power, transport and telecoms projects in recent years, laying a
solid foundation for sustained economic growth, said regional
government chairman Ma Qizhi.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region reported 300 million
yuan in government revenue in 1997, up 19.3 percent over the
previous year, said Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the regional
government.

<P>
CANBERRA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares closed
slightly higher Thursday in Sydney after a rise on Wall Street
overnight, with banks and insurance stocks again leading the local
bourse into positive territory.
</P>
<P>
Nevitts Dealer Steve Mayne said positive gains in the banking
and insurance sectors were driving the market Thursday, while
lower commodity prices overnight had pushed resources stocks
lower.
</P>
<P>
"The banking stocks were firmer with more speculation of an
interest rate cut around the corner," Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
Reports that Australia's growth rate had peaked due to the
Asian crisis and that inflation had been brought under control has
fueled market expectations of another official interest rate cut.

8,775.40 overnight.

The bank index climbed 11.1 points to 5733.9, with Commonwealth
Bank shares leading the way, up 21 cents or 1.16 percent to 18.37
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank closed three cents firmer at 21.50
Australian dollars, Westpac was up one to 10.61 Australian
dollars, while ANZ kicked the trend, closing nine cents lower at
10.38 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index finished the day 9.4 points up at
4784.6 but lower commodity prices overnight sent the all resources
index down 2.7 points to 1163.0.
</P>
<P>
Mayne said the lower overnight commodity prices kept Australian
resource stocks lower Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Resources giant BHP was seven cents lower at 15.61 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Global miner Rio Tinto was the only major resource stock which
bucked the downward trend, surging 28 cents to finish at 19.78
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index slid 9.7 points to 1089.9 with Sydney spot gold
bullion closing at 291.25 U.S. dollars, down from Wednesday's
close of 292.10 U.S. dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Man Sues Wife for Smoking at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli man in Tel Aviv
suffering from lung disease has filed a 1.4 million-dollar suit
against his wife for exposing him to tobacco smoke, the English
daily The Jerusalem Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old man, whose name barred by the court from
publication, told Tel Aviv Family Court that his wife smokes
about 70 cigarettes a day for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The man, who was determined 100 percent disabled four years
ago, is waiting for a lung transplant in the United States. He
demands for 5 million shekels (1.4 million U.S. dollars) in
compensation from his wife.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that his lung illness is due to the large amounts
of cigarette smoke he was exposed to at home. He said that he
was forced to leave his home out of fear that his health would
continue to deteriorate if he continued living there.
</P>
<P>
He complained that before they were married 13 years ago, he
asked her to refrain from smoking near him, but she ignored the
request after marriage and even blew smoke toward him.
</P>
<P>
The man's wife has not yet filed a statement of
defense. Currently, the couple is in the middle of divorce
proceedings, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Deputies Hail NPC Successful Conclusion (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yuan Zhou, an official from southwest China's Guizhou Province,
said, "We've witnessed the coersiveness of the government from the
proceedings of current session and the mental outlook of deputies.
The session is alive with a mood of unity, truth-seeking,
democracy and pioneering.
</P>
<P>
Hong Weizong, vice-chairman of northwestern Ningxia Regional
People's Political Consultative Congress, cited the Ninth NPC
First Session as a cross-century grand gathering.
</P>
<P>
It has elected top government leaders who will lead the Chinese
people in their march into the next century and reflects the
wishes of the people of all ethnic groups in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should treasure the ethnic unity as we care for our own
eyes, speed up economic growth, cement the new-type ethnic
relationship of unity, equality and mutual help," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yuen Mu, executive director and vice-president of China
Merchants Holdings Co. Hong Kong, said the current NPC session
will help promote the social stability and economic prosperity of
Hong Kong and exert a far-reaching impact on the return of Macao
to the embrace of the motherland and accomplishment of
reunification of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yafeng, a young deputy of Taiwan origin, said the Ninth NPC
session has successfully completed all its agenda and provided
solutions to all major problems.
</P>
<P>
"We deputies of Taiwan origin are satisfied with the outcome of
the NPC session, and felt gratified at China's re-appeal for
holding political negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits in the government report, which was adopted after it was
was discussed fully by deputies."
</P>
<P>
A female deputy of Uygur ethnic group said the top concern of
deputies from northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
is to revitalize agriculture through the use of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
"As an agro-technician, I'll do my own job well and never let
the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang down," she said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Hails Success of NPC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Friday edition of the
People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, will carry an editorial
hailing the successful conclusion of the First Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top lawmaking
body.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that the NPC session, which began on March 5
and just concluded here this morning, has held high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and made new contributions to
pushing forward China's reform, opening-up and socialist
modernization drive, and will unite and encourage the Chinese
people to strive for the attainment of the magnificent goals set
by the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC).
</P>
<P>
It notes that the next five years are of critical importance to
China's development and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,
and that the Chinese people will face extremely glorious yet
arduous tasks in this period.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to study the guidelines of the 15th national
Party congress in an earnest manner, fulfill the tasks set forth
by this NPC session in a comprehensive way, and try our best to
open a new chapter for the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics at the turn of the century," it says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that economic growth is the key to the success of
China's bid to achieve socialist modernization, and that it's
extremely important to persistently take economic development as
the central task and maintain a sustained, rapid and sound growth
of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the article says, it is a major guarantee for
comprehensive social advancement, and also the common aspiration
of the Chinese people, to place equal emphasis on economic growth
on the one hand and the development of socialist democracy,
improvement of the country's legal system and promotion of
cultural and ethical progress on the other.
</P>
<P>
Describing the system of people's congress as China's
fundamental political system, the article says that this system
must be adhered to and further developed, so as to improve the
country's democracy and legal system and promote the building of a
socialist nation ruled by law.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that serving the people wholeheartedly is the
purpose of the CPC and governments at all levels across China, and
that unremitting efforts should be made to fight corruption,
improve the morale of the Party and build a clean government.
</P>
<P>
It urges leading officials of all ranks to firmly remember
their responsibilities, voluntarily resist the influence of
decadent ideologies and play an exemplary role in strictly abiding
by Party disciplines and state laws, honestly performing their
official duties and conscientiously seeking benefits for the
people.
</P>
<P>
The article finally calls on all Chinese people to treasure
rare historical opportunities that have emerged, hold higher the
great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, rally more closely around
the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, and work
hard with one heart and one mind to promote reform, opening-up and
modernization drive, as well as the great cause of China's
peaceful reunification.

<HEADLINE> Feature: India's New PM Facing Difficult Tasks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Senior leader of the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) A. B. Vajpayee was sworn in as new prime
minister of India's BJP-led coalition government at the Presidency
forecourt Thursday, together with an unexpected big team of
cabinet ministers, suggesting that he is facing difficult tasks
ahead.
</P>
<P>
During a one-and-a-half hour swearing-in ceremony, in which
various political leaders and noted figures from all walks of life
participated, new Prime Minister Vajpayee was putting on a solemn
face with his head slightly down pondering over things.
</P>
<P>
What has happened here Thursday at the ceremony proved the fact
that Vajpayee is facing hard jobs and challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Vajpayee had planned to present a
small cabinet at his swearing-in ceremony and after a vote of
confidence in Parliament 10 days later, he would expand his
cabinet so as to include all representatives both from the BJP and
its allies. Yet because of the last-minute pressures, he was
forced to agree on a 42-member cabinet at one stroke.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for Vajpayee to be sworn in to the post
in less than two years. He was sworn in as India's prime minister
on May 16, 1996, but he resigned 13 days later as his minority
government would lose a trust vote in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
This time again he would lead a minority government as no
single party could emerge a working majority in the just virtually
concluded general elections to the 12th Lower House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Except four constituencies, among the already declared 539
seats, the BJP and its allies secured 252, while the Congress and
its allies as well as the United Front, the three major political
forces in India, got 167 and 96 seats respectively.
</P>
<P>
Even if the BJP claimed that it had received 12 more MPs'
support later, it could not be able to cross the majority mark.
</P>
<P>
Keeping this in mind, Vajpayee has decided to set aside
contentious issues and promised to seek a national consensus on
all major issues confronting the nation.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the eight-page national agenda, drafted by all the
combine, here Wednesday at a press conference, Vajpayee said, "We
will strive to develop national consensus on all major issues
confronting the nation by involving opposition parties and all
sections of society in dialogue."
</P>
<P>
"We will also try for a consensus mode of governance as far as
practicable," he added.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the Vajpayee minority
government will face various challenges ahead and it is still a
question mark whether it could be able to provide a stable
government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Israeli Request Against Publishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States has rejected
Israel's demand on refraining from publishing a new plan to
advance the Middle East peace process, Israel Radio reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli demand for not publishing a U.S. proposal on
Israeli implementation of further redeployment in the West Bank
was presented to U.S. officials by Uzi Arad, diplomatic adviser
to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs
Martin Indyk, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel until last year,
turned down Israel's demand, citing that details of the
U.S. proposal are already well-known.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan reportedly demands Israel carry out a 13 percent
redeployment in the second of three-phased further troop
pullbacks in the West Bank so to break the year-old deadlock in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel's prolonged delay in implementing further redeployments
is the leading obstacle blocking the peace process. If Washington
publishes its new plan, it will increase pressure on Israel to end
the stalemate in the peace talks, observers noted.
</P>
<P>
Arad was accompanying Israeli Industry and Trade Minister
Natan Sharansky on a current visit to Washington. Top on
Sharansky's agenda for his talks with Vice-President Al Gore is
trying to thwart Russia's efforts to sell missile and nuclear
technologies to Iran, Israel's arch rival in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's Prime Minister's Office reacted skeptically
to the reports that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
is trying to arrange a summit in Europe between Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference Wednesday with visiting
Jordanian King Hussein in Washington, Albright stressed that it
was necessary to breathe life again into the peace process. She
called on both Israeli and Palestinian leaders to make hard
decisions to move forward the stalled peace process.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Falling gold prices and a plunge
in the value of the New Zealand currency fostered bearish
sentiment in the market Thursday in Sydney, pressuring the
Australian dollar lower.
</P>
<P>
The local unit slid to an intraday low of 66.15 US cents, its
lowest level since February 25, closing at 66.32 US cents from
66.53 US cents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The market had a fairly bearish outlook this morning," said
John Reedyk, head of foreign exchange sales with ANZ bank.
</P>
<P>
"The market is fairly bearish. The sellers must be genuine
because the market is not bouncing," Reedyk said.
</P>
<P>
Overnight, the confirmation of gold sales by Belgium's Central
Bank and rumors of International Monetary Fund gold sales sent the
gold price to a low of around 286.75 US dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Reserve Bank eased monetary conditions by 150
basis points, twice the amount anticipated by financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Bankers Trust Senior Economist David Bassanese said the key
risk for the Australian dollar going forward was whether the
currency could hold up in the manner that it has done so in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the local session at 86.32 yen
from 86.72, and at 1.2121 marks from 1.2131 marks.

<HEADLINE> China's Semiconductor Business Growing With Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The rapid growth of China's
semiconductor business and preferential policies for the industry
have helped increase the amount of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
One study indicates that the business will grow by as much as
30 percent annually, to 15 billion US dollars worth by the year
2000, and China is expected to become another semiconductor center
in Asia, after Japan and the Republic of Korea, and that European,
American, and Japanese companies will compete intensely for market
shares in China.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, there has been increased investment by
American, German, Japanese, and Korean semiconductor businesses in
China, according to Beijing's International Business Daily, which
says that the Netherlands' Philips Company and the US's Motorola
were among the first to invest in China's semiconductor field. In
1992, the two companies spent 100 million US dollars each on
factories producing integrated circuit boards.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the US's Intel set up a semiconductor
factory in Shanghai's Pudong New Area at a cost of 90 million US
dollars, and Germany's Siemens is looking for new ways to
cooperate with China.
</P>
<P>
Japan's NEC, Hitachi, and Fujitsu are in the Chinese market as
well. Hitachi began working with a Singaporean company to
manufacture 16 Mb chips in a factory in the city of Suzhou last
year. Its monthly output is 1.5 million, and another factory with
a monthly output of 40 million will open in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A factory established in Suzhou by Korea's Samsung at a cost of
100 million US dollars started manufacturing 40 million
semiconductors each month last July, and the Korean giant Hyundai
produces 50 million semiconductors each month in its Shanghai
factory, which started last October.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the computer and telecommunications
businesses is expected to bring sales of semiconductors worldwide
worth 300 billion US dollars by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Center for Production of Aerosol Freon-Free Raw Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 19 (Xinhua) -- An aerosol production center
substituting hydrocarbon-based products for freon has been built
and put into operation in the Zhongyuan Oil Field in central
China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The center, owned by the Zhongyuan Oil Field General Plant for
Production and Marketing of Natural Gas, has installed equipment
capable of annually producing 50,000 tons of hydrocarbon-based
products such as isobutane and dimethylmethane.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of products manufactured by the center,
considered the largest in Asia, has been put on the domestic
market. A dozen Chinese enterprises have placed orders for 6,000
tons of the center's products thus far, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
China has banned its aerosol makers from using freon as the
projectile agent in production and has worked out detailed
regulations governing substitution. The use of freon, which
damages the ozone layer of the atmosphere, has been banned from
use in aerosols and other applications by most developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Before the establishment of the center, China had to spend
large amounts of hard currency to import hydrocarbon-based
projectile agents from developed countries.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of government officials, more than 150 aerosol
customers and some well-known aerosol makers from the United
States, Britain and Japan are expected to visit the center this
month, according to local sources.

<P>
XIAMEN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Many Taiwanese businesses say they
intend to increase their investment in the city of Xiamen in
Fujian Province, because they've survived the financial
turmoil in Southeast Asia thanks to a stable renminbi.
</P>
<P>
The improvements in infrastructure are another thing that
attracts Taiwan entrepreneurs, government sources say.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen is one of China's five special economic zones. It has
approved 1,491 Taiwan-funded ventures, with more than three
billion US dollars worth of investment.
</P>
<P>
The city had 50.5 billion yuan in industrial output value last
year, 40 percent of that from Taiwan-backed businesses, 1,149 of
which are wholly Taiwanese-funded. Eighty-nine percent of these
are in industrial production, and more than 80 percent of their
products sell overseas. Four of the city's top 10 businesses are
Taiwanese-funded.
</P>

<HEADLINE> North China Province Employs 70 Percent of Laid-off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 70 percent of 100,000
laid-off workers in north China's Shanxi Province found new jobs
in 1997 because of a life security and re-employment system.
</P>
<P>
The province issued laid-off workers job-waiting cards, which
ensured their priority in entering re-employment service centers
and labor markets, as well as receiving favorable policies for
licenses and approvals.
</P>
<P>
Departments of industrial and commercial administration should
set aside a certain number of stalls at fairs for laid-off
workers, the province ruled, and that newly established businesses
should hire laid-off workers first.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province decided that any company helping 60
percent of its workers find new jobs in the same year would be
exempt from income tax for three years.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi has set up re-employment funding at different levels,
raising 40 million yuan annually, and laid-off workers get
bottom-line living expenses and training fees.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, the province is stepping up efforts to create
new job opportunities by developing community services, commerce,
catering, maintenance and other services for the public.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 million workers in the country's financially
troubled state enterprises reportedly lost their jobs in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Surges in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus in
February grew 88.7 percent from a year earlier to 1,284.67 billion yen
(about 10.2 billion dollars) as the stagnant domestic demand depressed
imports, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's global exports in February edged up 2.7 percent from a year
earlier to 4,097.58 billion yen (about 32.6 billion dollars) while
imports dropped 15.0 percent to 2,812.91 billion yen (about 22.4
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus with the United States jumped 32.9 percent
from a year earlier to 539.03 billion yen (about 4.3 billion dollars),
up for the 17th consecutive month, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
As for trade with Asian countries, Japan's surplus totaled 490.83
billion yen (about 3.9 billion dollars), up 1.1 percent from a year
earlier for the first increase in two months.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the region declined 11.9 percent and imports from there
fell 17.3 percent, both down for the second consecutive month,
reflecting financial troubles in the region, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the surplus with the European Union (EU) jumped 75.6
percent to 349.62 billion yen (about 2.8 billion dollars), for the
11th successive monthly rise.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the trade data, an economist at the Japan Research
Institute predicted that the decline in imports is likely to continue,
as long as Japan's domestic demand remains stagnant.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- To invigorate financial market
and boost economic development, the Tianjin Development Zone
has developed a series of preferential policies to attract overseas
banks.
</P>
<P>
The zone in the north China port city of Tianjin has covered an
area of over 70 square kilometers and become the largest of its
kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
Though the zone has entered its most rapid development period,
it has only 30 financial institutions with a total deposit of
less than 10 billion yuan, which has restricted its economic
development to some extent.
</P>
<P>
So the zone invited presidents of the 12 overseas bank branches
in the city and briefed them of the situations and prospects of
the zone.
</P>
<P>
To encourage these banks to operate business in the zone,
the zone has offered them some preferential policies. The overseas
banks will enjoy a decrease of 50 percent rents if they want to
rent houses in the zone, also a drop of 50 percent land prices if
they plan to build houses. If they jointly set up financial
institutions with the zone, they just pay 30 percent of the land
prices.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve investment environment, the zone will make
full use of overseas investments, issue long-term bonds and
establish investment funds.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that overseas-funded enterprises in the
zone have gained huge profits, which gave a living example for
overseas banks.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the zone now has over 2,300 overseas-funded
enterprises, involving 10 billion U.S. dollars of contractual
investment. And 46 of them generated more than 100 million yuan of
output value each in 1997. In the same year, the zone recorded
a total of 47 billion yuan of industrial output value.

lower than average in northern provinces, and about 20 to 30
percent lower in the central and central highland provinces.

<HEADLINE> Profile: vajpayee: Poet, Politician, Statesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Atal Behari Vajpayee, described
as the moderate and tolerant face of the hard-line Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP), was sworn-in Wednesday morning as India's 14th
prime minister, the post he has held the second time.
</P>
<P>
The "bachelor boy" of Indian politics, who Indian first prime
minister Jawaharlal Nehru had long ago prophesied would hold the
high office, kept his second date with destiny.
</P>
<P>
Sworn in as the nation's 11th prime minister on may 16, 1996,
Vajpayee had resigned after 13 days in power when he failed to
muster a majority on the floor of the Lok Sabha, the lower house
of India's parliament.
</P>
<P>
No stranger to top-level politics, the 72-year-old astute
parliamentarian, as minister of external affairs in 1977 and later
leader of the opposition, has always held the center stage.
</P>
<P>
Born in Christmas day, 1926, at gwalior in the central state of
Madhya to school teacher Krishna Behari Vajpayee, his initiation
into politics came as a student.
</P>
<P>
A leader with a clean political image, he is credited with
bringing a liberal and moderate image to the BJP, which opponents
and critics dub, not always kindly, communal and reactionary.
</P>
<P>
Jailed during the 1942 quit India movement (though there have
been allegations that he had given witness against freedom
fighters to get released), Vajpayee, a postgraduate in political
science from Kanpur University, started off as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, a persuasive leader and sensitive poet, entered
parliament for the first time in 1957, when he became one of the
only four candidates of Jan Sangh, the predecessor of the BJP, to
win in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
As a founder of the Jan Sangh in 1951 and winner of India's
second highest civilian award Padma Vibhushar, Vajpayee has been
described as, among many, a "multifaced personality", an eminent
national leader, an erudite politician, selfless social worker,
forceful orator, poet, litterateur, journalist and so on.
</P>
<P>
A former editor who has entered Lok Sabha for the eighth time
with the just-concluded elections, Vajpayee has also been a member
of Rajya Sabha, the Council of States.
</P>
<P>
It was by no means easy sailing for Vajpayee, his first attempt
to enter parliament was unsuccessful -- he lost in a by-election
in the mid `50s from the state of lucknow.
</P>
<P>
As external affairs minister in the Janata Party government
which came to power in 1977 in the aftermath of emergency, he set
a record by becoming the first Indian minister to have addressed
the United Nations General Assemble in Hindi, the national
language.
</P>
<P>
A man with a graceful taste for things apolitical, Vajpayee has
been member of Indian delegations to many an international forum
with great success.
</P>
<P>
A leader bestowed with ample wit and humor whose speeches are
full of poetic imagery, Vajpayee had advocated just before the
1991 elections the formation of a national government.
</P>
<P>
In a national agenda released Wednesday, Vajpayee pledged to
strive for consensus on national issues in a bid to reverse the
bitter government-opposition relations.

<HEADLINE> Laid-off Workers Re-employed in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 200,000 laid-off workers
in Chongqing Municipality found new jobs last year because of
training programs sponsored by the city's labor department.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of the reform of state-run enterprises, the
old industrial base of Chongqing faces a harsher task as the
majority of the city's laid-off workers need to be re-trained
before adapting to new job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
One official said that 18 re-employment service centers have
been established to organize such training courses as the
management of family affairs and tailors' skills.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, by the end of last year, the city had
organized 248 training classes which enrolled more than 20,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
To date, a complete re-employment system -- comprising quality
education, skills-training, rating and recommendation -- has come
into being in the city.
</P>
<P>
Two talent fairs organized last year in the city helped 3,300
laid-off workers find new jobs, a remarkable achievement which a
senior official attributed to the improved competitive edge of
laid-off workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 22,200 Beijing residents --
12,084 low-income households -- have been granted a card for
subsidized grain and edible oil in 1998, according to the
municipal civil affairs bureau.
</P>
<P>
Subsidy cardholders whose income is below the level of monthly
basic life guarantee of 190 yuan could obtain 20 yuan (2.4
U.S. dollars) worth of grain and oil from designated grain and
edible oil suppliers each month.

<P>
Currently, 20 yuan would buy 10 kilograms rice or flour, or two
kilograms of edible oil at local markets.

<P>
The system to grant subsidized grain and edible oil to needy
urban residents began in December of 1996. The municipal and
district financial departments have spent 4.6 million yuan for
the subsidy.

The Beijing municipal civil affairs bureau finished a yearly
examination of subsidy cardholders in January, and approved 350
new cardholders this year.

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Concludes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), China's top lawmaking body, concluded its first
annual session here this morning after adopting various
resolutions and having elected or approved state leaders of a new
term.
</P>
<P>
The session has called on people of all ethnic groups across
the country to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory
and, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at the core, make concerted efforts and strive with a
pioneering spirit for an all-round advancement of the cause of
China's socialist modernization into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the closing meeting this morning,
President Jiang Zemin said that China's goal of development is to
basically accomplish the modernization program and develop into a
prosperous, strong, democratic and culturally advanced socialist
nation when the People's Republic celebrates its centenary.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, our country will rank among the moderately
developed countries of the world, the Chinese people will have
achieved common prosperity on the basis of modernization and the
great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will have been realized,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that these ambitions are in conformity with
the aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups in China, and
acknowledge that there will be difficulties and risks in the
country's process of development.
</P>
<P>
"But nothing of this kind can stop the great Chinese Communist
Party and the Chinese people from forging ahead. We must strive
for and will certainly be able to realize these ambitions. We
shall triumphantly reach the glorious shore of modernization," he
concluded.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,907 deputies attended today's meeting, which was
presided over by Li Peng, an executive chairman of the current
session presidium and chairman of the Ninth NPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
They adopted a resolution endorsing a government work report.
The resolution says that the report has summarized government work
in the past five years in a practical and realistic manner, points
existing contradictions and problems sober-mindedly, and puts
forward feasible suggestions for this year's government work.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also says that in the past five years, China has
scored tremendous achievements in its socialist modernization
drive that have drawn worldwide attention, and has enjoyed a
relatively good period of development since the founding of New
China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"All these have resulted from the efforts of people of various
ethnic groups across the country holding high the great banner of
Deng Xiaoping Theory and, under the leadership of the Communist
Party of China, persistently taking economic development as the
central task and adhering to both the four cardinal principles and
reforms and opening-up," it notes.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting also adopted a resolution endorsing a report by Chen
Jinhua, ex-minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, on
the implementation of the 1997 plan for national economic and
social development and a draft plan for national economic and
social development in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It also adopted a resolution endorsing a report by Liu Zhongli,
former minister of finance, on the implementation of 1997
central and local budgets and on draft 1998 budgets.

<P>
The session approved the work reports of the Standing Committee
of the Eighth NPC, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme
People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
Following the agenda, President Jiang Zemin delivered a speech
expressing his heartfelt thanks for being elected as president of
the People's Republic of China and the trust placed in him by the
deputies and the people of all the ethnic groups throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
"The call of the times and the great trust of the people make
me keenly aware of the lofty and weighty responsibilities I
shoulder. I will faithfully abide by the Constitution, perform my
duties to the best of my ability and wholeheartedly serve the
motherland and the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
And then, Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Ninth NPC, said that the Ninth NPC First Session is successful
with concerted efforts of all NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Ninth NPC, he expressed heartfelt respect and
sincere thanks for the Eighth NPC Standing Committee chaired by
Qiao Shi, as well as all NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
Li said the five-year term of the Ninth NPC will be an
important period, in which China will successfully accomplish the
goals of reform, opening-up and modernization drive set for this
century and lay a solid foundation for attaining magnificent
objectives for the first decade of the next century.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), held last September, explicitly announced that state
affairs should be managed according to law, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ruling the country by law is an important component of Deng
Xiaoping Theory and a basic strategy adopted by the CPC in leading
the people in running the country, an important requirement for
developing a socialist market economy, an important hallmark of
social and cultural progress, and a vital guarantee for
maintaining long-term stability in the country," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Administering China according to law and constantly improving
the socialist legal system is an arduous, complex and long-term
historical process, which will continue throughout the entire
course of our socialist modernization drive, the new chairman of
the top legislature said.
</P>
<P>
"This requires that we continuously explore and advance in a
down-to-earth manner," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the work of previous national people's congresses, the
Ninth NPC will continue to improve socialist democracy and legal
system and better play its role as the highest organ of state
power, he said.
</P>
<P>
The speeches of Jiang Zemin and Li Peng won rapturous applauses
from the participants.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng then announced the conclusion of the Ninth NPC First
Session.
</P>
<P>
Vice-chairmen of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee and principal
Chinese leaders were present at the closing meeting.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Rejects Military Sentence to Ranariddh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's National United
Front (NUF) Wednesday rejected Cambodian Military Court's decision
to sentence Prince Norodom Ranariddh to 35 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh was sentenced to 35 years in prison on the
charges of illegally purchasing and transporting weapons and
conspiring with the outlawed Khmer Rouge to overthrow the
government, and he was ordered to pay more than 56 million
U.S. dollars in compensation.
</P>
<P>
The NUF, in a statement, urged the international community and
all friends of Cambodia to deny any validity to what it described
as politically-motivated trials.
</P>
<P>
All member parties and leaders of NUF pledged to stand together
in guaranteeing free, fair and credible elections, implying the
right and possibility for Prince Norodom Ranariddh to participate
on the same footing as other candidates, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
All member parties and leaders of the NUF would either
participate in the real elections, or withdraw from a mockery of
elections designed only to legitimize the illegal Hun Sen regime,
it added.
</P>
<P>
A royal pardon granted by King Norodom Sihanouk could wipe out
the prince's jail sentence, but Justice Minister Chem Sgnuon said
the pardon could not free the prince from liability for civil
damages payable to victims.
</P>
<P>
"The compensation still stands and has to be paid. If he
doesn't pay, or if he refuses to pay, he will be arrested and
sentenced in lieu of payment," the justice minister said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Impose Heavy Tariffs on Czech Commodities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is to levy 100
percent tariffs from April 1 on Czech commodities, the EU Council of
Ministers announced in Brussels Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The European Union will end the preferential status the Czech
Republic enjoyed with its exports, apparently in retaliation for
Prague's decision to impose quotas on EU apples.
</P>
<P>
The products to be affected are pork, poultry and fruit juice
and will cost the Czech Republic 160 million koruna (around five
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Czech government decided on February 1 to import 24,000 tons
of EU apples annually, with a 95 percent tariff on any excess.
</P>
<P>
Economic sources noted that the trade war began right after the
EU selected the Czech Republic at the end of last year to be among
the first to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
The dispute will make this year's negotiations very difficult, the
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Li Lanqing on China, WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua)-- Vice Premier Li Lanqing said here
today that the World Trade Organization (WTO) will find it hard to
play its due role as a world trade organization without the
participation of China, which is already the 10th largest trading
nation in the world.
</P>
<P>
When addressing a press conference held by the First Session of
the Ninth NPC, Li said, "important progress has been made in the
negotiations on this issue, and we hope that this matter would
be resolved very soon."
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's attitude towards the accession into the WTO
is a positive one, he recalled that China has been working for that
objective for 11 years, taken part in the whole process of the
Uruguay round and signed the final packaged agreement of the
Uruguay round.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for us to adopt the positive attitude on this issue
is because the world trade and economic cooperation needs a
unified set of rules," he said, "otherwise, that may give rise to
regional protectionism, or even trade conflicts or wars in the
interests of nobody."
</P>
<P>
The problem is that some members of the WTO think that China
needs the WTO more than the WTO needs China, this is not a correct
view, he said.
</P>
<P>
After joining the WTO, he added, China is prepared to undertake
the obligations for a developing country and will also enjoy the
rights correspondingly.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade and more, great progress and achievements
have been made in China's reform, although the country is still
not a member of the WTO," he said. As a matter of fact, he
stressed, the results of many of China's reforms have already gone
beyond the commitments it has made.
</P>
<P>
"But our reform must proceed in a step by step manner in
accordance with the preset objective and plan, and this has been
proved correct in our practice," Vice-Premier Li said.

<HEADLINE> CIS Will Remain, Says Russian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) was at a turn in the course of events, but will
remain and develop, Russian Minister of Cooperation with the CIS
Anatoly Adamishin said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Adamishin as making this remark
when commenting on Russian media speculation that the CIS was
nearing its end. He was speaking at a news conference held to
explain why the CIS summit scheduled on Friday was delayed.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the summit rescheduling to late April was mainly
because President Boris Yeltsin was ill. But there were other
reasons leading to the postponement, Adamishin said.
</P>
<P>
Adamishin refuted some Russian media opinion that Yeltsin's
illness prevented the CIS from divorcing or dividing up.
</P>
<P>
And it was time for all the CIS people to work together and
develop the CIS in accord with the people's will.
</P>
<P>
The CIS was out of step now because CIS countries had different
economic bases, Adamishin said. But so long as all the CIS
countries made the effort to bring about common economic bases,
the CIS countries would further develop, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the CIS summit in April would approve a
proposal by Russia and Ukraine to set up a free-trade zone within
the organization.

JAKARTA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign exchange
reserves, in the form of gross foreign assets, stand at 16.6
billion U.S. dollars as of March 13, 1998, Bank Indonesia, the
country's central bank, said.
</P>
<P>
The reserves are sufficient to cover four months of non-oil and

</P>
<P>
It said the reserves are 1.6 percent higher than those at the
end of February when they amounted to 16.333 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increase is the result of, among other things, taking
standby loans totaling 444 million during this period.
</P>
<P>
The release also said most of the gross foreign assets took the
form of liquid investment.
</P>
<P>
As of March 13, the statement said, Bank Indonesia has

<HEADLINE> Dhaka: More Trade Needed to Justify Transit Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Both Bangladesh and Nepal should
boost their trade volume to justify a transit route through India,
Finance Minster S. A. M. S. Kibria said.
</P>
<P>
"If the trade volume (between Bangladesh and Nepal) increases,
then India will presumably increase the transit facilities,"
Kibria told reporters Wednesday upon return from the 10th
Bangladesh-Nepal Joint Economic Commission (JEC) meeting, press
reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The transit would remain just a paper facility without the
movement of adequate goods of either bilateral or international
trade from Nepal, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal should import through Chittagong and Mongla ports to
increase the volume, which is very low at present, said the
finance minister.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day JEC meeting, the two sides discussed
trade, transit and investment and signed agreements for two joint
venture banks and one insurance company, he added.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries was estimated at 12 million
U.S. dollars in the 1996-97 fiscal year ending last June.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Continue Promoting Cross-Straits Ties: Zhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Beijing welcomes the visit of Koo
Chen-fu, chairman of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF), as well as any preparatory talks for his visit, said
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark on Premier Zhu Rongji's press conference
hosted by the First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress
here today.
</P>
<P>
When asked on a huge surplus Taiwan enjoys in the trade across
the straits, Premier Zhu voiced his confidence that cross-straits
relations will improve with a positive attitude shown by the
Taiwanese business community toward the trade issue.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan last year had a surplus of 17 billion US dollars in the
trade across the straits, the total volume of which reached 20
billion US dollars, Vice-Premier Qian acknowledged, "which is very
much in Taiwan's favor."
</P>
<P>
He urged the two sides to work together to expand the trade and
said that "the best way to do that is to establish direct postal,
air and shipping and trade links between the two sides of the
Taiwan straits," the vice-premier pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the premier reiterated President Jiang Zemin's
eight-point proposal for cross-straits relationship in early 1995
and cited it as the basic principle that guides the development of
the relationship.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States has ruled out
sending NATO forces into Kosovo, despite the "critical" situation
in the Yugoslavia's province.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said here on
Wednesday that the use of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
forces to end the conflict was not yet under consideration.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that Yugoslavia must bear the responsibility for
the situation and it was high time for Belgrade to initiate talks
with the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo if Yugoslavia was to retain
the province.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu said Tuesday that he
would do his best to make Talbott realize the imperative necessity
of strengthening the southern flank of the NATO.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a security problem in Europe, it is this one in
Kosovo," Plesu said. "It is logically, strategically and
militarily obvious that measures should be taken to consolidate
this flank. Consequently, our wish to integrate into NATO is of
objective necessity."
</P>
<P>
Plesu will hold talks on Thursday with Talbott who is in
Bucharest for a two-day visit on the last leg of his Balkan tour
which has taken him to Croatia, Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria.

<HEADLINE> Market in China Has Great Potential: New Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Newly-elected Premier Zhu Rongji
said here today that China's market is far from being saturated,
and all foreign investors are welcome to invest actively in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held just after the closing of
the First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress, Zhu
said China is the biggest potential market in the world, though
there exists the problem of duplicated construction and the
phenomenon of excessive supply over the demand in the manufacture
of a host of products.
</P>
<P>
China remains the biggest market in the world in many aspects,
he said, explaining that China's annual output of steel production
has exceeded 100 million tons, and yearly output of newly
increased program-controlled telephone exceeds 20 million lines,
the record number in the world.
</P>
<P>
What China needs now is to restructure its economy, he said,
noting that China intends to increase the pace of infrastructure
development in the future, and to explore and open up a vast
potential market in its rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"We also strive to step up housing construction, which is of
great concern to the people," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu Rongji On Reform Focuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua)-- Premier Zhu Rongji elaborated on
reform focuses this year at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The first focus, he said, is the grain circulation system.
Thanks to China's successful agricultural policy, the country has
gathered in good harvests for three consecutive years, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's grain reserves have reached a record high, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that even if China meets with serious natural
disasters for two years running, the country will not be short of
grain," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, because of the country's huge grain reserves, the
government's subsidies have also increased.
</P>
<P>
That is why reform is necessary for the country's grain
marketing system, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second focus is reform of the country's investment and
funding system. The existing system covers mainly administrative
examination and approval and cannot bring into play the role of
the market in resources allocation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has given rise to a lot of duplicate construction," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"So we must conduct a fundamental reform of this system to
bring it into conformity with international practices and in line
with a socialist market economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The third is reform of the housing system. Housing development
will be a new growth area in China's economic development, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
To make it a growth area, he said, "we must reform the current
policy of welfare housing allocation. We have to monetarize and
commercialize all housing so that all people can purchase their
own houses. And we expect to issue a new policy in the second half
of this year after many years of study and deliberation on the
issue. That is to say, according to the new policy, we will stop
all allocation of welfare housing. All housing will be
commercialized."
</P>
<P>
The fourth is reform of the medical care system. In the second
half of this year, a nationwide medical care reform program is
expected to come out to ensure basic medical care for people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The fifth is reform of the fiscal and taxation system. The
existing system is the result of reform in 1994 which has achieved
great successes; it surely has increased state revenue yearly by a
large margin, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the current problem facing us is that the amount of
charges collected is larger than taxes collected. Various local
government institutions have levied various additional charges and
fees which are not in keeping with the central government's
regulations, making people heavily burdened and causing complaints
from them.
</P>
<P>
"We must take vigorous steps to rectify and change the
situation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Outlines Three-Year Reform Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China's newly elected Premier Zhu
Rongji told a press conference here today that China will, in
three years' time, accomplish its reform targets in the key areas
of state-owned enterprises, financial sector and government
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the Chinese government has decided to enable most of
the large and medium-sized enterprises to be lifted out of the
current difficult situations and establish modern enterprise
systems in these enterprises in about three years.
</P>
<P>
"We must do this job well in three years time," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
At the national conference on the financial work held last
year, he recalled, a decision was adopted to make thorough reforms
in the country's financial system, according to which the central
bank of China must step up its supervision and regulation
function, and the commercial banks must operate independently.
</P>
<P>
"this objective should also be obtained before the end of this
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the program on the reorganization of the
institutions of the central government adopted by the current
session of the NPC, he noted, the number of ministries and
commissions under the State Council will be reduced from 40 to the
present 29, and the number of staff working in government
institutions will be cut by half in three years time.
</P>
<P>
Correspondingly, local governments at various levels
are also expected to achieve this reorganization target in three
years' time, he added.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that after the new government takes office, it
will first determine the size, posts and number of the new
government institutions, and it will take three years for the
redirected people to be assigned to their new jobs, but with
regard to the reorganization of the government institutions, that
will be accomplished within this year.

<HEADLINE> Three Years Enough for China's SOE Reform: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said here
today that three years are sufficient time for China to bring most
of its loss-making state-owned enterprises out of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we're absolutely able to attain the goal of
bringing most state-owned enterprises now suffering losses out of
their difficult situation in a period of three years, or by the
end of this century," said Zhu in his first press conference since
becoming China's fifth premier.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some foreign media have overestimated the
difficulties of China's state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"When we say that the percentage of loss-making state-owned
enterprises is more than 40 percent, we're referring to the number
of these enterprises. You know, there are 79,000 industrial
enterprises owned by the state in China, and some of them are very
small, with only several or dozens of people," Zhu explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that among the 500 extremely large state enterprises,
whose profits and taxes that are handed over to the state account
for 85 percent of the country's total, only 10 percent are
suffering from losses.
</P>
<P>
"That's why I say three years are enough for us to bring most
loss-making state-owned enterprises out of their difficult
situation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Though declining to comment on the operation of conglomerates
in the Republic of Korea, which has been seriously affected by a
recent financial crisis, Zhu said that China should draw upon the
experience and lessons of various countries concerning this crisis
and "is doing so".
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out the possibility that the Southeast Asian
financial crisis would have an impact on the paces of China's
reform of state-owned enterprises.

Aware of the arduousness of his new job, Zhu said, he worried
that he might fail the people, who have great expectations upon

COLOMBO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Security forces and police

following intelligence reports that special contingents of Tamil

<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China's new government "is not
considering any change" in its policy towards Russia, China's new
premier, Zhu Rongji, said here today.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning China's Russia policy, Zhu
said, "I've never thought of having any change in China's policy
towards Russia."
</P>
<P>
"The new government will pursue unswervingly the foreign policy
decided by President Jiang Zemin and (former) Premier Li Peng,"
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that when he was a vice-premier in the previous
cabinet, he was in charge of the country's economic work. "I
didn't attend to diplomatic work very much," he added.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, in response to a question about
whether or not a cabinet member who once studied in foreign
country A would be pro-A, said, "We just don't have the logic. I
think no matter where the members once studied, or what
experiences they have had, they are the cabinet of China."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Set Up Holding Firm to Manage State- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto has
approved plans to set up a holding company to manage and
restructure the country's sprawling state-owned companies, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The holding company would help strengthen state firms and then
privatize them, State Minister of Empowerment of State Enterprises
Tanri Abeng said here Wednesday after meeting President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"The target is to accelerate the privatization," local leading
newspapers Thursday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 164 state companies but 70 percent of them were
classified as financially unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
The minister acknowledged that the government had been slow in
restructuring state firms due to a lack of coordination and
dualism in overseeing them.
</P>
<P>
In a 50-point memorandum with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) signed on January 15, Soeharto has agreed to establish a
special framework to accelerate the privatization of state firms
through share flotation, negotiated enterprises sales or closures
by April.
</P>
<P>
The president also agreed that 12 enterprises would be prepared
for public listing during the first year of the program.
</P>
<P>
Tanri said Soeharto had also agreed to possible foreign
participation in state firms.
</P>
<P>
"The president instructed me those state companies that do not
perform well should either be sold or closed before they become a
burden to the state," the minister added.

<HEADLINE> IMF, Indonesia Agree to Review Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the Indonesian government have agreed to review the
latter's economic reform program backed by an IMF-led
multi-billion U.S dollar bailout package.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached here Wednesday during a meeting
between IMF Asia-Pacific director Hubert Neiss and Indonesia's
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industrial Affairs
Ginandjar Kartasasmita, a press release issued Wednesday night
said.
</P>
<P>
Neiss said after the one-hour meeting that the two sides agreed
to form five discussion groups to review the reform program.
</P>
<P>
He said the first group would focus on monetary policy and the
second group would concentrate on efforts to strengthen the
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
"Both are necessary to control inflation," Neiss noted.
</P>
<P>
The third group will be in charge of reviewing the 1998/99
budget (starting from April 1) and deciding how to fit necessary
subsidies into a feasible budgetary framework.
</P>
<P>
The fourth group will focus on structural reforms, "which in
our view are essential to pave the way for the resumption of
growth in the Indonesian economy once the crisis is over," Neiss
said.
</P>
<P>
The fifth group will discuss external corporate debt
restructuring initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Neiss held that "This is a very important element in creating
the necessary confidence to turn around the present crisis."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia signed a reform agreement with the IMF at the end of
October last year in exchange for a bailout of more than 40
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The initial 3 billion U.S. dollar tranche of balance-of-payment
support was paid over in December.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF withheld the second tranche worth 3 billion
dollars earlier this month because of the so-called lack of
reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
Neiss, who arrived here on Tuesday, said his team will report
back to the Fund's executive board in Washington, which is
scheduled to discuss the delayed disbursement of the aid at a
meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been badly hit by the monetary crisis since July
last year. The rupiah (national currency) was trading at about
10,200 to the dollar Tuesday afternoon, down more than 70 percent
from its level in July.

<P>
SAN JOSE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Trade ministers from 34 American
countries will sign a declaration at a preparatory meeting
Thursday, defining the objectives of the negotiations on the
creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
The document, known as "Declaration of San Jose", will be
submitted for approval to the second Summit of the Americas
scheduled for April 18 and 19 in Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory FTAA negotiations have been held since the first
Summit of Americas in December 1994, when presidents agreed to set
up the free trade zone in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Some countries suggested that the second summit marks the formal
start of the FTAA negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, governments have found that they still have to work
hard to reconcile the divergent interests of the rich U.S. economy
with those of the poorer Latin American and Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is the only American country being excluded from the FTAA
negotiations because of its ideological differences with the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Identifies Gene for Heart Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at a U.S. medical
school have identified a gene responsible for a heart disorder
which kills thousands of people every year.
</P>
<P>
Now the team from the Baylor College of Medicine hope the
discovery will lead to improved diagnosis and a cure for
idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF), a heart rhythm disorder.
</P>
<P>
The disorder increases the risk of episodes in which the heart
beats very rapidly and erratically, racing at between 200 and 400
beats per minute -- too fast to pump blood to the brain and the
rest of the body.
</P>
<P>
If the episode is not treated immediately, the patient will
lose consciousness and die. In many cases the first symptom is
sudden death.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that IVF causes between 15,000 and 36,000
sudden cardiac deaths each year in the United States and up to 30
percent of those who survive an attack will suffer again. The
disorder usually occurs in young or healthy people.
</P>
<P>
But the scientists led by Dr. Wang Qing believe the present
costly and time-consuming diagnosis of IVF can be replaced with a
simple and accurate DNA test for some patients.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wang and his colleagues say that the newly-identified gene
controls formation of a tube-like "ion channel" that lets sodium
ions move in and out of cardiac cells, regulating
heartbeats.
</P>
<P>
Faults in this gene can produce mutant ion channels with
altered or no functions, which could disrupt the heart's
electrical conduction and cause sudden death.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Iraq Inspections Could End in a Year: Butler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations arms
inspectors could complete their work within one year if Baghdad
honors the latest agreement on Iraq's arms inspections, U.N. chief
inspector Richard Butler said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"My perception is ...that we could get this done within a year
or so - maybe slightly less," Butler, chairman of the United
Nations Special Commission in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Butler said he was encouraged by a "new spirit" of cooperation
that Iraq has demonstrated since it signed the agreement on
U.N. weapons inspections with United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, on February 23.
</P>
<P>
The deal, reached after more than 10 hours of intense
negotiations between Annan and the Iraq leaders, made special
arrangements for the arms inspections of Iraq's eight
"presidential palaces."
</P>
<P>
Butler is scheduled to leave New York Thursday for meetings in
Vienna, Austria with senior officials of the International Atomic
Energy Agency on arrangements of joint inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He will travel early next week to Baghdad for talks with Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes smoothly, the U.N. inspectors, accompanied
by senior diplomats selected by Annan, will enter the
"presidential palaces" next week.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. resolutions, when the U.N. Special Commission
ends its work in Iraq and concludes that Iraq has destroyed all
weapons of mass destructions, the U.N. Security Council should
make a decision to lift the economic sanctions imposed on
Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990
</P>
<P>
Butler said he believed U.N. sanctions would end once his
commission reported Iraq compliance with the U.N. resolutions,
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there will be full support from the Council," he
said.

BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said here
today that the process of democratic election is different in
China and other countries, and varies in the orient and in the

</P>
<P>
With regard to the democratic election of governmental
officials, such as the state president or the premier of the State
Council, Zhu said, "I think that is the question involving the
political restructuring that should be done according to legal
procedures."
</P>
<P>
"It is hard for me at present to predict when such elections
will take place," he said at a press conference held in the Great
Hall of the People this morning.
</P>
<P>
Noting that democratic elections have been carried out in both
basic rural areas and enterprises, where villagers are able to
elect their village heads, and workers have their democratic
rights for appraisal of directors of enterprises, they have rights
for democratic examination on accounting, and for democratic
election of the heads of enterprises, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that "these are very good ways and good
directions for development."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, one US foundation once organized a mission to
investigate into village election in Chinese villages and they
issued an affirmative report on that, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Demand Key to Economic Growth: Zhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Stimulating domestic demand is
the key to accomplishing China's goal of keeping its GDP growth at
eight percent and inflation below three percent this year, said
newly elected Chinese premier Zhu Rongji here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark at a press conference that was held right
after the conclusion of the first session of the Ninth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Wtih macroeconomic controls and a relatively tight monetary and
fiscal policy implemented over the last few years, money supply in
the country has been well under control, and inflation kept at a
low level, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Given the conditions," he said, "it is possible for us
to channel more financial resources to stimulate domestic demand,
by instilling more fund into infrastructure such as highways,
railways, farmland and water conservancy construction, urban
construction, environment protection facilities, high and new
technology industries, and technical upgrading of industrial
enterprises."
</P>
<P>
He added that another important area will be housing
development, which is expected to be a new growth area for the
national economy.

<P>
COLOMBO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched a Young
Entrepreneur Program in an effort to steer education in the
country to new directions to face challenges of an open market
economy and the trend of globalization.
</P>
<P>
While inaugurating the program Wednesday at Isipathana College,
Education Minister Richard Pathirana said it will introduce
business and economic education in schools and groom children to
become successful entrepreneurs, according to the Daily News
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Initially as a pilot project 1,000 children from selected
schools will be involved in the program which will be modeled on
the lines of the world famous Junior Achievement program which
originated in the USA and is now operative in over 100 countries
involving three million children.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo program is promoted by the Federation of Chambers
of Commerce and Industry in collaboration with the Ministry of
Education and sponsored by the private sector here including the
Seylan Bank and Ceylinco Insurance.
</P>
<P>
The program will bring a welcome change in attitudes and the
active involvement of the private sector would reduce the gulf
that exists between economic activities and education, the
minister added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Committee Approves Campaign Finance Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A United States house
committee, under the leadership of the Republicans, approved
Wednesday a campaign finance bill to curtail union political
activities and ban large, loosely regulated donations to national
political parties.
</P>
<P>
The bill would also allow local election officials to try to
verify the citizenship of prospective voters and permit
individuals and political action committees to donate larger sums
to candidates than they can under current law.
</P>
<P>
With some provisions likely to provoke objections from
Democrats and Republicans, the bill, approved by the House
Oversight Committee, faces an uncertain fate when it reaches the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
Common Cause, a non-partisan group advocating overhaul of the
current campaign finance system, called the legislation a "cynical
sham laced with poison pill amendments designed to ensure that the
bill will not become law."
</P>
<P>
Representative Sam Gejdenson, a senior Democrat on the panel,
accused Republicans of drafting a bill designed to deny unions
their rights, intimidate Hispanic voters and increase the
political clout of the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
Representative Bill Thomas, a Republican and the committee
chairman, countered that Gejdenson and other Democrats were making
an unseemly "class warfare" argument.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the Senate debated a campaign finance piece
of legislation that included a ban on so-called "soft money" --
unlimited donations from individuals, corporations and labor
unions to political parties. But it died in a Republican-led
filibuster.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Threats to Impose Stricter Sanctions against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States would propose
to impose harsher sanctions on Yugoslavia if Belgrade does not
change its attitude toward the ethnic crisis in the turbulent
province of Kosovo, U.S. special envoy for the Balkans Robert
Gelbard claimed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If Belgrade fails to take steps to work out a political
settlement for Kosovo where the ethnic Albanian majority wants
independence, Washington would consider serious and biting
sanctions against the troubled nation, Gelbard said after a
meeting with Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in the
provincial capital Pristina.
</P>
<P>
As the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported, the six-nation
Contact Group formed by the United States, Britain, France,
Russia, Germany and Italy has urged Yugoslav leaders to start
negotiations with the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Albanians comprise 90 percent of the population of two million
in Kosovo, which Serbs rule with a large police and military
presence. Tensions heightened since February 28 when Serbian
police swept the unruly region in an effort to wipe out ethnic
Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard also expressed satisfaction that Rugova is setting up a
negotiation team to prepare for talks with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Washington is ready to help and involve in the negotiations if
both sides agree, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Fifteenth National Congress of the Party and the First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress have clarified to
the world that the Chinese people are progressing through their
own pioneering efforts and will add a new and magnificent chapter
to the 5,000-year history of Chinese civilization, and make
greater contributions to mankind.
</P>
<P>
We should hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory,
continue to emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, deepen
reform and open China wider to the outside world. We should shift
speedily to a new economic structure and a new mode of economic
growth, persistently implement the strategies of revitalizing the
nation through science and education and managing state affairs
according to law with a view to advancing the cause of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics into the next century in an
all-round way.
</P>
<P>
We should adhere to the principle of "one country, two
systems", maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong,
realize the successful return of Macao to the motherland and make
unremitting efforts to eventually settle the Taiwan question for
the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
We shall continue to uphold our independent foreign policy of
peace. We shall make contributions to the formation of a
multi-polar political structure in the world, the establishment of
a just and equitable new international order and to the promotion
of the lofty cause of world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The goals we have set are as follows: When the People's
Republic celebrates its centenary, the modernization program will
have been basically accomplished and China will have become a
prosperous, strong, democratic and culturally advanced socialist
country. At that time, our country will rank among the moderately
developed countries of the world, the Chinese people will have
achieved common prosperity on the basis of modernization and the
great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will have been realized.
</P>
<P>
These ambitions are in conformity with the aspirations of the
people of all nationalities in our country. As we strive to
develop, we are bound to encounter difficulties and risks. But
nothing of this kind can stop the great Chinese Communist Party
and the Chinese people from forging ahead. We must strive for and
will certainly be able to realize these ambitions. We shall
triumphantly reach the glorious shore of modernization.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Impose Stiffer Penalties on Dollar Hoarders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- In an attempt to stamp out
speculators in the local market, the Central Bank of the
Philippines will begin to impose stiffer penalties from March 28
on banks found violating prudential limits on daily foreign
exchange holdings.
</P>
<P>
In a circular published Thursday, the central bank said banks
found to have violated the net overbought or net oversold foreign
exchange limit will be slapped monetary and non-monetary penalties
starting from the first day of violation.
</P>
<P>
A bank has overbought when its foreign-exchange assets exceed
its foreign-exchange liabilities. It is considered oversold when
the reverse occurs.
</P>
<P>
At present, a bank is required to observe an overbought limit
of 5 percent of its "unimpaired" capital or 10 million dollars,
whichever is lower.
</P>
<P>
If a bank violates this limit, the previous rule imposes a fine
of 5,000 pesos (125 U.S. dollars) daily on the violator until it
brings back its overbought position to the allowable level.
</P>
<P>
Under the new circular, a bank found to have violated the
ceiling will be fined 10,000 pesos (250 dollars) on the first
banking day of violation.
</P>
<P>
On the second banking day that the violation has not been
"corrected", the bank will be slapped 20,000 pesos. This will
increase to 30,000 pesos on the third day onward that the bank
continues to violate the limit.
</P>
<P>
Banks which persist in violating the circular beyond the three
banking days will face possible suspension of their rediscounting
privilege with the central bank for at least 30 days.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Stresses Administration of Country according to Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee will, in the next five
years, continue to strengthen socialist democracy and legal system
and play its role still better as the highest organ of state power,
Ninth NPC Standing Committee Chairman Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing meeting of First Session of the Ninth
NPC, Li said the five-year term of the Ninth NPC will be an
important period, in which China will successfully accomplish the
goals of reform, opening-up and modernization drive set for this
century and lay a solid foundation for attaining the magnificent
objectives for the first decade of the next century.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), held in last September, explicitly announced that state
affairs should be managed according to law.
</P>
<P>
"Ruling the country by law is an important component of Deng
Xiaoping Theory and a basic strategy employed by the CPC in
leading the people in running the country, an important
requirement for developing a socialist market economy, an
important hallmark of social and cultural progress, and a vital
guarantee for maintaining long-term stability in the country," Li
Peng said.
</P>
<P>
He referred the laws to the Constitution and other laws and
regulations formulated on the basis of the Constitution and in
conformity with the realities of socialist China.
</P>
<P>
Managing China according to law and constantly improving the
socialist legal system is an arduous, complex and long-term
historical process, which will continue through the entire course
of our socialist modernization drive, the new chairman of the top
legislature said.
</P>
<P>
"This requires that we continuously explore and advance in a
down-to-earth manner," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
The essence of running the country according to law and
building a socialist country ruled by law is to guarantee that the
people are the masters of their country and that there is a legal
framework with which they can manage state affairs, Li said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution, all power in China belongs to
the people and the organs through which all people exercise state
power are the NPC and the local people's congresses at all
levels.
</P>
<P>
This system of people's congresses, the fundamental political
system of China, Li noted, is suited to China's conditions and
constitutes an effective organizational form through which the
people can administer state affairs.
</P>
<P>
"While promoting economic restructuring, we must continue to
carry out political restructuring. We should develop socialist
democracy and uphold and improve the system of people's congresses
so as to guarantee the people's right to be the masters of their
country," Li Peng said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Underlines Legislation, Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee will further strengthen
legislation and supervision over the implementation of the
Constitution and other relevant laws, Ninth NPC Standing Committee
Chairman Li Peng said today.
</P>
<P>
A socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics, which
embodies the position of the Party and the wishes of the people
and meets the needs of social and economic growth, is the
foundation in our efforts to administer the country according to
law, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth NPC and its Standing Committee should focus on the
legislation concerning the establishment and improvement of the
socialist market economy and the promotion of economic and social
growth, and they should improve the quality of the law-enacting
work. Legislation should conform to the Party's major policies for
reform and development, and laws covering economic matters should
be formulated and improved, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential to improve laws relating to socialist
democracy and administrative management systems as well as other
laws. During the term of the Ninth NPC, we should preliminarily
establish a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics,"
Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution is the fundamental law of the state and the
foundation for managing state affairs according to law, Li noted.
"No individuals or organizations have the power to overstep the
Constitution."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he noted, the Ninth NPC and its Standing
Committee should further strengthen supervision over the
implementation of the Constitution and other laws.
</P>
<P>
"We must correct the tendency to ignore laws, neither observing
nor enforcing them to the letter, the failure to punish
lawbreakers and the taking of bribes," said Li.
</P>
<P>
"We should strengthen supervision over law enforcement and the
administration of justice by government departments, and over the
work of the State Council, the Supreme People's Court and the
Supreme People's Procuratorate. We must ensure that administrative
departments perform their official duties according to law and
that judicial and procuratorial organs administer justice fairly,"
the new chairman said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all government departments and their personnel to take
the lead in enforcing laws strictly in order to safeguard the
authority of the Constitution and other laws.
</P>
<P>
"Attending to the self-improvement of the NPC and its Standing
Committee is an important factor in fully performing the duties
the Constitution has assigned to us and giving play to the role of
the organs of state power," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC should maintain closer ties with the people,
conscientiously accept their supervision, go deep among them to
apprehend their conditions, adequately reflect their will and pool
their wisdom, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should adhere to the principle of democratic centralism and
earnestly safeguard the democratic rights of the NPC deputies and
members of the Standing Committee," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the NPC deputies and members of its Standing
Committee make concerted efforts, fully rely on the people and the
leadership of the Party and work actively with all their hearts
and all their might, fresh progress will certainly be scored in
improving our socialist democracy and the legal system," Li Peng
said.

China Jewels and Ornaments Import and Export Corp. and Beijing
Ornaments Import and Export Company are the two leading
exporters. Their combined export volume of gold and silver
products were 41.52 million U.S. dollars and 3.66 million
U.S. dollars, respectively, accounting for 92 percent of the total.

after four consecutive annual increases.

<P>
PARIS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Automobile
Federation (FIA) reinstated on Wednesday the French Grand Prix to
the year's agenda after a dispute over television rights was
settled.
</P>
<P>
The dispute involved the TF1 network, which had the rights to
cover Formula One in France, and rival FR3, which obtained a
judgment allowing all TV channels to operate on the site.
</P>
<P>
The FIA said in a statement that it could reinstate the races
after the French parliament adopted a law clarifying rules for
television.
</P>
<P>
The race will be held June 28 at Magny-Cours, France, near the
Loire Valley.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the Federation was threatened by the anti-tobacco law
and withdrew the French race from the 1993 schedule.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Mette Jacobsen of Denmark
defeated Olympic champion Susie O'Neill by breaking the European
women's 200 meters butterfly short-course record at a World Cup
swimming meeting in Malmo on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen clocked two minutes 6.78 seconds to beat the mark of
2:07.04 set by Michelle Smith-de Bruin of Ireland in Cork on
August 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen, the 100m butterfly European champion and winner of
the event on Tuesday, beat Australia's O'Neill by just 0.08
seconds.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, who won the world 200m butterfly title in Perth in
January, recovered from the defeat with a fine win over world
short-course champion Claudia Poll in the 400 meters freestyle
later.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill won in 4:09.95, with Poll second in 4:10.18, well
outside the 4:00.03 world mark the Costa Rican set in Gothenburg
last April.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Gustavo Borges completed a golden double, winning the
50 meters freestyle in 22.29 seconds ahead of Dmitry Kalinovsky of
Belarus and Sweden's John Miranda.
</P>

On Tuesday, Borges won the 100 meters freestyle, the event in
which he took the silver medal at the 1992 Olympics and bronze at
the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Swedish world short-course champion Patrik Isaksson, winner of
the 50 and 200 meters breaststroke on Tuesday, made it a winning
treble in the 100 breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Katrin Meissner, winner of the 50 and 100 freestyle
in Sheffield, repeated the double in Malmo.
</P>
<P>
Her compatriot Ralf Braun won the men's 200 meters backstroke
in a personal best 1:56.26.

<HEADLINE> Former East German Swimming Coaches Face Doping Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A Berlin court Wednesday opened
the trial of four former East German swimming coaches and two
sports doctors who are accused of harming underage athletes by
giving them performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that the six accused, all worked for the
former SC Dynamo Berlin club, had caused irreversible bodily harm
on 19 female swimmers by giving them steroids between 1974 and
1989.
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Kielgass, who got a gold medal in January this year in
Perth as a member of the German 4x200 freestyle relay team, was
among the three still active swimmers named as victims by
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
It is the first trial in Germany dealing with the alleged
organized doping practice in former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
Defence lawyers, however, asked to stop the trial for reasons
including superannuated cases. One lawyer also complained about
lopsided handling of the German doping history because doping
research had also being allowed in former West Germany until the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Former East German leader Egon Kreuz described the trial on
Wednesday as "a revenge" against East Germany which was always
better than West Germany in sport.
</P>
<P>
Judges said they would decide next Wednesday whether to go on
with the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the defendants would face up to three years in
prison.

<HEADLINE> Competition among Beijing's Ice-Cream Makers Heating up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Although summer is still
two-to-three months away, ice-cream makers in Beijing have already
started vying for consumers.
</P>
<P>
With the constant rise in living standard and changes in eating
habits, the per capita annual consumption of ice cream in China
has grown to 2 liters. However, that figure is much lower than the
6 liters consumed by the average person in Europe.
</P>
<P>
While the variety and output of ice cream have been constantly
increased in China, the market competition is also getting more
intense, forcing companies to lower prices, increase varieties and
expand markets.
</P>
<P>
For example, Walls, the world's largest ice-cream producer, has
decided to lower the price of several of its products in China by
more than 20 percent. It will also introduce seven new products
this summer.
</P>
<P>
Other ice-cream makers have also announced additional
varieties, but have refused to disclose the names and prices.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, some companies have decided to open new markets in
China's remote areas.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure consumers will find more tasteful ice cream at lower
prices this summer," one market analyst said.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Aid to Help Candidate Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, Wednesday proposed making
one billion ECU (around 1.2 billion U.S. dollars) available each
year to help its applicants bring their transport networks and
environments up to EU standards.
</P>
<P>
The proposed aid will apply the EU's Structural Funds to its 10
eastern European applicants for the first time. It will finance up
to 85 percent of public investment in "projects that would have a
significant impact," the Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Monika Wulf-Mathies, EU commissioner for regional affairs, said
in the statement, "Preparing for enlargement is a huge task, in
particular for the accession states. The proposals will help
beneficiary countries to match the EU standards and at the same
time familiarize them with EU structural policy."
</P>
<P>
The EU is scheduled to open accession talks with Poland,
Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Cyprus at the
end of this March.
</P>
<P>
However, the other five applicants -- Slovakia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania -- are regarded by the EU as
prospective members which are moving at a slower pace.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said last year that the EU candidates had to
solve their severe environmental problems in order to become
formal members of the 15-nation wealthy club.
</P>
<P>
"A major effort will be required in helping these countries
meet standards set in EU legislation concerning the drinking water
supply, waste water management, air pollution and solid waste
treatment," said the EU executive.
</P>
<P>
The Commission believed that the proposed aid will help
"develop and upgrade the transport infrastructure in the applicant
countries...linking it to EU infrastructure -- an activity which
is essential to their strategies for economic development."
</P>
<P>
Projects costing at least five million ECU (around six million
dollars) will be covered by the aid, according to the Commission.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official: Elections in Hong Kong to be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said in London
on Wednesday the forthcoming legislative elections in Hong Kong
will surely be "democratic, open and fair."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang Guisheng, the Chinese senior representative of
the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, said that all necessary
preparations for the first legislative elections in Hong Kong
after the handover is under way by the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government.
</P>
<P>
"We have full confidence in that the forthcoming elections will
be a great success and the elections will be democratic, open and
fair," Wang said at a press conference at the end of the 42nd
meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group in London. It was
also the first such meeting in London after the handover of Hong
Kong on June 30, last year.
</P>
<P>
He said all the arrangements and organizations for the first
legislative elections, to be held on May 24, was the
responsibility of the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government takes the view that the forthcoming
elections is a matter fully within the limits of the high degree
of autonomy" and therefore "the central government will not send
officials or delegates to monitor the election."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese official stressed, since the elections
is a matter of China's internal affairs, "we do not want to see
any foreign states to make irresponsible remarks towards the
elections."
</P>
<P>
He said it has been more than eight months since Hong Kong
returned to China. The reality and facts of the past eight months
"have fully demonstrated the principles of one country two
systems, Hong Kong people running Hong Kong with high degree of
autonomy and all the provisions of the Basic Law have been fully
observed and implemented."
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong government headed by the Chief Executive Tong
Chi-hua has achieved very effective work over the past months. The
situation in Hong Kong following its return is good, Hong Kong now
enjoys social stability, its people feel confident and its economy
operates healthily," he said.

<HEADLINE> German Economy More Competitive Worldwide, Bundesbank Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- German economy has been regaining
its competitive edge in the world market over the past two years,
thanks mainly to a weaker currency and improved productivity, the
German central bank Bundesbank said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to an economic report issued by the Bundesbank,
Germany's exports rose to 887.5 billion marks (487.6 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1997, up 12.5 percent over the previous year,
outstripping the nine percent growth of the 1997 world trade.
</P>
<P>
The most dynamic expansion was achieved in central and eastern
Europe, where Germany's exports surged about 27 percent last year
to a volume amounting to one tenth of the total German exports.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable gains were also made in the United States and Latin
America, both boosting their imports of German goods by 26 percent
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany also saw its exports to other European Union
countries increased by about 8.5 percent and its exports to
Southeast Asia up by 9.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank attributed the export boom mainly to the
weakening German mark as well as German industries'
rationalization efforts to improve productivity and reduce
production costs.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, the real value of the German mark
had fallen by nearly 8.5 percent against the currencies of 18
industrialized countries, the Bundesbank said.

</P>
<P>
Addressing the official opening ceremony of the Cebit computer

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, London Hits New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
closed mixed Wednesday, with London hitting another record closing
high while Paris and Frankfurt retreating from Tuesday's
ground-breaking rally to end in the negative ground.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares extended Tuesday's
rally and ended the session at a new peak, up 68.7 points or 1.18
percent at 5,903.6, propelled by the new budget and other economic
data showing signs of easing inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that investors bought into the market and a large
surge saw the FTSE break through the 5,900 barrier.
</P>
<P>
Sterling's advance to fresh highs was largely ignored, as was
Wall Street's gentle opening drift.
</P>
<P>
However, in Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index closed weaker but above
the key 4,900-point level, down 26.96 points or 0.55 percent at
4,919.72.
</P>
<P>
Banking sector was among the biggest decliners, with Dresdner
Bank slipping 3.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Paris CAC-40 index also ended lower, down 9.11 points or
0.25 percent at 3,652.52. Dealers said that French stocks eased as
the market went through a bout of profit-taking following three
consecutive record closes.

<HEADLINE> EC President Unveils EU Vision for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, Wednesday unveiled the EU's
vision for the year 2000 and beyond, heralding a radical spending
shake-up to accommodate its eastern European applicants.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Santer, president of the Commission, called it a "vast
undertaking" at a press conference held Wednesday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
However, Mr. Santer indicated he expected resistance from some
member countries to the blueprint since the 15 EU member countries
would be required to give up some financial help as the poorer
eastern European applicants joined the bloc.
</P>
<P>
"Developing a vision is one thing, translating it into concrete
action is another," Santer told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and its regional
development funds will become the main targets of the EU executive
for the spending shake-up. The two account for three quarters of
the EU's annual budget of 85 billion ECU (some 93 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Commission has proposed that significant cuts be made in EU
subsidies for cereals, beef and dairy products and it has proposed
measures to target the regional funds to areas which will benefit
the most.
</P>
<P>
The EU is determined to keep spending around at the current
level of 0.46 percent of gross national product for the period
until 2006.
</P>
<P>
The issue which the EU is confronted with is that it has to
redistribute the funds in order to help accommodate the first wave
of prospective new members -- Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Slovenia,
the Czech Republic and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Santer expressed optimism about the Commission's proposal which
will be debated by ministers of the 15 EU member states, saying
that he hoped to see agreement by Spring 1999.
</P>
<P>
Monika Wulf-Mathies, the EU commissioner responsible for
regional affairs, said she wanted to make the so-called Structural
Funds, created in 1988 aiming at ironing out major discrepancies
in living standards in different parts of the EU, more efficient
and to tighten controls on how governments use the money.
</P>
<P>
The Commission Wednesday also unveiled reforms to the CAP in
the next century, tackling the biggest single budget item by
lessening the support of artificial prices and shifting the
financial burden from consumers to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
The EU has also on its agenda preparations for a new round of
global trade talks which are scheduled to start in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, EU's farm proposals have met criticism from ministers
and farmers, who have threatened cuts in incomes and certain areas
of production.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senator Warns NATO Expansion Isolates Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- As the U.S. Senate debated on
the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
before voting, a leading critic warned Wednesday that the move
could end up creating an "iron ring" isolating Russia.
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., suggested this ring, or arc, could
divide Europe just as surely as did the "Iron Curtain" of the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
Warner, a senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee,
urged the Senate to consider dangers of expanding NATO to Russia's
doorstep.
</P>
<P>
"Just as the Iron Curtain was dropped in the late 1940s,"
Warner said, admitting more and more former Soviet republics into
NATO would set up "an iron ring that circles much of Russia."
</P>
<P>
The admission of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to the
NATO has wide bipartisan support in the Senate, but battle lines
were forming over whether additional nations should be invited and
when.
</P>
<P>
A group of influential senators, led by Warner and Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., is proposing that the measure be
accompanied by a three-year freeze on additional membership after
accepting the three.
</P>
<P>
However, some senators believe that the condition would have
severe negative consequences, slamming the door in the face of
several other countries who are applying for membership.
</P>
<P>
The Senate began debating the NATO measure late Tuesday, and
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has been alternating debate
on it with discussion of an unrelated GOP bill for educational tax
breaks.

</P>
<P>
The message will center on fostering bilateral relations and on
the latest developments of situation in the Middle East region, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish ambassador said Cem will hold talks with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the Middle East peace process, the
situation in Iraq, Turkish-Israeli defense cooperation and a
military pact between Egypt and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries, including Egypt, have criticized Ankara for
strengthening military ties with the Jewish state and betraying
the interest of the Muslims. But Turkey maintained that its ties
with Israel would do no harm to a third part.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ankara is concerned about a military pact signed
last month between Egypt and Greece, a longtime rival of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Greece, both members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, have been marred by a number of
issues including territorial disputes and the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Annan Demands Coordination of Mideast Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief Kofi Annan on Wednesday
asked for all the concerned parties in the Middle East peace
process to coordinate closely with the U.S. government in a bid to
reactivate the long-stalled process.
</P>
<P>
"The concerned parties in a given conflict have to agree on
mediation, and then to agree on the mediator which is in this
case the American government," said Annan at a joint press
conference with Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
"When you have a mediator, it is important for all of the
concerned (parties) to offer all (their) support to it," said the
U.N. chief, who arrived here Tuesday evening on the first leg of
his regional tour aimed at helping revive the long-stalled Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I encourage the parties to work constructively, energetically
and speedily (with the U.S.) to have a solution before the
situation becomes worse," added the secretary general, whose tour
also includes Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that a progress would be achieved in this respect, and
I hope that would take place with all the efforts of the Americans
to get the parties to the table," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan denied that the U.N. wanted to be the second
meditator for the peace process, adding that "multiple mediators
complicate the matters and does not help solve them," adding that
he carried no initiative for the process in his current trip.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he had discussed with Hassan the possibility
of establishing a regional center to cope with all the problems in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed the need to have this sort of center, so
that leaders in the region can come together to discuss issues of
common concern," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"We also talked about bringing a group of thinkers together to
look at the problems of the region, and perhaps produce a
document that will be very useful for policy makers as they deal
with the crisis in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan paid his current visit as the peace negotiations on the
Palestinian-Israeli track have been deadlocked for a year due to
the Israeli government's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Over the past months, the U.S. government made attempts to
mediate, but no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Amid arising tension in the region, Israel is widely
criticized for sticking to its own ideas and not yielding to
U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
Annan has left here for Egypt to continue his tour of the
region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve: U.S. Economic Growth Still Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Despite certain impact by the
current Asian crisis, the nation-wide economic growth in all
regions remains strong while inflation seems "eerily calm," the
Federal Reserve said reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its "Beige Book" survey of regional economic conditions
issued here today, the Fed noted that "industrial activity is on
the rise in most parts of the country, with orders and production
up. Most districts, though, are experiencing a decline in exports
to Asia,"
</P>
<P>
U.S. consumers continue to spend strongly on everything except
cars, said the report, which is based on statistics collected
through March 9.
</P>
<P>
"Retail sales are generally up in most districts, exceeding
retailers expectations in many of them," the report said.
However, "Auto sales are generally down, although demand for
pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles remains high."
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned on some
occasions later last year that labor shortages in the United
States eventually could create increased consumer price inflation.
However, so far though, that doesn't seem to be happening, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
"The demand for labor remains strong with nearly all districts
reporting shortages of workers at the entry level and in certain
skilled categories," it said. Instead, "widespread labor market
tightness appears to have increased the degree of wage pressures."
</P>
<P>
"Pressures on product prices remain eerily calm," it noted.
"Domestic competition, productivity gains and the Asian situation
help to constrain production costs."
</P>
<P>
"The Beige Book," named after the color of its cover, was
prepared for the March 31 meeting of the Fed's policy-making
Federal Open Market Committee. The panel sets short-term interest
rates through changes in the overnight rate on loans between
banks.

<HEADLINE> Study: Children Should Learn Reading Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Children should start to learn
reading in their preschool period to avoid reading problems in
school, said a report by a U.S. government advisory panel
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report by the National Research Council said that attention
should be paid to abilities that can be developed in preschool.
Children should learn to read first either English or their native
language.
</P>
<P>
The report by a 17-member panel of teachers, education
professors, psychologists and classroom teachers emphasized
children's learning to manipulate sounds and understand the
relationships between letters and sounds, the cornerstone of
phonics-based instruction.
</P>
<P>
But it also stressed frequent reading, aloud or silently, and a
close attention to meaning, an element of whole language
instruction. Children should also learn to read fluently, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended teachers and parents put focus on the
period between birth and kindergarten, because important
developments for the acquisition of literacy occur from birth
onward.
</P>
<P>
The report said reading specialists are important, and it urged
that teachers be trained in the relationship between language and
reading.
</P>
<P>
Between 25 percent and 40 percent of children do not read well
enough, quickly enough or easily enough to do well in middle
school or high school, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Education and the Department of Health and
Human Services commissioned the study in a purpose to find how
reading difficulties can be prevented.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has announced his plan to hire
100,000 new teachers and volunteer tutors to help children
overcome reading problems in schools.
