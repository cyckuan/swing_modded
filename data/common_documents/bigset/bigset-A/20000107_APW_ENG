    PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- With its message on yard signs, book covers and the
walls of courthouses and public classrooms, a Ten Commandments movement is
pushing forward around the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Like anti-abortion legislation earlier, the right to display the
commandments has become a high-priority issue for Christian groups, says Frank
Flinn, an adjunct professor of religious studies at Washington University in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents argue that the framework for America's system of laws is based on
the 10 rules that the biblical book of Exodus says God gave to Moses. The rules
should be displayed in schools, they say, insisting that it is legal if the
display is paid for with private funds.
</P>
<P>
	   The movement stems from a "heartcry," says Janet Parshall, spokeswoman for
Family Research Council, a Christian lobby group in Washington, D.C., which has
distributed 750,000 Ten Commandments book covers. She says she does not know if
the shooters at Columbine High School in Colorado would have been deterred by
seeing the Ten Commandments, "but I'm willing to risk the try."
</P>
<P>
	   The American Civil Liberties Union disagrees.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kentucky, the ACLU filed suit Nov. 18 against McCreary and Pulaski
counties and the Harlan County schools after the commandments were publicly
displayed. The ACLU cites a 1980 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the posting of
the commandments in schools amounted to an unconstitutional government promotion
of religion, which is forbidden by the First Amendment. The suits are pending.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, in the court of public opinion, Christian groups cannot go wrong by
promoting the Ten Commandments, says Flinn, a First Amendment expert. "The
opposition is immediately put in a weak position. If I tell you, 'No, the Ten
Commandments don't belong in a courtroom or in a classroom,' then automatically
I look like I'm for murder and fornication and theft."
</P>
<P>
	   Roy Moore, an Alabama circuit judge who refused to take down the
commandments posted in his courtroom in 1995, has spoken at Christian rallies
across the country. He encourages school boards to post the Ten Commandments
even if it means a costly lawsuit for the district.
</P>
<P>
	   In Altoona, Pa., religious leaders and school officials reached an agreement
in August allowing an after-school Ten Commandments club and a new comparative
course in religions.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the Val Verde Board of Education in California voted to reverse
its policy of displaying the Ten Commandments in district offices after the ACLU
threatened to sue.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the three Kentucky counties, Parshall says, "They're the ones that
are currently in the barrel of the gun of the ACLU if you will, but they really
are not a whole lot different than a whole lot of other places across the
country."
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Pilon, vice president of legal affairs at Cato Institute, a
libertarian think tank, says posting the Ten Commandments in public classrooms
and courthouses amounts to tyranny.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nothing in our constitution prohibits people from expressing and supporting
their beliefs as vigorously as they want, provided they do it in the private
sector," Pilon says. "What these people seem to want is public sanction for
their views and that precisely is what the Constitution prohibits in the
establishment clause of the First Amendment."
</P>
<P>
	   Flinn says the postings are legal only if other religions are given the same
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
	   "My rule is one in, all in," Flinn says.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ten Commandments movement is catching on because people sense the
country has deteriorated since court decisions of the 1960s took prayer out of
public schools, says Don Swarthout, a Denver minister who helped plan a Corbin,
Ky., rally for the commandments and who is changing his ministry to focus more
on them.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, he says he will not be pushing schools to post the commandments.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the Ten Commandments were not in the schools we could still have good
moral values if people tried to live their life by the Ten Commandments,"
Swarthout says. "The fact that they hang in the school doesn't immediately fix
our schools."
</P>
<P>
	   The movement is influencing merchandise sales at Christian bookstores.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Ratliff, owner of Lighthouse Christian Bookstore in Pikeville, says he
sold four to five times more Ten Commandments merchandise, such as plaques and
yards signs, in 1999 than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bible does not change, but what is requested by customers does, Ratliff
says.
</P>
<P>
	   "There will come a day," he says, "where customers are looking for something
else to grab onto."

Protests Continue Over Cuban Boy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Hundreds of Cuban-Americans blocked intersections and cut off
access to the Port of Miami on Thursday to protest the U.S. government's
decision to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba. Police
arrested about 100 people, including two prominent Cuban exile leaders, for
refusing to disperse. Roaming groups of protesters disrupted traffic on major
streets during evening rush hour, angering drivers trying to escape the
gridlock. The situation was expected to continue Friday. Brothers to the Rescue,
a Miami-based exile group that searches the waters off Florida for Cubans trying
to make it to the United States, called for supporters to drive 15 mph Friday
throughout Miami-Dade County.

Bush Pledges Tax Cuts If Elected
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- An aggressive George W. Bush pledged in campaign debate
Thursday night to push for "tax cuts, so help me God" if elected to the White
House and accused presidential rival John McCain of seeking campaign finance
changes that would hurt the conservative cause. McCain used the forum to
strongly defend his actions on behalf of a political donor who was seeking
action from the Federal Communications Commission. The tax cut pledge uttered by
Bush, the national GOP front-runner, was all-but-unequivocal: "If there's a
recession it's important to cut taxes to make sure the economy grows. ... It's
also important to cut the taxes where there's times of plenty. ... It's
important to cut the taxes to make sure Washington, D.C., does not spend the
surplus."

Mideast peace talks Thursday, meeting with Israel's prime minister and the
Syrian foreign minister after face-to-face negotiations between the two sides
ground to a halt. The U.S. aim is a treaty that would exchange the Golan
Heights, a strategic border territory Israel has held for more than three
decades, for diplomatic and economic relations with Syria. Clinton met
separately for an hour each with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.

Panic Spreads Through Ivory Coast

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Rumors of gunfire spread panic through Ivory
Coast's commercial capital Thursday, less than two weeks after a former army
chief seized power in a largely bloodless coup. Stores closed down, and
residents fled the central business district as rumors spread of gunshots in
several in other areas. By late afternoon, however, calm had been restored.
Western diplomats and military officials confirmed there were gunshots Wednesday
night at one of the main military bases. It was unclear, though, what had
provoked the shooting, or if there was more gunfire Thursday.

Accounting Firm Violations Found
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A review led by an independent consultant has found
thousands of violations by accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and many
of its partners of rules requiring accountants to remain independent from
companies they audit. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which made the
consultant's review public Thursday, said its investigation of New York-based
PricewaterhouseCoopers is continuing. A year ago, the firm agreed in a
settlement to conduct the review after the SEC alleged that some of the
accountants owned stock in corporations they audited.

U.S. District Judge Denise Page Hood to throw out federal Bankruptcy Judge
Arthur Spector's Dec. 21 ruling that allows women who voted against the $3.2
billion settlement to sue Dow Corning's corporate parents. The settlement had
barred further lawsuits against Dow Chemical and Corning Corp. over silicone

<HEADLINE> Clinton Aims To Combat Hackers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stepping up vigilance against cyber-terrorism, President
Clinton plans to announce a new initiative Friday to protect federal computers
from infiltrators.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has frequently expressed concern about the emerging threat that
hackers, thieves and other governments pose to the nation's high-tech
infrastructure. A top adviser Thursday included cyber-terrorism near the top of
a list of threats facing America in the next century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there's a whole new realm of threat we're going to be dealing
with,'' National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said in response to a questions
after a National Press Club speech. ``The ability to take weapons of mass
destruction across national borders with relative ease; the ability to attack
our computers that run our infrastructure through cyber-terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Clinton's
budget request for 2001 would seek additional funds for monitoring and
protecting government computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now that we're past Y2K, we need to continue to insulate and secure our
nation's computers,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
	   The official did not have any specific dollar figures, but USA Today
reported in Friday's issue that the plan includes $2 billion to make the
government's computer systems less vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The new initiative builds on steps the administration announced last year.
It would seek to develop new technologies, increase public and private
cooperation against computer sabotage, improve training for government agents
and boost protection of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's creating a number of programs to train, detect and strengthen our
ability to deal with cyber-terrorists,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last July, the administration announced that it was creating a
government-wide security network to protect against hackers. The plan included
an elaborate network of electronic obstacles, monitors and analyzers to watch
for suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
	   The first 500 intrusion monitors were to be installed on non-military
government computers early this year, and the full system was to be computed by
May 2003.

<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Steve Sullivan and Boris Mironov each had a goal and two
assists as the Chicago Blackhawks defeated the Calgary Flames 5-2 Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan McCabe, Tony Amonte and Alex Zhamnov also scored for the Blackhawks,
who won at home for only the fifth time in 20 games. Doug Gilmour added three
assists for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Jocelyn Thibault made 33 saves for Chicago, which denied Calgary a chance to
reach the .500 mark for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Valeri Bure and Derek Morris scored for Calgary, which dropped to 9-5-3 in
their last 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Fred Brathwaite started in goal for Calgary, but was replaced by
Jean-Sebastien Giguere at 7:11 of the second period after allowing four goals on
12 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Bure gave Calgary a 1-0 lead with a power-play goal from the left circle at
5:29 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
	   McCabe tied it at 9:42, and a power-play goal by Mironov with 35.5 seconds
left in the period gave Chicago a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Mironov's goal, scored when he pinched in from the point and one-timed
Sullivan's feed, was his his first in 23 games this season. Mironov began the
season with a 16-game holdout.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan's deflection during a 4-on-4 45 seconds into the second period made
it 3-1. Amonte made it 4-1 -- and sent Brathwaite to the bench -- at 7:11 by
completing a 2-on-1 break with Doug Gilmour.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhamnov made it 5-1 with a power-play goal from the right circle at 5:35 of
the third. Morris' power-play goal with 3:30 left completed the scoring.

<HEADLINE> Cox Cable Reaches Deal With Fox  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 400,000 Cox Communications cable customers will
once again be able to see Fox programming, including the National Football
League playoffs, because of a new transmission agreement reached Thursday, the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox had refused to let several Cox Communications systems in northern
Virginia, Cleveland, Dallas and Houston retransmit its programming after Cox
declined to add two other Fox networks as it upgrades to digital systems that
carry more channels.
</P>
<P>
	   At midnight on New Year's Eve, Cox subscribers could no longer receive Fox
over their cable connections, and those wanting the channel had to go back to
getting it over the air by antenna.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Fox and Cox said they had "agreed in principle" to restoring
Fox local and national programming.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies said they wouldn't disclose any terms of the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Negotiator Blames Union  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Richie Phillips' Major League Umpires Association completed
its appeal of the National Labor Relations Board election it lost, and the
hearing officer hopes to make a decision later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   On the final day of the three-day hearing, baseball lawyer Rob Manfred
blamed the MLUA for cutting short a Dec. 7 meeting to discuss the plight of 22
umpires who were let go Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Manfred said he was surprised MLUA lawyer Pat Campbell wouldn't discuss the
22 before bargaining on a new contract for all umpires.
</P>
<P>
	   "He believed if we could reach a global resolution, he could get all the
umpires back into a group," Manfred said.
</P>
<P>
	   Manfred said he was concerned the MLUA had just lost a vote 57-35 to a group
of insurgent umpires who had formed their own union and he hoped he could
receive assurances that umpires would support a deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, he said, baseball would be left "holding the bag" because it
would be forced to begin negotiating with the victorious Major League Umpires
Independent Organizing Committee as soon as the vote was certified.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearing office Dale L. Leach III told the sides to submit briefs by Jan. 13
and said he expects to rule within a week after that whether to uphold the
election or call for a new vote. The losing side could appeal to the five-man
NLRB in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the hearing, Campbell said Manfred was not accurate when he
described how the Philadelphia meeting ended. He said it actually concluded
abruptly because Manfred said he had to catch a train back to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   During his testimony, Manfred insisted that no one from baseball had ever
negotiated on behalf of umpires with the insurgent MLUIOC or anyone besides
Phillips' MLUA.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he had negotiated on Nov. 15 with Campbell and others about a new
contract for umpires, discussing subjects such as tenure, five-man crews and
whether AL and NL umps could be combined on crews.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were no formal proposals made and, frankly, we were a little
surprised about that," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   During cross examination, Manfred said baseball had not prepared a formal
proposal yet for umpires because it had not received a formal proposal from
umpires on what they want.

<HEADLINE> Senators' Prospal Isn't Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Ottawa Senators center Vaclav Prospal escaped suspension
Thursday for his ethnic slur against Montreal Canadiens defenseman Patrice
Brisebois, but must attend a diversity-training session.
</P>
<P>
	   Prospal, who called Brisebois a "frog" -- punctuated by an obscenity -- in a
Dec. 27 game, was told to come to New York to meet with NHL-appointed diversity
trainer Zach Minor for further education and discussion regarding
diversity-related issues.
</P>
<P>
	   The league deemed Prospal's public apology to French-Canadians as
sufficient, especially because it was accepted by the Canadiens and Brisebois.
</P>
<P>
	   "The league and the NHL Players' Association view the matter closed as soon
as the supplemental diversity training session has taken place," an NHL
statement read. "While all NHL players are staunch competitors, the heat of
battle does not justify the type of behavior displayed in this instance.
</P>
<P>
	   "The league, in conjunction with the NHL Players' Association, has gone to
great lengths to educate and sensitize all NHL personnel to the diversities that
exist in our league, as well as to the importance of respecting and appreciating
those diversities."
</P>
<P>
	   The league said Prospal has acknowledged that his on-ice comments were
inappropriate and has been told that any further incident of the same or similar
nature will result in immediate disciplinary measures.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really don't have much to say," Prospal said after Ottawa's 5-2 victory
over Phoenix on Thursday night. "I'll go to the meeting. I don't have any
problem with that. You can always learn."
</P>
<P>
	   The NHL has on three occasions suspended players for making racist remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington's Chris Simon was suspended for three games in 1997 for uttering
a slur at Edmonton's Mike Grier, the Capitals' Craig Berube got one game for a
similar offense against the Florida Panthers' Peter Worrell, and San Jose's
Bryan Marchment also got one for a slur against Donald Bashear of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
	   Grier, Worrell and Bashear are black.
</P>
<P>
	   Prospal, who is from the Czech Republic, said he wasn't aware saying "frog"
could be taken as racist. His apology Tuesday was made to French-Canadians in
general.
</P>
<P>
	   The NHL recently had consultant Minor visit the league's 28 clubs to deliver
a talk and screen a video on racism and other forms of intolerance.

<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- Deon Luton scored 26 points and Washington outscored UCLA
7-2 over the final 1:20 to a 63-62 victory over the 24th-ranked Bruins on
Thursday night in the Pac-10 opener for both teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Luton hit a 3-pointer with 37 seconds left to give the Huskies (6-7) a 61-60
lead. He added two free throws with 11 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   UCLA (8-3) had a chance to tie, but the officials ruled that Jason Kapono's
toes were on the 3-point line as he hit a jumper at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Luton scored 14 of the Huskies' final 20 points and was 10-of-16 from the
field, including 3-of-6 from 3-point range. Will Perkins had 10 rebounds for the
Huskies, who have won three of the last four meetings with UCLA.
</P>
<P>
	   Kapono led the Bruins with 19 points, while Jerome Moiso added 13. Dan
Gadzuric pulled down 13 rebounds for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
	   After Washington's 9-2 run over the first four minutes of the second half
gave it a 36-33 lead, nobody led by more than three points until Gadzuric's
layup put UCLA ahead 60-56 with 1:43 left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins opened the game with a 9-0 run as the Huskies missed their first
seven shots. Washington ended the drought when Chris Walcott came off the bench
and immediately connected on a three-point play with 16:11 left in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
	   Walcott did not start, and was not expected to play because of a sprained
left knee.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington tied the game at 11 after holding UCLA without a field goal for
five minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskies took their first lead, 20-18, on Marlon Shelton's layup with
5:10 remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins regained the lead on consecutive 3-pointers by Kapono and led
31-27 at halftime.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- A Hawaiian princess' multibillion-dollar estate has hired a
college administrator to run Kamehameha Schools, one of the islands' most
powerful private institutions that has been in turmoil the last several years.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamilton McCubbin, a former dean of the University of Wisconsin-Madison's
School of Human Ecology, was named chief executive officer, the schools
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The hiring of a chief executive was one condition of a $9 million settlement
with the Internal Revenue Service allowing the $6 billion educational trust to
keep its tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
	   That status was jeopardized after allegations arose against the trustees in
1997 of mismangement, self-dealing and excessive pay.
</P>
<P>
	   Five trustees resigned their $1 million-a-year posts last year after a state
judge temporarily removed them, and five interim trustees have run the estate
since May.
</P>
<P>
	   McCubbin is a 1959 graduate of Kamehameha Schools, established by the 1884
will of Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop for the education of native Hawaiian
children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Dr. McCubbin brings to us a wealth of experience and knowledge in the area
of early education and child development,'' said Robert Kihune, chairman of the
interim board of trustees.

their possible involvement in Wednesday's bombing outside the prime minister's
office, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they had also arrested two Tamil Tiger rebels early Friday
carrying explosives. The rebels confessed that they intended to set off the
bombs at bus stations in the Buddhist temple town of Kandy, where Sri Lanka's
majority Sinhalese Buddhist believe a tooth relic of Buddha is kept, police
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two rebels were arrested in the eastern Ampara district early Friday,
said Assistant Police Superintendent H.R. Senaviratne.
</P>
<P>
	   The sweep began Thursday, with 200 people arrested, and continued Friday
with 500 more detentions.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities planned to question the suspects, almost all from the island's
Tamil minority, about possible links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
a separatist group blamed for engineering three suicide attacks in the past
three weeks. The three attacks killed 50 people.
</P>
<P>
	   About 4,500 armed policemen fanned out across Colombo on Thursday and Friday
to look for rebels or their sympathizers, a top police official said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing national security concerns, police prohibited people from leaving or
entering Colombo, Dehiwalla or Mount Lavinia until Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombo was similarly sealed off about two years ago to allow door-to-door
searches for Tamil guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   The streets of Colombo were empty Friday, as residents huddled at home in
front of televisions to see what was happening in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency rule allows the armed forces to search houses or detain anyone on
suspicion of involvement with the rebels. It has been in force for more than two
years across Sri Lanka, but Parliament must reapprove it every month.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's suicide bomber, who died in the blast, was traced to a village
in eastern Batticaloa district, state-run Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corp. radio
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bomber blew herself up as police tried to question her outside the
office of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who was not in the building at
the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the bomber was a member of the Black Tigers, the suicide squad
of the Tamil Tigers. The police arrested her parents and a sister, but did not
disclose the charges, the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't clear whether the bomber wanted to attack the 82-year-old prime
minister, who works mostly from home because of poor health.
</P>
<P>
	   Three weeks ago, a woman bomber blew herself up at an election rally for
President Chandrika Kumaratunga -- who is the prime minister's daughter.
Kumaratunga suffered a serious eye injury.
</P>
<P>
	   The guerrillas have been fighting security forces for 17 years to carve a
homeland in Eelam, where they say Sri Lanka's 3.2 million minority Tamils will
not be discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sinhalese comprise 14 million of the country's 18.6 million people.

<HEADLINE> Troops Fan Across Eastern Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
   By IRWAN FIRDAUS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of soldiers fanned out Thursday across a
group of islands in eastern Indonesia to try to quell violence between Muslims
and Christians that has claimed hundreds of lives in the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday in Jakarta, an estimated 80,000 Muslim demonstrators demanded that
the government end the bloodshed, threatening to declare a holy war in defense
of Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally, held after morning prayers at National Monument Square across the
street from the presidential palace, followed a series of smaller protests by
Muslims in the capital in recent days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We give (President Abdurrahman Wahid) one month to stop the killings of
Muslims,'' said Husin Ali Al Habsy, one of the speakers at the rally.
``Otherwise, we are ready to send at least 10,000 people there to defend the
Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
	   Max Tamaela, military chief of Maluku province, said Thursday that the army
had re-established control of Seram Island, where fighting earlier this week
killed 17 people.
</P>
<P>
	   But the situation remained uncertain on Halmahera Island, where reports said
hundreds of people may have died in fighting Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of people fleeing the violence continued to pour into the North
Maluku provincial capital of Ternate, about 1,600 miles east of Jakarta. Many
said the situation in Halmahera was out of control.
</P>
<P>
	   Tamaela said the military had sent in extra troops to try to stop the
violence on Halmahera, but he said he did not know if clashes had ended.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've deployed troops to the outlying islands,'' Tamaela said. ``But it's
hard to tell what is really going on.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials estimate the death toll stands at about 500 for the past 10 days,
but unconfirmed reports put it much higher.
</P>
<P>
	   In Maluku's provincial capital of Ambon, the local military commander, Col.
Irwan Kusnadi, said his troops were preparing to secure the town before the
start Saturday of Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim holiday that celebrates the end of the
holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've confiscated thousands of illegal weapons in the past couple of
days,'' he said. ``We want to make sure the city is safe for the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Indonesia's navy has imposed a blockade around the islands in an
attempt to stop militia members from traveling between islands.
</P>
<P>
	   By the government's count, 1,300 people have died in Maluku and North Maluku
-- known as the Spice Islands during Dutch colonial rule -- since religious
fighting erupted a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   An influx of Muslims from Indonesia's other islands over the past two
decades has changed the religious makeup of the provinces, where the Christians
used to have a small majority.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Protest Cuba Boy Decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Hundreds of Cuban-Americans chanting ``Liberty! Liberty!''
blocked intersections and cut off access to the Port of Miami on Thursday to
protest the U.S. government's decision to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested at least 135 people, including two prominent Cuban exile
leaders, for refusing to disperse.
</P>
<P>
	   Roaming groups of protesters disrupted traffic on major streets during the
evening rush hour, angering drivers trying to escape the gridlock. More than 50
officers in riot gear used tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters from one
intersection.
</P>
<P>
	   A motorist plowed through a group of protesters blocking an intersection
near Miami International Airport, knocking a man and a woman to the ground.
Their conditions were not immediately known. One police officer working crowd
control suffered broken bones when he was hit by a motorist trying to get home.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation was expected to continue Friday. Brothers to the Rescue, a
Miami-based exile group that searches the waters off Florida for Cubans trying
to make it to the United States, called for supporters to drive 15 mph Friday
throughout Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno essentially ruled out any chance
she will reverse Wednesday's decision by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to send the boy back to the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Jeb Bush wrote to President Clinton on Thursday seeking a reversal of
the INS decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fidel Castro has made Elian a poster child for his communist dictatorship,
and has turned what should be a determination as to the child's best interest
into a way to advance his own political tyranny,'' Bush wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past six weeks, Elian has been the subject of protests in Florida
and Cuba -- and in the middle of an international debate over where he belongs.
Fidel Castro kept up the pressure with another government-orchestrated
demonstration Thursday in Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after
his mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned while trying to reach
Florida by boat. He has been living in Miami with his paternal great-uncle and
great-aunt.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, whose whereabouts were kept secret after Wednesday's decision,
arrived back at his relatives' home Thursday afternoon. His great-uncle hoisted
Elian on his shoulders and the boy smiled and waved to cheering supporters
outside the house.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the family said Elian's relatives told him he may be
returning to Cuba and he said he did not want to go. Elian's father called the
boy from Cuba Thursday but it wasn't known what they talked about.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the boy's American relatives asked Reno to reverse the decision
and said they will announce on Friday their plans for legal action.
</P>
<P>
	   But Reno said she had consulted with INS Commissioner Doris Meissner and
agreed with the decision. ``Based on all the information we have to date, I see
no basis for reversing,'' Reno said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS said the boy must be returned to Cuba by Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, several hundred protesters gathered outside a downtown federal
building, pushed back police barricades and marched several blocks to the Port
of Miami, where most of the arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 officers in riot gear guarded the port's entrance in the shadow of
Freedom Tower, a former customs building where many Cubans entered the United
States in the 1960s. About 780,000 Cuban-Americans live in Miami-Dade County,
accounting for 35 percent of its 2.1 million residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators shouted ``Clinton! Coward! Miami hates you!'' They carried
posters in English and Spanish and waved U.S. and Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm defending my rights because where the rights of one person end, the
rights of another begin,'' said Meri Pino, 70, who refused to move from the port
entry.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested people who sat on the pavement and others who crossed police
lines. Those arrested included Cuban exile leaders Ramon Sanchez, head of the
Democracy Movement, and Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a typical custody battle between parents in two different
states of the United States,'' Basulto said after he and Sanchez were released
from jail Thursday night. ``This is a country against a family.''
</P>
<P>
	   The headquarters of Royal Caribbean International, a leading cruise line, is
on port property, and the demonstration kept employees from leaving for several
hours. No major cruise ships were in port Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, small groups of protesters intermittently blocked intersections.
Gov. Jeb Bush lifted tolls on highways near protests to relieve rush-hour
congestion.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 10 people carrying a large Cuban flag sat down in the middle of a
main downtown street, crippling traffic during a downpour. Motorists honked
their horns in irritation or support.
</P>
<P>
	   During the morning rush-hour, two dump trucks and a pickup truck slowed all
three lanes of downtown-bound traffic to about 20 mph on the major east-west
route in Miami. The Florida Highway Patrol issued several citations and
threatened to arrest drivers slowing traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm Haitian and they send all the Haitians back,'' motorist Fritz Rene,
31, said at one blocked intersection as he was trying to get to work. ``Whenever
anything happens to the Cubans, they go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez said she supported the demonstrators but
asked them to remain peaceful.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of Cubans here who have suffered and they are willing to
stop this because the laws here are not being fair,'' the boy's cousin said
outside her home. ``They haven't given us the opportunity to speak on behalf of
him.''
</P>
<P>
	   American officials had suggested that Elian's father come to Florida to get
his son. The U.S. National Council of Churches said the boy's relatives in Cuba
want the organization to bring the boy back.

   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Predominantly black colleges in Alabama and

</P>
<P>

McCain Defends Actions on Behalf of Donor

	   DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- At a campaign debate in New Hampshire on Thursday
night, GOP presidential candidate John McCain strongly defended his actions on
behalf of a political donor who was seeking action from the Federal
Communications Commission. "My job is to make the bureaucrats work for the
people," said McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. "I would
do the same thing again, almost anytime." McCain wrote a letter on behalf of the
political donor. McCain's aides fretted that the issue of the letter could

U.S. Abortions Continue To Decline

	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The number of abortions in the United States fell in 1997 to
the lowest level in two decades, despite new drugs that make it easier to
terminate a pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported
Thursday that 20 of every 1,000 women of reproductive age (15 to 44) had
abortions in 1997, the lowest since 1975. The CDC cited several factors for the
decline, including reduced access to abortion, an increased willingness to use
contraception and possibly different attitudes about the moral implications of
abortion.

<HEADLINE> No. 1 Stanford 86, Arizona St. 67  </HEADLINE>
    By ROB GLOSTER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Every time Arizona State got close, Stanford's
Casey Jacobsen hit a rally-killing 3-pointer. By the time Jacobsen was done, he
had 24 points and the No. 1 Cardinal were still undefeated.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobsen hit three of his four 3-pointers in the second half, including a
four-point play midway through the period, as Stanford defeated the Sun Devils
86-67 Thursday night in the Pac-10 conference opener for both schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Madsen added 14 points and 13 rebounds and Jarron Collins had 14 points
for Stanford (12-0), playing its first conference game as the nation's top team.
The Cardinal had played a series of overmatched opponents since moving up to No.
1 in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford faces No. 5 Arizona on Saturday in an early season battle of the
teams expected to vie for the Pac-10 title. Arizona (12-2) won 65-61 at
California on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Eddie House had 24 points and Chad Prewitt added a career-high 18 for
Arizona State (8-4), which managed just 34.9 percent shooting against the
nation's top defensive team. Stanford has held opponents to an average of 31
percent shooting this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading by seven at halftime, Stanford extended its lead to 46-35 as Madsen
and Ryan Mendez scored all of the Cardinal's points in the opening 6:19 of the
second half. Each had four points during that span.
</P>
<P>
	   House then went on a spree, scoring seven quick points to pull ASU within
50-44, but Jacobsen hit a 3-pointer and followed 33 seconds later with another
3-pointer on which he was fouled and made the free throw.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing by 15 points, the Sun Devils had scored eight straight points to
pull within 59-52 when Jacobsen struck again, hitting a 3 from in front of the
Stanford bench. David Moseley added another 3-pointer, and ASU didn't threaten
again.
</P>
<P>
	   ASU's pressure defense rattled Stanford at times in the opening half, and
Cardinal coach Mike Montgomery got called for a technical foul just 3:09 into
the game. The Sun Devils led for most of the half, but a 15-6 run by Stanford to
close the half gave it a 38-31 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Mendez and Jacobsen each hit 3-pointers in the first half and scored nine
points to lead Stanford. House had 14 points for ASU, but missed all three of
his 3-pointers in the half. The Sun Devils went 0-for-7 on 3-pointers in the
first half.

in front 58-56 on a putback and two free throws by Wright.
</P>
<P>
	   Lampley grabbed an offensive rebound and dunked to tie it 58-all but Arizona
scored six straight points, starting with Luke Walton's 6-foot runner in the
lane. Woods had a driving layup off a feed from Gardner and then hit a short
turnaround jumper with 50 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Wethers came back with a 3-pointer but that was the last score for
Cal. Gardner made one of two free throws with 18 seconds left and Joe Shipp and
Lampley missed long jumpers for Cal in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona went in front 51-50 behind an 11-3 run that included 3-pointers from
Gardner and Walton but Cal scored the next six points, starting with a 15-foot
jumper by Lampley to regain the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Vander Laan scored 10 of his points in the first half, when Cal led 40-35.
</P>
<P>
	   Cal hurt itself by committing 21 turnovers and shot just 35 percent from the
field compared to 44 percent by the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bears outrebounded Arizona 46-31 but were not accurate enough with their
shots off the rebounds to make a difference.

<HEADLINE> TV Coverage Of SLA Trial Denounced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Television coverage of Sara Jane Olson's bombing
conspiracy trial would endanger public safety by showing how terrorist groups
make bombs, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Court TV and Cable News Network have asked to televise the trial of the
former Symbionese Liberation Army fugitive. Her defense team supported the
motion, saying her right to a fair trial will be enhanced by TV coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors Michael Latin and Eleanor Hunter on Thursday opposed the
request.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Much of the testimony in this case will revolve around the making of
terrorist bombs,'' said their court filing. ``Experts will describe in explicit
detail how terrorist groups, like the SLA, make their bombs, how law enforcement
disarms them, and techniques used by law enforcement in tracking those
responsible for domestic terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Detailed gavel to gavel television coverage will hinder law enforcement
and be detrimental to public safety,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson, formerly known as Kathleen Ann Soliah, is accused of planting pipe
bombs under two police cars in 1975 as part of a SLA plot to avenge the killings
of six SLA members in a Los Angeles police shootout. The devices did not
explode.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge James Ideman did not immediately rule on the television
issue. So far, he has refused to admit TV cameras to hearings in the case. Trial
is set to begin next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson remained a fugitive for more than two decades and led an apparently
crime-free life as a doctor's wife and mother of three children until she was
arrested in June near her home in St. Paul, Minn. She has pleaded innocent and
is free on $1 million bail.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Grandmother Expecting Triplets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNNYSIDE, Wash. (AP) -- Aracelia Garcia, who already has 15 grandchildren,
was a bit surprised to find herself pregnant again -- and with triplets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I could have imagined one but not more -- not three,'' the 54-year-old
woman said in Spanish. ``My heart is full of happiness. I feel happy God wants
me to have three. ... A child is a gift, a treasure.''
</P>
<P>
	   The babies, all girls, could come as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia is waiting out the pregnancy at home, where the living room is filled
with portraits of her and her husband surrounded by their eight children, whose
ages range from 16 to 34, and their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Diana Smigaj at the Cascade Woman's Health Care Center in Yakima said
older expectant mothers like Garcia face additional health risks including high
blood pressure and diabetes. The babies are also at risk for growth problems,
premature birth and Down syndrome.
</P>
<P>
	   But Garcia's health is excellent, which she attributes to her years of toil
as a farm worker.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She's amazing,'' Smigaj said. ``I've never seen anyone like her.''
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia, a native of Mexico, said she moved to Sunnyside in 1976 and became
an American citizen in 1996. She plans to go back to work as soon as her health
and the babies allow.

<HEADLINE> Businesses To Boost Computer Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- So much for dire predictions that the Y2K bug would throw
the U.S. economy into a tailspin. A subtle economic boost may instead be the
result.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a dearth of major computer problems from the date changeover to
2000, many U.S. businesses are lifting freezes on buying new technology -- some
earlier than planned -- to install computers and software key to building Web
sites and speeding communication with suppliers and customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Other companies are reaping an unexpected benefit of scouring for Y2K
glitches -- the elimination of outdated technology that had bogged down networks
with a hodge-podge of software applications and machines.
</P>
<P>
	   That's welcome news for tech companies, who have faced a harrowing plunge in
their shares this week as investors cash in on the industry's remarkable rally
during 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Predictions now being made of a tech-related boost to the economy contrast
with those of last year when many economists warned computer disruptions from
Y2K would curb growth.
</P>
<P>
	   "The warnings were very widespread," said First Union Corp. economist Mark
Vitner. He predicts 3.4 percent economic growth this year, down slightly from
4.2 percent in 1999 due to higher interest rates crimping new home sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The downside of Y2K was scarcely noticeable -- some hotels and other
travel-related industries reported weak bookings as fears of disruptions kept
people close to home.
</P>
<P>
	   But the emerging upside -- a burst of tech spending -- could help turn
around prospects for sellers ranging from IBM to PC maker Gateway, invigorating
a key U.S. economic engine.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of people were holding back," said John Gantz, an analyst with
researcher International Data Corp. IDC found that 37 percent of 2,100 North
American companies it surveyed deferred spending last year on non-essential
technology projects unrelated to the Y2K glitch.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're talking about billions of dollars of spending that was withheld,"
Gantz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall U.S. technology spending is expected to increase by a robust 8.3
percent to $417 billion this year, IDC says, slightly lower than last year's 9.5
percent growth largely due to price drops in computers.
</P>
<P>
	   Other factors will aid technology spending this year. Many companies are
expected to buy Microsoft's newest operating system software, the Windows 2000
program for business computers, which comes out in February. But a lot of money
will shift from fixing Y2K bugs to buying computers and software key to running
Web sites and online connections with customers and suppliers.
</P>
<P>
	   Typical is American Re Corp. The Princeton, N.J.-based insurer had frozen
spending Oct. 1 on technology not needed to fix glitches. Instead of lifting in
March, as planned, the freeze will thaw in the next two weeks amid a lack of any
problems, said Douglas Paige, vice president of information technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The funds will go to creating and buying applications to help American Re
exchange information and conduct transactions with other insurers and agencies,
replacing a patchquilt of less efficient methods such as sending faxes and
making telephone calls. The insurer also will lease 1,400 new desktop and laptop
computers.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Sentimentality Endures  </HEADLINE>
   By BRADLEY FOSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Unlike fears of widespread computer failure, sentimentality
toward the year 2000 endures.
</P>
<P>
	   A casual survey of consumers suggests Y2K-themed knick-knacks are more
likely to be tucked in a drawer than thrown away like an old newspaper. Unless,
of course, that newspaper happens to be dated Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Champagne flutes, glass paperweights, wool hats and even sterling silver pie
cutters emblazoned with the words ``Year 2000'' made popular gifts at home and
in the workplace this past Christmas and New Year's.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the much-anticipated rollover came and went without apocalyptic
consequence, the Year 2000 reference on otherwise ordinary gifts seems to have
given them keepsake status.
</P>
<P>
	   Penny Rebert, a judicial clerk in Carlisle, Pa. says, at first, she had no
desire to save the commemorative champagne flutes she received from a secretary
at work. Ultimately, though, junking a present -- and the only Y2K memento she
had -- did not seem in keeping with the spirit of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guess I'll probably keep them because they're kitschy and cute,'' Rebert
says. ``But they'll probably sit in the attic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Brad Adams, a San-Francisco-based district manager for data storage
equipment maker EMC Corp., spent more than a thousand dollars in Y2K-themed
gifts, giving $50 crystal champagne flutes with hand-painted EMC logos to 25 of
his best clients. ``I also bought four just for keepsakes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Others harbor hopes their millennial mementos will be worth more money as
collectibles in the future. In anticipation of such interest, the United States
Postal Service last week issued 120 million ``Baby New Year'' stamps, nearly
double the number that are usually sold as commemoratives.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, several Web sites hawking already popular items such as Beanie Babies,
Furbys and all-things Pokemon have invoked the Year 2000 in their sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
	   But antique doll collector and dealer Joan Kindler of Whitestone, N.Y.,
cautions even mint-condition mass-produced dolls from the turn of the 21st
century will fizzle in value in the long run.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Things that people are likely to throw away'' are more likely to fetch
high prices at auctions in the future, Kindler says. She cites the wildly
popular Cabbage Patch Dolls from the early 1980s as proof: ``You cannot give
them away today,'' Kindler says.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, she adds, she'll probably ignore the laws of supply and demand just
this once. ``I might go scour the stores for the half-price sales,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
	   The Internet remains a busy place for buyers and sellers of Y2K trinkets.
Specialized e-commerce Web sites cropped up over the past year and eBay remains
a thriving marketplace for such goods.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am happy to report that no overstock exists. My eBay customers cleaned
me out,'' says Elise S. James, an Internet merchant from River Edge, N.J. who
sold ``Millennium Angel'' pins for $1.99 ``by the gross'' to customers in
Florida, Michigan, Montana and California.
</P>
<P>
	   For her part, James is keeping Year 2000 ales she and her husband bought on
their honeymoon in London; a champagne bottle ``stashed as a memory''; the Jan.
1 edition of The New York Times and a Y2K blown-glass Christmas tree ornament.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Rhonda Adragna admits she plans to hold onto a pair of $50
Waterford crystal champagne flutes, she has no plans to put them in storage.
</P>
<P>
	   Adragna, who runs the Millenniumgift.com Web site out of her home in Half
Moon Bay, Calif., says her children regularly drink Coca Cola out of them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I buy things, I use them,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Accounting Firm Violations Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly half the partners at accounting giant
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP reported having violated rules prohibiting them from
owning stock in companies they audit, and many more such lapses went unreported,
a review led by an independent consultant has found.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which made the consultant's review
public on Thursday, said its investigation of New York-based
PricewaterhouseCoopers is continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, the firm agreed in a settlement to conduct the review and create
a $2.5 million education fund after the SEC alleged that some of its accountants
compromised their independence by owning stock in corporations they audited.
</P>
<P>
	   PricewaterhouseCoopers promised at the time to take steps to ensure that it
didn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
	   In light of the disappointing results of the review, the SEC said Thursday
it has asked an accounting industry oversight board to sponsor similar
independent reviews at other accounting firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC has been stressing the need for accounting firms to be more
independent of the companies they audit. The watchdog agency's rules explicitly
forbid accountants from owning stock in their audit clients.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Turner, the SEC's chief accountant, called the report by the
independent consultant, New York attorney Jess Fardella, "a sobering reminder
that accounting professionals need to renew their commitment to the fundamental
principle of auditor independence."
</P>
<P>
	   Fardella and his four-person team found some excusable mistakes by the
accounting firm but also "laxity and insensitivity to the importance of
independence" and "serious" problems of corporate structure and culture.
</P>
<P>
	   The report found:
</P>
<P>
	   --Nearly half the firm's 2,698 partners, or 1,301, reported having committed
at least one violation of the auditor independence rules while 153 of them
admitted to more than 10 each.
</P>
<P>
	   --Of a total 8,064 violations reported by those involved, 81.3 percent were
by partners and 17.4 percent by managers. Nearly half of the reported violations
were committed by partners who perform services related to financial audits of
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   --Almost half the reported violations involved direct investments by the
PricewaterhouseCoopers professionals in securities, mutual funds, bank accounts
or insurance products related to client companies.
</P>
<P>
	   --In addition, Fardella's team did random checks that found that 77.5
percent of the firm's partners failed to report at least one violation they
committed. That means an estimated 86 percent of the 2,698 partners had at least
one violation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Nestor, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said he had no comment
on the report but provided a copy of a letter sent Wednesday by chairman
Nicholas G. Moore and chief executive James J. Schiro to the firm's partners.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter termed the Fardella report "embarrassing to our firm and to all
of us as partners" and said that "Equally important, it may also raise questions
and concerns among our clients and our people."
</P>
<P>
	   However, the executives added that the violations of the independence rules
cited by the report, while unacceptable, "did not in any way impair the
professional objectivity and integrity" of the company's audits.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are determined to do everything possible so that neither our firm nor
our clients ever again suffer from independence-related problems," Moore and
Schiro wrote. "To facilitate this, we have established expansive new policies
and procedures to address previous infractions and to prevent future ones."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC appointed Fardella in March 1999 to supervise the internal review
after it censured PricewaterhouseCoopers for alleged violations of the
independence rules.
</P>
<P>
	   In its settlement with the SEC, the firm agreed to set up the $2.5 million
education fund, to be used to enhance awareness in the accounting profession of
the independence rules.
</P>
<P>
	   PricewaterhouseCoopers, created from the July 1998 merger of Price
Waterhouse LLP and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand LLP, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing
in agreeing to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the accord, the firm also agreed to be censured, to improve its
procedures for monitoring adherence to the independence rules and to conduct the
internal investigation supervised by Fardella.

<HEADLINE> 'Satisfaction' Said Rock's Best  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 30 years later, the competition between the
Beatles and the Rolling Stones rages on.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beatles placed nine entries on a list of rock 'n' roll's 100 greatest
songs, as compiled by VH1 in a poll of 700 people in the music industry. The
Stones have five.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's the Stones' celebrated ode to sexual frustration, "(I Can't Get No)
Satisfaction," that topped the list. The Beatles could do no better than ninth,
with "Hey Jude."
</P>
<P>
	   The Stones' 1965 hit has one of the most recognizable guitar riffs in music,
which Keith Richards said came to him one night when he was sleeping.
</P>
<P>
	   "It kind of sticks up as an anthem for the time it was released and for
every generation that came since," said Todd Schwartz, VH1 programming director.
"It strikes a chord with every teen-ager."
</P>
<P>
	   After "Hey Jude," three other Beatles songs made the top 25: "Yesterday," "A
Day in the Life" and "I Want to Hold Your Hand."
</P>
<P>
	   "The Beatles had so many songs that the vote got divided," Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elvis Presley, who had four songs on the list as did Led Zeppelin, couldn't
crack the top 10. The best he could do was No. 18 with "Jailhouse Rock."
</P>
<P>
	   A lot of big names were shut out of the top 100 entirely, among them
Madonna, Fleetwood Mac, Neil Young, U2 and R.E.M. Aretha Franklin's "Respect"
came in second and Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven," a staple of FM radio in
the 1970s, was third.
</P>
<P>
	   Rounding out the top 10 are "Like a Rolling Stone" by Bob Dylan; "Born to
Run" by Bruce Springsteen; "Hotel California" by the Eagles; "Light My Fire" by
the Doors; "Good Vibrations" by the Beach Boys; "Hey Jude"; and "Imagine" by
John Lennon.
</P>
<P>
	   The list's oldest song was "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley &AMP; His
Comets, released in 1955. The newest was Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit,"
from 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Nirvana's hit was the only one from the 1990s to make it. Schwartz said it
may be because VH1's voters were even older than the network's usual audience.
VH1 aims at age 30 and up.
</P>
<P>
	   VH1 will count down the list in a special that runs over five nights,
starting Jan. 17.

<HEADLINE> Sports Car Avanti Resurrected  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VILLA RICA, Ga. (AP) -- For nearly 40 years, sports car enthusiasts have
adored the Avanti, a smooth, stylish coupe that has always turned heads but
rarely turned a profit.
</P>
<P>
	   Introduced by Studebaker a year before the automaker went out of business in
1963, new Avantis are gearing up to hit the road again, this time from a small
factory in this town west of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've concluded that the car is cosmic," said Tom Kellogg, who helped with
the original Avanti design. "It has some sort of personality or spirit that
keeps finding people to take it over and stroke it and keep it going."
</P>
<P>
	   Avanti Motor Corp., formed in 1964 after Studebaker's demise, continued
production of the car until it went bankrupt in 1985. The following year, a new
Avanti Motor Corp. formed and resumed production, first in South Bend, Ind., and
then in Youngstown Ohio, where the last line of Avantis was produced in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Now two businessmen have given up six-figure salaries and cushy corporate
jobs to bring the Avanti back to life.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're just living a dream because we love the car so much," said John
Seaton, former president of a Carrollton clothing company and the new president
and chief executive officer of Avanti Motor Co. "We're ready to go at 4:30 a.m.
and do whatever is necessary."
</P>
<P>
	   Seaton and John Hull, a former corporate accountant from Trumbull, Conn.,
Avanti's chief financial officer, answer their own phones and help unload
equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Avanti enthusiasts are glad the car is back in production. Steve Kolish, a
retired airline mechanic in Niles, Ill., bought his Avanti 20 years ago and
estimates he has spent upwards of $50,000 in upkeep and restoration.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're a unique bunch of sick people," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The original Avanti design was by Raymond Loewy for Studebaker as a way to
save the flagging company.
</P>
<P>
	   Kellogg was on Loewy's staff and was called upon to update the sleek car
known for its squared off front end, distinctive sweeping fenders and trademark
backside.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've talked to Avanti owners everywhere trying to figure out what it is
they like about the car," said Kellogg, now 67 and based in Irvine, Calif. "They
all have different answers. So I had to go with my gut feeling."
</P>
<P>
	   A prototype of the new design was unveiled in December, with plans calling
for a hardtop and convertible version of the two-door coupe that retains many of
the instantly recognizable features of the original, including the round
headlights.
</P>
<P>
	   Seaton, Hull and former sole owner Michael Kelly form the partnership that
owns the privately held Avanti Motor Co. The first car is expected to roll off
the line by the end of 2000 and cost under $100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   In keeping with Avanti tradition, the Fiberglas body, the leather interior
and all the other trimmings will be assembled by hand, while the guts of the car
will be a souped-up Corvette engine and updated suspension system.
</P>
<P>
	   Initial plans call for the plant to produce about 300 cars a year.
</P>
<P>
	   For Kolish, the wait could not be over soon enough.
</P>
<P>
	   "The look of the rear end is what captured me and led me to buy one," Kolish
said. "It will be nice to see that rear end on the road again."

<HEADLINE> 33 Journalists Said Killed in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Journalism was an often dangerous profession to practice in
1999, with 33 journalists in 10 countries losing their lives because of their
work, according to a press freedom group.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of deaths increased from the year before, when 24 journalists
were killed in 17 countries, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the African nation of Sierra Leone was the most dangerous place for
journalists, with 10 killed there, including Associated Press Television News
producer Myles Tierney.
</P>
<P>
	   Tierney and Ian Stewart, AP's bureau chief from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, were
shot last January. They were among a group of journalists traveling -- with
military escort -- through downtown Freetown when they came under attack. A
rebel opened fire on the AP car; Tierney died instantly, and Stewart suffered a
serious head wound.
</P>
<P>
	   Yugoslavia had the second-highest number of deaths, with six. Other
countries where journalists were killed included Colombia, East Timor,
Argentina, Lebanon, Nigeria, Russia, Sri Lanka, and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   All 33 journalists were killed either while on assignment or as a direct
result of their work, according to researchers at CPJ.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the French media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders
reported that 36 journalists had been killed worldwide in 1999. The discrepancy
between that number and the one released by CPJ was not immediately explained,
but CPJ is still investigating the deaths of 19 other journalists that may have
been related to their professions.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those killed were targeted by warring factions within the various
countries, CPJ said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We see a clear policy, particularly in Sierra Leone, Colombia, and East
Timor, of armed factions seeking to banish or even exterminate journalists in
order to hide the truth,'' CPJ executive director Ann Cooper said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether it's the Indonesian army or Sierra Leonean rebels, the goal is
obvious: get rid of the witnesses whose reporting can inform the world about
atrocities, corruption or killings.''

<HEADLINE> Former Rams Lineman Faces Charge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LAGUNA NIGUEL, Calif. (AP) -- Former NFL star Doug France, arriving in court
to face a felony drunken driving charge, was confronted by the daughter of the
woman who died in a 1990 alcohol-related crash in which France was involved.
</P>
<P>
	   France, 46, attended a pretrial hearing Thursday involving a Sept. 26
accident in which his vehicle struck a car on a freeway in San Juan Capistrano.
</P>
<P>
	   No one was hurt, but police said the former Los Angeles Rams offensive
lineman had a blood-alcohol level of 0.15 percent, nearly twice California's
legal limit of .08.
</P>
<P>
	   He could be sentenced to as much as three years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   On hand for his pretrial hearing was Grasie Contreras, whose 53-year-old
mother, Maria, died in 1990 when France's car crashed head-on into her car.
</P>
<P>
	   France, who had a blood-alcohol level of 0.13 during that accident, pleaded
guilty to vehicular manslaughter and was sentenced to a year in jail and five
years probation. He was allowed to serve the jail term under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside court, Contreras said she was disappointed France had been arrested
again.
</P>
<P>
	   "It should stay with you for the rest of your life and have an impact on
your future actions," she said. "I just feel as if I'm going through that hurt
all over again. The pain obviously comes back."
</P>
<P>
	   After the September crash, France said he believed his blood-alcohol level
was increased by cough syrup he was taking.

<HEADLINE> CDC Warns of Drug-Resistant Bacteria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The government is warning hospitals that some Staph bacteria
strains may be drug-resistant after confirming that a woman died from a heart
valve infection despite taking antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
	   The 63-year-old Illinois woman died last April. It was the first confirmed
U.S. death from a Staph infection that didn't respond to vancomycin, the
antibiotic of last resort for lingering infections, said a report released
Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC warned that some strains of Staphylococcus aureus are showing signs
of resistance to vancomycin.
</P>
<P>
	   The report cited four cases since 1997, including the Illinois woman who
died after vancomycin had no effect on a Staph infection that had entered a
valve in her heart.
</P>
<P>
	   The other patients, all of whom were seriously ill and had been treated with
vancomycin for extended periods, were in Michigan, New Jersey and New York. The
CDC said the Illinois case was the only confirmed fatality.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is another example of why we need to use antibiotics more
judiciously,'' said Dr. Julie Gerberding, the CDC's director of hospital
infections programs. She said the four cases were extremely rare and occurred in
very ill people.
</P>
<P>
	   Staph bacteria are passed by skin-to-skin contact and generally are
harmless. However, the bacteria can enter the body through wounds and cause
serious infections of the skin, tissue, bones and joints. Staph is blamed for
about 13 percent of the nation's 2 million infections at hospitals each year.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, a Hong Kong newspaper reported that three people had died from
an antibiotic-resistant strain of Staph bacteria.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers working to develop new antibiotics announced in September that
two had proven effective against vancomycin-resistant bacteria in human tests --
Synercid, manufactured by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, and Zyvox, made by Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn.

<HEADLINE> LA Auto Show Has Crossover Vehicles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Transportation of the future could combine the best
aspects of a sedan with those of SUVs and pickup trucks if the concept vehicles
being shown off at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show catch on.
</P>
<P>
	   Three automakers -- the Saturn division of General Motors Corp., the Mercury
division of Ford Motor Co. and Subaru of America -- showed off concept vehicles
that promise the comfort and handling of a sedan, coupled with the ruggedness
and carrying ability of an SUV or pickup.
</P>
<P>
	   The Saturn CV1, inspired in part by Saturn Chairwoman Cynthia Trudell's
experience in London cabs, is strictly a concept car, she said following the
unveiling.
</P>
<P>
	   But the other two concepts -- the Mercury Mountaineer SUV and the Subaru
ST-X four-door truck -- appear much closer to reality. Ford designers said the
Mountaineer was a strong indication of what the next version of the vehicle
would look like, and how it would differ from its mechanical twin, the Ford
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
	   Subaru is thinking seriously of putting the more radical ST-X on production
lines in the next two or three years, George Muller, Subaru's president and
chief executive officer, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   "It depends on what kind of reaction we get," Muller said. "Right now the
market is really receptive to this type of vehicle, so it's a more serious
concept."
</P>
<P>
	   The notion that the traditional distinctions among autos are blurring -- a
process inspired by autos such as Subaru's Outback and the Lexus RX300 --
emerged as an unofficial theme at the show.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to create new segments and redefine existing segments" in the auto
industry, Ron Zarrella, president of GM North America, said in a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The ST-X and CV1 both target mid-priced markets. The ST-X is aimed primarily
at Generation Xers who want to take bikes or snowboard gear to the mountains.
The CV1 seeks a broader audience: anyone who has kids or equipment to transport,
but doesn't want a traditional minivan or SUV, said Trudell.
</P>
<P>
	   The ST-X features four-passenger seating along with a 55.5-inch pickup bed.
The rear window can be rolled down into the back seat frame and folded down to
turn the ST-X into a two-seater with a 76-inch bed.
</P>
<P>
	   Other features include an independent suspension, all-wheel-drive,
roof-mounted lights and an 8.5 inch clearance for off-road travel.
</P>
<P>
	   Built from an Outback frame and a supercharged 230-horsepower version of the
Outback's 2.5 liter engine, the ST-X could move easily to mass production,
Muller said. If that happens, it probably would sell in a price range close to
the Outback, which goes for $23,000 to $28,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ST-X stands out from other crossovers that have appeared so far, said
George Peterson, an auto industry analyst at Auto Pacific Inc. in Tustin, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like a very nicely done four-door El Camino," he said. "It harkens
back to the old car-pickups of the 1960s and 1970s. With four doors it has a lot
of extra utility."
</P>
<P>
	   The CV1, Saturn's first concept vehicle, holds five adults in standard
seating. Two kid-sized, fold-down jump seats attached to the back of driver and
front passenger seats. Trudell suggested the jump seats after seeing them in
London cabs.
</P>
<P>
	   All seats except the driver's can be folded down flat.
</P>
<P>
	   At 177 inches, the CV1 is 1.1 inches shorter than the Saturn SL sedan and 2
feet shorter than Honda's Odyssey minivan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mercury Mountaineer concept is slightly wider than the current version,
and has a cleaner, more straight-forward design, with larger headlamps and a
bolder grill. It's meant to help establish a separate look for Mercury, said J
Mays, Ford's design chief.
</P>
<P>
	   One striking exception to the truck/SUV theme was provided by Rolls Royce,
which debuted a new $360,000 Corniche convertible to live chamber music. The
sleek build-to-order auto revives the Corniche nameplate, which was discontinued
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-door, four-seat Corniche features the classic Rolls Royce front
grill followed by a long, smooth lines that slope gently downward over the
trunk. The car is powered by a supercharged 6.75-liter engine and accelerates
from zero to 60 mph in eight seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Rolls Royce expects to sell about 450 cars over its lifetime, including
about 100 in the United States, said Tony Gott, chief executive of Rolls Royce
and Bentley Motor Cars. The market is so exclusive, company executives already
know about 75 percent of their potential customers by name, he said.

<HEADLINE> 7 More Players Named in Irish Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Seven additional Notre Dame football players were
linked Thursday to a former booster convicted of embezzling more than $1.4
million from her employer.
</P>
<P>
	   The new names surfaced when Jerry Dominiack, the former employer of
convicted embezzler Kimberly Dunbar, filed an amended complaint in St. Joseph
Superior Court on Thursday, according to a report on ESPN's Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaint says Bobby Taylor and Allen Rossum, former Irish players now
with the Philadelphia Eagles, accepted money or gifts from Dunbar.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit seeks $5,000 from Taylor, who allegedly was loaned the money to pay
back an agent, and $12,500 from Rossum, who allegedly was given the money to buy
himself and his girlfriend a camcorder and trips to New York and Las Vegas, ESPN
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other former Irish players, Ivory Covington and Tracy Graham, were named
in the suit. Also named were three players from this season's team -- Lamont
Bryant, Eric Chappell and Raki Nelson.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the NCAA put Notre Dame on probation for the first time in the
school's history and said the university would lose two scholarships because of
the Dunbar case.
</P>
<P>
	   College football's sanctioning body, however, did not touch Notre Dame's
postseason eligibility. And the school's TV contract with NBC -- worth an
estimated $8 million to $9 million annually -- is not affected.
</P>
<P>
	   The university said last month it would not appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement ended an almost two-year investigation into the
relationships between Dunbar, 30, and several Irish players. Some of those
relationships were sexual, and Dunbar has a child with former player Jarvis
Edison.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Friedenthal, chair of the NCAA infractions committee, said last month
the university was not penalized for gifts Dunbar gave players with whom she was
romantically involved, but her interaction with other players and their parents
was a factor in the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The NCAA's report did not implicate anyone from the current Notre Dame
coaching staff.

<HEADLINE> Urban Faculty Offered Incentives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- Hoping to revitalize areas surrounding urban
colleges and universities, state officials are offering incentives for faculty
and staff to move into nearby neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   A program unveiled Thursday offers $10,000 for school employees who buy
homes in designated areas near New Jersey's state university campuses, said Jane
Kennedy, a commissioner in the state Department of Community Affairs. The money
is intended for use as down payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Faculty and staff who already own homes in the target areas can apply for
$5,000 to make exterior improvements, Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the biggest challenges for cities is attracting and retaining
middle-income households,'' she said. ``But this isn't just about selling people
a house. We're looking for people to buy a community.''
</P>
<P>
	   The program, expected to cost $2.5 million for the fiscal year 2000, was
announced a year ago in Gov. Christie Whitman's budget address.
</P>
<P>
	   It has since garnered the support of college and university administrators
across the state, said Rutgers President Francis Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When people think of higher education, it's natural for them to focus on
traditional missions, such as teaching,'' he said. ``But service to our
communities is also an essential element of our mission.''
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 13 campuses in nine institutions are eligible to participate in
the grant program. Faculty and staff must settle nearby the schools except for
in Camden, where all city locations qualify.
</P>
<P>
	   Participating schools range in size from Rutgers -- with nearly 11,000
full-time faculty and staff at three campuses -- to Cumberland County Community
College, which has 150 full-time employees at its campus in Vineland.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenny said household income will not be a factor in obtaining the basic
$10,000 down payment money, but families whose incomes meet restrictions set by
the state Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency will also be eligible for more
assistance, including a reduced rate mortgage.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's program is modeled after a similar effort at the University of
Pennsylvania. That program is widely credited with beginning a renewal of West
Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Inmate Executed  </HEADLINE>
   By ASHLEY ESTES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATMORE, Ala. (AP) -- A man convicted of killing a young girl during a
robbery and kidnapping was executed in the state's electric chair early Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   David Ray Duren, 37, was the first inmate to be electrocuted since the U.S.
Supreme Court agreed in October to consider whether Florida's use of the
electric chair is cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Duren was convicted of murder for the 1983 shooting death of Kathleen
Bedsole, 16. He kidnapped the girl and her boyfriend, Chuck Leonard, from
Leonard's parked car, put them in the trunk and drove them to a secluded area
where they were shot. Leonard survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Duren and an accomplice, David Kinder, were quickly captured. Kinder is
serving life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
	   Duren fought his execution for 16 years before changing his mind. He
admitted he was guilty and that the death penalty was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can drag it out another three years or however long it took them to
decide it,'' Duren told The Birmingham News on Wednesday. ``But that wouldn't be
fair to the victims' family. It wouldn't be fair to my family.''
</P>
<P>
	   Leonard, now a Baptist minister in South Carolina, said he spoke Wednesday
with Duren, who told him he was a born-again Christian who sought God's
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Nebraska are the only states that use
electrocution as the sole means of execution. Late Thursday, the Florida
Legislature voted to change its law to allow inmates the option of lethal
injection.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama officials have said they are waiting to see if the Supreme Court's
ruling affects Florida alone.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Alaska Candidate Gets Plea Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A man once considered a top contender for governor
has pleaded no contest to two charges stemming from the campaign finance
problems that toppled his run for office.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of a plea deal reached Thursday, John Lindauer agreed not to run for
public office in Alaska again and to issue a public apology. He received a
one-year suspended sentence, two years probation, 100 hours of community service
and a $15,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindauer, a former state legislator and chancellor of the University of
Alaska at Anchorage, spent $1.7 million on his campaign for governor in 1998 and
easily won the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
	   He claimed he was financing his campaign with his own money, but he later
was forced to admit that nearly all the money came from his wealthy wife,
Dorothy Oremus, heiress to a Chicago concrete business.
</P>
<P>
	   Under state campaign laws, contributions are limited to $500 per individual.
</P>
<P>
	   After the facts about his financing came out, the state Republican Party
withdrew its support and Lindauer's campaign fell apart. He finished third in
the election with 17 percent of the vote, behind Democratic Gov. Tony Knowles
and a Republican write-in candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindauer's lawyer, Peter Gruenstein, said Lindauer had made mistakes while
pursuing a ``laudable goal'' of running a campaign that did not rely on special
interest money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has paid a very dear political price in respect to those mistakes,''
Gruenstein said. He said Lindauer plans to pursue business interests in Chicago
rather than stay in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindauer pleaded no contest to providing false or misleading information to
the Internal Revenue Service and violating the campaign expenditure law.
</P>
<P>
	   He also pleaded no contest to a third charge -- submitting a false
statement, a misdemeanor that was reduced from a felony perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
	   That stemmed from Lindauer's claim that he received a check from the 1997
Alaska Permanent Fund -- money paid to residents who have lived in the state at
least one year and who apply for the dividend. Lindauer had been accused of only
moving back to Alaska from Chicago to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
	   His 1998 Permanent Fund application correctly showed he didn't receive a
1997 check.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Stephanie Rhoades said Lindauer's actions were a pattern of lies that
had dragged down the political process and added to the public's bad image of
politicians.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Looks at Golan Pleasures  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOUNT HERMON, Golan Heights (AP) -- When Yossi Elazar reached this pinnacle
as a soldier in June, 1967, the view was green hills dappled with sunshine,
Damascus shimmering in the distance -- not the snow that now makes his living as
a ski shop owner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just love it,'' Elazar said Thursday, after the Golan Heights' first
heavy snowfall this season. ``When the snow starts, everyone's adrenaline starts
to rush and up we go.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mount Hermon is Israel's only ski resort, and for many Israelis
contemplating the Golan's handover as part of a peace deal, its delights rank
almost as high as more solemn considerations, such as security and the fate of
Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
	   Its slopes provide stunning mountain vistas and snow -- qualities otherwise
lacking in their cramped, flat, dry land. As Israeli and Syrian negotiators meet
near Washington to work out a peace agreement -- possibly as soon as year's end
-- many rushed to revel in the strategic plateau's winter wonderlands.
</P>
<P>
	   Liron Parsay, 24, took the day off from her computer job at a communal farm
and was the first Israeli -- besides soldiers and snow plow drivers -- to
venture up the mount.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Suddenly winter is here,'' Parsay said as she pulled her sleeves over her
hands. ``We hadn't seen winter in so long. We had planned to come up ever since
we heard the weather forecast three days ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   The overnight storm dropped more than 32 inches of snow on the slopes, and
the fir trees dipped low with the weight.
</P>
<P>
	   Elazar, the ski shop owner, was so entranced by what he saw as one of the
first Israeli soldiers to ascend the 5,280-foot mountain in 1967, when Israel
captured the heights, that soon he moved his young family from Tel Aviv to the
rustic conditions of the tiny settlement of Neve Ativ.
</P>
<P>
	   He planted an apple orchard and helped expand the tiny ski resort that was
founded in 1970. Nearly 30 years later, the mountain sports nine ski lifts and
45 trails, Elazar has become a fixture -- and the idea of leaving rankles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will take as much money as possible and will go to the Rocky
mountains,'' if the Golan goes back, swore the 52-year old, sitting in a
cafeteria crowded with ski instructors in red, yellow and orange ski parkas. ``I
will be ashamed to stay in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other settlers are equally as emphatic, and have launched a blitz to win the
referendum Barak says he will bring to the Israeli people when he has a deal in
hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Baruch plans to distribute ``The nation is with the Golan'' stickers at the
ski resort in a bid to get pleasure seekers to think seriously about the
consequences of a return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will let people feel the connection between the Hermon site and the
Golan Heights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear what will happen to the homes of the more than 15,000 Israeli
settlers if the land is returned to Syria. The ski resort may seem frivolous to
negotiators discussing weightier issues like security arrangements and water
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Parsay said she trusts Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to bring back
security and peace in exchange for territory -- but she will miss Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think about it even. It's sad to think about the bad
possibilities,'' Parsay said. ``If there will be peace, I imagine I will be able
to come here to visit, perhaps with a passport. I want to see Damascus.''

<HEADLINE> Fighting Bulls Bring Money to Kenya  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN NENE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KHAYEGA, Kenya (AP) -- Smeared with traditional ointments that supposedly
protect him from harm, a brown-and-white dappled bull named Itionyi charged onto
the field and warily approached his opponent, another bull dubbed Chui.
</P>
<P>
	   Itionyi's supporters, intoxicated by a night of smoking marijuana and
drinking a home-distilled corn liquor, tightened their circle around the two
combatants. They blew clouds of the pungent smoke at their 750-pound hero --
hoping the dope would give him an edge in the fight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is good, it gives him a lot of courage and stamina,'' said Henry
Bicha, Itionyi's owner, who had wagered $28 his bull would win. Bicha was
risking more than money -- Chui had killed three of his bulls in previous fights
and his already tattered pride was at stake
</P>
<P>
	   Prestige and the need for diversion from grindingly difficult lives are
fueling the growth of bullfighting in western Kenya. But bull owners and zealous
fans also believe the sport has a rosy commercial future as a draw for tourists
in this East African nation.
</P>
<P>
	   All those motives were evident when, with a squeaky fanfare from a battered
trumpet, Bicha recently summoned the residents of Khayega, a town 185 miles
northwest of the capital Nairobi, to watch his bull challenge Chui, the reigning
local champion.
</P>
<P>
	   Itionyi and Chui, their horns sharpened for combat, circled each other as
the crowd of men and boys surged to within three feet of the hulking animals.
Bicha's five-year-old bull lunged at Chui, locking his shorter horns with his
foe's longer ones.
</P>
<P>
	   They withdrew and circled each other, scraping the ground with their hoofs
and grunting. They then slammed into each other once more.
</P>
<P>
	   In less than 10 minutes, it was over. To the roar of the crowd -- and the
moan of losing bettors -- Itionyi knocked the champ on his back. The
seven-year-old Chui struggled to his feet and ran off defeated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ground was slippery, that's why my bull fell down,'' said Alfred
Milimo, Chui's humiliated owner.
</P>
<P>
	   Chui was consigned to the ranks of a has-been, perhaps to fight again one
day. Bulls who are impaled on the horn of their opponent and die go straight to
the butcher, later to adorn the tables of village elders.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Mboyi, an official for the unofficial Federation of Bullfighting, said
the sport, with proper marketing, could become a big tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we need is to have rules governing the sport and make it safer for
the fans to watch. We're against the habit of the fans getting so close to the
bulls when they are fighting,'' he said, noting that over-enthusiastic,
over-intoxicated spectators have been gored.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogers Mulilio, who is researching bullfighting in the region around
Khayega, traced the start of the sport to the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
	   British colonial officials first introduced wrestling to the Luhya, Kenya's
second-largest tribe. But rivalries between wrestlers of different clans
threatened to spill over into wider violence. So after World War I, the British
brought in bullfighting.
</P>
<P>
	   Even without betting, bullfighting is treated with the utmost seriousness.
Owners and trainers are not permitted to have sexual relations with women the
night before the fight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a bad omen. The bull can be knocked down by a vehicle or something
else nasty can happen,'' Bicha explained.
</P>
<P>
	   Women remain on the periphery of the fighting, but they are the first to
celebrate victory with special bullfighting songs. The cultivation, sale and use
of marijuana are illegal in Kenya, but that doesn't stop people from indulging.
</P>
<P>
	   Until about two years ago, bullfights were held only to mark special
occasions. Today, the timing of big fights coincides with the period from
Christmas to the opening of school in mid-January when Luyhas who work in
Nairobi or in the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa return home for the holidays.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 105, Mavericks 92  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- Don Nelson was so upset with Karl Malone and the officials
that the Dallas Mavericks coach physically confronted the massive Utah Jazz
star.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson bumped Malone in the third quarter after the Dallas coach was ejected
for arguing about a foul call on a play involving Malone in Utah's 105-92
victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was taught when I was little to respect my elders, but you're totally out
of line when you get in a player's face," said Malone, who had 24 points and 11
rebounds. "He crossed the line and I have no respect for that."
</P>
<P>
	   Malone said a physical confrontation between the 59-year-old Nelson and the
6-foot-9, 260-pound power forward would be, "like a Volkswagon and an
18-wheeler."
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the first time a coach has bumped me in 15 years," Malone added. "I
realize he's an older fellow, but he's probably overmatched."
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson and Dallas center Shawn Bradley were ejected in the second half, and
Jazz coach Jerry Sloan was tossed out with 3:37 to play. There were eight
technical fouls in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson was ejected with 6:04 left in the third quarter when he was hit with
a double technical for arguing a call by referee Scott Wall.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was whistled for a foul against Malone, whose knee struck Bradley's
midsection as Bradley tried to draw a charge. Bradley was on the floor for
several minutes before he was helped to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson continued to argue the call after Bradley left the court, and Wall
ejected Nelson. The Mavericks coach then confronted Malone, bumping Malone
before the two were separated and Nelson was escorted out of the arena.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson's son and top assistant coach, Donnie, took over the team, and Donnie
Nelson was slapped with a technical with 4:53 left in the third quarter for
going into the court to protest a no-call.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley returned to start the fourth quarter, but picked up his second
technical of the night for an automatic ejection.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Don Nelson nor Bradley were available for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought I was going to have to jump on his back and slow him down. That's
what he is, he's a competitor and he's feisty," Donnie Nelson said of his
father.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how his father would have fared against Malone, Donnie Nelson said,
"He's got a real good sucker punch."
</P>
<P>
	   Sloan got into the act, picking up two technicals with less than four
minutes left to earn his ejection.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a little crazy out there," Sloan said. "We were glad to come away
with the win."
</P>
<P>
	   "Emotion runs high every once in a while," Jazz guard Jeff Hornacek said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryon Russell added 20 points for the Jazz, and John Stockton had 12 points
and 10 assists. Utah has won five straight and 11 in a row against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas lost its fifth in a row with future owner Mark Cuban looking on from
his baseline seat. Cuban, an Internet billionaire, agreed this week to buy
majority interest in the Mavericks from Ross Perot Jr. for $280 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Finley had 30 points for the Mavericks, who've lost nine of 10 and
six in a row at home. Dirk Nowitzki added 24 points, and Cedric Ceballos had 21
points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah put the game away with a 16-4 spurt, capped by Greg Ostertag's basket
with 5:28 left that made it 89-75. Malone's 15 third-quarter points allowed the
Jazz to maintain the lead. Notes: Hornacek had his streak of 67 consecutive
successful free throws end in the second quarter. Hornacek, who last missed on
Nov. 12, has the sixth-longest streak in league history. Minnesota's Micheal
Williams had a league-record streak of 97 from March 24-Nov. 9, 1993. ... The
Mavericks signed guard Greg Buckner to a 10-day contract. Buckner, a 1998
second-round pick of the Mavericks, played in the CBA last season. He suffered a
knee injury prior to training camp this season. ... Utah opened the game with a
13-2 run and held a 45-40 halftime lead. ... Finley played in his 329th
consecutive game, third-longest active streak in the league. ... Dallas forward
Gary Trent missed the game because of a strained left groin.

<TEXT>
<P>
    TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- North Carolina State keyed on Florida State's
Latavia Coleman on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   It almost backfired.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolfpack held Coleman to six points, but April Traylor scored 23 and
Brooke Wyckoff added 12 points and 10 rebounds as the Seminoles gave
third-ranked North Carolina State a scare before falling 62-58.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaayla Chones and Tynesha Lewis scored 17 points each for North Carolina
State.
</P>
<P>
	   "To be in a position to win that basketball game against the third-ranked
team in the country shows the strides that we've made, especially with Tay only
scoring six points," Florida State coach Sue Semrau said. "I thought they really
keyed on her. And now you see that we have a really balanced team where a lot of
different people can score. We have a lot of different weapons."
</P>
<P>
	   The Seminoles (7-5, 0-2 ACC) erased a 12-point deficit in the second half,
tying the game 58-58 before fading down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   "What are we going to gain by getting all worried about them being the third
team in the country?" Wyckoff asked. "April said it all night, 'We have nothing
to lose."'
</P>
<P>
	   N.C. State's Summer Erb, held to six points and three rebounds, fouled out
with 1:18 remaining. Levys Torres, fouled on the play, made both free throws to
tie it 58-58.
</P>
<P>
	   Chones put the Wolfpack (13-0, 4-0) ahead 60-58 with a short jumper and
Florida State failed to keep pace when Angela Sutton missed two free throws with
47 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Coleman gave the Seminoles one more shot, tying up a loose ball after N.C.
State's Terah James missed the front end of a 1-and-1 with 23 seconds left. But
Coleman couldn't handle a pass from Lakesha Springle on the next possession, and
Lewis sealed the outcome with two foul shots with 4.5 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Traylor scored 11 points in a 16-4 run that tied the score at 56-56.
</P>
<P>
	   "She led us in a great way tonight," Semrau said.

<HEADLINE> Farmers' Price for Raw Milk Drops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- The basic price U.S. dairy farmers received for raw
milk fell in December to the lowest price since 1978, the Wisconsin Agriculture
Statistics Service reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The fall to $9.63 in December from $9.79 per 100 pounds in November can be
attributed to increased milk production, primarily on farms in the western
United States, said Ed Jesse, a dairy economist at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison.
</P>
<P>
	   Jesse said Thursday he does not expect prices to rebound to levels seen
during the last two years, believing raw milk prices will stay around $10 for
the first three months of 2000 before climbing to $13 later in the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The $16 price, I think, is gone for a while," Jesse said. "We put in a
production engine that is pretty hard to slow down once prices drop. The good
news is we have bottomed out for the year and prices have only one place to
head."
</P>
<P>
	   Darwin Lawson, who milks 72 cows near Darlington, Wis., said he expected the
raw-milk price would drop but only to perhaps $11 per hundredweight, or about 12
gallons.
</P>
<P>
	   With premiums for the quality of his milk, he earned just shy of $20 per
hundredweight at times last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a good year last year," Lawson said. "We just hope the price doesn't
stay way down there too long. If it does, we will do like the hog farmer did
last year: Give up."
</P>
<P>
	   The basic formula price of $9.63 is the lowest since $9.33 per hundredweight
in July 1978, said SuAnn Hollewell, a dairy statistician for the Agricultural
Statistics Service in Madison.
</P>
<P>
	   Through November 1999, milk production was up 1 percent in Wisconsin
compared with the same period in the previous year, while nationally production
was up 3.4 percent, Hollewell said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The western production is really what is driving the downward trend in milk
prices right now," she said.

<P>
	   WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Frustrated over lack of control over their checkoff
dollars, Kansas farmers are seeking to privatize the state's commodity
commissions.
</P>
<P>
	   At stake is who decides how to spend the $8 million earmarked for research,
market development, promotion and education for the four major crops grown in
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor now appoints the members of the four commissions that regulate
checkoff dollars farmers pay on wheat, grain sorghum, corn and soybeans. Farmers
want to elect their own commissioners to administer the funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Also at issue is who gets to keep the $400,000 in interest earnings from the
checkoff program, said Greg Krissek, assistant secretary at the Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
	   That interest now goes into the state's general fund. Farmers contend that
all the money, including the interest earnings, should go back to the commodity
commissions.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are some people saying, and arguing, that it is not really the
state's money. It is the farmers' money and the commodity commission should be
able to utilize it," said Dennis Morrice, executive director of the Kansas
Soybean Association.
</P>
<P>
	   The farmers' proposal -- which has the support of the Kansas Department of
Agriculture and Gov. Bill Graves -- will be put before the Legislature this
session, Krissek said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Aims To Combat Hackers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress next month for more
money to develop new technologies and increase the capability of federal law
enforcement officers to combat cyber-terrorists.
</P>
<P>
	   With the New Year's Y2K threat now apparently over, Clinton hoped to turn
the nation's attention with a White House announcement today toward the need for
devoting more federal money to monitoring and protecting government computer
systems from infiltrators.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House was outlining what will be a part of a budget request to
Congress next month detailing the need and proposed measures for maintaining the
security of the nation's increasingly digitalized infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now that we're past Y2K, we need to continue to insulate and secure our
nation's computers,'' one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A
specific dollar figure was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has frequently expressed concern about the emerging threat that
other governments, hackers and thieves pose to a nation and a world now
dependent on high technology.
</P>
<P>
	   A key adviser on Thursday included cyber-terrorism near the top of a list of
threats facing America in the new century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there's a whole new realm of threat we're going to be dealing
with, the ability to take weapons of mass destruction across national borders
with relative ease; the ability to attack our computers that run our
infrastructure through cyber-terrorism,'' National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
said in response to questions after a National Press Club speech.
</P>
<P>
	   An administration official speaking on condition of anonymity said, ``Now
that we're past Y2K, we need to continue to insulate and secure our nation's
computers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The official did not have any specific dollar figures, but USA Today
reported in today's issue that the plan includes $2 billion to make the
government's computer systems less vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The new initiative builds on steps the administration announced last year.
It would seek to develop new technologies, increase public and private
cooperation against computer sabotage, improve training for government agents
and boost protection of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's creating a number of programs to train, detect and strengthen our
ability to deal with cyber-terrorists,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last July, the administration announced that it was creating a
government-wide security network to protect against hackers. The plan included
an elaborate network of electronic obstacles, monitors and analyzers to watch
for suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
	   The first 500 intrusion monitors were to be installed on non-military
government computers early this year, and the full system was slated to be
computed by May 2003.

<HEADLINE> 10 Commandments Becomes Larger Issue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- With its message on yard signs, book covers and the
walls of courthouses and public classrooms, a Ten Commandments movement is
pushing forward around the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Like anti-abortion legislation earlier, the right to display the
commandments has become a high-priority issue for Christian groups, says Frank
Flinn, an adjunct professor of religious studies at Washington University in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents argue that the framework for America's system of laws is based on
the 10 rules that the biblical book of Exodus says God gave to Moses. The rules
should be displayed in schools, they say, insisting that it is legal if the
display is paid for with private funds.
</P>
<P>
	   The movement stems from a ``heartcry,'' says Janet Parshall, spokeswoman for
Family Research Council, a Christian lobby group in Washington, D.C., which has
distributed 750,000 Ten Commandments book covers. She says she does not know if
the shooters at Columbine High School in Colorado would have been deterred by
seeing the Ten Commandments, ``but I'm willing to risk the try.''
</P>
<P>
	   The American Civil Liberties Union disagrees.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kentucky, the ACLU filed suit Nov. 18 against McCreary and Pulaski
counties and the Harlan County schools after the commandments were publicly
displayed. The ACLU cites a 1980 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the posting of
the commandments in schools amounted to an unconstitutional government promotion
of religion, which is forbidden by the First Amendment. The suits are pending.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, in the court of public opinion, Christian groups cannot go wrong by
promoting the Ten Commandments, says Flinn, a First Amendment expert. ``The
opposition is immediately put in a weak position. If I tell you, `No, the Ten
Commandments don't belong in a courtroom or in a classroom,' then automatically
I look like I'm for murder and fornication and theft.''
</P>
<P>
	   Roy Moore, an Alabama circuit judge who refused to take down the
commandments posted in his courtroom in 1995, has spoken at Christian rallies
across the country. He encourages school boards to post the Ten Commandments
even if it means a costly lawsuit for the district.
</P>
<P>
	   In Altoona, Pa., religious leaders and school officials reached an agreement
in August allowing an after-school Ten Commandments club and a new comparative
course in religions.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the Val Verde Board of Education in California voted to reverse
its policy of displaying the Ten Commandments in district offices after the ACLU
threatened to sue.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the three Kentucky counties, Parshall says, ``They're the ones that
are currently in the barrel of the gun of the ACLU if you will, but they really
are not a whole lot different than a whole lot of other places across the
country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Pilon, vice president of legal affairs at Cato Institute, a
libertarian think tank, says posting the Ten Commandments in public classrooms
and courthouses amounts to tyranny.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nothing in our constitution prohibits people from expressing and
supporting their beliefs as vigorously as they want, provided they do it in the
private sector,'' Pilon says. ``What these people seem to want is public
sanction for their views and that precisely is what the Constitution prohibits
in the establishment clause of the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Flinn says the postings are legal only if other religions are given the same
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My rule is one in, all in,'' Flinn says.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ten Commandments movement is catching on because people sense the
country has deteriorated since court decisions of the 1960s took prayer out of
public schools, says Don Swarthout, a Denver minister who helped plan a Corbin,
Ky., rally for the commandments and who is changing his ministry to focus more
on them.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, he says he will not be pushing schools to post the commandments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the Ten Commandments were not in the schools we could still have good
moral values if people tried to live their life by the Ten Commandments,''
Swarthout says. ``The fact that they hang in the school doesn't immediately fix
our schools.''
</P>
<P>
	   The movement is influencing merchandise sales at Christian bookstores.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Ratliff, owner of Lighthouse Christian Bookstore in Pikeville, says he
sold four to five times more Ten Commandments merchandise, such as plaques and
yards signs, in 1999 than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bible does not change, but what is requested by customers does, Ratliff
says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will come a day,'' he says, ``where customers are looking for
something else to grab onto.''

<HEADLINE> Kings 4, Panthers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Len Barrie had the first two-goal game of his NHL career
and the Los Angeles Kings outshot the Florida Panthers 41-17 in a 4-2 victory
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kings, who won for just the second time in 10 games, tied a franchise
record with 26 shots in the second period when Florida mustered just five.
</P>
<P>
	   Recalled from the International Hockey League two months ago, Barrie snapped
a 1-1 tie with his second goal of the game at 2:58 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   Ziggy Palffy stole the puck from Florida's Bret Hedican at the blue line and
took the first shot, which was stopped by goalie Mike Vernon. Luc Robitaille
tipped the puck to Barrie on the left side and he scored to give the Kings a 2-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida was penalized for too many players on the ice, which led to the
Kings' third goal. Jaroslav Modry scored the power-play goal from inside the
left circle after a flurry in front of Vernon at 15:21 of the second.
</P>
<P>
	   Barrie tied the game 1-1 on a shot through Vernon's pads at 8:26 of the
first period. It was Barrie's first goal in his last 16 games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Panthers tied a season low with two shots in the first period. Their
second shot produced a power-play goal by Ray Sheppard when the puck bounced in
off the glove of goalie Stephane Fiset at 6:06.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Svehla made it 3-2 at 11:14 of the third period on Florida's 12th
shot. Lance Pitlick missed tying the game moments later when his shot on an open
net went wide right.
</P>
<P>
	   Glen Murray scored an empty-net goal with 34 seconds left for the Kings, who
kept Vernon from tying former Kings goalie Rogie Vachon for eighth on the career
victory list with 355 wins.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida's Ray Whitney received a game misconduct for hitting Marko Tuomainen
with the butt end of his stick at 2:12 of the third period.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Look at Golan Pleasures  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOUNT HERMON, Golan Heights (AP) -- When Yossi Elazar reached this pinnacle
as a soldier in June, 1967, the view was green hills dappled with sunshine,
Damascus shimmering in the distance -- not the snow that now makes his living as
a ski shop owner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just love it,'' Elazar said Thursday, after the Golan Heights' first
heavy snowfall this season. ``When the snow starts, everyone's adrenaline starts
to rush and up we go.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mount Hermon is Israel's only ski resort, and for many Israelis
contemplating the Golan's handover as part of a peace deal, its delights rank
almost as high as more solemn considerations, such as security and the fate of
Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
	   Its slopes provide stunning mountain vistas and snow -- qualities otherwise
lacking in their cramped, flat, dry land. As Israeli and Syrian negotiators meet
near Washington to work out a peace agreement -- possibly as soon as year's end
-- many rushed to revel in the strategic plateau's winter wonderlands.
</P>
<P>
	   Liron Parsay, 24, took the day off from her computer job at a communal farm
and was the first Israeli -- besides soldiers and snow plow drivers -- to
venture up the mount.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Suddenly winter is here,'' Parsay said as she pulled her sleeves over her
hands. ``We hadn't seen winter in so long. We had planned to come up ever since
we heard the weather forecast three days ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   The overnight storm dropped more than 32 inches of snow on the slopes, and
the fir trees dipped low with the weight.
</P>
<P>
	   Elazar, the ski shop owner, was so entranced by what he saw as one of the
first Israeli soldiers to ascend the 5,280-foot mountain in 1967, when Israel
captured the heights, that soon he moved his young family from Tel Aviv to the
rustic conditions of the tiny settlement of Neve Ativ.
</P>
<P>
	   He planted an apple orchard and helped expand the tiny ski resort that was
founded in 1970. Nearly 30 years later, the mountain sports nine ski lifts and
45 trails, Elazar has become a fixture -- and the idea of leaving rankles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will take as much money as possible and will go to the Rocky
mountains,'' if the Golan goes back, swore the 52-year old, sitting in a
cafeteria crowded with ski instructors in red, yellow and orange ski parkas. ``I
will be ashamed to stay in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other settlers are equally as emphatic, and have launched a blitz to win the
referendum Barak says he will bring to the Israeli people when he has a deal in
hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Baruch plans to distribute ``The nation is with the Golan'' stickers at the
ski resort in a bid to get pleasure seekers to think seriously about the
consequences of a return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will let people feel the connection between the Hermon site and the
Golan Heights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear what will happen to the homes of the more than 15,000 Israeli
settlers if the land is returned to Syria. The ski resort may seem frivolous to
negotiators discussing weightier issues like security arrangements and water
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Parsay said she trusts Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to bring back
security and peace in exchange for territory -- but she will miss Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think about it even. It's sad to think about the bad
possibilities,'' Parsay said. ``If there will be peace, I imagine I will be able
to come here to visit, perhaps with a passport. I want to see Damascus.''

Republicans Debate Gays in Military
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- At a campaign debate in New Hampshire on Thursday, GOP
presidential contenders had an incendiary exchange over gays in the military.
Gary Bauer said that Democratic stance that homosexuals should serve openly
would further the "radical homosexual agenda," and an animated Alan Keyes said,
"I will return to the ban on homosexuals in the military." Said frontrunner
George W. Bush, "I'm a don't ask, don't tell man." The Clinton administration's
policy, which the president has said has not worked well, is to allow gay
service members if they do not make their sexual orientation known. John McCain
said that policy could be fine-tuned, but he added, "I cannot change a policy
that's working."

<HEADLINE> Astros Sign Gooden to Contract  </HEADLINE>
    By C. BRYSON HULL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Dwight Gooden, once the ace of the New York Mets, is getting
what might be his final chance to pitch in the majors.
</P>
<P>
	   Gooden agreed to minor league contract with the Houston Astros --
essentially a tryout -- on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't hold any illusions of grandeur out that at 35 years old we're going
to see the Doc Gooden of 26 or 28 years old," Astros manager Gerry Hunsicker
said. "But knowing Doc, I'll take my chances while he's on the mound."
</P>
<P>
	   Gooden was 3-4 with a 6.41 ERA last year in 22 starts with the Cleveland
Indians. A shoulder strain hampered him, and Cleveland dropped him from its
postseason roster.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just don't have the velocity I had at one time on a consistent basis,"
Gooden said. "I think now I'm a more complete pitcher, I'm a smarter pitcher."
</P>
<P>
	   Houston is looking to add pitchers after trading Mike Hampton to the Mets
last month. The Astros traded Hampton after he decided against a contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
	   The Astros also needed insurance to protect their pitching depth in case
Scott Elarton isn't ready to return from shoulder surgery in time for next
season.
</P>
<P>
	   Shane Reynolds and Jose Lima, who agreed Wednesday to an $18.75 million,
three-year deal, are the only two pitchers assured of spots. That leaves Gooden
to compete with Chris Holt, newcomer Octavio Dotel and Elarton, if he's ready.
</P>
<P>
	   During his 11 years with the Mets, Gooden's fastball brought him a string of
awards, including Rookie of the Year honors in 1984 and the NL Cy Young Award in
1985. At age 20, he was the youngest-ever Cy Young winner.
</P>
<P>
	   But a drug problem led to two suspensions in 1994, and Gooden was suspended
for the entire 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
	   He returned with the New York Yankees in 1996 and stayed there until joining
the Indians in 1998. With 188-107 record and 3.46 ERA, Gooden is fourth among
active pitchers in wins.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the National League is a better league for him because he can help
himself with the bat more than most pitchers can," Astros manager Larry Dierker
said.

<HEADLINE> FSU's Amato Takes N.C. State Job  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID DROSCHAK AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina State didn't just hire an assistant
coach to be the head football coach for the Wolfpack. They believe Chuck Amato
has been THE assistant.
</P>
<P>
	   Amato left national champion Florida State and the side of Bobby Bowden on
Thursday to accept the head coaching job at his alma mater. He brings years of
experience of running the day-to-day operations of the Seminoles -- who won two
national titles in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're getting a guy who has been running the No. 1 program in America this
decade, the No. 1 program as we sit here right now," Wolfpack athletic director
Les Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowden, who is 70, agreed with Robinson, saying Amato was given plenty of
duties as his top assistant.
</P>
<P>
	   "He loves responsibility," Bowden said of Amato, who was his assistant head
coach for 14 of Amato's 18 years with the Seminoles. "I threw more on him than
any other coach I've had. He was the assistant head coach and that's exactly
what he was."
</P>
<P>
	   Amato, who inherits a 6-6 team, was given a five-year contract with a base
salary of $185,000 a season.
</P>
<P>
	   Amato, 53, admitted that he had slept a total of only six hours in the past
two days. But he had an overflow crowd of 300 Wolfpack alumni and supporters on
the edge of their seats during his emotional return to his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm ready, and I don't care about the scrutiny," said Amato, who has never
been a college head coach. "I'm a tough guy and I don't care."
</P>
<P>
	   Amato said he met with Robinson in Charlotte on Wednesday, and the two
finalized the deal at 2 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted to make sure that they wanted to make the investment," Amato said.
"Poor Les, he didn't realize I had that many questions for him because I had
never been a head coach before. But I have been at this for some time, and every
year I would write a question down. So, I had about 62 of them.
</P>
<P>
	   "I like to look people in the eye to see how they answer questions, to see
their reaction. But I don't think there's any question North Carolina State
University wants to be like Virginia Tech, wants to be like Florida State, wants
to be like Nebraska."
</P>
<P>
	   Amato coached at N.C. State from 1972-1980, then spent two years at Arizona
as defensive coordinator before joining Florida State in 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   It took the Wolfpack six weeks to hire a head coach after Robinson fired
Mike O'Cain on Nov. 24 following a 41-40 record in seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   But Robinson defended the length of the 43-day search, saying Bowden himself
called early in the process to ask if Amato could be allowed to coach against
Virginia Tech in Tuesday's national title game.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson granted that wish.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are part of a corporate group bigger than N.C. State called the Atlantic
Coast Conference," Robinson said. "We really pull for each other, and we had a
team playing for the national championship. It helps put money in our pockets.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was that important to them that he coach in that game. Then I got to
thinking, 'How bad would it be for our head coach to have been the assistant
head coach, on national TV, winning the national championship?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson said he talked to about 12 coaches during the long search, but met
with Amato first and offered him the position.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were so many things I liked about him. I wanted somebody to beat
him," Robinson said. "He was put there as a standard. Nobody beat him."

<HEADLINE> Parnevik Leads Mercedes by a Stroke  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- Jesper Parnevik always seems to play well in the
British Open, which may be why he felt so comfortable in the vicious trade winds
off the coast of Maui for the Mercedes Championship.
</P>
<P>
	   Tiger Woods seems to play well anywhere, which explains why he's in
contention once again.
</P>
<P>
	   While the average score for the first round was 75.03, Parnevik scratched
out nine birdies -- along with a bogey and back-to-back double bogeys -- for a
4-under 69 in the first round of the first tournament of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Similar winds to Carnoustie," Parnevik said. "It was a three-, four-,
five-club wind. Those conditions, you can't think about the swing or anything
like that. You just try to get the ball around the golf course and hope for the
best."
</P>
<P>
	   Players did well Thursday to throw out the yardage book, too. Duffy Waldorf
found that out when his 5-iron from 175 yards wound up 50 yards short, and his
full sand wedge on the next shot didn't make it to the green, either.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought I was never going to get to the hole," said Waldorf, one shot
back after a 70.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, meanwhile, didn't skip a beat after ending the 1999 season on a
spectacular note, winning the last four PGA Tour events and finishing no worse
than seventh in 13 of his last 14 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a bogey on the 17th and missing a birdie opportunity on the
downwind, par-5 18th, Woods still managed a 71 and was two shots out of the
lead, along with Ernie Els. Defending champion David Duval birdied the last two
holes and was among those at 72.
</P>
<P>
	   "You hit some clubs some distances that you're not quite used to," Woods
said. "These conditions, you just have to keep plugging away."
</P>
<P>
	   With gusts up to 40 mph -- and more expected today for the second round --
only eight players managed to break par. That's a stark contrast from a year
ago, when only three players failed to break par on the Plantation Course at
Kapalua.
</P>
<P>
	   That's not the only change.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, Duval used the Mercedes as a springboard to topple Woods as No.
1 in the world, winning by nine strokes with a score of 26-under. This kind of
wind won't allow for anyone to come close to that score.
</P>
<P>
	   And this year, Duval and the rest of the PGA Tour are trying to catch up to
Woods.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're never surprised to see his name on the board now," Waldorf said.
"He's playing at a level that not many have reached out here. All of us have
played at that level, but not for very long."
</P>
<P>
	   A victory at Kapalua would be his fifth in a row, the longest streak since
Ben Hogan won five straight tournaments in 1953.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has to screw up pretty bad not to be up on the leader board," Parnevik
said. "He doesn't have to do everything right to win. And when he does
everything right, he runs away with it."
</P>
<P>
	   Everything went right -- and then everything went wrong -- for Parnevik. He
birdied six of the first 11 holes to open a 4-shot lead.
</P>
<P>
	   "And then the fun began," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He missed the 12th green and three-putted for double bogey, then missed the
green and dumped a chip shot into the bunker for another double bogey on the
13th. Parnevik birdied the next two holes, then chunked a wedge on No. 17 that
led to a bogey.
</P>
<P>
	   An official on the 18th green announced Parnevik as wearing "the wild red
pants," not uncommon for the most eccentric dresser in golf. But that only
prompted a shout from the gallery.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you knock it in the hole, we don't care what color pants you wear,"
someone yelled.
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik's putt veered some 20 feet to the left once it reached the green
and grazed the cup, giving him his ninth birdie of the day and a 1-shot lead.
</P>
<P>
	   By that account, Woods was downright boring.
</P>
<P>
	   Wearing his cap backwards at times to keep it from blowing off, Woods rarely
found trouble on the wide-open fairways, and only the tricky grain on the greens
kept him from gaining more ground. He missed eight birdie putts from 15 feet or
in.
</P>
<P>
	   But any round under par was a good day.
</P>
<P>
	   Rich Beem had a 46 on the back for an 84, while Match Play champion Jeff
Maggert and Ted Tryba also had to sign for a score of 80 or worse.
</P>
<P>
	   If Parnevik didn't already wear a hat with the bill flipped up, the trade
winds would have taken care of that. As whitecaps swept across the Pacific Ocean
below and tree limbs appeared to be on the verge of snapping, it was all the
elite field could do to hang on.
</P>
<P>
	   And these conditions are typical of Kapalua.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this is a normal wind and I had this to play, I'd quit," Hal Sutton said
after a 4-over 77. "I couldn't stand up. I don't know what the skinny people
were doing."

<HEADLINE> Psychological Tests for John Rocker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Braves president Stan Kasten has no plans to abandon
John Rocker, whose comments disparaging immigrants, gays and minorities brought
him widespread condemnation and embarrassment to the team.
</P>
<P>
	   Commissioner Bud Selig on Thursday ordered Rocker to undergo a psychological
evaluation and said in a statement that he will await the results before
deciding on any disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig called Rocker's remarks, published in Sports Illustrated last month,
"reprehensible and completely inexcusable" and said he will take "whatever
additional action that I consider to be necessary" after Rocker's evaluation.
</P>
<P>
	   Kasten said he thought punishment was warranted, and that Rocker likely
would have been suspended indefinitely if his comments had been published during
the season.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kasten said the commissioner's office will decide the punishment, not
the team.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we have here is a player who has expressed remorse. Under those
circumstances, I am not going to abandon a player or an employee or a friend,"
Kasten said.
</P>
<P>
	   A native New Yorker, Kasten said he had a suggestion on how to show the
outspoken Braves reliever the true meaning of his words.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first thing I told John was that the next time he was in New York was
to go to the Statue of Liberty and read the words inscribed there," Kasten said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that in addition to repairing relationships with his teammates,
Rocker must rebuild bridges with management, including general manager John
Shuerholz and executive vice president Hank Aaron, who was furious at the
comments.
</P>
<P>
	   "John has a lot of people to get right with ... me, John, Hank," Kasten
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kasten said the evaluation should begin within days. He said releasing
Rocker remains an option, but is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   "He did have a history of good relationships with players of different races
and different ethnic backgrounds," Kasten said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kasten said baseball officials and the players association decided the
evaluations were appropriate. The two organizations jointly will pick
psychologists to evaluate Rocker.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker's agent, Randy Hendricks, said neither he nor Rocker would comment.
</P>
<P>
	   In his comments to Sports Illustrated, Rocker said he would never play for a
New York team because he didn't want to ride a subway "next to some queer with
AIDS." He also bashed immigrants, saying, "I'm not a very big fan of foreigners
... How the hell did they get in this country?"
</P>
<P>
	   He also called a black teammate "a fat monkey" while insulting Asians and
single mothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker later apologized and said he was not a racist. Kasten said that
Rocker has tried to repair relationships with teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some have been receptive, but he isn't batting a thousand," Kasten said.
"He has tough job ahead of him."
</P>
<P>
	   Several advocacy groups said the written apology and baseball's action thus
far was not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have asked for his termination and still stand by that," Jeff Graham,
executive director of Atlanta's AIDS Survival Project, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta City Councilman Derrick Boazman, who organized a news conference to
speak out against Rocker and the Braves soon after the comments were made
public, said baseball's move was "disappointing."
</P>
<P>
	   "What are they evaluating him for? He's a 37-save guy, and they know he is
psychologically fit to play the game," Boazman said. "Even if he is diminished
mentally, he still made those hate-filled comments."
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker, 25, saved 37 games for the Braves last year, taking over for injured
closer Kerry Ligtenberg. He created a one-man rivalry with the city of New York
during the NL Championship Series, calling Mets fans "stupid" and refusing to
back down in the World Series, when the Braves were swept in four games by the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
	   "We spoke to him during the Mets series about controlling himself and not
showing weakness," Shuerholz said. "He may come out of this a stronger player,
but we'll have to see."

	   Baseball lawyer Rob Manfred, on the witness stand Thursday, blamed the MLUA
for cutting short a Dec. 7 meeting to discuss the plight of 22 umpires who were
let go Sept. 2, the result of a failed mass resignation scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   Manfred said he was surprised MLUA lawyer Pat Campbell wouldn't discuss the
22 before bargaining on a new contract for all umpires.
</P>
<P>
	   "He believed if we could reach a global resolution, he could get all the
umpires back into a group," Manfred said.
</P>
<P>
	   Manfred said the MLUA had just lost a vote 57-35 to a group of insurgent
umpires who had formed their own union, and he hoped he could receive assurances
that umpires would support a deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, he said, baseball would be left "holding the bag" because it
would be forced to begin negotiating with the victorious Major League Umpires
Independent Organizing Committee as soon as the vote was certified.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearing office Dale L. Leach III told the sides to submit briefs by Jan. 13,
and said he expects to rule within a week after that whether to uphold the
election. The losing side could appeal to the five-man NLRB in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the hearing, Campbell said Manfred was not accurate when he
described how the Philadelphia meeting ended. He said it actually concluded
abruptly because Manfred said he had to catch a train back to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   During his testimony, Manfred insisted that no one from baseball had ever
negotiated on behalf of umpires with the insurgent MLUIOC or anyone besides
Phillips' MLUA.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he had negotiated on Nov. 15 with Campbell and others about a new
contract for umpires, discussing subjects such as tenure, five-man crews and
whether AL and NL umps could be combined on crews.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were no formal proposals made and, frankly, we were a little
surprised about that," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   During cross examination, Manfred said baseball had not prepared a formal
proposal yet for umpires because it had not received a formal proposal from
umpires on what they want.

<HEADLINE> Gene Budig Resigns As AL President  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Gene Budig, his job about to become extinct, resigned as
American League president and was appointed a senior adviser to baseball
commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
	   Budig's counterpart, Len Coleman, announced Sept. 15 that he was resigning
as National League president, effective Oct. 31. Coleman also became a senior
adviser to Selig.
</P>
<P>
	   Owners intend to disband the American and National leagues as legal entities
later this month and consolidate their functions in the commissioner's office.
Budig and Coleman have contracts running through December 2002 and will continue
to be paid their $650,000 annual salaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Budig, a former chancellor at Kansas, will consult on matters involving
government relations, ballpark construction, educational programs and charities,
the commissioner's office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Sept. 15 owners meeting in Cooperstown, Selig originally said
Budig was offered the job of senior vice president for educational and
government affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Owners intend to approve the abolition of the AL and NL when they meet Jan.
20 at Phoenix. The move will not affect the alignment of the leagues or their
divisions, only their business affairs.

<HEADLINE> Necaxa 1, Manchester United 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- When it comes to big games, David Beckham
sees red -- as in red cards.
</P>
<P>
	   Beckham was ejected for violent play in the 42nd minute Thursday as European
champion Manchester United opened play in the first FIFA World Club Championship
by tying Mexico's Necaxa 1-1
</P>
<P>
	   Beckham, tossed during England's second-round loss to Argentina in the 1998
World Cup, was expelled by Argentine referee Horacio Elizondo after the English
forward missed the ball and kicked Jose Milian.
</P>
<P>
	   FIFA said Beckham will miss Manchester United's game against Vasco da Gama
on Saturday and that the disciplinary committee will meet to decide if the
suspension should be extended.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reaction of the Mexican players got him sent off," Manchester United
coach Alex Ferguson said. "The referee reacted to the Mexican players and that's
disappointing. It was a 50-50 ball and they both had their feet in the air."
</P>
<P>
	   Beckham is married to the singer Posh Spice, whose real name is Victoria
Adams.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago, he appeared in court in England accused of speeding and
pleaded innocent, stating that the reason he was over the speed limit was
because he was trying to escape from a media photographer.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, his wife said on live television her husband occasionally
liked to wear her underwear, likely to make him the target of jokes back home.
</P>
<P>
	   The ejection brought back memories of the 1998 World Cup, when he was
ejected for a kick at Argentina's Diego Simeone. That came just after halftime
and England was forced to play with 10 men for 75 minutes, losing on penalty
kicks following a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, Manchester United trailed 1-0 at the time of his ejection.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian Montecinos put the Mexican team ahead in the 14th minute with a
free kick over a defensive wall.
</P>
<P>
	   Alex Aguinaga could have made it 2-0 in the 58th minute but he made a weak
penalty kick that goalkeeper Mark Bosnich easily saved.
</P>
<P>
	   Dwight Yorke had a chance to tie the score in the 80th minute, when
Manchester United was awarded a penalty kick but goalkeeper Hugo Pineda knocked
it away with a brilliant save.
</P>
<P>
	   Yorke then tied the score in the 82nd minute, beating Pineda off a cross
from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
</P>
<P>
	   In the second game of the Group B doubleheader, Brazil's Vasco da Gama beat
Australia's South Melbourne 2-0 on goals by Felipe in the 52nd minute and
Edmundo in the 85th.
</P>
<P>
	   In Group A play today at Sao Paulo, Spain's Real Madrid faced Brazil's
Corinthians, and Saudi Arabia's Al-Nassr played Morocco's Raja.

<HEADLINE> Bakke Is New World Cup Slalom Leader  </HEADLINE>
By VANIA GRANDI-
Associated Press Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIBOR, Slovenia (AP) -- Norway's Trine Bakke, the new World Cup slalom
leader, faces fierce competition in the race for the title.
</P>
<P>
	Bakke vaulted atop the slalom standings Thursday when she charged down a World
Cup slalom course to capture her first season victory and her second ever.
</P>
<P>
	She surpassed Croat sensation Janica Kostelic, who is sidelined with a knee
injury suffered last month in a downhill crash.
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to win the slalom World Cup title,'' Bakke said. ``I hope to be on
the podium in every race.''
</P>
<P>
	But it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
	Close at the Norwegian's heels are France's Christel Saioni, Austrian Sabine
Egger and Slovenian Spela Pretnar. All are within 75 points, less than the 100
points awarded for a win.
</P>
<P>
	Bakke and her three rivals have each taken home one slalom trophy this season.
The 18-year-old Kostelic won two before she was hurt.
</P>
<P>
	``This makes the races more exciting for fans,'' Bakke said. ``The title is
wide open.''
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegian attacked the twisty slalom course Thursday, posting the quickest
time in both runs and finishing nearly a second ahead of Pretnar.
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Pretnar was very close after the first run,'' said Bakke, whose
combined time was 1 minute, 41.90 seconds. ``I was under pressure to beat her.''
</P>
<P>
	Pretnar, cheered wildly by some 12,000 fans who lined the course, crossed the
finish line in 1:42.77.
</P>
<P>
	``I am surprised I managed to stay focused in front of these huge crowds,''
Pretnar said. ``It shows I am very stable psychologically, which gives me a lot
of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
	Skiing is the national sport in this tiny country, and athletes are under great
pressure to perform.
</P>
<P>
	Egger, winner of last week's slalom in Lienz, Austria, was third in 1:42.99.
</P>
<P>
	A slalom specialist, Bakke, 24, won the bronze medal in slalom at the Vail
World Championships last year.
</P>
<P>
	Her only World Cup triumph prior to Thursday was in slalom last year in St.
Anton, Austria.
</P>
<P>
	American Sarah Schleper scored a personal best Thursday, finishing seventh.
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Michaela Dorfmeister maintained her overall World Cup lead, ahead of
teammate Renate Goetschl, last year's World Cup downhill champion.
</P>
<P>
	The women next compete in a giant slalom and slalom in Berchtesgaden, Germany,
this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Wolters Chosen for US Women's Team  </HEADLINE>
    By CHUCK SCHOFFNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Now that she's finally a member of the U.S. women's basketball team, Kara
Wolters still has plenty of incentive.
</P>
<P>
	   All she has to do is look at coach Nell Fortner.
</P>
<P>
	   Fortner, who'll take over as coach of the WNBA's new Indiana Fever following
the Olympics this fall, took Wolters in the league's expansion draft last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolters, added to the national team by USA Basketball on Thursday, doesn't
want to let her down.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it says a lot knowing that she leaves me with the U.S. team and
also drafted me to Indiana," said Wolters, who was an All-American at
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's definitely a confidence thing. To know that a coach, who's a great
coach, is that positive and confident in me, that really means a lot to me and
it makes me want to work even harder for her and for the team."
</P>
<P>
	   Wolters, a 6-foot-7 center, has been practicing with the team since
September. She became its 11th member, leaving one more spot to be filled. The
team, which resumes training in Miami tonight, is expected to become the Olympic
team next summer.
</P>
<P>
	   The selection committee was impressed with Wolters' most striking feature --
her size.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's a very good day for our team," Fortner said. "Kara has so much
USA Basketball experience. She brings a different element to the floor with her
size that we need on this team."
</P>
<P>
	   Wolters, who played for Fortner on the 1998 world championship team, has
averaged three points and 2.3 rebounds in 15 games with the national team, which
will leave for a European tour later this month. She played with the WNBA's
Houston Comets last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Her selection means that two of the game's premier players, Cynthia Cooper
and Sheryl Swoopes, are still not on the U.S. team. Cooper, who has led the
Houston Comets to all three WNBA championships, withdrew from the national team
in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Swoopes played on the 1996 Olympic team. Cooper played in the 1988 and 1992
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
	   Karen Stromme, who chairs the selection committee, said the group will
discuss candidates for the 12th spot on the team in a conference call next week.
But she said the committee might not make a decision then.
</P>
<P>
	   "Training time is vital," Stromme said. "We would like to as soon as the
committee feels it could reach a unanimous decision. The sooner the better.
However, not at the expense of making a decision just to get somebody to train."
</P>
<P>
	   Stromme said the committee has a "short list" of players it is considering,
but would not reveal any names.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of very talented players," she said. "But our committee's
challenge is not necessarily to put an All-Star team together, but rather the
best team that's going to win in Sydney."

<HEADLINE> Skins Need To Give Johnson Space  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins have vivid memories of Brad
Johnson under siege in the Pontiac Silverdome.
</P>
<P>
	   When the Redskins lost to the Detroit Lions 33-17 five weeks ago, Johnson
was sacked five times. The offensive line, discombobulated by the dome crowd,
was plagued by false starts, holding penalties and coach Norv Turner's
determination to pass the ball against the Lions' depleted secondary.
</P>
<P>
	   Defensive end Robert Porcher, who had 15 sacks in the regular season, made
right tackle Jon Jansen look like the rookie he is.
</P>
<P>
	   "He got inside of me a couple of times, he got around the end," Jansen said.
"I learned a lot about him. I learned a lot about myself."
</P>
<P>
	   Jansen gets another shot at Porcher, but this time it'll be outdoors, when
the Lions and Redskins meet Saturday in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "There'll be a lot of things I'll do differently," Jansen said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the final whistle of the Detroit-Washington game on Dec. 5, the Lions
were leading the Central Division and seemed headed for a high playoff seed,
while the Redskins were left wondering if they would collapse altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   How things have changed. The Lions (8-8) haven't won since, while the
Redskins (10-6) won the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
	   "I do think it helped us, as bad as it sounds, by taking the beating that we
did," Johnson said. "So I don't think there will be any happy faces around here
until after the game. In a sense, I think that could help us from a preparation
standpoint."
</P>
<P>
	   Neither team has much to brag about. The Redskins beat only one team with a
winning record this season, and that was the season-ending Miami game when the
Dolphins rested many of their starters. The Lions have not been a good team away
from their dome, losing five in a row and six of eight on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you start to lose a little bit like we've done, there's a confidence
factor that you have to regain," Detroit coach Bobby Ross said. "And I think
that's what we're working on right now."
</P>
<P>
	   The Redskins will have not only momentum and the home field on their side
Saturday, they'll have history. No 8-8 team has ever won a playoff game, and the
Lions are 0-17 on the road against the Redskins since the franchise moved from
Boston to Washington in 1937.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lions were regular playoff participants in the 1990s -- this is their
fifth postseason appearance in seven years -- while the Redskins are breaking a
seven-year playoff drought. Even so, Washington has the more recent playoff
victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lions have stumbled at the first playoff hurdle four straight times.
They haven't won a postseason game since January 1992, when they beat Dallas and
then lost to eventual Super Bowl champion Washington. The Redskins returned to
the playoffs the following season, won one game and hadn't been back since until
now.
</P>
<P>
	   All that history is well known to former Redskins quarterback Gus Frerotte,
who will start for the Lions. When asked about it, Frerotte pointed to a more
relevant bit of recent history -- that 33-17 game.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know we're playing the same Redskins we played up here," Frerotte said.
</P>
<P>
	   Frerotte is starting ahead of Charlie Batch, who reinjured his broken thumb
in final regular-season game. Frerotte also started the first game and had
success throwing upfield against a Redskins defense ranked next-to-last in the
league.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to make the big plays," Frerotte said, "because our running game's
not there."
</P>
<P>
	   Ross said he would try fullback Cory Schlesinger at the tailback spot this
week to jump-start a running game that's almost been nonexistent since the
departure of Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
	   The key to the game, though, could be how Jansen and rest the Redskins
offensive line fare against Porcher and the Lions' front four. Turner has vowed
to run the ball more this game, but that strategy might be hampered by an injury
to Stephen Davis, the NFC's leading rusher. Davis sprained an ankle 2 1/2 weeks
ago and returned to practice this week. He won't be 100 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to run the ball for four quarters," Turner said. "But we've got to
make the plays in the passing game we didn't make the first game."

<HEADLINE> Andre Reed Criticizes Bills on Web  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo Bills wide receiver Andre Reed is an
angry man. He's angry at management over his diminished role on the team, and
he's even angry at benched quarterback Doug Flutie.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed, who said in early December that the best thing for him would be to
keep his mouth shut about his lack of playing time, apparently no longer feels
that way.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15-year veteran of four Super Bowls let his feelings boil over again on
his Internet site. His journal on Tuesday revealed more disappointment, and it
came only two days after he moved into second place on the NFL list of career
receptions with 945, behind only Jerry Rice of the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't just a happy moment for me, but also frustration," Reed wrote.
"The five balls that I did catch weren't even routes, and that just makes me
look bad, like they have to give me charity throws. They've just been throwing
me bones to keep me happy, but I'm not happy at all.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the franchise realizes that, and they know that I don't want to be
here anymore," Reed continued. "You look at the game Monday night with Jerry in
San Francisco. The 49ers still respect Jerry, and whether it was his last game
in that uniform or not, I think he went out the way he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here, they haven't given me that freedom and respect. I'm sure San
Francisco wouldn't do that to Jerry Rice. It'll be a chip on my shoulder for a
long, long time. I think I can start fresh somewhere else and offer a team
something next year and hopefully go out the way I want to."
</P>
<P>
	   Reed also passed former Seattle Seahawks star Steve Largent and took over
fourth place on the NFL's yards receiving list with 13,095. Coach Wade Phillips
said that getting Reed the records was one of the goals, but that did little to
placate the veteran star.
</P>
<P>
	   "People around here think that I'm retiring, and that Sunday was my last
game, but it wasn't!" Reed wrote. "At this point I just want to go where I'm
appreciated and respected, and I haven't had that here."
</P>
<P>
	   Reed also said he hopes the Bills give him his unconditional release after
the playoffs, and thinks they will.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's obvious I'm not in their future plans, and I can't subject my family
or myself to that anymore. It's time for me to move on. Believe me, I'll be
happier. I was not a happy football player this year; it was very miserable
going to work every day."
</P>
<P>
	   Reed finished the season with 52 catches for 536 yards and only one
touchdown, and his longest reception was 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   With the emergence of Eric Moulds, who led the team with 65 catches for 994
yards and seven touchdowns, and the promise of rookie Peerless Price (31 catches
for 393 yards and three TDs), Reed's frustration at playing a minor role now is
understandable.
</P>
<P>
	   But with at least one more game to play this season -- on Saturday at
Tennessee -- Reed still planned on playing a prominent role, even if it isn't
running routes and catching important passes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully, we're on a winning note next week!" he wrote. "It's a 12-team
tournament now. I think a lot of the young guys will be looking to Thurman
Thomas, Bruce Smith and myself (for leadership), and I'm glad I can be looked to
in that regard."
</P>
<P>
	   Reed also vented on offensive coordinator Joe Pendry and Flutie, who has
been replaced by Rob Johnson for Saturday's game after starting the first 15
games of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   "You may have heard that I am not on speaking terms with Doug Flutie," Reed
wrote. "Doug Flutie has changed as a person over one year, and Joe Pendry has
had a plan for me from Day 1. You don't do that to people because it comes back
to bite you."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Flutie's Internet journal dealt with his benching, and there was
no grousing.
</P>
<P>
	   "I definitely want to be in the game and help us get to the Super Bowl,"
Flutie wrote. "But I unconditionally accept the decision Coach Phillips has
made."

<HEADLINE> Titans Look To Finally Beat Buffalo  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee Titans safety Marcus Robertson, with 150
stitches in his face following a motorcycle crash, still wants to play in the
AFC playoffs Saturday against the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to be out there because this team is the best team I've been a part
of, and I think our chances to win the Super Bowl are good," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't happen very often, and it's been five years since we've been to
the playoffs. I know it's my opportunity right now to try to seize the moment."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans won a franchise-record 13 games this season, and their 13-3
record is the best ever not to win a division. The Titans will play host to
Buffalo (11-5) Saturday in a game that already has a place in NFL history for
having two teams with the most combined wins in a wild-card game.
</P>
<P>
	   Bills defensive end Bruce Smith said it was disappointing that Buffalo and
Tennessee didn't have easier opponents to open the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sure both teams are going to give the fans their money's worth," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's game will be the first time these teams have met in the playoffs
since that infamous 38-35 overtime game on Jan. 3, 1993, when the Houston Oilers
(who later moved to Tennessee) blew a 32-point lead to the Bills. Fans recently
voted it the league's fifth-most memorable game.
</P>
<P>
	   Only six former Oilers remain on the roster for Tennessee, and they have
been answering questions about that game all week. They all agree that the game
is ancient history.
</P>
<P>
	   "I liken it to when I was in the seventh grade, the first year I ever played
tackle football," left guard Bruce Matthews said. "I broke my leg, and it hurt
bad. God gives you the ability to lock out ugly, negative things in your life. I
guess that's what happened with that."
</P>
<P>
	   If the Titans get that kind of lead again, they won't blow it this time.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we could make the outcome a little different this go-around,"
Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith admitted that the game, which sent the Bills onto their third straight
Super Bowl appearance, isn't something he thinks of much. He thinks Buffalo's
defense, the best in the NFL, will be too busy dealing with a Titans offense
that has topped 40 points in each of its last two games.
</P>
<P>
	   McNair finally has found his rhythm, throwing six TD passes in his last five
quarters, and the Titans went 7-2 against the NFL's best defenses.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Titans take a lead, Smith expects them to use Eddie George, who ran
for 1,304 yards this season, to play keepaway.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to make sure we play the most disciplined game we've ever had
to play with these two guys in the backfield," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bills will take the field with Rob Johnson at quarterback instead of the
benched Doug Flutie. Johnson, who will be making his first playoff start, was
impressive Sunday in throwing for 287 yards against the Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson said he was glad Tennessee had only one game film to study him.
Titans safety Blaine Bishop said their lack of familiarity with Johnson easily
counters Flutie's ability to create magic.
</P>
<P>
	   "From one game, it's kind of hard to say what Rob Johnson likes to do, what
he leans on when it gets tough. So it will be very interesting," Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
	   It won't be easy with Adelphia Coliseum sold out and fans in a frenzy over
the first playoff game in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   Titans rookie end Jevon Kearse, who led the AFC with 14 1/2 sacks, said the
game offers Tennessee a chance to prove the franchise can play against Buffalo
in the playoffs. Houston was 0-2 in its previous two playoff games with the
Bills.
</P>
<P>
	   "We owe it to the organization," Kearse said.

<HEADLINE> Colts' Bennett Hopes To Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Reports that linebacker Cornelius Bennett, the leading
tackler for the Indianapolis Colts this season, will miss the playoffs with a
knee injury might have been premature.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett, who started all 16 games, tore the medial collateral ligament in
his left knee and also stretched his posterior cruciate ligament when he was
blocked Sunday by Buffalo's Antowain Smith on the Bills' opening offensive play.
</P>
<P>
	   "The swelling is dissipating every day, and the soreness is dissipating,"
Bennett said after watching the Colts practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm optimistic. I normally heal fast. The way I'm healing right now is
pretty good. We'll re-evaluate on Monday," Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts have a first-round bye in the playoffs and will play either
Seattle, Buffalo or Tennessee in the RCA Dome on Jan. 16. Bennett said he was
optimistic about playing in that game.
</P>
<P>
	   "If not next week, hopefully we can win and I'll get a chance to play the
following week," Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett said his MCL was torn and that the PCL was only stretched. It had
been feared that both ligaments were torn.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm doing what they are asking me to do, and even a little more.
Flexibility-wise, it is pretty good. I'm a little sore, but I'm hoping for next
week," said Bennett, who had 114 tackles during the season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am not one of those guys who doesn't listen to the doctors, but if there
is any possibility that I can get out on the field, I'll be there."
</P>
<P>
	   At 34 and in his 13th season, Bennett said he's motivated to earn a Super
Bowl championship. He is the only player in league history to be on the losing
side in five Super Bowl games -- four with Buffalo and one last January with
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   If he can't play, Bennett is confident Bertrand Berry or Ratcliff Thomas can
be a capable replacement.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're young guys. Bertrand, he's played some. He has started in the past,
so it's not a totally new thing to him," Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, 12 of Berry's 13 starts were last year as a defensive end, and his
only start at linebacker was as a rookie in 1997. Until he replaced Bennett on
Sunday, Berry had only five tackles on defense this season. He had four more
against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told him he's just got to step up and be the man. No one expected me to
come in and play the way I did this season, except for myself," Bennett said. "I
came in and made an impact, and he can do the same thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett, signed as an unrestricted free agent after being cut last year by
Atlanta, has been a vital member of an improved defensive unit that helped the
Colts produce the biggest turnaround in NFL history. After finishing 3-13 in
1998, the Colts won the AFC East championship at 13-3.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know my body and I've overcome a lot in my career on and off the field,"
said Bennett, who has more playoff experience than any other member of the team.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is another obstacle and I can hurdle it, even if one leg is not so
good," he said. "If I can move, then I'm going to be out there. I feel me at
60-70 percent is better than a lot of guys at 100 percent."

<HEADLINE> Vikes' George Wants What Aikman Has  </HEADLINE>
    By ARNIE STAPLETON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Jeff George silenced his critics by guiding the
Minnesota Vikings into the playoffs after Randall Cunningham lost his touch.
</P>
<P>
	   Next, George will try to erase the stigma of having never won a playoff game
in his eventful decade in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the best supporting cast I've ever been around, and I'm excited
about that," said George, whose checkered career includes a loss in his only
other playoff appearance, at Green Bay in 1995 when he was with the Atlanta
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
	   George said he feels like the last three regular-season games, all Vikings
victories, were similar to the playoffs because they were do-or-die.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every game's been big for us. We felt like these last three, four weeks
have been playoff games for us," George said.
</P>
<P>
	   George, who got run out of Indianapolis, Atlanta and Oakland, leaving a
trail of annoyed teammates, coaches and fans, signed a one-year contract with
the Vikings for the veterans minimum of $400,000 last winter.
</P>
<P>
	   He took over Minnesota's prolific offense when Cunningham struggled to match
the magic of last season and was benched only 5 1/2 games into his new $28
million contract.
</P>
<P>
	   George, who was 37-74 as a starter before this season, piloted the Vikings
(10-6) to an 8-2 record and a wild-card berth Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys
(8-8) at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with his newfound success, which earned him about $1 million more in
incentives, George's me-first attitude was absent in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's nothing to prove," George said. "This team's proved it. It's not
me. We're 8-2 as a team. Not one guy can do it. I'm just around a great group of
guys, a great supporting cast and just trying to win like the other guys."
</P>
<P>
	   George could command about $6 million a year now that he's turned around his
troubled career. But he knows what would truly vindicate him: a Super Bowl ring.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman, who has three Super Bowl rings, said
quarterbacks are judged chiefly on the number of titles they win.
</P>
<P>
	   "All you've got to do is look at guys who have great playoff success who
haven't won a Super Bowl and that's a tag that they get hit with," Aikman said.
"And I don't think that's necessarily fair. But as a quarterback, ultimately
that's how we're all judged."
</P>
<P>
	   George said he doesn't feel any pressure to prove himself in the postseason,
though.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's important to the team, not just me," he said. "That's the team goal.
Just getting to the playoffs is one thing, but to win in the playoffs and to win
a Super Bowl? Not many guys can say that, so that should be every player's
goal."
</P>
<P>
	   Aikman agreed that George, who threw for 23 touchdowns and just 12
interceptions, has great ability even though he's never won in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Jeff is as talented a quarterback as there is in the league,"
Aikman said. "He's got tremendous arm strength. He can make all the throws and
he's got good mobility within the pocket. There seems to be some turmoil that's
surrounded his career. But I think he's an awfully talented player."
</P>
<P>
	   All season, George refused to talk about his troubled past, which includes a
sideline spat with then-Falcons coach June Jones in 1996, and he doesn't much
like talking about his future and where his next big paycheck will come from.
</P>
<P>
	   But the opportunity to keep throwing to Cris Carter and Randy Moss, who
combined for 2,654 yards receiving, the second-highest total in NFL history,
could keep George in purple and gold for a long time.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the perfect offense for me," George said of the seventh system he's
run since entering the league as its top draft choice in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter said he just hopes the Vikings can fit George in under their cap.
</P>
<P>
	   "Even though we haven't played even a full season together, I think that we
have tremendous chemistry," Carter said.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks' Kennedy Ready for Playoffs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- In his 10 pro seasons, Cortez Kennedy of the Seattle
Seahawks has been the NFL Defensive Player of the Year, an eight-time Pro Bowl
defensive tackle and has earned more money than he can possibly spend.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, this Sunday will be special. After 151 regular-season games, Kennedy
will play in his first playoff game when the Seahawks meet the Miami Dolphins in
the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never in my life have had so many ticket requests," Kennedy said. "That's
one of the reasons why I'm not answering my phone this week."
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy was the third player chosen in the 1990 draft, after quarterback
Jeff George by Indianapolis and running back Blair Thomas by the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, when Kennedy was the NFL Defensive Player of the Year, the Seahawks
won a franchise-low two games. He played so well and so hard that he stood out
on a 2-14 team.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Holmgren, Seattle's first-year coach, is Kennedy's fourth with the
Seahawks. He played two seasons under Chuck Knox, three under Tom Flores and
four under Dennis Erickson before Holmgren arrived from Green Bay in January.
</P>
<P>
	   "It feels great," said a smiling Kennedy. "Usually, I'm talking about going
deer hunting right now. Well, I can put that on hold. I can't wait until Sunday.
This is 50 times better than going to the Pro Bowl. I can't imagine how I'm
going to feel when I step on the field Sunday. This is something I've been
waiting on a long time."
</P>
<P>
	   It almost didn't happen. After 10 games, the Seahawks were 8-2 with a
five-game winning streak and a three-game lead in the AFC West.
</P>
<P>
	   Then they lost five of their final six games in a tailspin that almost cost
them the second division title in team history. They reached the playoffs last
Sunday when Kansas City lost in overtime to Oakland after the Seahawks were
beaten 19-9 by the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't wait to get that bad taste out of my mouth," Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy is popular with his teammates and well-liked by players on opposing
teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell Maryland, one of his best friends and a former college teammate at
Miami, is a defensive tackle with Oakland who helped beat the Chiefs and get
Kennedy and the Seahawks into the playoffs. He plans to be in the Kingdome on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy has been making some phone calls himself this week. He placed a call
to Chiefs defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, an old friend who used to play
with the Raiders, to needle him unmercifully about Kansas City missing the
playoffs. All in good humor, of course.
</P>
<P>
	   "I won't mess with Russell about not going to the playoffs," Kennedy added.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy, a Pro Bowler again this season, and Pro Bowl linebacker Chad Brown
were elected captains of Seattle's defense for the playoffs. It's an honor the
low-key Kennedy didn't seek, but it's a responsibility he knows he needs to
fulfill.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't like to be thought of as a leader. But, hey, this is OK. This is
the time I need to step up. But I don't believe at yelling at anybody. I'll tell
the guys, 'You know what you have to do.' I don't have to be ranting and
screaming," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy is turning over his $16,000 paycheck for Sunday's game to two
charities close: the Jerome Brown and Payne Stewart foundations. Brown, also a
defensive tackle, played with Kennedy at Miami and died in a car accident in
1992, while Stewart, a top golfer, died in a plane crash last year. Stewart's
agent, Robert Fraley, who also was Kennedy's agent, also died in the crash.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Hope Healthy Deion Will Help  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Without a healthy Deion Sanders to cover Randy Moss or
Cris Carter, the Minnesota Vikings have had no problem torching the Dallas
Cowboys' secondary.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders hopes things will be different Sunday now that he's healthy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm better this time," Sanders said. "I think it will allow us to do more
things and not just sit back and wait on what they're going to do. We'll be able
to force them into situations.
</P>
<P>
	   "But even if you had Lester Hayes and Mike Haynes, I don't know if you'd
have enough talent to match up with those guys."
</P>
<P>
	   Moss caught three touchdown passes totaling 163 yards and Carter had seven
catches for 135 yards as Minnesota beat Dallas 46-36 on Thanksgiving 1998.
Sanders missed that game with a toe injury that required offseason surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the NFL's most productive tandem combined for 15 catches, three
touchdowns and 207 yards as the Vikings scored the final 27 points after falling
behind 17-0. Sanders, considered the NFL's best cover cornerback, limped through
the game with hamstring and groin problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes are higher for Round 3.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, it's a first-round playoff game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going to do my best," Sanders said, smiling. "We're going to have a
good time."
</P>
<P>
	   While fans would love to see Sanders and Moss go head-to-head on every snap,
Dallas coaches won't allow it. They prefer mixing up their coverages to avoid
being predictable.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Sanders mostly will line up on the right side of the defense, often
before Minnesota is out of its huddle. Once quarterbacks stand over the center,
they make sure to find Sanders.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff George sure did two months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 15 times Sanders lined up against Moss, George went that way only
twice. The matchup was a draw as Sanders knocked down a long pass and Moss had
an 8-yard catch.
</P>
<P>
	   "Deion's unbelievable," George said. "When he's not healthy, he's
unbelievable. Just his presence on the field is unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
	   "But that doesn't mean you shy away from the guy. We have every bit of
confidence in our receivers and our running game."
</P>
<P>
	   The respect teams show Sanders shifts pressure to the other side of the
field. And that's where Dallas has been vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
	   Injuries to would-be starter Kevin Smith and top backup Kevin Mathis have
increased the playing time of converted safety Charlie Williams and undrafted
rookie Duane Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
	   Although whoever is out there gets help from a safety, it's not always
enough.
</P>
<P>
	   The back of Williams' jersey is all over the videotape from the last game
against the Vikings, especially on Moss' big plays. Teams also have started
picking on Hawthorne, who is listed generously at 5-foot-10.
</P>
<P>
	   The good news for the Cowboys is that Smith and Mathis both might be back
for the first time since the previous Vikings game. Each has been in and out of
the lineup since then.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought the guys who were on the field the two previous times were not
healthy," Dallas coach Chan Gailey said. "So even if Kevin Smith and Kevin
Mathis don't make it back, at least the guys who are on the field will be 100
percent. We'll gain an advantage there. Then if we get either of those guys
back, it'll help our chances of being able to match up."
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders is glad to have help and he's happy to be healthy himself.
</P>
<P>
	   But there's one more thing he'd like to see.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish our offense would let that clock tick down to the last second before
we snap every ball," he said, "because the more you keep those guys off the
field, the less opportunities they have."

<HEADLINE> Johnson May Coach Final Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- If Jimmy Johnson and Dan Marino are closing out their Miami
careers, they'd rather it not happen on Sunday when the Dolphins and Seattle
Seahawks -- each with five losses in their last six games -- meet in the NFL
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Somebody is going to have a real good news conference come next Monday,"
said Johnson, who is in his fourth season as coach of the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Marino: "We're disappointed. Now, we feel we've got a reprieve."
</P>
<P>
	   The Seahawks (9-7) and the Dolphins (9-7) both reached the playoffs on the
final day of the season, when they both lost for the fifth time in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seahawks' 19-9 loss to the New York Jets last Sunday put the Dolphins in
the playoffs and apparently dropped Seattle out of them. Then, 50 minutes later,
Kansas City lost in overtime to Oakland, and the Seahawks were in.
</P>
<P>
	   When the AFC West champion Seahawks and the wild-card Dolphins meet, it will
be the final game in the Kingdome, which is being torn down for a new football
stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seahawks are in the playoffs for the first time since 1988, ending the
longest playoff drought in the league. The Dolphins haven't won a playoff game
on the road since 1974.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dolphins, who won seven of eight in the first half of this season, lost
to the Jets 38-31 at home and 21-10 at Washington in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously, I'd like to have 11 or 12 wins. We don't. We've got nine wins.
But we're in the playoffs," said Johnson, who won two Super Bowls in five
seasons as coach of the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel we're a better team than our record," said Marino, who is still
looking to win his first Super Bowl in his 17 seasons with the Dolphins. "We let
it slip for awhile."
</P>
<P>
	   Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren, who previously coached at Green Bay, has never
lost a playoff game at home. If he extends that record to 6-0, Sunday's game
might be the last for Johnson and Marino.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino might choose to retire and Johnson might step away from coaching. He
also is the team's general manager.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino faced the Seahawks in the playoffs as a rookie in 1983 and again in
1984. He likes his team's chances against a Seattle team that went in reverse
after going 8-2.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we win three games, we're in the Super Bowl," said Marino, who played
and lost in the 1985 Super Bowl against San Francisco. "When we play well, we
can beat anybody."
</P>
<P>
	   And Johnson said: "I like our chances."
</P>
<P>
	   A lot of teams liked their chances in the final six weeks against the
Seahawks. Jon Kitna, in his first season as a full-time starting quarterback,
threw 10 interceptions during those six games and couldn't produce a touchdown
in two of them.
</P>
<P>
	   Against the Jets, the Seahawks had to settle for three field goals by Todd
Peterson.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricky Watters, Seattle's running back, started against the Jets despite a
sprained right knee and had 30 yards on nine carries. Holmgren, probably fearing
that Ahman Green would fumble the ball in a crucial situation, gave Watters'
backup one carry.
</P>
<P>
	   Watters' knee is still bothering him and Holmgren said he won't be 100
percent for the Dolphins' game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've got to be more cautious with the football in these playoff games and
understand that's what wins them," said Kitna, thinking past Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Kitna hopes to get a lot more help from Watters, but conceded that might not
happen. So he's prepared to pass the ball more often this week.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not going to say, 'Wow, we need the running game to win,' " Kitna said.
"I don't think that's the case. Certainly that helps you win. But when you throw
the ball 45 times, you have to be more efficient and I wasn't efficient in the
later parts of the third quarter or the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to be more efficient and use the passing game as the running game.
But it sure makes things easier if you have the running game going."
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's game will be a homecoming for Dolphins backup quarterback Damon
Huard, who played at the University of Washington. Damon's younger brother,
Brock, another former Huskies quarterback, is a rookie with the Seahawks, but
won't be active for the game because he's the third-string quarterback behind
Kitna and Glenn Foley.
</P>
<P>
	   The Huard brothers will have 25 family members, including their parents and
friends, in the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
	   Damon Huard got five starts when Marino was sidelined with a neck injury
this season.

<HEADLINE> Military Housing Raise Proposed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (AP) -- Lance Cpl. Matt Alandt ran into a stark
reality when he transferred to Camp Pendleton and sought off-base housing with
his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
	   Rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Oceanside, north of San Diego, was $725.
His monthly housing stipend from the Marine Corps was $623.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's pretty tough,'' said Alandt, 21, of Boise, Idaho, who moved back on
base this year. ``You live paycheck to paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
	   Relief may be on the way for the more than half of the 1.4 million members
of the military who receive monthly stipends for off-base housing. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said Thursday that the Clinton administration will look
to spend $3 billion over five years to end a requirement that military members
pay 15 percent of their off-base housing costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can never pay you what you're worth to this country,'' Cohen told the
Marines at Camp Pendleton. But ``we can pay you more than we have been paying.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal, part of the president's 2001 military budget request, is part
of a campaign to make military life more attractive by increasing pay and
benefits. In recent years, the Pentagon has had trouble recruiting new members
and retaining those already in uniform.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen reminded the Marines that their base pay rose 4.8 percent on Jan. 1,
and that many will get additional increases of as much as 5.5 percent on July 1.
He said he also would seek ways to improve military health care, but gave no
specifics.
</P>
<P>
	   The stipend varies depending on location, rank, marital status and number of
children.
</P>
<P>
	   On-base housing is free, but is in short supply nationwide. And 200,000 of
the 300,000 units are considered substandard and in need of replacement or
repair.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, many choose to live off-base so spouses can be closer to their
jobs.

<HEADLINE> Relief Sought on Off-Base Housing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (AP) -- Lance Cpl. Matt Alandt ran into a stark
reality when he transferred to Camp Pendleton and sought off-base housing with
his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
	   Rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Oceanside, north of San Diego, was $725.
His monthly housing stipend from the Marine Corps was $623.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's pretty tough,'' said Alandt, 21, of Boise, Idaho, who moved back on
base this year. ``You live paycheck to paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
	   Relief may be on the way for the more than half of the 1.4 million members
of the military who receive monthly stipends for off-base housing. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said Thursday that the Clinton administration will look
to spend $3 billion over five years to end a requirement that military members
pay 15 percent of their off-base housing costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can never pay you what you're worth to this country,'' Cohen told the
Marines at Camp Pendleton. But ``we can pay you more than we have been paying.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal, part of the president's 2001 military budget request, is part
of a campaign to make military life more attractive by increasing pay and
benefits. In recent years, the Pentagon has had trouble recruiting new members
and retaining those already in uniform.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen reminded the Marines that their base pay rose 4.8 percent on Jan. 1,
and that many will get additional increases of as much as 5.5 percent on July 1.
He said he also would seek ways to improve military health care, but gave no
specifics.
</P>
<P>
	   The stipend varies depending on location, rank, marital status and number of
children.
</P>
<P>
	   On-base housing is free, but is in short supply nationwide. And 200,000 of
the 300,000 units are considered substandard and in need of replacement or
repair.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, many choose to live off-base so spouses can be closer to their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   In parts of the country where the cost of living is relatively high, the
housing allowance doesn't go far. At Camp Pendleton, the stipend -- including an
increase for this year -- ranges from $690 per month for a junior enlisted
person with dependents to $1,130 for a top officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan, Clinton will ask Congress to consider using $160 million to
reduce service members' out-of-pocket costs for off-base housing to an average
15 percent of rent or mortgage. The current average is nearly 19 percent.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Seek To Avoid Flag Issue  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A huge, three-day Confederate rally and re-enactment
begins here today -- the same day Republican presidential candidates will be in
South Carolina to debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Mere coincidence, the rally's organizers say.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's one very touchy issue for visiting candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   In this state, where some call the early Republican primary the ``Gateway to
the South,'' a bitter argument over the Confederate flag flying above the
statehouse is no minor local issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Heritage Coalition Chairman Chris Sullivan, one of the rally's organizers,
says it certainly will sway how he votes in the Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If a candidate for president were to decide he was against what the flag
represents, that would certainly have an impact on my decision,'' he said. ``I
think a lot of people would share that view.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican candidates debate tonight in West Columbia, a day after they
faced off in Durham, N.H.
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederate rally, meanwhile, starts with a reading of the names of
26,000 soldiers ``who died defending South Carolina from invasion,'' accompanied
by the ringing of a bell. The next day, re-enactors from North Carolina,
Tennessee and Louisiana are expected to participate in a two-mile procession.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters say the banner stands for defiant defense of freedom and Southern
heritage. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People sees a
symbol of slavery and has called for a tourism boycott of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican candidates, have done their best to avoid the issue -- though
not always successfully.
</P>
<P>
	   Publisher Steve Forbes said it was a local matter. So did Texas Gov. George
W. Bush -- but in a way that stirred things up.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona Sen. John McCain said, ``To me personally, I understand how it could
be offensive to some people, but I had ancestors who fought in the Confederate
Army and I thought they fought honorably.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also said he had resented it when the NAACP announced a boycott of
his state to pressure officials to approve a holiday honoring the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, pressed this summer about the South Carolina tourism boycott, said,
``My advice is for people who don't live in South Carolina to butt out of the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   The NAACP suggested Bush follow his own advice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your comments may even be seen as a thinly veiled attempt to gain votes in
South Carolina by attacking the NAACP and this issue,'' James Gallman, South
Carolina NAACP president, wrote to Bush. ``In reality, you are the outsider.''
</P>
<P>
	   Back home, the Texas NAACP wants Bush to push for legislation banning the
flag from public institutions there following a controversy at high school that
uses the flag and a Rebel mascot.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a no-win situation for Bush, who is trying to broaden his appeal to
minorities with his ``compassionate conservative'' message but can't alienate
conservatives backing the flag, said Earl Black, a Rice University political
scientist who specializes in Southern politics and who used to live in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Politicians are really reluctant to intervene in local disputes,'' Black
said. ``It has an effect of dividing supporters without normally winning new
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
	   And what about the Democrats?
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, who is pursuing the Democratic presidential
nomination, ``supports the right of the people of South Carolina to remove the
Confederate flag,'' said spokeswoman Laura Quinn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wouldn't fly it,'' said his opponent, Bill Bradley. ``I think that it
sometimes offends a large part of the population.''
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Buchanan, a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, said the
Southerners ``ought to be respected and so should the flag under which they
fought and died.''
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina raised the Confederate flag over its statehouse in 1962 to
commemorate the Civil War's centennial and is the only state that has kept it
flying.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia and Mississippi incorporate the Confederate symbol in their state
flags. The state Supreme Court has resurrected a 6-year-old challenge by the
NAACP to change that in Mississippi. Attempts to change Georgia's flag have
failed in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, South Carolina legislators gave themselves sole power to remove the
flag after then-Gov. David Beasley and the state Chamber of Commerce tried to
bring it down. Beasley later said the flag issue contributed to his defeat last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges has met privately with both sides in an effort to
fashion a compromise, but the GOP-controlled House has the votes to keep the
flag flying.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Party Campaign Struggling  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's Christian Democrats are trying to revive their
fortunes after weeks of paralysis caused by a campaign funding scandal that has
triggered a criminal probe against ex-chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
	   Party leaders were to launch a campaign against higher gasoline taxes today,
hoping to channel public discontent over rising fuel prices into an
anti-government groundswell for a state election next month. The burden of
Kohl's legacy promises to make that an uphill struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   Heading into a two-day party strategy session opening today outside Hamburg,
party chief Wolfgang Schaeuble set the tone by taking aim at his boss in the
strongest terms yet.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview in today's edition of the newspaper Die Welt, Schaeuble once
again urged Kohl to clear up suspicions surrounding up to $1 million in cash
donations he solicited from as yet unnamed supporters in the 1990s and kept off
the party's books in apparent violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As bitter as that path may be, it remains without alternative,'' Schaeuble
told the paper. In a humbling comment, he reminded his ex-boss that ``the Kohl
era has been over since the election defeat on Sept. 27, 1998.''
</P>
<P>
	   Party officials said Kohl would not attend the executive board session in
the town of Norderstedt, unusual for a man who rarely missed a meeting during 25
years in charge of the party. No reason was given.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian Democrat leaders said the scandal would be discussed but that the
meeting would focus on strategy for Feb. 27 elections in the small state of
Schleswig-Holstein, just north of Hamburg, and issues such as taxes and
education policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the scandal exploded last month, the Christian Democrats had high
hopes of extending a string of election victories and unseating the governing
Social Democrats in Schleswig-Holstein. Now they're struggling to reverse a
dramatic slump in opinion polls. Prosecutors opened a criminal probe against
Kohl this week for possible breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's time for us to get back into the political competition,'' party
general secretary Angela Merkel said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the party would start by distributing leaflets condemning two
increases in the tax on gasoline since April under Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's government. The party called the taxes an ``unbearable burden'' on
motorists, especially in rural areas with many long-distance commuters such as
Schleswig-Holstein.

<HEADLINE> Twins May Age Differently  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gwen Sirota and Gay Block are identical twins. When they
hit age 60, they thought they still looked alike. After all, identical twins are
supposed to age alike, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
	   Then a plastic surgeon stunned them with side-by-side photographs: Despite
having the same genes, Block actually looked like an older version of Sirota
instead of a twin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At first I thought he'd touched up the photos,'' Block recalls. Then ``I
went, 'Oh my gosh, I really do look older.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Block, it turns out, loved to tan, baking on California beaches. She says
she smoked marijuana and drank fairly heavily during a stressful period of the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Her twin never did any of that. And while genes gave them the same eye
crinkles and smile line, Block's wrinkles were significantly deeper, with those
telltale vertical lip lines from puckering up to smoke, and her skin was
coarsened by the sun.
</P>
<P>
	   So much for assuming that good genes are enough to fight the ravages of
time.
</P>
<P>
	   Your doctor -- if you didn't hear it from mom or dad first -- always have
said smoking and too much sun are bad for you. They sow the seeds for cancer and
other problems, but it's hard for some people to believe that today's lifestyle
choices carry serious consequences down the road.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dr. Darrick Antell's new study of twins illustrates that in the nature
vs. nurture debate, nurture plays a huge role in how we age -- and he argues
that if faced with powerful photographic evidence, more people would kick some
bad health habits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can talk until you're blue in the face about all the health hazards''
of habits like smoking and tanning, said Antell, who practices plastic surgery
at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York. ``But tell them they'll age
quicker and not look as attractive, and people will probably listen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Identical twins are sought by medical researchers struggling to understand
the relationship between genetics and the environment on a host of topics,
including what makes some people age better than others.
</P>
<P>
	   Antell was interested in aging's skin-deep effects. So he traveled to the
annual Twins Days Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, to recruit twins for a two-step
study: First, did some twins' skin age differently and why? Then he gave
participating twins facelifts using slightly different surgical techniques, to
help settle a debate over which facelifts hold up best over time.
</P>
<P>
	   Facelift results aren't in yet. But a report comparing photographs of his
first seven sets of twins, in the Annals of Plastic Surgery, concluded smoking
and tanning led a list of environmental factors that over-aged some twins who
otherwise led similar lives.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the photographs that are unique. ``In many ways, a visual message is
often a much stronger draw'' than same-old health warnings, said aging expert
Dr. Robert Kane of the University of Minnesota, which is conducting more
in-depth twin studies on aging.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, another set of twins in the study led almost identical lives,
except one had smoked cigarettes for 30 years and her twin never did, Antell
said. The smoker had deeper wrinkles, including vertical lip lines and sagging
skin.
</P>
<P>
	   Then there are Block and Sirota.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We never saw a difference,'' insists Sirota, of Cockeysville, Md. ``I
thought he took the worst picture of Gay and the best picture of me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Happy with a facelift that she says makes both twins look 50-ish again,
Block, of Novato, Calif., now says her skin did reflect a tougher life. Always a
more avid tanner, she says the death of a child turned her to marijuana and
alcohol in the '70s -- and that stress plus bad health habits obviously played a
role.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the twins show ``you can practice defensive aging'' with healthier
lifestyle choices, Antell advises.

<HEADLINE> China: 15,000 Killed in Quake  </HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE KURTENBACH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- Thirty years ago, a powerful earthquake struck in the dead
of a winter's night, killing 15,621 people in southern China. But the
devastation remained hidden until survivors gathered this week to mourn the
dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Breaking three decades of silence, several state-run newspapers reported
today that the Jan. 5, 1970, earthquake that struck a relatively isolated part
of Yunnan province with a magnitude of 7.7 had been covered up by authorities
amid the chaos of the ultraleftist Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of the quake, the official Xinhua News Agency ran a brief report
noting that it had occurred but it reported a lower magnitude and omitted
information on casualties and damage, the Beijing Morning Post newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, keeping such information secret would be difficult due to loosening
controls and greater ease of communication throughout the country. The communist
leadership still keeps tight control, however, over information it considers
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   The death toll of 15,621 from the quake in Tonghai county in Yunnan would
make it China's third most deadly this century. The worst was the July 28, 1976,
7.8 to 8.2 magnitude earthquake in the eastern city of Tangshan, which killed
240,000. A magnitude 8.6 quake on Dec. 16, 1920 killed 100,000 people in the
northwestern province of Gansu.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beijing Morning Post report noted that at the time of the 1970 quake,
China was isolated from the West and had a policy of refusing outside
assistance. Most of the aid provided from inside the country to victims of the
quake was ``spiritual'' in nature, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fanatical political atmosphere of the time, news was devoted mainly
to the propaganda purposes of the leftist extremists in charge and to the
glorification of then-Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After the quake, the disaster area received hundreds of thousands of
copies of the `Quotations of Mao Tse-tung' and Mao statues and 14,350 letters of
condolence, but the amount of material and financial relief was pathetically
small,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1970 earthquake devastated seven counties over an area of 5,456 square
miles in central Yunnan, a major tobacco-growing region. Estimated at today's
prices, it caused more than $326.9 million in damage, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The first shock was followed by 12 aftershocks of magnitudes ranging from 5
to 5.9, it added.
</P>
<P>
	   News of the quake came to light after the newspaper Yangcheng Evening News
reported that relatives of the victims had gathered on Wednesday in Yuxi city in
Yunnan for a memorial service.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear why reports of the deaths and destruction resulting from the
quake did not surface earlier. Although China's media remains entirely state
controlled, in recent years the government has more openly reported about
earthquakes and other disasters, despite continuing to severely restrict access
by foreign journalists to rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
	   In a similar instance, only in recent years have state media reported on the
August 1975 collapse of dams at the Banqiao and Shimantan reservoirs in central
Henan province that drowned 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The communist government has yet to fully account for the greatest calamity
of the Mao era, the Great Famine of the late 1950s and early 1960s that killed
as many as 30 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   That disaster resulted from a premature attempt to establish communism by
collectivizing agriculture and an ill-conceived ``backyard furnace'' program
that led farmers to neglect fields and melt down their tools to make steel.
</P>
<P>
	   The government remains secretive about many issues it considers sensitive or
important for national security. Vaguely worded, arbitrarily enforced laws on
protecting state secrets have been used to jail scores of dissidents,
journalists and others who run afoul of the authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet growing numbers of foreigners live and travel here and many Chinese are
traveling overseas. Wider access to telephones and use of the Internet have also
increased the flow of information.

<HEADLINE> Census Seeks Head Count Workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wanted: A half-million hard workers to visit neighbors and
get them to talk about themselves. The hours are flexible hours, the pay is
good.
</P>
<P>
	   With the national head count closing in, the Census Bureau launched an
effort Thursday to hire an army of part-time workers to take the tally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our goal is to have a pool of local people who are familiar with their
communities and committed to a successful count in their own neighborhoods,''
Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said the Bureau has 520 offices open across the country with each
needing to hire 800 to 1,000 people for four weeks to six weeks around census
day, April 1. He said the agency will spend $9.5 million on help-wanted
advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   Just 65 percent of American households mailed back their Census forms in
1990. While the Bureau hopes to boost that rate with advertising this time, most
of the workers being hired are needed to visit the homes of people who fail to
respond by mail.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the count is on schedule, Prewitt said, with 150,000 people hired
so far and a pool of about 1 million applicants. He said the agency wants an
overall pool of about 3 million from which to choose.
</P>
<P>
	   Those hired include about 6,000 welfare-to-work applicants, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Legal residents age 18 and older are eligible to work for the Census Bureau.
They do not need to be citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In many areas the agency is seeking bilingual workers. Pay varies from $8.25
to $18.50 per hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt urged anyone interested in a Census job to call the agency's
toll-free number, 1-888-325-7733.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said other aspects of the effort are also on schedule, including:
</P>
<P>
	   --The first local counts will begin in two weeks in rural parts of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   --Printing is ahead of schedule with all 123 million long forms finished and
the work about 75 percent complete on the short forms.
</P>
<P>
	   --The agency has verified 20 million rural addresses, adding 10,000 new
ones, and is now sending the 100 million city addresses to local governments for
verification.
</P>
<P>
	   --The agency has obtained 4.5 million square feet of office space, 17,000
telephones, 100,000 pieces of furniture and thousands of pieces of office
equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said about two-thirds of the workers hired so far are women, many
seeking a second part-time job. He noted that most people who worked for the
agency in dress rehearsals are coming back for the final count.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall there are about 860,000 jobs to be filled, but not all at the same
time, so Prewitt said the agency expects many people will do more than one of
them.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort to count the estimated 274 million people in the United States is
a decade-long program, Prewitt stressed, noting that planning for the 2010 count
already has started.
</P>
<P>
	   He warned that ``the conditions that make it difficult to count this country
completely have magnified since 1990,'' including the presence of more
immigrants, a larger non-English speaking population, a more mobile population,
more total households and more irregular living arrangements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe we can do a basic enumeration better than we did in 1990,'' he
said, but that does not necessarily mean a more accurate census.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said he expects there will still be an undercount, in particular
among minorities, and the agency will need to do a post-census quality check to
measure that undercount and correct it in the overall totals.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Vow To Push Tax Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Their grand tax cut plan thwarted by a presidential veto
last year, Republicans say they'll return to work this year with several
narrowly aimed tax relief bills aimed at helping married couples and parents
planning for education costs.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., concluding a two-day leadership
planning session Thursday, did not rule out another late-year attempt to pass a
bigger tax bill similar to the 10-year $792 billion measure President Clinton
rejected last year.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said, ``we need to get out there early'' with a more targeted
approach. Congress reconvenes on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Other specific tax goals mentioned by Hastert and other GOP leaders included
a plan, coordinated with Clinton, to spur investment in poorer communities,
legislation to block new Internet taxes and tax breaks for people who adopt
children with special needs.
</P>
<P>
	   Reflecting the new era of budget surpluses, Hastert also said Republicans
are working on a plan to eliminate the portion of the national debt now held by
the public. He said the plan would envision ending the public debt in 10 to 15
years, a commitment that aides said could mean less money for fundamental Social
Security reform.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has also outlined steps to buy back the public
debt by 2015. The national debt consists of the $3.7 trillion owed the public in
treasury bills and savings bonds -- the public debt -- and another $2 trillion
in Social Security and other trust funds.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the debt was eliminated was 1835, when Andrew Jackson was
president. The national debt crossed the $1 trillion mark in 1983 and rose
sharply through 1997, when it has slowly gone down with the advent of budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   In describing this year's session, House Majority Leader Dick Armey referred
to the ``three T's'' -- tax relief, trade and technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP leaders said they would work to win China's accession to the World
Trade Organization, pass a bill opening up trade with Africa and the Caribbean
and support legislation left from last year that would standardize laws on
computer encryption and electronic signatures on e-trade contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Passing legislation is always more difficult in an election year, and
Hastert acknowledged that ``certainly presidential politics will be a major
concern'' in the second half of the year. He said congressional Republicans
would coordinate policy with the GOP presidential nominee. Current frontrunner
George W. Bush has proposed a tax cut plan that is even more ambitious than the
GOP plan defeated last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Provisions to address the education savings account and the extra tax burden
faced by some married couples who file jointly were both part of that GOP tax
package.
</P>
<P>
	   Reducing the marriage penalty paid by millions of two-income couples would
have cost an estimated $119 billion, while raising tax-exempt contribution
limits to IRA-like education savings accounts and other steps to promote
education savings were estimated at $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP outline of its goals for the election-year session came a day after
Clinton and Democratic leaders met at the White House and said they would push
legislation to shore up Social Security and to fix the nation's crumbling
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrats also said they would also seek to pass legislation unfinished
from last year, including gun restrictions, an increase in the minimum wage and
a patient's bill of rights.

<HEADLINE> FBI: New Year's Threats Not Unusual  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For all the fear of New Year's terrorism, the FBI opened
no more investigations of computer crime and physical threats or violence than
during a normal seven-day period.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI opened six investigations of computer crimes and 12 investigations
into physical threats or violence nationwide from Dec. 29 through Jan. 5, Mike
Vatis, head of the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The level was not beyond the norm you would usually see in that number of
days,'' Vatis said. ``On neither side -- cybercrime or physical threats -- did
we think the weekend activity was particularly unusual.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vatis said some new computer viruses were found but there were no
significant millennium-related attacks during the seven days his office operated
a command post inside the FBI's Strategic Information and Operations Center in
Washington. He also said there was no increase in attacks from overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   All the investigations remain open, but any threats posed have been
neutralized, Vatis said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the six computer crime investigations were opened in response to
reports from private companies that had downloaded special detection software
Vatis' office posted Dec. 30 on its Internet Web page. Using the FBI's software,
three private companies found hacker tools hidden on their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The software has been downloaded by more than 2,600 companies and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   Vatis said the computer investigations involved hacker attacks using what
are known as ``distributed denial of service'' tools. In such cases, hackers
hide tools, known as daemons, inside large computer systems, like those at
universities. The hackers later issue commands from their own computer to order
each of hundreds of daemons to attack a target computer system through various
portals. These multiple attacks can cause the target system to crash or become
so overloaded it cannot function.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI field offices, each of which also maintained a command post over the New
Year's weekend, opened a dozen investigations of physical destruction or threats
of it.
</P>
<P>
	   Vatis would not discuss details of any of the investigations but his office
is responsible for protecting computer systems, like the banking system, and
physical infrastructure, like power and telephone lines, transportation routes
and water systems, from either electronic or physical attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   In Bend, Ore., an 80-foot powerline tower carrying high-voltage electricity
from the Pacific Northwest to the Southwest was toppled Dec 30. But David Szady,
head of the FBI's Portland office, said no explosive was used. ``The cause has
been determined and has been reported as an act of malicious mischief,'' Szady
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Szady would not elaborate, but the owner of a nearby store said Oregon
officials told him some people who appeared to be drunk unbolted support cables
holding the tower in place.
</P>
<P>
	   A conservative group criticized the FBI for warning state and local police
officials to look out for violent white supremacists, apocalyptic cults, radical
lone wolf members of private citizen militias and others who promote violent
millennial agendas.
</P>
<P>
	   This effort, named Project Megiddo, ``did nothing to prevent terrorism,''
said Lisa Dean of the Free Congress Foundation. ``The FBI used the Y2K situation
to confuse the Religious Right ... with those religious cults whom they consider
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether the Megiddo report exaggerated the potential for violence,
Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday, ``The nice answer would be that there
was no threat.''
</P>
<P>
	   But she said authorities must ``take reasonable precautions'' and advise
Americans of risks whenever possible. ``I think we described the heightened risk
that revolved around the time of the end of the millennium,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Public Schools Said Improving  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite widespread public perception that America's
public schools are failing, an analysis of two decades of government data
reveals SAT scores are rising, more students are achieving in math and science
and college enrollment is up.
</P>
<P>
	   A report issued today by the Center on Education Policy and the American
Youth Policy Forum compares U.S. schools in the 1980s with classrooms of the
mid- to late-1990s and concludes there are many positive trends.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, ``The Good News About American Education,'' found that fewer
students are dropping out, students are taking more challenging courses and more
students with disabilities are finding their way into mainstream classrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Critics and reformers are overemphasizing the bad and slighting the good.
We're saying that of course we have to do better, but we've moved a far distance
in 15 years,'' said Jack Jennings, a former Education Department official who
now directs the Center on Education Policy, which advocates for public schools.
``The public sounds like it's giving up on the public schools, and we have to
take a long, deep breath.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report acknowledges that much work is yet to be done but was based on
statistics from the Education Department that generally paint a brighter
picture. The study notes that the overall dropout rate declined by 4 percent and
the rate among black youth dropped 8 percent between 1972 and 1997, the latest
year for which figures were available.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the study's other findings:
</P>
<P>
	   --Scores on the math portion of the SAT increased 17 points and verbal
scores increased 2 points between 1983 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   --Scores on standardized science and math achievement tests improved among
9-, 13-, and 17-year-old students between 1982 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   --14 percent more students went on to college in 1997 than in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking at school crime overall between 1993 and 1997, the study found the
rate dropped from 155 to 102 incidents per 1,000 children. Violent crimes
dropped by 19 incidents and seriously violent crime decreased by 4 incidents for
every 1,000 students, the study said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report did not include a recent spate of school shootings in Colorado,
Oregon, Arkansas and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although recent, tragic school shootings have reminded the nation that
violent death at school is intolerable no matter how rare an event, children are
safer in schools than in the community or at home,'' the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
	   Samuel Halperin, a senior fellow with the American Youth Policy Forum, said
that even if the recent shootings had been included, the crime rate in public
schools still would have declined.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's always the spectacular thing that gets everyone's attention, but we
have to get the whole picture,'' he said. ``This report is not saying crime is
not a problem. We're just saying that it's declining.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jeanne Brennan, a spokeswoman for Education Trust, an advocacy group for
poor minority students, said the study is shortsighted on gaps in achievement
between minorities and white students.
</P>
<P>
	   Halperin acknowledged that the disparity is ``much too large'' but said
statistics show the gap is narrowing. For example, among 9-year-olds the
difference between black and white students' math achievement scores was an
average of 29 points on a standardized achievement test in 1982, while the
difference was 25 points in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not saying by any stretch of the imagination that we're where we
ought to be. We're just saying let's stop all the incessant bashing and look at
some of the real numbers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Military Sees Revived Gays Debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talk on the Democratic presidential campaign trail about
liberalizing the policy on allowing homosexuals to serve in the military is seen
from inside the Pentagon as little more than that: talk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Candidates for political office are certainly free to do that and must do
that in order to explain their views to the American people. But I would not
speculate as to what that may or may not mean a year from now,'' Rear Adm. Craig
Quigley, a spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sen. Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore both had said Wednesday
night they would make sure that homosexuals could serve openly. Gore added a new
twist, however, when he said he would not nominate anyone to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff who did not agree with his position on gays serving.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has criticized the current ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, set in law
by Congress in 1993, that permits gays and lesbians to serve as long as they
don't openly state their sexual preferences.
</P>
<P>
	   Presidents don't normally set litmus tests for members of the Joint Chiefs,
whose collective opinions are conveyed to the president by the Joint Chiefs
chairman, by law the president's chief military adviser. A president usually
takes for granted that the four service chiefs will carry out his orders.
</P>
<P>
	   If the next president decided he wanted to change the law on gays in the
military, he almost certainly would face the same firestorm of dissent in
Congress that greeted President Clinton in the early weeks of his first term.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton entered office saying he wanted gays to be allowed to serve openly,
but opposition in Congress and among military leaders left him with no choice
but to accept a compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   In remarks to reporters Thursday, Clinton said he still believes that gays
and lesbians ought to be allowed to serve so long as they obey the Uniform Code
of Military Justice, which prohibits homosexual contact.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So I would like to find some way for people to be honest, to obey the law
and to serve with distinction in the military,'' Clinton said. ``So I think that
is where our focus ought to be, and the next president will have to figure out
how to do that. But I think there will have to be a change in the law now.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic candidates' willingness to loosen strictures on gays in the
military drew animated responses Thursday night as the GOP candidates debated.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer said the Democratic stance would further the ``radical homosexual
agenda,'' and an Alan Keyes said, ``I will return to the ban on homosexuals in
the military.''
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush said, ``I'm a don't ask, don't tell man.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain said the policy could be fine-tuned, but he added, ``I
cannot change a policy that's working.''
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Dugan, who was a member of the Joint Chiefs as head of the Air Force
until September 1990, said in an interview Thursday that he saw no problem with
a president using a litmus test like that suggested by Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Dugan said, military leaders would expect a president to
put a high priority on maintaining good order and discipline in the military --
a condition that would be undermined, in Dugan's view, if gays were given
special treatment or permitted to flaunt their sexuality in ways that
heterosexuals may not.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the policy is to allow gays in the military to do whatever they want,
(Gore) is going to go through a lot of senior officers before finding someone''
willing to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dugan said.
</P>
<P>
	   As it happens, the next president will have little immediate opportunity to
apply any such litmus test anyway, unless he takes the unusual step of firing
the service chiefs when he takes office in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Henry H. Shelton was confirmed by the Senate just
last fall to serve until September 2001, and the vice chairman's post would not
become vacant until spring 2002 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the four service chiefs, Air Force Gen. Michael Ryan is due to leave
first, in fall 2001. The Navy's chief, Adm. Jay Johnson, is scheduled to be
replaced this summer and his successor would have just begun a four-year term
when the next commander-in-chief takes office. The Army chief, Gen. Eric
Shinseki, and Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James Jones just started their
four-year terms last summer.

<HEADLINE> Women Off Welfare Lacking Insurance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Getting off welfare and getting a job can mean losing
health insurance coverage, according to a study of women and children leaving
welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
	   About one-third of women formerly on welfare who went to work had no
insurance. Women who left welfare and didn't work fared worse -- nearly half
lacked insurance, even though many of them should be eligible for Medicaid, the
government health program for the poor, according to the study to be published
Monday in the journal Health Affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Millions of families have left welfare in the last several years, prodded by
tough new rules and the strong economy. But advocates for the poor worry that
when they lose their monthly welfare checks they also lose government-subsidized
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Most former welfare recipients still qualify for Medicaid, but -- for a
variety of reasons -- many leave the program. There are few statistics available
that show exactly how many have been dropped from Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   The Urban Institute study, which examined 1,004 women and 1,662 children who
left welfare between 1995 and 1997, focused on how some people leaving welfare
add to the ranks of the uninsured, which number 44 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Despite the fact that there are several ways to maintain Medicaid
eligibility after leaving welfare, a large percentage of women and children are
losing that coverage and falling through the cracks,'' said co-author John
Holahan, director of the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, one of the
sponsors of the study.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found that children previously receiving welfare fared better than
women when it comes to keeping insurance. Forty-seven percent were covered by
Medicaid and 29 percent were covered by private insurance, but 29 percent were
uninsured. The numbers add up to more than 100 percent because some children had
multiple sources of health insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The study did not examine the reasons why women who get jobs after leaving
welfare don't have health insurance through their employers. The study's authors
said other research shows that former welfare recipients have low-wage jobs that
don't offer insurance or, if insurance is offered, don't pay enough for them to
afford the premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Finding work does not guarantee that a former welfare recipient will also
obtain health care coverage,'' said Bowen Garrett, co-author and research
associate at the Urban Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   The research was part of a project funded by several organizations,
including the Henry J. Kaiser Family.
</P>
<P>
	   The study is the latest evidence that low-income families leaving welfare
are losing insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Auditors at the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicaid,
found that some states are illegally denying benefits to poor families dropped
from the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
	   People were losing Medicaid coverage because they were not told they were
eligible, were automatically dropped from computerized Medicaid files when they
got off welfare, or were improperly harassed by caseworkers when they applied
for coverage, auditors said.
</P>
<P>
	   A study last year by Families USA, a liberal consumer group, estimated that
675,000 people lost Medicaid coverage and had no other health insurance in 1997
due to strict new welfare rules.

<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Even with President Clinton intervening, Israel
and Syria remained apart after four days of lagging peace talks, their
face-to-face negotiations at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who has made Mideast peace a top priority for the final year of his
term, returned here for the third time since the negotiations began Monday in
hopes of quickening the pace of the talks. He planned another trip today.
</P>
<P>
	   The president met separately on Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, but did not try to bring the
two leaders together for a second three-way meeting, according to White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton left after spending six hours at the semi-secluded conference center
where the delegates are sequestered. Lockhart called the meetings constructive
and ``obviously substantive,'' but did not say whether the president made any
headway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Both the prime minister and the foreign minister are quite engaged,''
Lockhart said. ``There are a lot of issues on the table. There are a lot of
things that have to be worked through, and it's going to take more than one
afternoon to work on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said Clinton, al-Sharaa and Barak
would hold a three-way meeting today, but there was no confirmation of that from
Israeli or U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Tensions surfaced early Thursday when the four committees charged with
handling contentious issues failed to convene. Syria is insisting on a meeting
of the working group handling its key demand for a timetable for Israel to
relinquish the Golan Heights, which Syria lost in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israelis appeared pleased that the negotiations were focused on peace
terms and security measures, such as installing an early warning system at the
border and clearing it of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The Syrians have said they were not ready to return home and tell their
people they had disregarded their most important concern -- the land issue --
and addressed only security issues.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said that even though there was no
committee activity Thursday, some of the issues that the committees would
address were taken up substantively in bilateral meetings between the United
States and the two parties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The feeling is that those meetings have been sufficiently good and
constructive that they have ... superseded committee meetings,'' said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has assured Israel and Syria he was willing to play a helpful and
consistent role in trying to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
	   Although two trips are on his schedule for next week -- to Arizona and Texas
on Monday and Tuesday and to New York on Thursday -- Lockhart said the peace
talks would take precedence.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. aim is a treaty that would exchange the strategic Golan Heights for
diplomatic and economic relations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Marking the end of Ramadan, Islam's holiest month, the White House issued a
presidential message with a prayer for peace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We pray that the new moon will bring a new era of peace between nations --
in the Middle East and all across the world -- so people can emerge from the
shadows of violence and make better lives for their children,'' Clinton said.

Thursday night to push for "tax cuts, so help me God" if elected to the White

changes that would hurt the conservative cause. McCain used the forum to
strongly defend his actions on behalf of a political donor who was seeking

also important to cut the taxes where there's times of plenty."

<HEADLINE> Accounting Firm Violations Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly half the partners at accounting giant
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP reported having violated rules prohibiting them from
owning stock in companies they audit, and many more such lapses went unreported,
a review led by an independent consultant has found.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which made the consultant's review
public on Thursday, said its investigation of New York-based
PricewaterhouseCoopers is continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, the firm agreed in a settlement to conduct the review and create
a $2.5 million education fund after the SEC alleged that some of its accountants
compromised their independence by owning stock in corporations they audited.
</P>
<P>
	   PricewaterhouseCoopers promised at the time to take steps to ensure that it
didn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
	   In light of the disappointing results of the review, the SEC said Thursday
it has asked an accounting industry oversight board to sponsor similar
independent reviews at other accounting firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC has been stressing the need for accounting firms to be more
independent of the companies they audit. The watchdog agency's rules explicitly
forbid accountants from owning stock in their audit clients.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Turner, the SEC's chief accountant, called the report by the
independent consultant, New York attorney Jess Fardella, "a sobering reminder
that accounting professionals need to renew their commitment to the fundamental
principle of auditor independence."
</P>
<P>
	   Fardella and his four-person team found some excusable mistakes by the
accounting firm but also "laxity and insensitivity to the importance of
independence" and "serious" problems of corporate structure and culture.
</P>
<P>
	   The report found:
</P>
<P>
	   --Nearly half the firm's 2,698 partners, or 1,301, reported having committed
at least one violation of the auditor independence rules while 153 of them
admitted to more than 10 each.
</P>
<P>
	   --Of a total 8,064 violations reported by those involved, 81.3 percent were
by partners and 17.4 percent by managers. Nearly half of the reported violations
were committed by partners who perform services related to financial audits of
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   --Almost half the reported violations involved direct investments by the
PricewaterhouseCoopers professionals in securities, mutual funds, bank accounts
or insurance products related to client companies.
</P>
<P>
	   --In addition, Fardella's team did random checks that found that 77.5
percent of the firm's partners failed to report at least one violation they
committed. That means an estimated 86 percent of the 2,698 partners had at least
one violation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Nestor, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said he had no comment
on the report but provided a copy of a letter sent Wednesday by chairman
Nicholas G. Moore and chief executive James J. Schiro to the firm's partners.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter termed the Fardella report "embarrassing to our firm and to all
of us as partners" and said that "Equally important, it may also raise questions
and concerns among our clients and our people."
</P>
<P>
	   However, the executives added that the violations of the independence rules
cited by the report, while unacceptable, "did not in any way impair the
professional objectivity and integrity" of the company's audits.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are determined to do everything possible so that neither our firm nor
our clients ever again suffer from independence-related problems," Moore and
Schiro wrote. "To facilitate this, we have established expansive new policies
and procedures to address previous infractions and to prevent future ones."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC appointed Fardella in March 1999 to supervise the internal review
after it censured PricewaterhouseCoopers for alleged violations of the
independence rules.
</P>
<P>
	   In its settlement with the SEC, the firm agreed to set up the $2.5 million
education fund, to be used to enhance awareness in the accounting profession of
the independence rules.
</P>
<P>
	   PricewaterhouseCoopers, created from the July 1998 merger of Price
Waterhouse LLP and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand LLP, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing
in agreeing to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the accord, the firm also agreed to be censured, to improve its
procedures for monitoring adherence to the independence rules and to conduct the
internal investigation supervised by Fardella.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Presses for Boy's Repatriation  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- While state-run television broadcast footage of Cuban exiles
protesting in Miami against the repatriation of Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban
government urged its people to keep up their own demonstrations to ensure the
boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   The unusual airing of protests against President Fidel Castro appeared aimed
at warning Cuban citizens that South Florida exiles could still force the
reversal of the U.S. government's decision to return Gonzalez to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Castro attended a rally Thursday by media workers at Havana's Palace of
Conventions to demand Gonzalez's return. For weeks the communist government has
held such rallies almost daily.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The case of Elian is for today's youth what 40 years of the blockade,
armed invasions, sabotage and attempts to kill President Fidel Castro were for
earlier generations,'' said Cuban journalist Luis Baez, who has written several
books about Cuban emigration to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   After the rally, state television showed the Cuban exiles in the streets of
Miami -- some of them carrying signs demanding ``Freedom for Elian,'' the same
battle cry regularly chanted during rallies on this side of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
	   A voiceover to the footage called the exiles ``criminals'' and ``mafia
members.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of Cuban-Americans chanting ``Liberty! Liberty!'' blocked
intersections and cut off access to the Port of Miami. In one case, riot police
had to use tear gas to clear them.
</P>
<P>
	   Saying ``nothing is certain'' about Elian's return, Cuba's government
exhorted citizens to keep rallying, after the boy's relatives in Miami said they
would look for ways to get around Wednesday's ruling by the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service to repatriate the child by Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban exiles in Miami will now ``proceed with all their resources to impede
or delay'' the ruling, Cuba predicted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot stop mobilizing! The struggle must not stop for one minute!''
said a message that was read Wednesday night to several thousand rallying Cuban
scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   Rescued on Nov. 25 by fishermen off the Florida coast, Elian has become the
subject of an international custody battle.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother died in a boating accident trying to get Elian and herself to the
United States. The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, lives in Cuba and wants
Elian back.
</P>
<P>
	   But Elian's relatives in Miami have fought to keep the boy, saying they
could provide him with a better life. Since the INS decision was announced
Wednesday, they have said they will appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has not appeared publicly since the announcement. Neither he nor
Elian's four grandparents could be located in their hometown of Cardenas, east
of Havana.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-North Korean Talks To Resume  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talks designed to pave the way for a high-level North
Korean visit to the United States will resume later this month in Berlin, U.S.
officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   The new round, to begin Jan. 22, was announced by the State Department on
Thursday, a day after a North Korean official raised questions over whether
North Korea was still interested in such a visit. A previous round of talks was
held in Berlin in November.
</P>
<P>
	   A State Department statement said a U.S. delegation led by U.S. envoy
Charles Kartman would meet with a North Korean delegation headed by Vice Foreign
Minister Kim Gye Gwan.
</P>
<P>
	   The discussions have focused on improving ties and North Korea's missile
program.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has said Pyongyang's agreement in September not to test a
long-range ballistic missile was expected to lead to a visit by a senior North
Korean official.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Chu Chang Jun, North Korea's ambassador to China, told reporters in
Beijing on Wednesday that North Korea had been prepared to send senior officials
to the United States until Washington committed ``acts of betrayal against our
country.''
</P>
<P>
	   He did not elaborate and U.S. officials proceeded with plans for the Berlin
talks and the U.S. visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We look forward to hosting a high-level visit at the earliest
opportunity,'' State Department spokesman James Foley said, adding that it was
up to North Korea to designate which official or officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will continue to work on preparations for such a visit when our
bilateral talks resume (in Berlin),'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Sandy Berger, who is President Clinton's national security
adviser, said the administration puts a high priority on the talks because it
remains concerned about North Korea's missile program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to pursue that very actively,'' he said in an address to the
National Press Club. ``North Korea has a choice. It can either pursue more
normal relations ... or it can continue with its threatening nuclear and missile
programs and continue to be isolated and continue to be contained by the rest of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're prepared to go down either path,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   Berger sidestepped a question on a story in Thursday's editions of The
Washington Times that China was continuing to supply materials for North Korea's
long-range missile program despite promises that it would tighten exports of
such technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest shipment was made just two weeks ago, through a Hong Kong
company, the newspaper said, quoting a classified Pentagon intelligence report.
</P>
<P>
	   While neither confirming nor denying the report, Berger said, ``We obviously
would not want to see China aiding North Korea's missile program. We've made
that clear to China. I don't think it's in China's interest to have a North
Korea that possesses nuclear weapons and the missile capability to deliver them
at long ranges, since China's fairly close to North Korea.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Don Nelson might be lucky he only lost Karl Malone's respect.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson was so upset with Malone and the officials that the 59-year-old
Dallas coach physically confronted the muscular Utah star during the Jazz's
105-92 road victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson, who was not available for comment, bumped Malone after the coach was
ejected for arguing about a foul call on Dallas center Shawn Bradley after a
play involving Malone.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the first time a coach has bumped me in 15 years," Malone said. "I
was taught when I was little to respect my elders, but you're totally out of
line when you get in a player's face. He crossed the line and I have no respect
for that."
</P>
<P>
	   Malone, 6-foot-9 and conservatively listed as 260 pounds, said a fight with
the 6-foot-6 coach would be like a collision between a "Volkswagen and an
18-wheeler."
</P>
<P>
	   In other NBA games, it was Detroit 101, Milwaukee 95; Toronto 101,
Sacramento 89; Minnesota 98, Portland 96; Indiana 102, Denver 97; Cleveland 90,
Golden State 75; and Miami 111, Houston 95.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson, who said Wednesday that he would step down as coach after the season
to concentrate on his duties as general manager, was ejected with 6:04 left in
the third quarter when he was given a double technical for arguing with referee
Scott Wall.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was called for a foul against Malone, whose knee struck Bradley's
midsection as the 7-foot-6 center tried to draw a charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was down for several minutes before he was helped to the locker
room. He returned to start the fourth quarter, but was ejected after picking up
his second technical.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson's son and top assistant, Donnie, took over the team and was hit with
a technical with 4:53 left in the third quarter for going on the court to
protest a no-call.

<HEADLINE> Confusion Over Surplus, Taxes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Viewers just tuning in to the presidential campaign could
have come away from the latest Republican debate with the notion that Texas Gov.
George W. Bush wants to devote the entire federal surplus in future years to tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one is suggesting we pass the entire surplus back to the taxpayers,''
Bush insisted in the face of attacks from Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But your plan does,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No, it doesn't,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, it does,'' McCain insisted.
</P>
<P>
	   No, it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
	   In the debate, as in the Democratic debates, candidates were not careful to
distinguish between the overall budget surplus projected in the years ahead and
that part of the surplus coming from Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   No candidate in either party is proposing to plunder the Social Security
portion -- the issue is what to do with the non-Social Security surplus, also
known as the ``available surplus.'' That's what McCain and Bush were arguing
about.
</P>
<P>
	   But viewers had no way of knowing that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They forget that the person who is watching this debate and is otherwise
involved in a life outside politics doesn't have the same set of assumptions,''
said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at
the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   There was still more room for confusion Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Candidates Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes both voiced support for a ``no tax''
plank in the GOP platform. They actually meant a ``no new taxes'' pledge, or a
promise not to raise taxes. But no one is talking about getting rid of them
altogether -- not even close.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in the debate:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Alan Keyes asserted that the Constitution does not address the separation
of church and state. Although the phrase does not appear in the Constitution,
the First Amendment opens, ``Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion'' -- words used to build up a body of law that speaks
to just such a separation.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bush swore to cut taxes ``so help me God,'' and brushed away the prospect
that national emergencies, such as war, might get in the way. Such developments
would be ``extreme hypotheticals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Forbes, facing persistent questions on why his campaign seems not to have
caught fire in New Hampshire, cited the example of Pat Buchanan, who pulled a
surprise Republican primary victory in the state in 1996. ``At this point he was
in single digits'' in opinion polls, Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
	   That was a touch melodramatic; Buchanan was at 15 percent in a major poll at
the comparable stage of the 1996 campaign -- about three weeks from the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jamieson said confusion over the two parts of the surplus has been the
most enduring disservice committed in the debates with candidates from both
parties so far -- that, and the fact that the budget performances everyone is
counting on are merely forecasts and may not happen.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain argues that Bush's $483 billion, five-year tax cut plan eats up the
non-Social Security surplus and more. Although that sets up a legitimate
argument over whether the cuts go too far and might force money to be taken from
Social Security, that's not how the issue was framed.

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Debate in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- In the first of back-to-back debates, the Republican
presidential candidates split on the question of whether gays should be allowed
to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain said they supported the
Clinton administration policy now in effect -- which members of their party long
have reviled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a 'don't ask, don't tell' man,'' declared the front-running Bush, who
opened the debate with an all-but-unequivocal tax pledge similar to one that
later caused trouble for his father, former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Their rivals, however, said gays should not be permitted to serve openly.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, McCain again defended his action as chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee to prod the Federal Communications Commission to act on a
license request from one of his campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator has made campaign finance reform a cornerstone of his
presidential campaign, saying that money is ``corrupting'' the political
process.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most objective observers believe the FCC hasn't done their job,'' he told
a questioner. ``That's my obligation as a senator and as the chairman of a
powerful committee.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain and their rivals -- Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes, Gary Bauer and
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah -- meet again tonight in South Carolina, and on Monday
in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's debate was the most boisterous yet, a fact apparent to voters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were good things I heard tonight, but I was surprised by the amount
of negativity,'' observed Mary Westfall of Durham, a self-labeled Democrat who
said she came to the debate undecided. ``I think they missed an opportunity to
go deeper.''
</P>
<P>
	   On gays in the military, McCain said the existing policy could be
fine-tuned. But in apparent agreement with Bush, added, ``I cannot change a
policy that's working.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which the president and others have
said has not worked well, requires gays in the military to keep their sexual
orientation a secret.
</P>
<P>
	   The other Republicans on stage trashed the policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said the pledges Wednesday night by the two Democratic candidates to
ensure that homosexuals can serve openly in the military were ``idiotic.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Joint Chiefs of Staff have one purpose, to keep the United States out
of war, and if they fail that, to win any war we're getting into,'' he said.
``Our party ought to find our voice and say that we will not put that kind of
requirement on our military.''
</P>
<P>
	   An animated Keyes said, ``I will return to the ban on homosexuals in the
military.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said open gays should not be allowed, saying the military is ``not an
agency for social experimentation.''
</P>
<P>
	   After struggling to be heard, Hatch offered an indirect response, saying ``I
will not expect anybody in the military to live any way other than the way I
live.''
</P>
<P>
	   On taxes, an aggressive Bush opened with a pledge to cut them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there's a recession it's important to cut taxes to make sure the
economy grows. ... It's also important to cut the taxes where there's times of
plenty. ... It's important to cut the taxes to make sure Washington, D.C., does
not spend the surplus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He was asked whether he was saying ``no new taxes, so help me God'' -- a
reference to the no-new-taxes pledge his father broke after winning the White
House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not only no new taxes. This is tax cuts, so help me God,'' replied
the junior Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The political subtext explained the course of the hourlong debate. Bush's
tax-cut pledge was designed to strike a chord in a state where residents are
fiercely proud that there is no income tax.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, McCain's chances for victory in New Hampshire rest with
independents, and his defense of his actions before the FCC seemed an effort to
reassure those attracted to his image as a reformer who will end politics as
usual.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate was feisty, as none of the men hesitated to interrupt each other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to stay here and take some time myself,'' Hatch said at one
point, as he jockeyed for airtime.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I paid for this microphone, mister,'' joked the moderator, NBC's Tim
Russert.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch shot back: ``Well, let me tell you something ... I'm taking this
microphone, I will tell you that right now.''
</P>
<P>
	   On other issues:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bauer underscored his commitment to the unborn, saying he would not
appoint any justice to the Supreme Court ``who would sacrifice even one child,''
a pledge he has uttered often in his effort to show unbreakable opposition to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Forbes, a wealthy publisher, criticized the Clinton administration's
decision to send a Cuban boy whose mother died escaping Havana back to his
homeland and his father. The child is ``Bill Clinton's human sacrifice to Fidel
Castro,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Criteria Released for Fall Debates  </HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS KIKER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Reform Party's presidential candidate and anyone
other than the Republican and Democratic nominees could be excluded from
presidential debates in the fall under new criteria established by an
independent commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision angered Pat Buchanan, the former Republican turned Reform
presidential candidate, who called he panel's decision Thursday a ``transparent
farce.'' He stressed that the Reform Party is nationally recognized, and that
its candidate should be included.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's be plain: This is nothing but a Beltway conspiracy by the two
establishment parties to corner the market forever on the presidency of the
United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan group created in 1987
as an impartial sponsor of the debates, said the stage for nationally televised
debates would be limited to candidates with at least 15 percent support in
national public opinion surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the former Republican Party chief who is co-chairman
of the commission, said the rules would limit the three scheduled debates to the
``realistic principal rivals to be president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement, he said, ``strikes a balance between reality and
fairness.''
</P>
<P>
	   The commission set two qualifications for participation:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Candidates must appear on enough state ballots to have a mathematical
chance of winning a majority in the Electoral College.
</P>
<P>
	   -- They also must have an average of 15 percent support in five major
national polls: ABC-Washington Post, CBS-New York Times, NBC-Wall Street
Journal, CNN-USA Today-Gallup and Fox News-Opinion Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan was not the only one incensed by the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Trump, the New York real estate developer who is considering a run
for the Reform Party nomination, said, ``I am not surprised that the two-party
political establishment wants to keep the American people from having a third
choice.'' He also threatened legal action.
</P>
<P>
	   The Libertarian Party also criticized the commission's rules.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Their new criteria will unfairly exclude candidates with a chance to win
the election, or with the potential to win the support of a substantial number
of American voters. That's just wrong,'' said party national director Steve
Dasbach.
</P>
<P>
	   Janet Brown, executive director of the commission, rejected the criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would seem premature for any candidate to attack them given the fact we
won't be applying them until late September,'' Brown said. ``By publishing these
criteria 10 months before the election that we hope to make it absolutely clear
to the candidates and the public how we will make these determinations.''
</P>
<P>
	   The commission also named three sites and dates for the debates, each of
which will begin at 9 p.m. EST and last 90 minutes:
</P>
<P>
	   -- The John F. Kennedy Library and University of Massachusetts in Boston,
Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Washington University in St. Louis, Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   One vice-presidential debate will be held at Centre College in Danville,
Ky., on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross Perot, the Reform Party founder, was included in debates in 1992 and
later won 19 percent of the popular vote -- but no electoral votes -- in the
general election. The debate commission excluded him in 1996, despite his
vigorous protests, saying his poll support was in single digits and that he had
no realistic chance of winning the election. Perot also lost a court fight over
the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Sabato, a professor of government at The University of Virginia, said
the new criteria ignore the fact that polls, for all their popularity, can be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Polling is not that precise,'' Sabato said. ``Even when you average five
polls you don't eliminate the individual margins of error.''
</P>
<P>
	   John Anderson said it was ``absolutely devastating'' when he was excluded
from the second of two general election debates in 1980 when he ran as an
independent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It sends a signal that (a candidate) is somehow less credible than the
other two candidates invited to the debate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But not everyone was upset.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Collins, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said, ``There
has to be some cutoff, some line has to be set for participating in these
debates. ... Seems to us that the nonpartisan commission has worked very long
and very hard and they have come up with a standard that is certainly reasonable
and is clearly not arbitrary.''

   SALEM, N.H. (AP) -- On consecutive days, Republican George W. Bush trekked to
investment houses to deliver his stump speech and ask the audience for its vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Did he make the audience swoon? Reporters may never know.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Fidelity Investments and Scudder Kemper Retirement Services forbid
their employees from speaking to reporters on any subject -- even political

prevents the public from assuming that an employee's reaction is the same as

<HEADLINE> Bradley Endorses Landmine Treaty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Arguing that the United States can ``lead the world
by the power of our example,'' Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley
has formally endorsed an international treating banning anti-personnel land
mines.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley issued his endorsement at a campaign rally Thursday, saying military
experts had assured him the treaty poses no threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue is getting attention in Iowa, which launches the presidential
nominating process with its caucuses Jan. 24. Today, a group called Iowans to
Ban Landmines planned an event in downtown Des Moines with Nobel Peace Prize
laureates Jody Williams and Tun Channareth of the International Campaign to Ban
Landmines.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said the timing of his announcement was deliberate. He had been
asked about the issue during earlier campaign swings, but had not taken a
position.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our military advantage is high-tech and will increasingly be high-tech,''
the former New Jersey senator said. ``There's no lower tech weapon in the world
than a land mine.''
</P>
<P>
	   His rival, Vice President Al Gore, also has endorsed the pact.
</P>
<P>
	   The treaty negotiated in Ottawa would ban anti-personnel land mines and
commit countries agreeing to it to dispose of land mines already in place. It
has been signed by more than 130 countries, but not the United States, and
ratified by more than 70.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States argues that weapons are needed on the Korean peninsula to
deter the North from invading the South. President Clinton has said the United
States will approve the treaty by 2006, but only if the armed forces come up
with an alternative by then.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the treaty say hundreds of thousands of land mines remain in
place for years after conflict, killing innocent people. Critics argue that
landmines are an essential part of a military strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley will be in Iowa for several days of campaigning, including a
Saturday debate with Gore. Today, he was returning to health care issues -- a
subject that has become a sharp bone of contention between the two contenders.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Bradley told supporters packed into a hangar at the Des Moines
airport that the treaty makes sense, ``not only so we can enhance our national
security, but we can lead the world by the power of our example.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said a major factor in his decision was that land mines are
indiscriminate killers. ``Our military advantage is that we are mobile, and land
mines are stationary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, Bradley headed to a chilly picket line where members of the
Teamsters Union are on strike and he got praise for a health care plan that Gore
has criticized as one that would squander the nation's projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Picketer Ed Hamel, of Des Moines, told Bradley of his 10-month-old child who
suffers from cerebral palsy, but isn't covered by the family health policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Gripping his arm, Bradley declared: ``This fight is for you. Can I tell your
story out there?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think you made up my mind,'' said Hamel.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Bradley said that response is typical of what he gets from voters who
have heard about his health plan.

sign during L.A.'s millennial celebration, says Tinseltown's big moment was a
flop.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Year's Eve finale that lit the sign with neon-colored strobe lights
was "ridiculous," the NBC "Tonight Show" host said during Monday's show.
</P>
<P>
	   "What did we have?" Leno asked the audience. "Ten floodlights from Home
Depot ... I've seen bug zappers do better shows."
</P>
<P>
	   Leno gave a parody re-creation by training two flashlights on a small model
of the sign.
</P>
<P>
	   "New Year's Eve is ancient history at this point," Deputy Mayor Noelia
Rodriguez responded Thursday. "Let's move on."

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie Perez and seven others were arrested after protesting
in front of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations over the Navy's bombing range
on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oscar-nominated actress and other protesters were taken to a Manhattan
precinct Thursday where they were expected to be charged with disorderly
conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rosie is a proud Puerto Rican girl whose family and friends in Puerto Rico
are directly affected by the actions she's protesting," Perez's spokesman David
Pollick said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 35-year-old actress from Brooklyn has appeared in several movies,
including "Do The Right Thing," and "White Men Can't Jump." She was nominated
for an Academy Award for best supporting actress in 1994 for "Fearless."
</P>
<P>
	   Puerto Rican lawmakers and thousands of other supporters have been calling
on the U.S. military to leave Vieques. But military officials have insisted the
island is the only place on the East Coast with all the qualities to host the
bombing runs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Abortions Continue To Decline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The number of American women who received abortions in 1997
was the lowest in more than 20 years, with experts citing everything from
reduced access to clinics, more willingness to use contraception and changing
attitudes about the procedure as causes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday that 20 of
every 1,000 women of reproductive age (15 to 44) had abortions in 1997, the same
rate as the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
	   But the number of abortions for every 1,000 live births dropped from 314 in
1996 to 305 in 1997 -- the lowest since 1975, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
	   The preliminary estimate of 1,184,758 legal abortions in 1997 was 3 percent
less than the 1,221,585 abortions in 1996 and the lowest number performed since
1978.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC cited several factors for the decline, including access issues, an
increased willingness to use contraceptives and possibly different attitudes
about the moral implications of abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, the annual CDC report included a breakdown from some
states showing the number of abortions performed through surgery and the number
via drugs. Previously, states had reported only the total number of abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, 16 states reported 2,988 abortions induced by drugs. The Alan
Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research organization, estimated there
were 4,300 drug-induced abortions in all of the United States during the first
half of 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug most commonly used in the United States to induce abortion is
methotrexate. Methotrexate is used to treat certain types of gastrointestinal
disorders and cancers, but doctors have been allowed to prescribe it to induce
abortion since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Another drug, mifepristone, is designed specifically to end pregnancy and is
expected to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration this year. It is
available only through clinical trials. A similar drug used in Europe, RU-486,
remains ensnared in political battles in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   The medications are touted as a way to make the procedure more private and
convenient, without the need for surgery. Women take the medications under a
doctor's supervision during the first 49 days of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Those on both sides of the debate said the medications are unlikely to
affect the overall numbers of abortions but might shift the method away from
surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it will have any effect whatsoever on rates of abortion or
rates of unintended pregnancy,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned
Parenthood Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
	   April Thompson, a spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee,
said: ``It's just another method of taking the life of an unborn child. It will
not change the debate and it will not change the number of abortions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC said that 52 percent of the women who received an abortion in 1997
were 24 or younger. Most of the women were white and unmarried. Fifty-five
percent of the procedures were done in the first two months of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Final 1997 figures -- the most recent year for which such numbers are
available -- including the numbers of abortions in each state, will be released
in the summer.

<HEADLINE> 'Blair Witch' Plans Sequel, Prequel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The witch in the woods isn't done yet.
</P>
<P>
	   The legend in "The Blair Witch Project" will continue with a sequel and a
prequel expanding on the horror tale that became one of the most successful
low-budget films ever made.
</P>
<P>
	   Producers are already scouting locations for "Blair Witch 2," to be released
in October. The prequel telling the witch's early history will follow in summer
2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Artisan Entertainment, which bought "Blair Witch" and the sequel rights for
$1 million at last year's Sundance film festival, hopes to rekindle the magic
that made the first film a $140 million smash.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it was the best million dollars anybody ever spent, even when you
see all the numbers in the 'dot com' world," Amir Malin, Artisan president, said
Thursday. "I don't think you've ever seen real returns, as opposed to paper
returns, like 'Blair Witch."'
</P>
<P>
	   The original "Blair Witch" was one of the most profitable movies ever.
Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez and their company, Haxan Films, shot
the film for about $60,000, with Artisan kicking in $260,000 more in
post-production costs, Malin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sequel and prequel each will have budgets of about $7 million to $10
million, still small by Hollywood standards.
</P>
<P>
	   "Blair Witch 2" is scheduled to begin shooting in early February and will be
directed by documentary filmmaker Joe Berlinger.
</P>
<P>
	   Malin said the movie will not necessarily follow the pattern of the
original, which was told through footage supposedly shot by three fictional
filmmakers who disappeared in the woods while making a documentary about a
legendary witch.
</P>
<P>
	   Artisan is keeping the plots and other details about the followup films
under wraps, including whether the three characters from the original will
return.
</P>
<P>
	   Myrick, Sanchez and their partners with Haxan will be executive producers on
"Blair Witch 2" but are not directing the movie because they are working on
another film, Malin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Malin said the Haxan team will return to write and direct "Blair Witch 3,"
which will span episodes in the witch's history from the 18th century through
the 1990s, leading up to the faux disappearance of the three filmmakers.

<HEADLINE> Census Seeks Head Count Workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wanted: A half-million hard workers to visit neighbors and
get them to talk about themselves. The hours are flexible, the pay is good.
</P>
<P>
	   With the national head count closing in, the Census Bureau launched an
effort Thursday to hire an army of part-time workers to take the tally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our goal is to have a pool of local people who are familiar with their
communities and committed to a successful count in their own neighborhoods,''
Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said the Bureau has 520 offices open across the country with each
needing to hire 800 to 1,000 people for four weeks to six weeks around census
day, April 1. He said the agency will spend $9.5 million on help-wanted
advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   Just 65 percent of American households mailed back their Census forms in
1990. While the Bureau hopes to boost that rate with advertising this time, most
of the workers being hired are needed to visit the homes of people who fail to
respond by mail.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the count is on schedule, Prewitt said, with 150,000 people hired
so far and a pool of about 1 million applicants. He said the agency wants an
overall pool of about 3 million from which to choose.
</P>
<P>
	   Those hired include about 6,000 welfare-to-work applicants, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Legal residents age 18 and older are eligible to work for the Census Bureau.
They do not need to be citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In many areas the agency is seeking bilingual workers. Pay varies from $8.25
to $18.50 per hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt urged anyone interested in a Census job to call the agency's
toll-free number, 1-888-325-7733.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said other aspects of the effort are also on schedule, including:
</P>
<P>
	   --The first local counts will begin in two weeks in rural parts of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   --Printing is ahead of schedule with all 123 million long forms finished and
the work about 75 percent complete on the short forms.
</P>
<P>
	   --The agency has verified 20 million rural addresses, adding 10,000 new
ones, and is now sending the 100 million city addresses to local governments for
verification.
</P>
<P>
	   --The agency has obtained 4.5 million square feet of office space, 17,000
telephones, 100,000 pieces of furniture and thousands of pieces of office
equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said about two-thirds of the workers hired so far are women, many
seeking a second part-time job. He noted that most people who worked for the
agency in dress rehearsals are coming back for the final count.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall there are about 860,000 jobs to be filled, but not all at the same
time, so Prewitt said the agency expects many people will do more than one of
them.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort to count the estimated 274 million people in the United States is
a decade-long program, Prewitt stressed, noting that planning for the 2010 count
already has started.
</P>
<P>
	   He warned that ``the conditions that make it difficult to count this country
completely have magnified since 1990,'' including the presence of more
immigrants, a larger non-English speaking population, a more mobile population,
more total households and more irregular living arrangements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe we can do a basic enumeration better than we did in 1990,'' he
said, but that does not necessarily mean a more accurate census.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said he expects there will still be an undercount, in particular
among minorities, and the agency will need to do a post-census quality check to
measure that undercount and correct it in the overall totals.

<HEADLINE> Country Music Album Sales Decline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- It's a true country heartbreaker: Sales of country
music declined 4.5 percent last year even as sales for the record industry
overall jumped 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Country music sold 69.3 million albums last year, according to SoundScan, a
Hartsdale, N.Y., company that tracks music sales and released 1999 figures on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The most successful was Shania Twain, whose "Come on Over" album sold 5.6
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry officials said country is no longer the fad of the moment, as it
was in the 1980s when Garth Brooks became a superstar.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, they said consolidation of the radio industry has led to tighter
playlists as conglomerates put pressure on stations to be more profitable. That
makes it harder to develop new stars and cultivate record buyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Another reason given for the drop is that many traditional country music
fans have become alienated by the influence of pop on country.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're doing is we're giving away the music to other formats and we're
frustrating the fans of our own format," said Evelyn Shriver, president of the
country division of Asylum Records.
</P>
<P>
	   The record industry overall sold 754.8 million albums in 1999. But among
country performers, only Ms. Twain and the Dixie Chicks (with 3.5 million sales
of "Wide Open Spaces") made the year's list of top 10 sellers.
</P>
<P>
	   The country industry is reliant on a select group of superstars. Brooks, the
Dixie Chicks and Faith Hill each have two of the 10 best-selling country albums
of the year. And four of the top 10 were released in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Trying to add some artists to that mix and create diversity is a priority
for us this year," said Ed Benson of the Country Music Association, a trade
organization that promotes country music.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooks, 37, the biggest-selling artist in country music history, has
indicated he may retire at the end of 2000 to spend more time with his three
young daughters. That could be a big blow to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville has survived such trends before. The industry rebounded from a
decline in the mid-1980s to reach unprecedented heights. Even now, far more
country albums are being sold than a decade ago.

<HEADLINE> 'Satisfaction' Said Rock's Best  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 30 years later, the competition between the
Beatles and the Rolling Stones rages on.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beatles placed nine entries on a list of rock 'n' roll's 100 greatest
songs, as compiled by VH1 in a poll of 700 people in the music industry. The
Stones have five.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's the Stones' celebrated ode to sexual frustration, "(I Can't Get No)
Satisfaction," that topped the list. The Beatles could do no better than ninth,
with "Hey Jude."
</P>
<P>
	   The Stones' 1965 hit has one of the most recognizable guitar riffs in music,
which Keith Richards said came to him one night when he was sleeping.
</P>
<P>
	   "It kind of sticks up as an anthem for the time it was released and for
every generation that came since," said Todd Schwartz, VH1 programming director.
"It strikes a chord with every teen-ager."
</P>
<P>
	   After "Hey Jude," three other Beatles songs made the top 25: "Yesterday," "A
Day in the Life" and "I Want to Hold Your Hand."
</P>
<P>
	   "The Beatles had so many songs that the vote got divided," Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elvis Presley, who had four songs on the list as did Led Zeppelin, couldn't
crack the top 10. The best he could do was No. 18 with "Jailhouse Rock."
</P>
<P>
	   A lot of big names were shut out of the top 100 entirely, among them
Madonna, Fleetwood Mac, Neil Young, U2 and R.E.M. Aretha Franklin's "Respect"
came in second and Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven," a staple of FM radio in
the 1970s, was third.
</P>
<P>
	   Rounding out the top 10 are "Like a Rolling Stone" by Bob Dylan; "Born to
Run" by Bruce Springsteen; "Hotel California" by the Eagles; "Light My Fire" by
the Doors; "Good Vibrations" by the Beach Boys; "Hey Jude"; and "Imagine" by
John Lennon.
</P>
<P>
	   The list's oldest song was "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley &AMP; His
Comets, released in 1954. The newest was Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit,"
from 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Nirvana's hit was the only one from the 1990s to make it. Schwartz said it
may be because VH1's voters were even older than the network's usual audience.
VH1 aims at age 30 and up.
</P>
<P>
	   VH1 will count down the list in a special that runs over five nights,
starting Jan. 17.

    AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Health officials Friday said a flu epidemic
sweeping the Netherlands will infect up to 20 percent of the country before
winter ends.
</P>
<P>
	   The eastern provinces have already reported high numbers of infections,
registering up to 26 cases per 10,000 people, according to the National Center
for Influenza. By contrast, the normal rate is two to three cases per 10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   If the center's forecast holds, up to 3 million of the Netherlands' 15
million inhabitants stand to get sick this winter.
</P>

	   Center spokesman Albert Osterhaus said people were being urged to get
anti-flu vaccinations or medications.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Steady at 4.1 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate held steady at a
three-decade-low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers found jobs, the
biggest gain since July.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department reported today that December's jobless rate matched
November's 4.1 percent, the lowest since a 3.9 percent rate in January 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the unemployment rate averaged 4.2 percent, the lowest
since 3.5 percent in 1969 during the Vietnam War, making last year one of the
most golden job markets in years. In 1998, the unemployment rate averaged 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Employers added 315,000 jobs to their payrolls in December, much more than
the 230,000 range many analysts were expecting. Workers founds jobs at
construction companies, engineering firms, health care centers and retail
stores. But manufacturing continued to lose jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton today credited information technology with helping "to
create the unprecedented prosperity we enjoy at the end of the 20th century." He
said the jobless rate for all of 1999 was 4.2 percent -- "the lowest in 30
years, the lowest annual unemployment rate since 1969, the lowest annual
unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics ever recorded."
</P>
<P>
	   In November, 222,000 workers found jobs; the government had previously
estimated 234,000.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, employers added 2.7 million jobs, compared with 2.9 million in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose by 0.4
percent to $13.46 in December, in line with the rise some analysts were
forecasting. That was the largest gain since September. In November, wages grew
by a tiny 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, economists and
members of the Federal Reserve worry that the combination could produce
inflation down the road. Their shared concern: that employers trying to attract
scarce workers to fill job openings lure them with higher wages and benefits --
increased costs that could drive up consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates three times last years to slow
the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists believe
the Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting, given
continuing strong economic growth. Today's report boosts the odds of that
happening, some economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bond market, worried that strong wage and job growth could lead to
inflation in the future, reacted negatively to the report. Bond prices fell this
morning as yields on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bonds climbed to 6.58
percent from 6.55 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The strong wage and job-growth numbers set up the likelihood of a Federal
Reserve rate hike at the February meeting of a quarter of a percentage point,"
said Paul Kasriel, economist for the Northern Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the gain in payroll jobs, manufacturing lost 1,000 jobs in December
although the pace of job loss is slowing. For the year, manufacturing lost
248,000 jobs with most of the decline occurring during the first six months.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. manufacturers have seen foreign demand for their products rebound
somewhat from a global financial crisis that began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Employment in construction grew by 16,000 in December, helped out by
better-than-usual weather. Over the year, construction gained 212,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The service sector, the driving force of job creation in the United States,
added 298,000 jobs in December with retailers adding 65,000 jobs, twice the
average for the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Engineering firms and management services added 23,000 jobs, while health
care providers added 16,000.

<HEADLINE> Thais Target 'Anna and King' Videos  </HEADLINE>
    By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai police have swung into action against the
banned Hollywood movie "Anna and The King," arresting two people allegedly
peddling pirated video disks and threatening them with long prison terms for
insulting Thailand's revered monarchy.
</P>
<P>
	   The filmmaker, 20th Century Fox, meanwhile confirmed Friday that it would
not appeal against a censors' ruling last month banning the film, starring
Oscar-winner Jodie Foster and action star Chow Yun-fat, for allegedly
denigrating a 19th century king.
</P>
<P>
	   "Partly because we respect Thai law, partly because it would be no use,"
said Atsara Pithaksorayuth, a Fox public relations official. "It is impossible
to improve the film to meet the demand of the censorship board."
</P>
<P>
	   Though the movie was easily banned from cinemas, many had expected
Thailand's flourishing market in pirated video cassettes and video discs to
easily circumvent the ban.
</P>
<P>
	   Copies of "Anna and The King" are reported to be going for $3.50.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested Jinjutha Boondharmmakul, 24, a university student, and
vendor Ravipatra Sawadwattanawong after they were caught on Thursday in
possession of 400 CD versions in a market parking lot.
</P>
<P>
	   Beside facing charges of violating copyright laws, which carry penalties of
up to two years in prison and a $1,080 fine, they could be charged under
seldom-applied laws against insulting the king, said Police Col. Suchart
Teerasawad.
</P>
<P>
	   The men could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison for diminishing the
standing of the monarchy, an institution revered by nearly all of Thailand's 61
million people. But King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning
monarch, has made it known that he does not want anyone prosecuted under the
laws this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Maj. Gen. Prakard Satamarn, who headed the censorship board, said the
crackdown on video versions would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anna and The King" was banned from being filmed and screened in Thailand
because of its depiction of Mongkut, a 19th century king of Siam, as Thailand
was then known.
</P>
<P>
	   Historians said the story was inaccurate, giving Anna Leonowens, an
Englishwoman hired to teach Mongkut's children, a prominence in court life and
hinted romantic involvement with the king that did not exist.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 116.35; Nasdaq Up 71.27  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks staged a strong advance in early trading today, with
blue-chip shares rising despite more signs of inflationary pressure and the
technology group mounting a modest rebound even after a profit warning by
Lucent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 116.35 at 11,369.61, extending the 250-point rebound of the past
two days.
</P>
<P>
	   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 71.27 at 3,798.40 after
plunging 400 points over the prior three sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Other broad-market indicators were also positive, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index rising 6.09 at 1,409.54.
</P>
<P>
	   The strength in technology came despite late Thursday's disclosure by Lucent
Technologies that the company won't meet most profit forecasts for the final
quarter of 1999. Lucent plunged afterwards on other markets and was trading
early today at 53 1/16, down 15 15/16 from Thursday's close on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the open of regular trading, the government reported that the
nation's unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade-low of 4.1 percent in
December as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest
gain since July.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the latest sign of a strong labor market that could force employers
to pay higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate. The
Labor Department reported that average hourly earnings rose by 0.4 percent to
$13.46 in December, the largest gain since September, but in line with what most
were forecasting.
</P>
<P>
	   While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, the Federal
Reserve has already bumped up interest rates three times in less than a year to
slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists
believe the Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting,
possibly hurting company profits.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading today, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than
a 3-to-2 margin on the NYSE, while Nasdaq gainers led by a 4-to-3 ratio. The
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 1.74 at 477.08.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 161.11 million shares in the early going, up sharply
from 118.79 at the same point on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was up 2.87 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.77 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.87 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Anti-Cyber-Terror Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pledging to defend against ``those who would use
cyberspace to do us harm,'' President Clinton said today he will ask Congress
for $91 million to develop new technologies to combat cyber-terrorists.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to reporters before departing to West Virginia for Middle East
peace talks, Clinton said the New Year's Y2K threat underscored ``how really
interconnected we all are'' -- and revealed how one person can use a computer
for good or sinister purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has never been a time like this, in which we have the power to
create knowledge and the power to create havoc, and both those powers rest in
the same hands,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our critical systems, from power structures to air traffic control, are
connected and run by computers,'' the president said. ``We must make those
systems more secure so that America can be more secure.''
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the budget request he will submit to Congress next month, Clinton
said the $91 million cyberspace initiative is part of a $2 billion proposal for
maintaining the security of the nation's increasingly digitalized
infrastructure. He said he would work to ensure that the security initiatives do
not tread on privacy rights of citizens and businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is essential that we do not undermine liberty in the name of liberty,''
he said. ``I hope that ... we will work together to ensure that information
technology will create unprecedented prosperity in the 21st century in an
atmosphere and environment that makes all Americans more secure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has frequently expressed concern about the emerging threat that
other governments, hackers and thieves pose to a nation and a world now
dependent on high technology.
</P>
<P>
	   A key adviser on Thursday included cyber-terrorism near the top of a list of
threats facing America in the new century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there's a whole new realm of threat we're going to be dealing
with, the ability to take weapons of mass destruction across national borders
with relative ease; the ability to attack our computers that run our
infrastructure through cyber-terrorism,'' National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
said in response to questions after a National Press Club speech.

<P>
	   The new initiative builds on steps the administration announced last year.
It would seek to develop new technologies, increase public and private
cooperation against computer sabotage, improve training for government agents
and boost protection of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his proposal includes a new program to offer college
scholarships to students in the field of computer security, on the condition
that they perform public service afterward. ``This program will create a new
generation of computer security specialists who will work to defend our nation's
computers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last July, the administration announced that it was creating a
governmentwide security network to protect against hackers. The plan included an
elaborate network of electronic obstacles, monitors and analyzers to watch for
suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
	   The first 500 intrusion monitors were to be installed on nonmilitary
government computers early this year, and the full system was to be completed by
May 2003.

<HEADLINE> France Listeria Poisoning Kills 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PARIS (AP) -- Two people, including a newborn infant, have died and four
others poisoned by listeria, a potent bacteria that has tainted some French meat
products, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   A newborn baby was infected while in the womb and died later, while an
elderly person died after eating meat produced by Coudray, a company based in
Sarthe, in northwestern France, officials said. The company's products have been
removed from supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
	   Four other cases of poisoning have been discovered, according to the
National Institute of Public Health Surveillance.
</P>
<P>
	   All cases concern the same potentially deadly bacteria, Listeria
monocytogenes. The Agriculture Ministry on Thursday described the outbreak as a
"serious listeria alert."
</P>
<P>
	   "The factory has been closed for cleaning and disinfection and will not
reopen until these measures have proved efficient," the ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Listeria is found most often in cheese and meat products. Infections can be
fatal if not quickly treated with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
	   Pregnant women or people with weak immune systems are especially vulnerable
to the virus. The disease can take up to eight weeks to incubate, with symptoms
that include fever, headaches and nausea.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the bacteria was found in pork tongue and pots and slices of
rillette produced at the Sarthe factory. Rillette is a coarsely chopped pate in
which fat is added. It is a commonly eaten food in France.

<HEADLINE> IMF Head Urges More Reforms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PARIS (AP) -- Michel Camdessus, the outgoing managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, said today that the IMF should be given
better-defined responsibilities and more political weight.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe in the political responsibility of multilateral institutions,"
Camdessus said in an interview with the French financial daily Les Echos.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus said that the IMF's interim committee -- currently a consultative
grouping with no executive powers -- should be transformed into a full-fledged
decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said that he would like to turn the G7 summit into a wider gathering
every two years by including the IMF's 24 board member countries, the World Bank
and the secretary-general of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   "This would, at last, enable us to establish a coordination of strategies,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The G7, or Group of Seven major industrial nations, gathers the political
leaders of the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy
for periodic meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus, who has made it clear he will resign in mid-February, said he is
proud of the support the IMF provided during his tenure to countries such as
Poland.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today Poland can hope to join not only the European Union, but also the
euro," Camdessus said, referring to the single European currency. "They are
aiming for a balanced budget in 2003, inflation below 4 percent and, by that
date, they should have completed privatization."
</P>
<P>
	   He warned that the dispute between the IMF and Russia was yet to be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that although Russia has met economic criteria set by the IMF, the
Russian Parliament has failed to adopt two key pieces of legislation. One covers
financial institution bankruptcies and the other, transfers to state coffers
from government-owned monopolies.

	   Jobless Rate Steady at 4.1 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate held steady at
a three-decade-low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers
found jobs, the biggest gain since July. The Labor Department
reported today that December's jobless rate matched November's 4.1
percent, the lowest since a 3.9 percent rate in January 1970. For
all of 1999, the unemployment rate averaged 4.2 percent, the lowest
since 3.5 percent in 1969 during the Vietnam War, making last year
one of the most golden job markets in years. In 1998, the
unemployment rate averaged 4.5 percent. President Clinton today
credited information technology with helping ``to create the
unprecedented prosperity we enjoy at the end of the 20th century.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pledging to defend against ``those who would

will ask Congress for $91 million to develop new technologies to
combat cyber-terrorists. Speaking to reporters before departing to
West Virginia for Middle East peace talks, Clinton said the New
Year's Y2K threat underscored ``how really interconnected we all
are'' -- and revealed how one person can use a computer for good or

	   Consumer Electronics Show Opens

	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A refrigerator that can sense when milk goes
sour; a microwave that will tell you what to cook from the
leftovers in your house; a car with a chip that stops you from
speeding. Electronics manufacturers at the giant Consumer
Electronics Show that opened yesterday are showcasing hundreds of
new ``smart'' devices like these, claiming they can make life
easier through seamless connections to the Internet. But a big
question is: Will consumers bite on such ideas? Computing and
software giants such as Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, Cisco and
Intel are betting they will, as are consumer electronics
manufacturers including Sony, Panasonic, Whirlpool, General
Electric and Casio.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly half the partners at accounting giant

many more such lapses went unreported, a review led by an
independent consultant has found. The Securities and Exchange
Commission, which made the consultant's review public yesterday,
said its investigation of New York-based PricewaterhouseCoopers is
continuing. A year ago, the firm agreed in a settlement to conduct
the review and create a $2.5 million education fund after the SEC
alleged that some of its accountants compromised their independence
by owning stock in corporations they audited.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Settles Illegal Aliens Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A Holiday Inn Express hotel has agreed to pay $72,000 to
nine illegal immigrants from Mexico who were fired as housekeepers in alleged
retaliation for leading a successful union organizing drive.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement was reached yesterday between Holiday Inn Express Hotel and
Suites, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Labor
Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Jaye Rykunyk, secretary-treasurer and principal officer of Local 17 of the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees, said the agreement was groundbreaking.
</P>
<P>
	   "The EEOC has taken the position that undocumented workers are entitled to
compensation for discrimination. It's a nationwide precedent for the EEOC,"
Rykunyk said.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, the EEOC said it had limited authority to help workers who were
in the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the settlement, the workers likely will have to leave the country
because they are undocumented, according to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's district director, Curtis Aljets.
</P>
<P>
	   The hotel fired the workers on Oct. 13 while they were in the process of
organizing a union. The hotel's manager said he turned them in to the INS
because he feared penalties for employing them.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS arrested eight of the workers on the same day. All nine workers, who
fought deportation, are still in Minnesota, awaiting an INS hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Two days after the arrests, the housekeepers' union filed an unfair labor
practices complaint with the NLRB.
</P>
<P>
	   The NLRB and the EEOC jointly investigated the hotel. The NLRB found that
the hotel was in violation of the National Labor Relations Act by retaliating
against its employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The EEOC found that the hotel violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by
denying the workers lunch and rest breaks, imposing more rigorous monitoring and
productivity schedules and denying them raises after a 90-day probationary
period.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Paul lawyer J. Michael Colloton, who represented Holiday Inn, said the
hotel does not acknowledge wrongdoing but settled the lawsuit because it was
less expensive than fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   The hotel agreed to pay the employees $1,000 each in compensatory damages.
The settlement also includes $7,000 in back pay for each worker.
</P>
<P>
	   Holiday Inn also signed a two-year contract with the union, providing a
starting wage of $7.25 for housekeepers, a raise after 90 days and another raise
after one year.
</P>
<P>
	   The hotel also has promised not to retaliate or discriminate against other
employees and to train its managers and supervisors. It must report to the EEOC
for one year.
</P>
<P>
	   The workers involved were Rosa Albino, Evertina Albino, Reyna Albino, Norma
del Toro, Bulfrano Albino, Bruna Alvarez, Estella Albino, Amado Flores and
Francilla Albino.

	   Among the guests aboard the 1,316-passenger Rotterdam when it sailed from
Port Everglades on Thursday were four couples who each booked a penthouse
verandah suite costing more than $275,000 for a 96-day global cruise, according
to officials from Holland America Line, the ship's Seattle-based owner.
</P>
<P>
	   Beverages, tips, shopping and shore excursions easily can add an additional

</P>
<P>
	   Some 925 guests were booked for the entire three-month itinerary at fares
ranging from $27,000 to $138,000 per passenger. Holland America said that was an
increase of more than 50 percent from the number taking the world cruise last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Most remaining cabins were filed by travelers taking just parts of the

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Steady at 4.1 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate held steady at a
three-decade-low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers found jobs, the
biggest gain since July.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department reported today that December's jobless rate matched
November's 4.1 percent, the lowest since a 3.9 percent rate in January 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the unemployment rate averaged 4.2 percent, the lowest
since 3.5 percent in 1969 during the Vietnam War, making last year one of the
most golden job markets in years. In 1998, the unemployment rate averaged 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Stock investors seemed to take the news in stride. The Dow Jones industrial
average gained 140 points in the first hour of trading and the Nasdaq index,
regaining ground lost in major sell-offs earlier this week, was up 80 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The bond market, worried that strong wage and job growth could lead to
inflation in the future, reacted negatively. Bond prices fell as yields on the
bellwether 30-year Treasury bonds climbed to 6.57 percent from 6.55 percent late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Employers added 315,000 jobs to their payrolls in December, much more than
the 230,000 range many analysts were expecting. Workers founds jobs at
construction companies, engineering firms, health care centers and retail
stores. But manufacturing continued to lose jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton today credited information technology with helping "to
create the unprecedented prosperity we enjoy at the end of the 20th century." He
said the jobless rate for all of 1999 was 4.2 percent -- "the lowest in 30
years, the lowest annual unemployment rate since 1969, the lowest annual
unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics ever recorded."
</P>
<P>
	   In November, 222,000 workers found jobs; the government had previously
estimated 234,000.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, employers added 2.7 million jobs, compared with 2.9 million in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "American workers are faring well in this econony," said Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman. "They are sharing in our nation's prosperity and this is
prosperity that is broadly shared," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose by 0.4
percent to $13.46 in December, in line with the rise some analysts were
forecasting. That was the largest gain since September. In November, wages grew
by a tiny 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, economists and
members of the Federal Reserve worry that the combination could produce
inflation down the road. Their shared concern: that employers trying to attract
scarce workers to fill job openings lure them with higher wages and benefits --
increased costs that could drive up consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates three times last years to slow
the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists believe
the Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting, given
continuing strong economic growth. Today's report boosts the odds of that
happening, some economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The strong wage and job-growth numbers set up the likelihood of a Federal
Reserve rate hike at the February meeting of a quarter of a percentage point,"
said Paul Kasriel, economist for the Northern Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the gain in payroll jobs, manufacturing lost 1,000 jobs in December
although the pace of job loss is slowing. For the year, manufacturing lost
248,000 jobs with most of the decline occurring during the first six months.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. manufacturers have seen foreign demand for their products rebound
somewhat from a global financial crisis that began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Employment in construction grew by 16,000 in December, helped out by
better-than-usual weather. Over the year, construction gained 212,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The service sector, the driving force of job creation in the United States,
added 298,000 jobs in December with retailers adding 65,000 jobs, twice the
average for the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Engineering firms and management services added 23,000 jobs, while health
care providers added 16,000.

<P>
	   The strength in technology came despite the disclosure by Lucent
Technologies late yesterday that the company won't meet most profit forecasts
for the final quarter of 1999. Lucent plunged afterwards on other markets and
was trading today at 53 15/16, down 15 1/16 from Thursday's close on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucent's troubles were apparently seen as a gain for its main rivals in
supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make
up the Internet. Nortel Networks was up 6 3/4 at 91 3/4 on the NYSE, while in
heavy Nasdaq trading, Cisco Systems was up 3 1/4 at 103 1/4 and Ciena was up 9
3/16 at 55 1/16 and JDS Uniphase was up 17 1/8 at 166 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, before today's open, the government reported that the nation's
unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade-low of 4.1 percent in December
as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since
July.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the latest sign of a strong labor market that could force employers
to pay higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate. The
Labor Department reported that average hourly earnings rose by 0.4 percent to
$13.46 in December, the largest gain since September, but in line with what most
were forecasting.
</P>
<P>
	   While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, the Federal
Reserve has already bumped up interest rates three times in less than a year to
slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists
believe the Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting,
possibly hurting company profits.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading today, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a
2-to-1 margin on the NYSE, while Nasdaq gainers led by a 3-to-2 ratio. The
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 6.67 at 482.01.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 406.66 million shares as of late morning, up sharply
from 310.72 million at the same point on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was up 2.87 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.77 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.87 percent.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army said today it is dumping its advertising agency,
Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. of New York, which held the account for 12 years and coined
the ad slogan, ``Be All That You Can Be.''
</P>
<P>
	   In what it billed as a ``dramatic series of changes'' in how it markets

</P>
<P>
	   The Army said Young &AMP; Rubicam is welcome to compete for the new contract, in
which the firm's compensation will depend on how many enlistments result from
its advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> More Spending Sought for Farm Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will seek $1.3 billion in new
spending for farm conservation programs in its 2001 budget, including $600
million in payments to farmers who voluntarily take steps to stop runoff from
their land.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration also is proposing to expand the popular Conservation
Reserve Program, which pays farmers to take environmentally sensitive land out
of production for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, who announced the proposals today during a campaign
trip to Iowa, said they would ``provide needed financial support to our family
farmers as well as tremendous environmental benefits for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals would nearly double what the Agriculture Department is
spending this year on conservation programs. The administration's 2001 budget
also is expected to include a new subsidy program to compensate farmers for
depressed commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the administration's plan is the new $600 million subsidy
program, which was introduced in Congress last year by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
Payment levels under the ``Conservation Security Program'' would be based on the
size scope of the conservation measures taken by the farmers. They could include
planting grass along streams and cutting back on livestock grazing.
</P>
<P>
	   An existing program that provides assistance for manure control and a
variety of other conservation measures would be increased from $174 million this
year to $325 million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Other proposals include:
</P>
<P>
	   --Increasing the acreage cap in the Conservation Reserve Program from 3.6
million to 40 million acres. That would allow more than twice as much land to be
enrolled in the program during the 1991 fiscal year as would be permitted under
current law.
</P>
<P>
	   --Expanding a program that pays farmers to restore wetlands by 210,000 acres
in 2001 and an additional 250,000 acres a year after that. The Wetlands Reserve
Program is currently limited to 975,000 acres.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today, with blue-chip shares surging
despite more signs of inflationary pressure and the technology group mounting a
modest rebound even after a profit warning by Lucent.
</P>
<P>
	   At midday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 134.96 at
11,388.22, extending the 250-point rebound of the past two days and wiping out
the remainder of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. Earlier in the day, the Dow was up
nearly 202 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 57.67 at 3,784.80 after
plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Other broad-market indicators were also posting sizable gains, with the

<HEADLINE> Accounting Firm Violations Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly half the partners at accounting giant
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP reported having violated rules prohibiting them from
owning stock in companies they audit, and many more such lapses went unreported,
a review led by an independent consultant has found.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which made the consultant's review
public on Thursday, said its investigation of New York-based
PricewaterhouseCoopers is continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, the firm agreed in a settlement to conduct the review and create
a $2.5 million education fund after the SEC alleged that some of its accountants
compromised their independence by owning stock in corporations they audited.
</P>
<P>
	   PricewaterhouseCoopers promised at the time to take steps to ensure that it
didn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the new inquiry, five partners of the firm and a slightly
larger number of other employees had been dismissed, and other employees were
disciplined but not fired, a PricewaterhouseCoopers managing partner, Kenton J.
Sicchitano, told The New York Times. He declined to give names.
</P>
<P>
	   In light of the disappointing results of the review, the SEC said Thursday
it has asked an accounting industry oversight board to sponsor similar
independent reviews at other accounting firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC has been stressing the need for accounting firms to be more
independent of the companies they audit. The watchdog agency's rules explicitly
forbid accountants from owning stock in their audit clients.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Turner, the SEC's chief accountant, called the report by the
independent consultant, New York attorney Jess Fardella, "a sobering reminder
that accounting professionals need to renew their commitment to the fundamental
principle of auditor independence."
</P>
<P>
	   Fardella and his four-person team found some excusable mistakes by the
accounting firm but also "laxity and insensitivity to the importance of
independence" and "serious" problems of corporate structure and culture.
</P>
<P>
	   The report found:
</P>
<P>
	   --Nearly half the firm's 2,698 partners, or 1,301, reported having committed
at least one violation of the auditor independence rules while 153 of them
admitted to more than 10 each.
</P>
<P>
	   --Of a total 8,064 violations reported by those involved, 81.3 percent were
by partners and 17.4 percent by managers. Nearly half of the reported violations
were committed by partners who perform services related to financial audits of
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   --Almost half the reported violations involved direct investments by the
PricewaterhouseCoopers professionals in securities, mutual funds, bank accounts
or insurance products related to client companies.
</P>
<P>
	   --In addition, Fardella's team did random checks that found that 77.5
percent of the firm's partners failed to report at least one violation they
committed. That means an estimated 86 percent of the 2,698 partners had at least
one violation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Nestor, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said he had no comment
on the report but provided a copy of a letter sent Wednesday by chairman
Nicholas G. Moore and chief executive James J. Schiro to the firm's partners.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter termed the Fardella report "embarrassing to our firm and to all
of us as partners" and said that "Equally important, it may also raise questions
and concerns among our clients and our people."
</P>
<P>
	   However, the executives added that the violations of the independence rules
cited by the report, while unacceptable, "did not in any way impair the
professional objectivity and integrity" of the company's audits.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are determined to do everything possible so that neither our firm nor
our clients ever again suffer from independence-related problems," Moore and
Schiro wrote. "To facilitate this, we have established expansive new policies
and procedures to address previous infractions and to prevent future ones."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC appointed Fardella in March 1999 to supervise the internal review
after it censured PricewaterhouseCoopers for alleged violations of the
independence rules.
</P>
<P>
	   In its settlement with the SEC, the firm agreed to set up the $2.5 million
education fund, to be used to enhance awareness in the accounting profession of
the independence rules.
</P>
<P>
	   PricewaterhouseCoopers, created from the July 1998 merger of Price
Waterhouse LLP and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand LLP, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing
in agreeing to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the accord, the firm also agreed to be censured, to improve its
procedures for monitoring adherence to the independence rules and to conduct the
internal investigation supervised by Fardella.

</P>

	   USDA predicts that net farm income will drop $7.6 billion this year to $40.4

federal aid this fall. The administration hopes to steer at least some of that
money into conservation programs.
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   The conservation proposals would represent a fundamental shift in the way
the government has traditionally supported farmers, said Agriculture Secretary
Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have been paying farmers for decades to grow commodities and, in some
cases, not to grow commodities. Now we must start thinking of the land itself as
our most valuable commodity,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Freaks and Geeks': Fresh New Course  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- "Freaks and Geeks" reminds us that it's not enough just to
say "outsider." Alienation comes in many shapes and sizes, and this drama, as
its title might suggest, celebrates the rich variety.
</P>
<P>
	   Set in a midwestern high school, circa 1980, "Freaks and Geeks" is a
knowing, affectionate and often very funny outpost on the rim of suburban life.
What we find there resists stereotypes and Hollywood styling. The look of the
show is remarkably unremarkable. The characters, like the world they occupy,
seem captured as they really are.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, "Freaks and Geeks" is hardly TV's first showcase for teen-age
outcasts. But what makes it so special is its fresh take on outsider status --
and its bounty of outsiders.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, happily, this wonderful show has been rescued from the Saturday fringes
of the NBC schedule, where, since its September premiere, no one knew about it
but adoring critics. NBC has moved the series to a more accessible slot: Monday
at 8 p.m. EST. Its survival there apparently depends on an instant upsurge in
the ratings.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's hoping.
</P>
<P>
	   "Freaks and Geeks" centers on Lindsay Weir. A bright but disaffected
sophomore, she has sought refuge from one fringe group (the school's brain
trust) by penetrating another (the fun-loving, rules-defying freaks).
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh, you're that chick who got an A," says gratuitous burnout Daniel, trying
to place her.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yeah, well," says Lindsay, feeling nailed. "Whadaya gonna do?"
</P>
<P>
	   Played by the adorable Linda Cardellini, Lindsay is a complicated mix of
goodwill, gumption and free-floating peevishness. The recent death of Lindsay's
grandmother has shaken her, triggering fundamental doubts about the meaning of
life and, more to the point, who she wants to be.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, as she tries to redefine herself, everyone is on her case -- especially
her father (Joe Flaherty), who, dispensing guidance, always cites the worst-case
scenario.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know who used to cut class?" he lectures Lindsay. "Jimi Hendrix. You
know what happened to him? He DIED!"
</P>
<P>
	   "I just cut one class!" Lindsay fires back. "And guess what? Everybody's
still alive!"
</P>
<P>
	   She's alive, yes, but steeped in confusion.
</P>
<P>
	   She dreads a first date with her would-be boyfriend Nick, whom she assumes
will expect her to go all the way. But when, instead, he serenades her off-key
to a Styx record ("Laaaady! When you're with me I'm smiling!"), she's

	   In a chronic funk, Lindsay views her world through wary eyes. She reacts to
its absurdities with a stricken smile. And in the face of all the brazen winners
who surround her, she seems hellbent on taking up for the underdog (which may
help explain the choice of her new friends).
</P>
<P>
	   Another underdog: her freshman brother. Played by John Daley, Sam is a sweet
kid who, small and immature for his age, is dwarfed even by the petite Lindsay,
who on at least one occasion defends him against a bully.
</P>
<P>
	   But unlike Lindsay, Sam is fundamentally happy hanging out with his geek
pals. Together they endure the indignities of PhysEd and contemplate such issues
as, "Will girls ever like us?"
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe so. On this week's episode, a lovely transfer student befriends Sam
and his chums. She launches model rockets with them. She pigs out with them at
an all-you-can-eat ribs restaurant. She's a dream come true for the boys.
</P>
<P>

"in" crowd, what should be their next move?

<P>
	   As its heroes struggle to maintain their footing against the undertow of
adolescence, "Freaks and Geeks" is funny without being phony, tender without
being sentimental, honest without being harsh.
</P>
<P>
	   Even in its new time slot, this show may still be a Nielsen pariah. But make
no mistake, if it were watched by everyone whose high school experience it
echoes, "Freaks and Geeks" would be a Top 10 hit.

	   At least four major investment firms downgraded Lucent following late
Thursday's warning by the communications equipment maker that its profits from
the final three months of 1999 won't meet Wall Street forecasts. But Lucent's
troubles were apparently seen as a gain for its main rivals in supplying speedy
fiber-optic gear for the communications networks that make up the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The German software group reported that its pretax profit doubled last year
as the company reached its goal of 15 percent to 20 percent sales growth. SAP is
scheduled to report more precise figures on Jan. 24.

	   The Atlanta-based beverage company named a new head for its European
division, which struggled through a contamination scare and a huge recall last
year. Charles S. Frenette will become an executive vice president and take over
the Greater Europe Group, which includes 49 countries, following the retirement
of William P. Casey. Frenette, 47, is currently the chief marketing officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The company warned that it only expects to break-even in per-share profits
for the fourth quarter. A First Call/Thomson Financial survey of four analysts

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Steady at 4.1 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate held steady at a
three-decade-low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers found jobs, the
biggest gain since July.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department reported today that December's jobless rate matched
November's 4.1 percent, the lowest since a 3.9 percent rate in January 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the unemployment rate averaged 4.2 percent, the lowest
since 3.5 percent in 1969 during the Vietnam War, making last year one of the
most golden job markets in years. In 1998, the unemployment rate averaged 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Stock investors seemed to take the news in stride. The Dow Jones industrial
average gained nearly 135 points by midday and the Nasdaq index, regaining
ground lost in major sell-offs earlier this week, was up more than 57 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The bond market, worried that strong wage and job growth could lead to
inflation in the future, reacted negatively. Bond prices fell as yields on the
bellwether 30-year Treasury bonds climbed to 6.57 percent from 6.55 percent late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Employers added 315,000 jobs to their payrolls in December, much more than
the 230,000 range many analysts were expecting. Workers founds jobs at
construction companies, engineering firms, health care centers and retail
stores. But manufacturing continued to lose jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton today credited information technology with helping "to
create the unprecedented prosperity we enjoy at the end of the 20th century." He
said the jobless rate for all of 1999 was 4.2 percent -- "the lowest in 30
years, the lowest annual unemployment rate since 1969, the lowest annual
unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics ever recorded."
</P>
<P>
	   In November, 222,000 workers found jobs; the government had previously
estimated 234,000.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, employers added 2.7 million jobs, compared with 2.9 million in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "American workers are faring well in this econony," said Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman. "They are sharing in our nation's prosperity and this is
prosperity that is broadly shared," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose by 0.4
percent to $13.46 in December, in line with the rise some analysts were
forecasting. That was the largest gain since September. In November, wages grew
by a tiny 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, economists and
members of the Federal Reserve worry that the combination could produce
inflation down the road. Their shared concern: that employers trying to attract
scarce workers to fill job openings lure them with higher wages and benefits --
increased costs that could drive up consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates three times last years to slow
the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists believe
the Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting, given
continuing strong economic growth. Today's report boosts the odds of that
happening, some economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The strong wage and job-growth numbers set up the likelihood of a Federal
Reserve rate hike at the February meeting of a quarter of a percentage point,"
said Paul Kasriel, economist for the Northern Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the gain in payroll jobs, manufacturing lost 1,000 jobs in December
although the pace of job loss is slowing. For the year, manufacturing lost
248,000 jobs with most of the decline occurring during the first six months.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. manufacturers have seen foreign demand for their products rebound
somewhat from a global financial crisis that began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Employment in construction grew by 16,000 in December, helped out by
better-than-usual weather. Over the year, construction gained 212,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The service sector, the driving force of job creation in the United States,
added 298,000 jobs in December with retailers adding 65,000 jobs, twice the
average for the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Engineering firms and management services added 23,000 jobs, while health
care providers added 16,000.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Schools Improving  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Compared with the 1980s, America's public schools are
doing a better job of educating the nation's children and preparing them for
college, a study released Friday said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report by the Center on Education Policy and the American Youth Policy
Forum finds, despite public perception that public schools are failing,
government figures verify that they have improved.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, ``The Good News About American Education,'' found that fewer
students are dropping out, students are taking more challenging courses, and
more students with disabilities find their way into mainstream classrooms. The
study was based on analysis of two decades of government data.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Critics and reformers are overemphasizing the bad and slighting the good.
We're saying that of course we have to do better, but we've moved a far distance
in 15 years,'' said Jack Jennings, a former Education Department official who
directs the public schools advocate Center on Education Policy, which advocates
for public schools. ``The public sounds like it's giving up on the public
schools,'' Jennings said, ``and we have to take a long, deep breath.''
</P>
<P>
	   Education Secretary Richard Riley agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This progress demonstrates that the efforts to reform American education
by raising standards and strengthening our investments in our schools is
working,'' he said. ``It also sends the clear message that we should continue to
support and improve public education and not be lured down the dead-end road of
vouchers that drain precious resources from our public schools.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report, which admits that much work is yet to be done, is based on
statistics from Riley's Education Department that generally paint a bright
picture.
</P>
<P>
	   The study notes that the overall dropout rate declined by 4 percent and the
rate among black youth dropped 8 percent between 1972 and 1997, the latest year
for which figures were available.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the study's other findings:
</P>
<P>
	   --Scores on the math portion of the SAT increased 17 points, verbal scores 2
points, between 1983 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   --Scores on standardized science and math achievement tests improved between
1982 and 1996 among pupils aged 9, 13 and 17.
</P>
<P>
	   --A greater percentage of students were going to college, 14 percent more in
1997 than in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking at school crime overall between 1993 and 1997, the study found the
rate dropped from 155 to 102 incidents per 1,000 children. Violent crimes
dropped by 19 incidents, and seriously violent crime by 4 incidents, for every
1,000 pupils, the study said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report mentioned a recent spate of school shootings in Colorado, Oregon,
Arkansas and elsewhere almost in passing: ``Although recent tragic school
shootings have reminded the nation that violent death at school is intolerable
no matter how rare an event, children are safer in schools than in the community
or at home.''
</P>
<P>
	   Samuel Halperin, a senior fellow with the American Youth Policy Forum, said
that even if the recent shootings had been included, the crime rate in public
schools still would have declined.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This report is not saying crime is not a problem,'' he said. ``We're just
saying that it's declining.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jeanne Brennan, a spokeswoman for Education Trust, an advocacy group for
poor minority students, complained that the study gives short shrift to gaps in
achievement between minorities and white students.
</P>
<P>
	   Halperin acknowledged that disparity is ``much too large'' but said
statistics show it is narrowing. For example, among 9-year-olds the difference
between black and white students' math achievement scores was an average of 29
points on a standardized achievement test in 1982, while the difference was 25
points in 1996.

<HEADLINE> 17 former utility workers harmed by asbestos settle for $2 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A group of asbestos companies agreed to pay $2
million to 14 retired utility workers and the heirs of three others stricken
with asbestos-linked diseases at power stations a generation ago.
<P>
	   The men, ranging in age from 56 to 75, had suffered exposure to asbestos
insulation products while working at Rochester Gas &AMP; Electric Corp. as far back
as the late 1950s, their attorney, Dennis Herron, said Friday. Most of them
retired in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the men who sued for damages in 1997 have since died of lung, colon
and throat cancers. Their share of the award goes to their families. The
wrongful death and injury lawsuit had gotten to the first day of jury selection
Thursday before being settled.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the settlement, the identities of the 21 defendants - asbestos
manufacturers, suppliers and distributors - were kept confidential. The utility
was not sued because New York employers are protected from claims under a
workers' compensation law.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were employed at a variety of power stations in the Rochester
region, including the Ginna nuclear plant on Lake Ontario's southern shore.
Power plants use great amounts of insulation for high-pressure steam pipes.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government banned the use of asbestos at industrial work places
in 1972. Exposure to asbestos can result in illness anywhere from 10 to 40 years
later, Herron said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The interesting thing with a lot of these 17 guys is they didn't work
directly with these products," he said. "They were doing their job next to a guy
who was replacing asbestos pipe covering ... and were exposed as a bystander."
</P>
<P>
	   All of the men were eventually stricken with illnesses that scientists have
linked to asbestos exposure, from various cancers to pleural thickening and
scarring of the lungs.
</P>
<P>
	   It was at least the fourth asbestos lawsuit in Rochester since 1996 that
ended in a payout.
</P>
<P>
	   In January 1996, the family of a retired Kodak worker who had recently died
of mesothelioma - the only form of lung cancer directly linked to asbestos
exposure - was awarded $375,000 in a settlement with five asbestos manufacturers
and a distributor.
</P>
<P>
	   In August 1997, nine asbestos manufacturers and distributors paid more than
$500,000 to the widow of a former Eastman Kodak Co. worker who had died five
months earlier of mesothelioma.
</P>
<P>
	   Last June, 18 makers and suppliers of asbestos paid $1.25 million to a Kodak
worker and the families of four fellow employees who had died of
asbestos-related illnesses.

<HEADLINE> New Peace Corps Director Sworn In  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new Peace Corps director, sworn in Friday, says he
wants more volunteers in developing countries to work with computers as a means
of offering high-tech assistance to the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark L. Schneider said he also wants volunteers to use e-mail to increase
global contacts for communities and classrooms at home.
</P>
<P>
	   He took the oath of office at the Peace Corps' downtown Washington
headquarters before a cheering crowd of Peace Corps workers, former volunteers
and administration officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am convinced that today's Peace Corps volunteers are comparative experts
in harnessing information technology to the task of poverty reduction,'' said
Schneider, who was appointed by President Clinton while Congress was out,
eliminating the need for Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Schneider and his wife, Susan, served as Peace Corps volunteers in El
Salvador in the late 1960s. He is a former U.S. Agency for International
Development assistant administrator for Latin America. He has also worked for
the Pan American Health Organization and was senior deputy assistant secretary
of state for human rights.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea of having volunteers equipped with laptop computers and other
high-tech devices is not new, but Peace Corps administrators have shied away
from equipping them with too much technology because they want volunteers to
live at the same level as the people they serve.
</P>
<P>
	   Schneider said computer-equipped volunteers could help develop small
businesses, explore new products that could boost local economies and help
reduce production costs. They also might be used to monitor immunizations, help
the poor acquire title to land and give urban teachers access to the Internet
for their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   Schneider said he also wants to work to increase the number of Peace Corps
volunteers from the current 7,000 to 10,000 -- a goal set by President Clinton
but not yet funded by Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Volunteers convey a sense of optimism to those around them that what is
attempted can be achieved,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton included Schneider among his ``recess appointments'' to avoid a long
nomination process. As it is, Schneider has no guarantee of being able to serve
after Clinton's term ends at the start of 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Schneider, 58, is the 15th director of the corps set up by President Kennedy
in 1961. Peace Corps volunteers now serve in 78 countries, receiving a living
allowance roughly comparable to local salaries. They include educators,
environmentalists, health experts, business advisers and agriculturists.
</P>
<P>
	   Schneider succeeds longtime Clinton aide Mark Gearan, who resigned as Peace
Corps director in August to become president of Hobart and William Smith
Colleges in Geneva, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Toner to take chief job at Electric Boat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GROTON, Conn. (AP) - A Mystic man has worked his way up through the
ranks at Electric Boat to become president of the company - a first for the
submarine maker.
<P>
	   Senior Vice President Michael W. Toner takes over Jan. 17, replacing
President John K. Welch, who has been named to head the Marine Systems Group of
General Dynamics, the parent company of Electric Boat.
</P>
<P>
	   When Toner reported for work at Electric Boat in 1965, he was taking a class
while waiting for security clearance. The teacher said they should appreciate
the opportunities that were available to them.
</P>
<P>
	   Why, someone in the room might even be president of the company someday,
Toner recalled the teacher saying.
</P>
<P>
	   "At the time I was trying to figure out what I was going to have for lunch
or when I was going to get out of that class," Toner said with a laugh. "But
I've thought about it over the years, and chuckled to myself, and thought,
'Wouldn't it be something if that happened?'
</P>
<P>
	   "I've reflected on it a lot the last few days, and now it has," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Toner's chief concerns will be increasing the volume of business in
the shipyard, possibly through new partnerships with the nearby Naval Submarine
Base and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like to see us start to try to get some new work into the shipyard, and
reinvigorate the work force," Toner said. "That would give us the ability to
transfer the knowledge to the next generation of shipbuilders."
</P>
<P>
	   While design work on the Virginia class of submarine is winding down, he
held out hope that the shipyard could handle other projects, such as the next
generation of aircraft carriers and the conversion of four older ballistic
missile submarines to fire conventional missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor union leaders at the shipyard approved of Toner's appointment.

<P>
	   "I think it could be very good news, because he understands the shipyard;
he's not an outsider," said Kenneth G. DelaCruz, president of the Metal Trades
Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Melvin E. Olsson, president of the Marine Draftsmen's Association, said
Toner's and Welch's appointments should be good for the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mike's going to be a good president for Electric Boat. He knows the
shipyard top to bottom, and what I like is he cares about the people as much as
he does the bottom line," Olsson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Toner, 56, has been second in command since May 1998, when he was named
senior vice president and directed 4,200 employees in the engineering and design
departments.
</P>
<P>
	   He came to the company after graduating with a degree in nuclear science
from New York Maritime College.
</P>
<P>
	   He took a job at Electric Boat when the Marine Engineers Benevolent
Association was on strike, and planned to stay until the end of the summer or
until the strike was over.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, he rose through the ranks as a manager and earned more academic
degrees: a master's degree in engineering from the University of Connecticut in
1970 and an executive master's of business administration from the University of
New Haven in 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   Toner and his wife, Carol, have three grown children.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 146.44; Nasdaq Up 73.93  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today, with blue-chip shares surging
despite more signs of inflationary pressure and the technology group mounting a
modest rebound even after a profit warning by Lucent.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
146.44 at 11,399.70, extending the 250-point rebound of the past two days and
wiping out the remainder of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. Earlier in the day, the
Dow was up nearly 202 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index was up 73.93 at 3,801.06 after
plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Other broad-market indicators were also posting sizable gains, with the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rising 17.47 to 1,420.92.
</P>
<P>
	   The strength in technology came despite Lucent Technologies' disclosure late
Thursday that the company won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter
of 1999. Lucent fell in late trading on other markets and was trading today at
52 15/16, down 16 1/16 from Thursday's close on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucent's troubles were apparently seen as a gain for its main rivals in
supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make
up the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not an industry issue," said Alex M. Cena, an analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent, but said its woes
were due to specific problems at the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, its rivals soared. Nortel Networks was up 14 9/16 at 91 9/16 on
the NYSE, while in heavy Nasdaq trading, Cisco Systems was up 3 3/16 at 103
3/16, Ciena was up 14 1/16 at 59 15/16 and JDS Uniphase was up 17 1/4 at 167.
</P>
<P>
	   Before today's open, the government reported that the nation's unemployment
rate held steady at a three-decade low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000
workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since July.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the latest sign of a strong labor market that could force employers
to pay higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate. The
Labor Department reported that average hourly earnings rose by 0.4 percent to
$13.46 in December, the largest gain since September, but in line with what most
were forecasting.
</P>
<P>
	   While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, the Federal
Reserve has already bumped up interest rates three times in less than a year to
slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists
believe the Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting,
possibly hurting company profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, many of today's strongest issues were companies who make products
that consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop: Procter &AMP; Gamble surged
7 1/2 to 115 3/8 and Coca-Cola jumped to 3 3/16 to 60 3/16 to help lead the Dow,
which also drew a boost from drugmakers Merck, up 5 1/16 at 73 3/16 and Johnson
&AMP; Johnson, up 3 3/4 to 96 5/16.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin
on the NYSE, while Nasdaq gainers led by nearly a 3-to-2 ratio. The Russell 2000
index of smaller companies was up 7.85 at 483.19.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 852.45 million shares at midafternoon, up sharply from
720.29 million at the same point on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent. European indexes
bounced back sharply from declines this week, with Germany's Xetra DAX rising
4.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 up 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 up 1.6
percent.

<HEADLINE> Woman Seeks Stronger Rape Laws  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Days before the Supreme Court hears her case, a former
college student who accused two football players of sexually assaulting her said
Friday, ``Rape is like having your soul torn out.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This violence happens to too many women, and we need laws on the books to
fight it,'' Christy Brzonkala said at a news conference. She was a Virginia Tech
student in 1995 when she says the athletes raped her in a dormitory room.
</P>
<P>
	   She is asking the Supreme Court to uphold a federal law, the 1994 Violence
Against Women Act, that lets rape victims sue their attackers. A lower court
declared the provision unconstitutional and threw out her lawsuit against the
two football players, Antonio Morrison and James Crawford.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's highest court hears arguments in the case next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Brzonkala, 23, has allowed her name to be used, but she has made little
public comment. On Friday, she spoke only in general terms about the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rape is a brutal form of discrimination: women are raped because they are
women,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Regarding her decision to pursue the case, she said she felt ``I should go
as far as I can go so I don't look 10 years down the line and say, `I should
have done something else.'''
</P>
<P>
	   When the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out her lawsuit, it said
Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce and assure equal protection to
all citizens did not authorize it to allow rape victims to sue their attackers
for financial damages.
</P>
<P>
	   One of her lawyers, Kathy Rodgers of the NOW Legal Defense and Education
Fund, said, ``State justice systems don't treat gender-motivated violence cases
as seriously as other cases. ... Historically, the federal government has been
the primary actor in protecting civil rights in this nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration also appealed the lower court ruling to the
Supreme Court. Separate criminal provisions of the Violence Against Women Act
are not at issue in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Brzonkala also is pursuing a separate sex-discrimination lawsuit against
Virginia Tech.

<HEADLINE> Army Pays for Ads Based on Recruits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to boost its sagging fortunes on the recruiting
front, the Army said Friday it will demand that its advertising agency be paid
based on performance -- how many recruits it attracts -- instead of a flat fee.
</P>
<P>
	   Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. of New York has held the advertising account for 12
years, and its current contract is due to expire in July. Army officials said it
was unclear whether that contract would be terminated early.
</P>
<P>
	   In what it billed as a ``dramatic series of changes'' in how it markets
itself to America's youth, the Army said it hired a Chicago consulting firm,
Jones-Lundin Associates Inc., to help it select an ad agency for the new
contract linking payment to performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones-Lundin also will advise the Army on whether it should drop its
advertising slogan, ``Be all that you can be,'' which has been a trademark
recruiting pitch since 1981. Last year, Advertising Age magazine ranked ``Be all
that you can be'' the No. 2 jingle of the century, behind McDonald's, ``You
deserve a break today.'' Some in the Army believe the long-running slogan is
less effective with today's youth.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past several years the Army has spent about $110 million a year on
advertising, but it has had trouble attracting enough recruits. Last year the
Army reported missing its recruiting target by 6,290.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army said Young &AMP; Rubicam is welcome to compete for the new contract.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army also said it will set up an in-house group staffed by civilians
with corporate marketing experience to monitor the performance of the new ad
agency.

<HEADLINE> The man with the million-megawatt smile is state's $100 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Johnnie Ely flashed a $100 million smile as he was
introduced Friday as the winner of the New Year's Eve Millennium Millions
lottery, the largest jackpot in state history.
<P>
	   "I am a happy, happy man," said the 66-year-old short order cook - make
that, ex-short order cook. That much was obvious as he joked with reporters at a
news conference held at Tavern on the Green in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   Opting for a lump sum cash payment, Ely won $44 million. After taxes, he
will receive a check for about $27 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Ely, who lives in the South Bronx with his wife of 35 years, Rosemary, a
nurse, didn't learn he was the sole first place winner of last Friday night's
drawing until Monday night. He was visiting friends in New Jersey and didn't
check his tickets until he heard that the winning ticket was still unclaimed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I checked the first ticket and nothing. Then the second ticket and - bingo,
bull's-eye - that was it," Ely said. But he didn't trust his aging eyes and
asked his son, Johnnie Jr., to check, too. Once he confirmed it, Ely said, "Like
a fool, I called the wife out."
</P>
<P>
	   "She put on her glasses, looked the numbers over and said, 'Sweetie, can I
retire now?"'
</P>
<P>
	   "You can retire," he told her. "Can I get a used car?" his son chimed in.
"Yes, you can," Ely calmly answered. He also has two grown daughters.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's cool, real cool to be able to do all the things you've always dreamed
about doing," he said. "But it's the kind of thing that now that you've got it,
you freeze."
</P>
<P>
	   Ely, who has worked for 35 years as a short order cook, spent $100 on
tickets over a month, including the two random quick pick tickets he picked up
the night before the drawing at a Manhattan check cashing store.
</P>
<P>
	   He also belonged to a pool with co-workers from The Java Shop, a
mid-Manhattan restaurant and bar.
</P>
<P>
	   After confirming his good fortune with state lottery officials on Tuesday,
Ely went to work as usual at 4 a.m. Wednesday. Coffee shop manager Winston
Willer said Ely came in and told him, "I've got good news and bad news."
</P>
<P>
	   The good news, he told him, was that the winning lottery ticket was sold at
the check cashing place where he bought their tickets. "I got so excited. I
said, let me go get them and check," Willer said. But Ely told him not to
bother. The bad news was that Ely had the winning ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't believe him, even after he told me he had confirmed it," Willer
said, "but I told him, "What are you doing here? Go home."'
</P>
<P>
	   He did, and thanks to the jackpot he doesn't have to make another vegetable
omelet, his specialty, ever again.
</P>
<P>
	   "It couldn't happen to a nicer guy," said waitress Hilda Purdy. She said Ely
used to call her "Cookie," and was always there with fatherly advice. "If I
could tell him one thing, I'd say, 'I'm glad for him. I wish that money gives
him all the happiness he's looking for."'
</P>
<P>
	   He is a regular lottery player, spending $5 a day on tickets. He's also had
many smaller wins. "I've won $1,300 three or four times, $500 to $600 a half a
dozen times and practically every week I win $25 or $30," he said. Despite his
windfall, he planned to keep on playing.
</P>
<P>
	   Ely said his unexpected early retirement has left him not really knowing
what to do. "I still wake up at 2:30 every day, only now I just look out the
window." He said he planned to take care of his extended family, including
helping several nieces and nephews through college, but beyond that he had no
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   He called himself a simple, practical man who likes to fish in his spare
time, drink diet soda and eat lots of vegetables - not too crunchy. Asked what
he wanted for himself, Ely replied:
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't need nothing. As long as I keep the good health I've had through
the years, what else does a man really need?" Then, flashing that
million-megawatt smile again, he joked, "I mean, I'm a millionaire, right?
That's what this is all about, brother. I am a millionaire!"

<HEADLINE> ABC Announces Agreement With NAACP  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK -- (AP) -- ABC on Friday became the second of the four major
networks to announce a deal with the NAACP to promote diversity in its ranks,
agreeing among other things to tie executive bonuses to success in employing
minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the week, NBC announced its own agreement, removing the threat of
a boycott that the NAACP began considering last summer when it drew attention to
the lack of minority actors on new fall shows.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC's deal is similar in that it concentrates more on changing the
behind-the-scenes operations of the network in the hope that it eventually makes
a difference in what goes on the air.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is just one step on a long road toward creating a diverse environment,"
said Patricia Fili-Krushel, ABC president.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC has agreed to assign high-level mentors to minority employees, set up a
diversity training program and consider a producer's diversity record when
deciding who will run its programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The "statement of understanding" with the NAACP also sets up a series of
meetings between ABC executives in charge of personnel and representatives of
the civil rights organization.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think the agreement makes it clear that increased opportunities for
people of color is a priority at ABC," said Kweisi Mfume, president of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
	   Mfume said he expects to reach agreements with CBS and Fox within the next
week or so. The agreement with CBS will address the number of minorities
onscreen more than the other deals have, Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the NAACP's deal with NBC has angered a coalition of Hispanic,
Asian-American and Indian groups that had thought they were all working
together. They have since set up their own meeting with NBC President Bob
Wright.
</P>
<P>
	   Mfume "agreed to join this coalition, and before we knew it he holds a press
conference announcing this deal. Not good," Esteban Torres, the coalition's
Hispanic representative and a former congressman, told the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
	   Mfume said he always made it clear to NBC that he was representing more than
just his own organization.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've never seen this as a black-white situation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Board OKs Calhoun's Coke endorsements as UConn coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Basketball coach Jim Calhoun can use his
association with the University of Connecticut men's basketball team to
advertise for Coca-Cola, the state Ethics Commission decided Friday.
<P>
	   At issue is a rule prohibiting Connecticut employees from using their public
positions for personal gain. Another rule says state workers can't use their
jobs to endorse private companies.
</P>
<P>
	   But Calhoun's agent, Peter Roisman, argued successfully that an exception
should be made because UConn and Calhoun each have separate agreements with
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jim Calhoun is a famous basketball coach who works for the state of
Connecticut," Roisman said. "He's not using the state of Connecticut to make
money."
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Plofsky, the commission's executive director, said his board will keep
a close eye on Calhoun's Coke endorsements.
</P>
<P>
	   "The board's decision allows (Calhoun) to appear in advertisements that also
use the UConn logo or the UConn Husky or any other tie-in to the school because
Coca-Cola has a separate licensing agreement with UConn," Plofsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   "But it allows it based on a most extremely important provision - that he
not be paid one penny extra for that appearance," Plofsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ethics Commission had been asked by Southern New England
Telecommunications Corp. to approve a similar provision for ads they wanted to
run featuring Calhoun. When the commission insisted that SNET disclose the terms
of the contract before considering it for approval, the company pulled its
request.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're not going to disclose details because they say they don't want to
give away trade secrets," said Commissioner Richard Vitarelli.
</P>
<P>
	   Plofsky said Coca-Cola gave the Ethics Commission the details of their
contract with Calhoun, but the board agreed to the company's request that
Calhoun's compensation be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
	   "The amount of money really doesn't indicate whether there's a conflict of
interest or not," Plofsky said. He said the dollar amount is not a public
document because the price was given to the commission verbally.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ethics Commission voted to postpone its discussion of another contract
Calhoun has pending with Nike.
</P>
<P>
	   When the Nike contract was first given to the commission for approval, the
board had multiple problems with it, Plofsky said. He would not discuss specific
problems, but said it has been rewritten to comply with ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Roisman said he will give the board the revised contract, but argued against
having its details discussed in a public meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel a public discussion of them is a violation of (Calhoun's) privacy,"
Roisman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The board will review the contract before deciding whether to discuss it
publicly.
</P>
<P>
	   Plofsky argued the Nike deal should be discussed at an open meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are here to decide if it is in compliance or if there is a conflict with
the ethics code," he said. "That needs to be discussed and disclosed on the
record."

<HEADLINE> Judge orders Internet porn site to drop Teen magazine's name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - At the request of Teen magazine, a federal judge has
ordered the operators of an Internet pornography site to stop using the
publication's name in its Web address.
<P>
	   "Our magazine is geared to teen girls, and when they find pornography
instead, you can well understand why not only our client would be upset, but our
readers would be upset. It's appalling," Teen magazine lawyer David Jacobs said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine's president, Lynn Lehmkuhl, said staff discovered the
pornography site the last week of 1999, and soon heard from puzzled girls.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was horrified. It was really hardcore. Not even 'Playboy.' It was really,
really creepy," Lehmkuhl said.
</P>
<P>
	   The operator of the pornography site, Blue Gravity Communications, and its
owner, Thomas Krwawecz III, were temporarily restrained on Thursday from using
the address, www.teenmagazine.com, by U.S. District Judge Joseph E. Irenas.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine's Web address is www.teenmag.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Irenas scheduled a hearing Jan. 14 on whether to impose an injunction
against Blue Gravity. He ruled, however, that Teen" was likely to prevail
because it would be "irreparably injured" by the use of its name by another.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue Gravity representatives did not attend the hearing, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
	   Messages left Friday for Krwawecz at his home in Pittsgrove, and at his
company, which has addresses there and in Pennsauken, were not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The pornography Web site could not be reached Friday morning, but was
available later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit filed Thursday for Teen is among the first in the nation to rely
on federal law enacted in November to ban "cybersquatting," the practice of
pre-empting of Internet domain names from people or companies with trademark
associations to them.
</P>
<P>
	   Domain names are the addresses computer users enter to reach a Web site.
They come between "www" and "com," "net" or "org."

	   The lawsuit seeks to have teenmagazine.com transferred to the publishers of
"Teen," and unspecified monetary compensation, including any profits the
defendants made from using the name.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit also cites trademark law, which has generally persuaded judges
in Web site disputes to side with the holder.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our client owns the trademark in Teen magazine, and is going to do
everything it can to protect its rights in Teen magazine, especially in this
case where the defendants have taken the name teenmagazine.com and linked it to

	   In a cybersquatting case in 1998, a federal judge in Newark ruled that a New

<HEADLINE> Most support capital punishment, think appeals take too much time  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - When it comes to murder, most Connecticut people
surveyed believe in an eye-for-an-eye brand of justice.
<P>
	   A Hartford Courant/Connecticut Poll published Friday found 66 percent of
residents surveyed believe capital punishment is appropriate punishment for
murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The support from two-thirds of those surveyed came even though 55 percent of
those polled said they don't believe the death penalty is a deterrent to murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 40 percent of those asked said they believe a black or Hispanic
defendant is more likely to be sentenced to death than a white defendant who
commits a similar crime, while 51 percent said they believe race would have no
real effect on the punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Although there is support for the death penalty, the poll found that
two-thirds of those questioned believe it is somewhat unlikely or very unlikely
that an execution will actually take place in the state anytime soon. Sixty-four
percent believe the appeals process is too drawn out.
</P>
<P>
	   Convicted serial killer Michael Ross was sentenced to death in 1987 and
while physically living on Connecticut's death row, has had his death sentence
thrown out. He is awaiting a new trial to determine his punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, New London Superior Court Judge Thomas Miano excused a fifth
juror from serving on the panel that will determine whether Ross is executed or
gets life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection was scheduled to begin Monday to choose five new jurors to
replace ones that Miano excused since the original panel was picked months ago.
A failed, last-minute appeal delayed the penalty hearing for so long that some
jurors could no longer serve on the panel.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Ross, there are six other men on death row.
</P>
<P>
	   Should the time come when the state actually begins executing those
sentenced to death, some of the respondents believe there is bound to be a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty percent said they believe it is likely that Connecticut will execute
someone who later is proved to be innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   The telephone poll of 500 randomly selected state residents was conducted
Dec. 7 to 13 by the Center for Survey Research and Analysis at the University of
Connecticut. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify '3-Strikes' Ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide whether a
Virginia murderer's death sentence was illegal because the man was barred from
telling jurors he would be ineligible for parole if sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices will use Bobby Lee Ramdass' case to clarify their 1994 decision
that said capital-case defendants sometimes must be allowed to tell sentencing
juries that a life sentence would carry no chance of parole.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision is expected by late June.
</P>
<P>
	   During a weeklong crime spree in 1992, Ramdass robbed two pizza restaurants
and a convenience store in Fairfax County, Va. During one episode, he killed
convenience store clerk Mohammed Kayani.
</P>
<P>
	   In separate trials, juries found him guilty of all three crimes. He was
sentenced to death for the murder after a state court jury found that he
constituted ``a continuing threat to society.''
</P>
<P>
	   After all appeals were rejected in state courts, Ramdass sought help in
federal court. He argued that he wrongly was barred from telling the sentencing
jurors about his ineligibility for parole under Virginia's three-strikes law.
</P>
<P>
	   The Virginia Supreme Court had ruled that the three-strikes law did not
apply to Ramdass when he was sentenced for the murder. He had been found guilty
by juries of three separate crimes, but one judge had not yet entered a judgment
of guilt.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal trial judge ruled that Ramdass was entitled to a new sentencing
trial, but a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw
out that decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel said federal courts are bound by state courts' characterization of
the relevant state laws.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Ramdass vs. Angelone, 99-7000.

	   Jobless Rate Steady at 4.1 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate held steady at
a three-decade-low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers
found jobs, the biggest gain since July. President Clinton and
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman hailed the news. Clinton credited
information technology with making a big contribution, and Herman
noted that the country's current prosperity was widely shared. The
Labor Department reported today that December's jobless rate
matched November's 4.1 percent, the lowest since a 3.9 percent rate
in January 1970. For all of 1999, the unemployment rate averaged
4.2 percent, the lowest since 3.5 percent in 1969 during the
Vietnam War, making last year one of the most golden job markets in
years. In 1998, the unemployment rate averaged 4.5 percent.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rose today despite Lucent
Technologies' disclosure late yesterday that the company won't meet
most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. Lucent fell in
late trading on other markets and was trading today at 52 15/16,
down 16 1/16 from Thursday's close on the New York Stock Exchange.
Lucent's troubles were apparently seen as a gain for its main

	   Y2K Flitch Hits Some Credit Cards

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Buyers beware: Your credit card might get
charged more than once because some merchants failed to update
their computer software for the Year 2000. Visa and Mastercard said
today they have checks in place to catch duplicate charges, but
they suggest that customers review their credit card statements
anyhow. A vast majority of transactions are going through without
problems, they added. The problem is being caused by outdated IC
Verify software from CyberCash, which makes electronic transaction

island's third largest producer in a stock swap that analysts
valued at more than $3 billion. With an earlier deal, the purchase
will make TSMC the world's largest chip foundry. TSMC's agreement
to buy Worldwide Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. follows recent
speculation that Taiwan's No. 2 company, United Microelectronics
Corp., had been courting Worldwide. The deal will put pressure on
United Microelectronics to find its own merger partner, said Nathan

accounting giant reported having violated rules prohibiting them
from owning stock in companies they audit. The review made public
by the Securities and Exchange Commission also said many more such
lapses were said not to have been reported. A
PricewaterhouseCoopers managing partner, Kenton J. Sicchitano, told
The New York Times that in addition to the dismissals, other

series of changes'' in how it markets itself to America's youth,
the Army said it hired a Chicago consulting firm, Jones-Lundin
Associates Inc., to help it select an ad agency for a new contract
that, unlike the existing arrangement, would pay the agency based
on how many recruits it attracts. The Army said Young &AMP; Rubicam is
welcome to compete for the new contract. The agency's current
five-year contract is due to expire in July. Officials said it was
unclear whether that contract would be terminated early.

<HEADLINE> Once a member, Bradley now resists voter group on candidate survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - For three years after leaving the Senate, Bill Bradley
lent his name to a voter education group that implores candidates in state and
federal campaigns to fill out a lengthy multiple-choice survey on issues.
<P>
	   Now, as a presidential candidate, Bradley has the chance to fill out Project
Vote Smart's "National Political Awareness Test" himself. But to the dismay of
the nonpartisan group, Bradley is resisting. His campaign says the test's
multiple-choice format is too confining and leaves little room for substance.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, has declined to fill
out the questionnaire on similar grounds. Republican George W. Bush and Reform
Party candidate Pat Buchanan have also turned down the group's entreaties.
</P>
<P>
	   But given his past affiliation with the group, it is Bradley's stance that
has most frustrated officials at Project Vote Smart's Philipsburg, Mont.,
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   "The quandary we have with Senator Bradley," said Richard Kimball, president
of the Project Vote Smart board, "is that he reviewed (the test) and approved it
for other candidates, but did not take it himself."
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Tony Wyche said the Bradley campaign has made numerous attempts to
satisfy Project Vote Smart with written summaries of the candidate's positions.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've tried a couple different ways to make it happen," Wyche said. "We've
sent them fact sheets. We're hoping to find a way to make this work."
</P>
<P>
	   Project Vote Smart argues that compliance with the multiple-choice format is
important to give voters a side-by-side comparison of candidate positions.
Candidates must answer at least 70 percent of the questions to get a passing
grade from Project Vote Smart.
</P>
<P>
	   Next Wednesday, Project Vote Smart will release grades for more than 100
major and minor party presidential candidates and 12,000 candidates for
Congress, governor and state legislatures across the country. Candidate answers
will be released as well.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, the group's Web site notes simply whether a candidate has submitted
answers.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, Orrin Hatch and John McCain have done
so. Bradley, Gore, Bush, Buchanan, Republican Alan Keyes and potential Reform
Party candidate Donald Trump have not.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is probably the worst performing group of front-runners, by a long
shot, since 1990" when the group began, Kimball said.
</P>
<P>
	   Founded by 40 leaders including former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy
Carter, Project Vote Smart has always encountered some resistance to its issues
test.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, only about 60 percent of congressional candidates got passing
grades. President Clinton and Republicans Buchanan and Forbes were among the
big-name presidential candidates who declined to fill out questionnaires in
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley is a unique case. Though he submitted his resignation last
month, his name and picture still appear on Project Vote Smart's Web site under
"founders."
</P>
<P>
	   The group invited Bradley to join its board in 1996 as he prepared to leave
the Senate after three terms representing New Jersey. Bradley wrote back that he
would be "honored to support your efforts to strengthen representative
democracy."
</P>
<P>
	   As a board member, Bradley received periodic reports on Project Vote Smart
programs and annual budgets, as well as drafts of National Political Awareness
Tests. His silence was always taken as approval of the group's work, Kimball
said.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, Project Vote Smart supporters reached out to Bradley as a
candidate, encouraging him to fill out the questionnaire. During those
discussions, Bradley's staff learned that Bradley was still considered a member
of the Vote Smart board.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 7, Bradley wrote to the group that when he became a candidate for
president, "I made an effort to resign from all the boards on which I sat. If
you do not believe that that has happened with Project Vote Smart's current
board, then please now consider this to be my resignation."
</P>
<P>
	   Kimball said he is holding out an eleventh-hour hope that many candidates,
including Bradley, will submit answers to the issues survey by next week.

<HEADLINE> Writer Patrick O'Brian Dies at 85  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOODS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Patrick O'Brian, whose celebrated novels of 19th century
seafaring won praise from critics and the loyalty of legions of readers, has
died. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian died in Dublin, Ireland, where he had been working on a book for
several weeks at Trinity College. The cause of death was not given and there
were conflicting reports of the date.
</P>
<P>
	   The British Embassy in Paris said O'Brian died Tuesday, but newspapers and
the news agency Press Association said he died Sunday. O'Brian had lived in
France since 1949.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian's major work was a 20-volume series set in the Royal Navy during the
Napoleonic wars.
</P>
<P>
	   A deep knowledge of naval history and 19th century life enabled him to evoke
a time and place so vividly that, in this era of supersonic jets and smart
bombs, his readers were gripped by the slow-motion suspense of sea battles
fought under sail.
</P>
<P>
	   The series, begun in 1969 with ``Master and Commander,'' is the story of the
friendship between a bold and ambitious navy officer, Jack Aubrey, and the
ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, a naturalist and secret agent who doesn't much
like sailing.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the books were well-reviewed and found an enthusiastic readership
from the start, it wasn't until the 1990s that they achieved wide recognition
abroad and were lifted out of the ``historical fiction'' genre in which they
generally were reviewed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1991, a New York Times critic called O'Brian ``the best novelist you have
never heard of.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Patrick O'Brian has written great and enduring literature which happens to
be set largely at sea,'' the Sunday Telegraph wrote in 1997, praising ``the
intensity of characterization, the complex elegance of the plotting, and the
brilliance of the writing.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian also proved that, in the hands of a skilled writer, specialist
language need not be an obstacle to understanding. Readers who can't remember
which side of a ship is starboard still can feel the frantic activity on deck as
the sails unfurl and catch the wind, and the excitement as a man-of-war turns to
engage the enemy.
</P>
<P>
	   A lexicon explaining O'Brian's nautical terminology was published, but
O'Brian didn't think definitions important.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ignorance of the cross-catharpins is not necessarily fatal,'' he once
said. ``Explanation almost certainly would be.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian's fans range from actor Charlton Heston to critic John Bayley, a
former Oxford professor of literature who wrote that O'Brian's ``originality
consists in the unpretentious use he makes of (history) to invent a new style of
fiction.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No other writer,'' Bayley wrote, ``not even Melville, has described the
whale and the wandering albatross with O'Brian's studious and yet lyrical
accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian guarded his privacy, and in his few interviews resisted questions
about his personal life.
</P>
<P>
	   He was born Dec. 12, 1914, in Chalfont St. Peter, west of London, and it
wasn't until 1998 that he was revealed to be the son of an English doctor and
not an Irishman as had been widely believed, the Daily Telegraph said in an
obituary Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said O'Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ, but changed his
name in 1945. During his school years, he was frequently ill, spending much time
reading. His writing career began at age 15, when he published a book about the
union of a giant panda and a snow leopard.
</P>
<P>
	   During World War II, O'Brian drove ambulances and worked briefly with
Britain's Political Intelligence Department.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1949, he and his second wife, Mary, moved to Collioure, southern France.
His first seafaring novel was ``The Golden Ocean'' in 1956, about a Pacific
expedition.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series was already well under way in Britain by the
beginning of the 1990s, when editor Starling Lawrence of the American publisher
W.W. Norton chanced to read one on a flight home.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest, as they say, is publishing history.
</P>
<P>
	   Several years ago, the writer said he would end the series with the 20th
book, but last month he said he was working on volume 21, the Daily Telegraph
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian also wrote biographies of Picasso and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. A
linguist, he translated the work of French writers Simone de Beauvoir and
Colette.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Funeral plans were not announced. He is survived by a son, Richard, from his
first marriage.

<HEADLINE> Another $12 million put toward farm land easements  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Another $12 million has been funneled into a state
program which allows municipalities to preserve what they consider crucial
tracts of farmland to keep them out of developers' hands.
<P>
	   Fifteen communities will get the latest state grants under the Farmland
Protection Program. They bring to $30 million the amount allocated since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   "By investing now, we're helping to ensure that the heritage of farm
families and the bucolic landscapes of our state will survive well into the next
century," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The grants are awarded to town or county farmland protection boards and are
designed to fund up to 75 percent of the projects. Municipalities must
contribute the other 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   No farmland is actually bought as a result of the program. Rather, easements
on the land are purchased which will prevent the property in the future from
being developed. That guarantees that farms will remain farms, even if the land
passes into other hands or is willed to relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   For farmers, the selling of easements can provide them with cash that could
allow some of them to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
	   To qualify, farms must be active, ongoing agricultural concerns situated on
scenic, well-tended properties. Ideally, the farms should also be adjacent to
other environmentally sensitive lands or to parcels on which easements have
previously been secured under the Farmland Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
	   New York is making "great strides" in preserving farmland through the
program, said Jerry Cosgrove of the American Farmland Trust.
</P>
<P>
	   "The result is that farmers can pass their farms on to their children and
reinvest in their communities' economic and environmental quality of life,"
Cosgrove said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cosgrove's group helps identify the most valuable and vulnerable pieces of
farmland and gives localities and farmers technical help in negotiating the
Farmland Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's $12 million in state funding is comprised of $7.5 million from
the 1996 state environmental bond act and $4.5 million from the state's
Environmental Protection Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest projects qualifying under the program, their location, the amount
of land involved and the cost to the state are:
</P>
<P>
	   -Macedon, Wayne County; more than 834 acres; $748,465.
</P>
<P>
	   -Montgomery, Orange County; about 481 acres; $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   -Southampton, Suffolk County; 30.5 acres; $828,965.
</P>
<P>
	   -Southold, Riverhead, Brookhaven, Southampton and East Hampton, all in
Suffolk County; undetermined number out of 47 parcels encompassing 2,469 acres;
$2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   -Elbridge, Onondaga County; 567 acres; $865,000.
</P>
<P>
	   -Preble, Cortland County; 359 acres; $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   -Marilla, Erie County; undetermined number out of 59 parcels encompassing
2,817 acres; $375,000.
</P>
<P>
	   -East Fishkill, Dutchess County; 164 acres; $890,000.
</P>
<P>
	   -Clintondale, Ulster County; 621 acres; $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   -Southold, Suffolk County; undetermined number out of six farms encompassing
180 acres; $495,479.
</P>
<P>
	   -Riverhead, Suffolk County; undetermined number out of five farms
encompassing 217 acres; $490,000.
</P>
<P>
	   -White Creek, Washington County; 221.5 acres; $225,962.
</P>
<P>
	   -Westport, Essex County; 293 acres; $140,334.
</P>
<P>
	   -Warwick, Orange County; 92 acres; $350,000.
</P>
<P>
	   -Amherst, Erie County; 1,044 acres: $100,000.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Cleric Declares Holy War  </HEADLINE>
   By KHALID TANVEER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAWAHALPUR, Pakistan (AP) -- A Pakistani cleric freed to end the hijacking
of an Indian Airlines plane declared a holy war today against India, and
recruited volunteers to fight for the disputed region of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   Maulana Masood Azhar, the most prominent of the three militant prisoners
released by India in exchange for the 155 passengers and crew aboard the
aircraft, addressed tens of thousands of people outside a mosque in his hometown
of Bawahalpur.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no way open for us other than to wage jihad (holy war) against
India for Kashmir's liberation,'' Azhar said during Friday prayers. ``I have
come here to give a call for jihad.''
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd responded with raised fists and promised to join the insurgency,
which has been battling Indian soldiers for more than a decade demanding either
outright independence for Kashmir or union with Islamic Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Indian soldiers are killing our brothers and raping our innocent
sisters,'' said Azhar, who was arrested by India in 1994. ``The world should
tell us which is a bigger crime-- the plane hijacking or Indian atrocities in
Kashmir?''
</P>
<P>
	   Five hijackers seized the Indian Airlines flight after it took off from
Nepal Dec. 24. The plane went on an odyssey across South Asia and the Middle
East before landing Dec. 25 at an airport in southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   It remained there until Dec. 31, when the hijackers freed their hostages in
exchange for the three Kashmiri militants and then disappeared.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking crisis raised tensions between India and Pakistan, two
nuclear-armed countries that have fought three wars over the past half-century.
</P>
<P>
	   India has accused Pakistan of masterminding the hijacking, and says that all
five hijackers were Pakistani. Pakistan, which has soundly condemned the
hijacking, has dismissed the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Newspaper reports said Friday that Pakistan had asked Nepal for a copy of
India's inquiry report into the hijacking, hoping it would provide clues to the
hijackers' identities.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan and India both lay claim to all of Kashmir and have fought two wars
over Kashmir since their independence from Britain in 1947. The two countries,
which exploded underground nuclear devices in 1998, came close to another war
this summer over the disputed region.
</P>
<P>
	   Muslim militants groups, including Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen, routinely recruit
Pakistanis to fight in Indian-ruled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   India accuses Pakistan of sending infiltrators into its part of Kashmir, but
Pakistan denies the charge, saying that Kashmir's separatist movement is an
indigenous struggle.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 180.02; Nasdaq Up 89.88  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today, with blue-chip shares surging
despite more signs of inflationary pressure and the technology group mounting a
solid rebound even after a profit warning from Lucent.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 180.02 at 11,433.28, extending the 250-point rebound
of the past two days and wiping out the remainder of Tuesday's 359-point tumble.
Earlier in the day, the Dow was up nearly 202 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index was up 89.88 at 3,817.01 after
plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Other broad-market indicators also posted sizable gains, with the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rising 23.83 to 1,427.28.
</P>
<P>
	   The strength in technology came despite Lucent Technologies' disclosure late
Thursday that the company won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter
of 1999. Lucent fell in late trading on other markets and was trading today at
53 1/16, down 15 15/16 from Thursday's close on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucent's troubles were apparently seen as a gain for its main rivals in
supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make
up the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not an industry issue," said Alex M. Cena, an analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent, but said its woes
were due to specific problems at the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, its rivals soared. Nortel Networks was up 9 7/8 at 94 7/8 on the
NYSE, while in heavy Nasdaq trading, Cisco Systems was up 4 23/64 at 104 23/64,
Ciena was up 11 11/16 at 57 9/16 and JDS Uniphase was up 20 1/2 at 170 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Before today's open, the government reported the nation's unemployment rate
held steady at a three-decade low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers
found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since July.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the latest sign of a strong labor market that could force employers
to pay higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate. The
Labor Department reported average hourly earnings rose by 0.4 percent to $13.46
in December, the largest gain since September, but in line with what most were
forecasting.
</P>
<P>
	   While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, the Federal
Reserve has already bumped up interest rates three times in less than a year to
slow the economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists believe the
Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting, possibly hurting
company profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, many of today's strongest issues were companies that make products
that consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop: Procter &AMP; Gamble surged
8 to 115 7/8 and Coca-Cola jumped 3 1/8 to 60 1/8 to help lead the Dow, which
also drew a boost from drugmakers Merck, up 5 7/8 at 74 1/4 and Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, up 3 7/16 to 96.
</P>
<P>
	   Those companies, considered cyclical stocks, have thrived this week as
investors took profits from a big run in technology shares at the end of 1999.
But their resurgence may be short-lived, argued Francis Gannon, senior equity
portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the leadership in this market is going to change
dramatically," he said. "At the end of 2000, we'll look back and see that the
dominant players remained telecom and technology."
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin
on the NYSE, while Nasdaq gainers led by nearly a 3-to-2 ratio. The Russell 2000
index of smaller companies was up 9.34 at 484.68.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 992.42 million shares in late afternoon, up sharply from
867.00 million at the same point on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent. European indexes
bounced back from declines this week, with Germany's Xetra DAX rising 4.7
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 up 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 up 1.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Police Report Attacks on Serbs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians attacked Serbs in a series of
scattered incidents as Kosovo's dwindling Serbian community celebrated Orthodox
Christmas, U.N. police and Yugoslav media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   An ethnic Albanian gang killed two Serb women who were on their way to a
Christmas Day liturgy Friday in the southwestern city of Prizren, Yugoslavia's
government-run Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO spokesmen in the provincial capital, Pristina, said they had no
information on the incident, which Tanjug said took place about 8:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest reported violence came hours before Bernard Kouchner, the top
international official in the province, joined Serbian church leaders for a
celebratory luncheon in Kosovo's main Serbian Orthodox monastery of Gracanica.
</P>
<P>
	   Orthodox churches worldwide celebrate Christmas on Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the meal in the monastery, priests handed small gifts to Serb
children. Cars and houses were bedecked with Serb flags and the traditional
symbol of dried oak branches.
</P>
<P>
	   The mood was hardly festive, however, as some Serbs vowed revenge on ethnic
Albanians and the NATO-led forces that launched an air attack on Yugoslavia last
spring.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even if there was a sort of celebration, it was very sad like in a funeral
and not the day when Christ was born,'' said Bishop Artemije of the Serbian
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, ethnic Albanians, who are predominantly Muslim, attacked and
beat three Serb men who were heading to Christmas Eve celebrations in the
village of Lipljan, five miles south of Pristina, U.N. police said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Serb man was shot and killed Wednesday in Prizren, and another Serb man
was shot and wounded Thursday by a gunman firing from a car with no license
plates in the town of Kosovo Polje, U.N. police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations and NATO have been unable to stop attacks by ethnic
Albanians against Kosovo's Serbs, despite the presence of about 50,000
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Those attacks began after the 78-day NATO bombing campaign forced Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to halt his 18-month crackdown against separatists
and withdraw police and soldiers from the majority ethnic Albanian province in
June.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States says more than 10,000 ethnic Albanians were killed during
the crackdown and more than 800,000 fled their homes and sought shelter in
neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Britain Broadcaster Race Heats Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Hotel and TV network owner Granada Group confirmed Friday
that it might bid for one of its independent commercial television peers,
Carlton Communications or United News &AMP; Media.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement had been expected ever since Carlton and United unveiled
plans for a $12.7 billion merger in late November, and heats up the race to
create what would be Britain's largest commercial broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
	   A ruling on whether the Carlton-United merger will be referred to Britain's
Competitions Commission is due soon. Granada said it would make its final
decision regarding any bid after the regulatory process has run its course.
</P>
<P>
	   Granada's chairman, Gerry Robinson, would not disclose whether his company
would prefer to bid for Carlton or United, noting that taking over either would
benefit Britain's Independent Television, or ITV.
</P>
<P>
	   ITV, Britain's oldest commercial network, was set up as a rival to the
British Broadcasting Corp., or BBC, in the form of 15 regional franchises.
</P>
<P>
	   Granada, which owns four of the franchises, has long been pushing to create
a single ITV company that it feels would be a more formidable competitor.
</P>
<P>
	   Making a deal with either company would help prevent a north-south divide
within ITV, Robinson said, adding that a Carlton-United merger would create a
powerhouse in Britain's southern half.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined Carlton-United group would create Britain's largest commercial
broadcasting group, with six major ITV franchises covering about 65 percent of
Britain's households.
</P>
<P>
	   The group would own a number of interests in digital television
broadcasting, national newspapers and a string of local British TV franchises.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Carlton and United were believed to have been motivated by fears about
the possible arrival of a much larger rival from the United States. By merging,
they would become a more formidable takeover candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Carlton and United said Friday that they remained committed to merging,
despite Granada's interest.

<HEADLINE> 'Memorial' to slain boy is a mess, newspaper says  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - A park where a slain 8-year-old boy liked to
play that was later dedicated to his memory is more of an eyesore than a place
for children, the Connecticut Post reported Friday.
<P>
	   Litter, cigarette butts and broken glass are strewn across Leroy "B.J."
Brown Jr. Memorial Park, the newspaper said. The basketball court is marred by
3-inch cracks that sprout grass and moss, and only fragments of nets hang from
the rims.
</P>
<P>
	   Posts intended to keep vehicles out of the park have fallen or been removed,
benches are worn or missing seats and the shards of broken bottles - clear,
green and brown - glisten everywhere, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy and his mother, Karen Clarke, were killed Jan. 7, 1999, allegedly
because Leroy was planning to testify against Russell Peeler, a convicted drug
dealer accused of killing Ms. Clarke's boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Peeler's brother, Adrian Peeler, killed the boy and his
mother to keep Leroy silent. Jury selection in the brothers' trials began this
week; if convicted, both could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Christopher Duby, a spokesman for Mayor Joseph P. Ganim, said improvements
are planned for the park, but said the volume of work in 1999 meant crews could
not get to it earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   He said work on parks would begin as soon as the winter ends, and said the
memorial would be high on the priority list.
</P>
<P>
	   "Even if it were just a typical park, it would be a high priority," Duby
said. "But the fact of whose memory it's being done in makes it more
(important). Nobody is blind to that."
</P>
<P>
	   State Rep. Robert T. Keeley Jr., D-Bridgeport, called the condition of the
park a disgrace.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very frustrated," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the nearby Boys and Girls Club, Executive Director Ken Bruno said he
hopes the park will be improved, for memory of the slain boy and for the
children who were affected by his death.
</P>
<P>
	   "The kids felt very strongly that we do something to memorialize him," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Pat Buchanan to fight new debate rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan threatened Friday to
go to the Federal Election Commission to protest new rules that could keep him
out of televised debates this fall.
<P>
	   "This is a conspiracy designed to perpetuate monopoly control of the
presidency and the White House by the two dominant national parties," he said of
rules announced Thursday by a special debate commission. "We're going to fight
this in court and we're going to fight it in the court of public opinion, and I
can tell you right now we're going to win it."
</P>
<P>
	   The Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan group set up in 1987
as an impartial sponsor of the nationally televised debates, said they would be
limited to candidates showing at least 15 percent support in national polls.
</P>
<P>
	   That could leave Buchanan off the screen.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is about giving the American people a third choice other than these
two Xerox copies we get every four years, these Doublemint twins from
Washington, D.C.," he said after meeting with leaders of New York's Conservative
Party at a restaurant on Manhattan's East Side.
</P>
<P>
	   He introduced Putnam County real estate developer Edward Heelan as his New
York campaign chairman. Heelan said the campaign had submitted papers to appear
on primary ballots in 29 of New York's 31 congressional districts. The filing
deadline for the March 7 primary was midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan, who bolted the GOP to mount a campaign for the Reform Party
nomination, said he hoped to be on New York's Conservative, Right to Life and
Independence lines in the general election. The Independence Party is New York's
affiliate of the national Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I can win those nominations, I think the Republican candidate, who I
expect to be Mr. Bush, will fold his tent and write off New York," Buchanan
declared. "It will be a Buchanan-Gore race for the state of New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the tiny but politically influential Conservative Party have also
met with Republican hopefuls Steve Forbes and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
Buchanan said his meeting was cordial, but that the party leaders plan to wait
until September to decide whom to support.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan spoke as real estate developer Donald Trump, who is considering a
bid for the Reform Party presidential nomination, prepared to meet with
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the party's highest elected official.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan said Ventura appeared to be leaning toward supporting Trump.
</P>
<P>
	   "But the truth is if you're going to beat Pat Buchanan, you've got to get in
the race," Buchanan said. "You've got to get down on the field, you can't just
make comments from the box office. And thus far no one has gotten into this race
to challenge us for the Reform Party nomination."
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan also offered some thoughts on New York's Senate race, expected to
pit first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "There could be a third party candidate running, Right to Life and Reform
and Conservative as well," he said. "Do not rule out the possibility of a
three-way race for the U.S. Senate from New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan declined to say whom the third-party candidate might be.

<HEADLINE> Mazda Unveils Car-Like SUV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mazda Corp. on Friday unveiled the Tribute, a trim sport
utility vehicle that marks the company's first serious effort to crack the
growing SUV market.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tribute's success is considered important to the continued turnaround of
the Japanese carmaker that's controlled by Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
	   "The addition of the new Tribute to the Mazda lineup marks the company's
resurgence as a full-line manufacturer," said Richard Beattie, president and
chief executive officer of Mazda North American Operations.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1990-93, Mazda sold a version of the Ford Explorer, but dropped it and
has not had a replacement since. SUVs have dominated North American auto sales
in recent years, and grew 15 percent during 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Introduction of the Tribute is "something that's actually going to ensure
their existence. They haven't had an SUV and it's something that's urgently
needed," said George Peterson, an analyst with Auto Pacific Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Mazda expects to build 20,000 Tributes in 2000 and up to 40,000 in 2001.
Versions intended for the U.S. market will be built at a Ford plant near Kansas
City, Mo., and should appear in showrooms by July, Beattie said. A Ford version
of the Tribute will be introduced next week at the North American International
Auto Show in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Beattie declined to reveal the price tag, but said it will be close to the
cost of smaller SUVs. The target buyer, he said, is a 30-something couple with
two children, a household income of nearly $70,000 and an active lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tribute offers a 3-liter, 200-horsepower V6 engine and independent
suspension in more expensive LS and ES models. The DX includes a 130-horsepower,
2-liter 4-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tribute comes with front wheel drive and an optional "on-demand"
all-wheel-drive system that kicks in automatically if the front wheels begin to
slip.
</P>
<P>
	   At 172 inches long and 72 inches wide, it is 5.5 inches longer overall than
the Jeep Cherokee and 2 inches longer at the wheelbase. With back seats folded
down, it has 71.7 cubic feet of cargo space.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fed Surpluses Said May Grow Larger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal budget surpluses for the next decade could be up
to $800 billion larger than last year's $3 trillion estimate, auguring an
election-year fight over whether the huge kitty should be used for tax cuts,
spending or debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic and Republican budget analysts say at the very least, new
official projections will equal that earlier estimate, no small feat considering
last year's spending splurge by lawmakers that ate well into those surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   The hardy economy has continued generating unanticipated piles of federal
revenue, more than offsetting the extra spending, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A surging economy is bailing out Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress
... outpacing even Congress' and Clinton's spending inclinations,'' said Stephen
Moore, fiscal policy director for the conservative-leaning Cato Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   Depending on what assumptions are made about spending, the new estimates --
one by the Congressional Budget Office, the other by the White House Office of
Management and Budget -- may exceed last year's by hundreds of billions of
dollars, said the Capitol Hill aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO and White House officials declined to discuss their numbers. CBO will
release its new projections later this month, the White House on Feb. 7, when
President Clinton presents his budget for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   For the short run, analysts say the estimates will show a budget surplus,
excluding Social Security, of perhaps $10 billion to $20 billion for this year,
and perhaps up to $60 billion for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Those numbers are important because they would let Republicans claim they
honored last year's promise to not use Social Security money to pay for other
programs. That pledge -- which President Clinton also embraced -- seemed in
jeopardy when lawmakers approved tens of billions in extra spending, threatening
to eat into Social Security's surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures also mean there would be plenty of resources for the tax cuts
Republicans want and the extra spending Democrats prefer for fiscal 2001.
Congress will begin working on tax and spending legislation for 2001 when it
returns to work Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   With both parties trying to create distinctions between themselves that
voters will remember on Election Day, bipartisan agreement on major tax or
spending issues seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the projected surpluses should be so big that some of the money
could be used for tax cuts or new spending for Medicare, defense and other
programs, and still leave huge sums that can be apportioned later. In the
meantime, any unused surplus money would automatically reduce the $5.8 trillion
national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most of the largesse is off in the future, and political gridlock will
ensure those resources are available for the next president and the 107th
Congress,'' said Robert Reischauer, a former CBO director who is now a senior
fellow at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the $3 trillion surplus projected last year, $2 trillion was to come from
Social Security, money that both parties consider politically untouchable for
spending for other programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The remaining $1 trillion in black ink was to come from the rest of the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The size of the projected surplus is growing chiefly because, for yet
another year, the unexpectedly strong economy is producing more federal revenue
than anticipated. In addition, spending for programs including Medicare has been
less than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   The size of the new surplus projections will also depend on whether the
estimates assume that spending limits enacted in 1997 will be obeyed this year.
Assuming the limits will be heeded would produce 10-year surplus estimates that
would well exceed $3 trillion, leaving more money for potential tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers, however, have ignored those limits the last two years,
outspending them by tens of billions of dollars. They seem certain to do the
same this coming year with its campaign-generated spending pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans are split over whether to obey those limits. House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., refused to say if they would when asked about it
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides expect White House budget writers to base their surplus forecasts on
an assumption that the spending limits will be breached.
</P>
<P>
	   The precise size of this year's surplus will be known right before the
November elections, when final data on revenue and spending is tallied.

<HEADLINE> Incoming Coke CEO Continues Shakeup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola's incoming chief continued to shake things up
Friday, naming a new head of the company's critical European division, which
struggled through a costly contamination scare last year, and appointing a new
chief marketing officer.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second and third such moves this week by Doug Daft. Many analysts
viewed the management shuffle as Daft's way of quickly putting together a new
team in time for his official takeover of the Atlanta-based soft drink giant in
April at the annual shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's been in Atlanta since 1991 and is familiar with the system and the
players, so there isn't the normal waiting time you would normally get with a
new CEO," said Merrill Lynch analyst Douglas Lane. "And stay tuned, I think
there is more to come."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, Coca-Cola stock shot up more than 5 percent, rising $3 to
$60 a share Friday afternoon in a day of broad stock gains on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Daft was named as the successor to Coke's chairman and chief executive, M.
Douglas Ivester, last month immediately following Ivester's surprise retirement
announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Daft picked Charles S. Frenette to take over the Greater Europe Group, which
includes 49 countries, following the retirement of William P. Casey. Frenette
also will become an executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Frenette, 47, is currently the chief marketing officer. Taking his place
will be 44-year-old Stephen C. Jones, president of Coke subsidiary Minute Maid
since November and former deputy division president in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Both appointments must be approved by the board.
</P>
<P>
	   Casey was in charge of the European division when the company underwent a
massive product recall in Belgium and France last year due to a health scare.
But Coke spokesman Rob Baskin said Casey had long been contemplating retirement
was not being forced out or punished for the European problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "Absolutely not," Baskin said. "This seemed like a good time to do it, what
with Doug Daft organizing for the future and putting his own team in place."
</P>
<P>
	   Frenette oversaw the creation of the company's new marketing strategy, which
is to be slowly unveiled over the next few months. Coke has already introduced
new glass bottles, and a presentation is expected to be made to the company's
bottlers next week in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   But many experts were not concerned that Frenette was taking a different job
at such a critical point.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was also on the ground a lot in Belgium during the recall and was more
hands-on in terms of fixing the problem than any other one guy," Lane said. "And
the (marketing) plans are already in place ... they just need to be
implemented."
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Daft announced that the company's highest-ranking black
executive had reversed his decision to retire at the end of this year. Carl Ware
instead will become an executive vice president in charge of a new division
overseeing global public and governmental relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Analyst David Goldman of Banc of America Securities said the moves should
also "build the ranks."
</P>
<P>
	   "Coke may have had a problem when it came to depth in management, and Doug
is moving quickly to correct that problem," Goldman said.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Steady at 4.1 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A burst of hiring at department stores and construction
companies helped keep the nation's unemployment rate at a 30-year low of 4.1
percent in December, marking a strong finish for a year in which Americans
enjoyed the best labor market since the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
	   Employers added 315,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, the largest gain
since July. Big increases came at department stores, enjoying their best holiday
sales season in seven years, and construction companies, basking in a building
boom brought on by warmer-than-usual weather.
</P>
<P>
	   "The century ended on a high note for workers," said First Union chief
economist David Orr. He noted that the gain in payroll jobs was far above the
240,000 increase many economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
	   December's jobless rate of 4.1 percent matched the year's low reached in
November. That level is better than any since unemployment stood at 3.9 percent
in January 1970, the Labor Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the unemployment rate averaged 4.2 percent, the best since
a 3.5 percent jobless average in 1969. In 1998, the unemployment rate averaged
4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "The opportunities for employment and for upgrading jobs in 1999 were the
best workers have seen in 30 years," said Ken Mayland, chief economist for
KeyCorp.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong economic growth is keeping unemployment down to levels most workers
haven't seen since they took their first jobs, economists said. And that's
helping workers who historically have had a harder time finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton hailed 1999's performance for producing "the lowest annual
unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics ever recorded." The
annual average unemployment rate for blacks in 1999 was 8 percent and for
Hispanics 6.4 percent, Labor Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, employers boosted jobs and wages by bigger-than-expected
amounts, which caused economists to worry that strong job and wage growth could
trigger inflation down the road.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're creating jobs faster than workers, and the Fed is right that this
can't go on forever," said Bill Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's jobless report adds to the likelihood that Federal Reserve
policy-makers will raise interest rates, by at least a quarter of a point, at
their next meeting in February, many economists said. The central bank bumped up
interest rates three times last year to slow the economy and keep inflation at
bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch's chief economist Bruce Steinberg said the
stronger-than-expected 315,000 jobs created in December "all but guarantees the
Fed will tighten monetary policy on Feb. 2."
</P>
<P>
	   Stock investors seemed to take the report in stride. The Dow Jones
industrial average gained more than 200 points late in the session, and the
Nasdaq index, regaining ground lost in major selloffs earlier this week, was up
by close to 110.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices fell as the yields on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bonds
climbed to 6.57 percent from 6.55 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   December's 315,000 additional payroll jobs followed a gain of 222,000 in
November. Department stores hired 34,000 people last month, their first increase
since April. Construction companies added 16,000 jobs, while engineering and
management firms hired a larger-than-normal 23,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Payrolls grew briskly in other industries as well. Bars and restaurants
hired 27,000 workers; health-care providers added 16,000, an above-average gain;
and financial services, including insurance and real-estate, added 12,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   But manufacturers lost 1,000 jobs in December, bringing their total job loss
for 1999 to 248,000. The manufacturing job loss has slowed in recent months as
U.S. exporters began to see a revival in foreign demand from countries
recovering from the global currency crisis of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, employers added 2.7 million jobs, compared with 2.9 million
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, grew
by 0.4 percent to $13.46 in December, the biggest jump in three months. That
followed a tiny 0.1 percent rise in November.
</P>
<P>
	   While strong wage and job growth are good developments for workers,
economists and members of the Federal Reserve worry that the combination could
eventually trigger inflation. Their shared fear: that employers trying to
attract scarce workers to fill job openings will lure them with higher wages and
benefits -- increased costs that could drive up consumer prices.

<HEADLINE> Court To Resolve Pension Dispute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide whether
employee benefit plans can sue brokers and others who provide services for their
roles in deals that make the plan lose money.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is whether Ameritech Corp. and its pension plan trustee, Harris
Trust and Savings Bank, can recover some $20 million lost in a deal with Salomon
Brothers Inc., a stock brokerage that is now part of Citigroup Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   In the late 1980s, Salomon sold $21 million worth of interests in a
financial deal involving two motel chains to Ameritech's pension plan. The plan
lost nearly all of its investment in the deal after the motel chains failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Ameritech and the bank that administers its pension plan sued. Among other
things, the lawsuit invoked a federal pension-protecting law, alleging that the
sale had been unfair and a ``prohibited transaction'' under the federal Employee
Retirement Income and Security Act (ERISA).
</P>
<P>
	   Salomon contended it could not be sued under ERISA because it, unlike Harris
Trust and Savings Bank, owed no fiduciary duty to the pension plan.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal trial judge allowed the lawsuit but the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals reversed that ruling and threw out the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ameritech pension plan's only option would be to sue its trustee for
engaging in the deal since Salomon owed no legal duty to the plan, the appeals
court said.
</P>
<P>
	   But six other federal appeals courts have allowed such lawsuits even in the
absence of a so-called fiduciary duty.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court's decision, expected by late June, should resolve the
conflict among the federal appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Harris Trust and Savings Bank vs. Salomon Brothers, 99-579.

    CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures rose Friday on the Chicago Board
of Trade in a rally driven by weather forecasts and a variety of technical
reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn led the gains, bursting to eight-week highs as steadily rising prices
gave evidence of a possible end to the long downward trend.
</P>

a forecast for record warm temperatures next week in the Great Plains, home to a
significant winter wheat crop.

	   Soybeans also advanced, although gains were limited by forecasts for rain in
crop areas of South America this weekend and again at midweek.

<HEADLINE> Flu bug, elective surgeries jam N.J. hospitals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - An empty bed is hard to find in a New Jersey
hospital these days.
<P>
	   A combination of a virulent flu bug sweeping the region and a glut of
patients who put off elective surgery until after the holidays is jamming
hospitals throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, most hospitals have had to close their doors temporarily to new
patients until beds open up. That, in turn, forces ambulances to divert
emergency patients to other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   Waits of two hours or more just to see an emergency room doctor are common,
officials say, and in some hospitals, for every patient in an upstairs bed,
there's another one in the emergency room waiting for one.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had times when we were the only hospital in our county that was not
on bypass," said Dr. Jay Kaplan, chief of emergency medicine at St. Barnabas
Medical Center. "We've had times where we were getting ambulances from 30
minutes away."
</P>
<P>
	   The situation was much the same at the 527-bed Monmouth Medical Center in
Long Branch.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the first three days of this week, we were the only hospital in
Monmouth County that was not on divert," said Dr. Peter Valko, Monmouth's chief
of emergency medicine. "We were the only game in town for several days."
</P>
<P>
	   The New Jersey Hospital Association surveyed its 108 members last week, and
found that virtually all of them had been forced to stop taking new patients for
at least a few hours at a time, a practice known as "going on divert."
</P>
<P>
	   It happens when a facility's emergency department determines it cannot
handle any additional patients because there are no available beds. The
condition usually lasts a few hours until some beds open up, although some
facilities have remained on divert for several days at a time.
</P>
<P>
	   "It really is difficult when everybody is going on divert because where are
the emergency cases going to go?" asked Geri Moon, the hospital association's
vice-president of professional practice.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hospitals have disaster plans in place, and this is almost like a
mini-disaster, if you will," added association spokesman Ron Czajkowski.
</P>
<P>
	   While there have been no reports of emergency patients worsening because
they had to be taken to a more distant hospital, hospitals take that step only
as a last resort. And Kaplan said ambulance crews will still bring a critically
injured or ill patient to the nearest emergency room, regardless of whether a
divert order is in place.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're trying to do the best they can," Moon said. "They're bringing in
additional staff, asking staff to work double shifts, and trying anything else
they can to deal with the crush."
</P>
<P>
	   The situation is not likely to improve anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
	   January is always the busiest month for New Jersey hospitals, with seasonal
flu outbreaks in full bloom. And many patients who need elective or
non-emergency procedures such as gall bladder surgery or hernia repair usually
schedule them for after the holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   That all adds up to jammed emergency rooms, and long waits for a hospital
bed.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a real focus on seeing people, even if we have to do it in the
hallway," said Kaplan, whose St. Barnabas system includes 11 northern and
central New Jersey hospitals. "They'd rather be seen in the hallway than not
seen at all. I'm aware of some facilities that are holding as many patients in
the ER as they have beds in the hospital."
</P>
<P>
	   Pati Caldwell, a spokeswoman for Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune,
said her 502-bed facility was handling the overflow from other shore area
hospitals. And even Jersey Shore had to go on divert twice this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital usually treats 140 emergency room patients a day, but is
averaging 25 to 30 additional ones this week, most of whom have flu or other
upper respiratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the weekend and in the beginning of the week, we were totally jammed,
and we're as busy today as we were then," she said. "We were receiving not only
our own patients, but also patients from other hospitals that were on divert.
We're pretty crowded, and it's been pretty steady."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Claims Mideast Talks Progress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- In a move portrayed as evidence of progress,
President Clinton presented Israel and Syria a ``working document'' Friday that
could be a pathway to a land-for-peace treaty between the two old foes.
</P>
<P>
	   In another measured step forward, Clinton met with Prime Minister Ehud Barak
of Israel and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, first together, then
separately. It was the first face-to-face meeting between Barak and al-Sharaa
since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are moving down the track,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said before formal talks drew to a close for the Jewish Sabbath and the Muslim
Eid al-Fitr, the end of the holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations were to resume Saturday night. He said Barak and al-Sharaa may
go home early next week, leaving experts behind to continue deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is difficult stuff. This is very hard stuff,'' Clinton said on his
fourth day of mediating between Barak and al-Sharaa on details of a settlement
based on the proposition Israel should give up the Golan Heights to gain Syria's
diplomatic recognition.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president gave the U.S.-drafted
document, about seven pages long, to the two sides during the 45-minute
trilateral meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This working document provides a summary of the issues to be decided and
the differences between the parties,'' Lockhart said. ``It is designed as a
procedural tool to focus the substantive discussions and to help bridge the
differences that now exist.''
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations at this college town 70 miles from Washington had stalled over
procedural issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel insisted committees on peace terms and border security meet first,
and they did. But Rubin said committees on the timetable of an Israeli
withdrawal on the Golan Heights and on water resources would meet before the
round ends.
</P>
<P>
	   The document, which Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had directed her
aides to prepare, details both the agreements and disagreements during
negotiations here, in Washington last month and before a breakdown four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's certainly progress to have a document before the parties,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he added, ``We have limited expectations (of) what can be completed with
one round.''
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation told The Associated Press that the
Syrian negotiating team was satisfied with the document ``because matters now
have become more well-defined, and we won't be going back to square one every
time we meet.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Israelis, but Rubin said, ``They
both regard this as a good way to move the process forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he is satisfied everyone is making a good-faith effort. ``They
are working hard and trying to find ways to resolve their differences,'' he
said,
</P>
<P>
	   Before boarding a U.S. Marine helicopter that took him back to the White
House, the president spent a few minutes window shopping on German Street, the
main thoroughfare in 239-year-old Shepherdstown.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 200 spectators lined the street to see him.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright stayed behind and planned to join the Israeli delegation for
traditional Shabat dinner Friday night at the Clarion Hotel, which is off-limits
to journalists. On Saturday, she will join the Syrians for their feast to mark
the end of Ramadan.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Party Tries To Win Back Voters  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORDERSTEDT, Germany (AP) -- Germany's conservatives are trying to win back
voters disaffected by Helmut Kohl's slush fund scandal with an anti-tax campaign
in a northern state that holds elections next month.
</P>
<P>
	   The Schleswig-Holstein vote will be the first test of how the Christian
Democrats are weathering the scandal -- and they've already told Kohl not to
campaign in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   By opposing an unpopular new gasoline tax that took effect Jan. 1, party
leaders hoped to tap into public discontent and revive their chances of
unseating Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats in the local election.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfgang Schaeuble, party chief since Kohl's 1998 election defeat, sought to
rally the Christian Democrats at a two-day strategy session of their national
leadership that began Friday in this town outside Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl skipped the session, unusual for a man who rarely missed a meeting
during the 25 years he ran the party largely as a one-man show. No reason was
given.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not giving up on the political contest,'' Schaeuble said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, gubernatorial candidate Volker Ruehe handed out leaflets
against the energy tax, calling it an ``unbearable burden on the people'' and
``economic rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Kohl's troubles remain a heavy burden. The former chancellor has angered
many in his party by admitting he solicited up to $1 million in political
donations from 1993-98 and illegally kept them off the books.
</P>
<P>
	   He has refused to name the donors, despite repeated appeals by his party to
help clear up the scandal. Prosecutors opened a criminal probe against Kohl this
week for possible breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the scandal erupted, the Christian Democrats had high hopes of
extending a string of election victories and winning in Schleswig-Holstein.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruehe acknowledged the danger that the Feb. 27 state ballot would become ``a
referendum about mistakes made by the Christian Democrats at the federal
level.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both Schaeuble and Ruehe -- top aides to Kohl during his 16 years as
chancellor -- are edging away from their former boss after some initial
reluctance.
</P>
<P>
	   With growing exasperation, Schaeuble said the party may have to accept that
Kohl will ignore its repeated appeals to name the anonymous donors -- and must
try to move on.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, we were not happy when he said he would stick by his opposing
point of view,'' Schaeuble said. ``We can't do anything about it. We can't force
him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ruehe said he kept Kohl out of the campaign because he wanted to put ``the
accent on the new party leadership.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Helmut Kohl told me already in early December that I had a free hand in
the matter,'' said Ruehe, who was defense minister under Kohl.
</P>
<P>
	   Schroeder opens his party's campaign in the state capital Kiel on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Shuffles Combat Commanders  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI BAGROV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- With its offensive to capture Grozny stalled, the
Russian high command on Friday shuffled its top combat generals in Chechnya,
insisting that it was a routine staff rotation.
</P>
<P>
	   The removal of the two generals who had commanded combat operations in
Chechnya suggested government frustration over the failure to take the shattered
Chechen capital. The Russian government wants to gain control of Grozny so it
can announce a major victory and possibly begin winding down the conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian commanders also indicated Friday that a scaling-back of the
bombardment of Grozny had been ordered, but gave conflicting details.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Ministry said Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev was replaced as commander
of the Eastern front by his deputy, Maj. Gen. Sergei Makarov.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Western front, Maj. Gen. Vladimir Shamanov was sidelined in favor of
Maj. Gen. Alexei Verbitzky. Little was known about the new commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian ground forces began a major drive Dec. 25 to take Grozny, but have
made little progress in the face of fierce rebel resistance. Russian commanders
said last month that the city would be taken within days.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebel fighters in the city launched counterattacks this week and showed no
sign of giving up. Rebel commanders say they are ready to fight for years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Ministry insisted the rotations were normal practice, but the
moves will be seen as dismissals. Acting President Vladimir Putin, who took over
when Boris Yeltsin resigned Dec. 31, may want to wrap up the war before
presidential elections March 26.
</P>
<P>
	   The personnel changes were ``not the result of any professional error of the
commanders who are just returning to their former positions,'' according to a
military statement read on Russian state television networks.
</P>
<P>
	   NTV, a private television channel, said Shamanov's removal might be linked
to reports that Russian soldiers massacred about 40 Chechen civilians last month
in the village of Alkhan-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Shamanov, who helped formulate the strategy to occupy Chechnya, returned to
his previous post as chief of the 58th Army.
</P>
<P>
	   The general became famous at the start of the campaign in September for his
hard-driving tactics. His soldiers adored Shamanov, who had a reputation of
leading from the front, unlike most other senior commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   Troshev, who will continue in his previous post as commander of the Northern
Caucasus military district, insisted at a press briefing Friday in the southern
Russian city of Mozdok that no errors had been made.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said that Russian forces were scaling back their operations in
Grozny, but indicated that fighting was not being called off altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   In a series of confusing remarks broadcast on Russian TV channels, Troshev
said Russian forces would ``suspend military activities in all directions''
because of the threat posed to civilians in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also said combat operations would continue in areas of the city where
there were no civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To halt does not mean we won't continue, we are conducting the military
activities around the clock in the areas where there are no civilians,'' he said
in the TV broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
	   The news agency ITAR-Tass reported from Mozdok that Troshev's comments
referred to air and artillery bombardment of the capital. A spokesman for the
Defense Ministry in Moscow said he was not sure what Troshev meant.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no details about how long any pause might last.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian artillery and aircraft have been battering Grozny since September
despite the presence of up to 40,000 civilians hiding in basements in the city.
Russia has announced cease fires in the past to allow civilians to leave, but
did not halt all combat operations during those lulls.
</P>
<P>
	   In spite of fog and snow, federal planes and helicopter gunships flew 43
combat missions over the past 24 hours, the military said Friday. It claimed to
have killed more than 30 rebels.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore duel over health care and farm policy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Democratic rivals Al Gore and Bill Bradley waged
a long-distance duel over health care and farm issues Friday, less than three
weeks before Iowa's leadoff caucuses. Gore brought in big-name help from a
former Senate colleague.
<P>
	   "Al Gore is going to be our health care president," Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts told a fairgrounds crowd. "Al Gore is going to be our protector of
senior citizens."
</P>
<P>
	   While the vice president was in Dubuque with Kennedy, challenging Bradley on
his centerpiece health-care package, Bradley headed to a community center in Des
Moines where he met with about 50 people to tout the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are differences that give people something to select," Bradley said
of the two presidential contenders' plans on health care, an issue that has
become central to their battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Both have offered plans to expand health coverage, but Bradley's is far
larger. Gore argues it would fritter away the budget surplus, while Bradley
argues that Gore is timid.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not satisfied with nibbling around the edges," said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy has long been a liberal champion on health care issues, and his
endorsement of Gore this week bolstered Gore's standing on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley shrugged off Kennedy's appearance and said he'll have senators
backing him in Iowa, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that Paul Wellstone and Bob Kerrey will be stumping around the
state, as well as a few other of my friends," said Bradley. "We're probably
going to have 400 or 500 people here or more."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore argued that Medicare was the key difference between the two, saying his
proposed budget would set aside $374 billion to shore up Medicare for baby
boomers' retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we want to be the kind of nation that continues to take care of its
seniors, we have to plan ahead," said Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said voters are paying attention to his plan. "I think that a lot of
middle-class and lower middle-class Americans have felt left out for a long
time," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scarlett Lunning of Des Moines listened to Bradley's health care pitch and
said, "There's a fear because we're all getting older. ... Everything moves with
the baby boomers."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, in a conference call with reporters, also took a shot at Bradley on
farm policy as he touted an administration plan to spend nearly $1.3 billion on
new conservation programs.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is going to be a new source of welcome income for farmers," said Gore,
who indicated he would use a debate Saturday to underscore differences on farm
policy.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Bradley had voted against ethanol subsidies and flood relief as a
member of the Senate. Bradley has said he had a different responsibility
representing New Jersey in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy has a political history in the state, campaigning in Iowa heavily
when he challenged then-President Carter in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   He lost badly and Bradley sought to use that race as a benchmark for his own
performance in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   "The high point for an insurgent in Iowa was 1980 when Ted Kennedy got
around 30 percent or 31 percent of the vote," Bradley said. "That's the most
that anybody ever got as an insurgent in Iowa."

<HEADLINE> Rise in crime really a product of cooked books  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In the New York Police Department, where crime
statistics can make or break a supervisor's career, the numbers from one
Brooklyn precinct were alarming: a 19 percent jump in crime last year.
<P>
	   But it wasn't the current head of the 88th Precinct who suffered for the
increase. His predecessor, police acknowledged Friday, had underreported crime
figures from the year before, creating the apparent crime wave in the Fort
Greene section.
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Charles F. Dowd, who was promoted because of his work in the 88th
Precinct, was transferred out of his new job and denied an expected promotion
when the skewed numbers became public knowledge. The New York Times first
reported the discrepency on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   According to The Times, at least five police commanders have been questioned
about the veracity of their statistics since 1996. The use of crime statistics
in planning police activity is one factor in the dramatic dropoff in the city
crime rate, which is now at a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowd apparently misclassified felony cases as less-important misdemeanor
cases. The result: robberies were down from 606 in 1997 to 399 in 1998; assaults
were down from 263 to 188; grand theft was down from 292 to 207.
</P>
<P>
	   When the numbers went up in 1999, new Capt. James Guida appeared in trouble.
Robberies appeared to jump from 399 to 470, assaults went from 188 to 195, and
grand theft increased from 207 to 326. An internal police audit turned up the
reason for the shocking increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowd, who kept his captain's rank, was never charged with any wrongdoing. He
is now in a non-command job at a Queens precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who initially told The Times that Dowd
"was dumped because he was playing with the statistics," later said that Dowd
had not willfully misled the department.

<HEADLINE> Pataki: let welfare families should keep more child support $$s  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Welfare families should keep more of the child
support payments they are getting from parents who are not living under the same
roof, Gov. George Pataki said.
<P>
	   Included in Pataki's 2000-2001 state budget proposal to the Legislature on
Tuesday will be a provision doubling the limit from $50 to $100 in child support
payments that families on welfare can receive.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki will present his sixth budget proposal to the state Legislature in
Albany on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Child advocates praised Pataki Friday for advancing the more generous
pass-through to welfare families, saying that if any families need the extra
money, it's those on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has always been an issue with us for those lucky enough to be getting
child support that they and their children should see the benefits of that
support," said Elie Ward, executive director of Statewide Youth Advocacy. "The
money is supposed to be for the kids."
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of child support that people on welfare can receive is limited so
taxpayers can be reimbursed for the cost of the public benefits their families
are taking in.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Pataki administration reported that about $1 billion child
support payments were made in New York. Of that, about $190 million was
forwarded to the state so state, county and federal taxpayers could be
reimbursed for the cost of welfare payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Ward said that for some families on welfare, getting an extra $50 or $75 a
month could be the difference between their even being on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Other child-related initiatives the governor said would be in his next
budget included:
</P>
<P>
	   -Increasing from 159,000 to 178,000 the number of child care slots available
for the children of working poor families.
</P>
<P>
	   -Increasing the state's child care block grant from $626 million in the
current fiscal year to $711 million in 2000-01. In addition to providing more
day care, the increase would also expand oversight and monitoring of child care
facilities, improve services for the children of migrant workers and provide for
the fingerprinting of all regulated child care providers, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   -Expanding the state's "celebrating fatherhood" campaign to encourage males
to voluntarily take part in their children's lives.
</P>
<P>
	   -Expanding efforts to determine whether parents paying child support have
health care programs which could also cover those children. If the children are
now on welfare, their health care is paid for by taxpayers through the Medicaid
program.

	   Jobless Rate Steady at 4.1 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate held steady at
a three-decade-low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers
found jobs, the biggest gain since July. President Clinton and
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman hailed the news. Clinton credited
information technology with making a big contribution, and Herman
noted that the country's current prosperity was widely shared. The
Labor Department reported today that December's jobless rate
matched November's 4.1 percent, the lowest since a 3.9 percent rate
in January 1970. For all of 1999, the unemployment rate averaged
4.2 percent, the lowest since 3.5 percent in 1969 during the
Vietnam War, making last year one of the most golden job markets in
years. In 1998, the unemployment rate averaged 4.5 percent.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today, with blue-chip shares
surging despite more signs of inflationary pressure and the
technology group mounting a modest rebound even after a profit
warning by Lucent. Just before 3 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 193.29 at 11,446.55, extending the 250-point rebound
of the past two days and wiping out the remainder of Tuesday's

points. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index was up 93.53 at

	   Tech Stocks Strong Despite Lucent
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rose today despite Lucent
Technologies' disclosure late yesterday that the company won't meet
most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. Lucent fell in
late trading on other markets and was trading today at 52 15/16,
down 16 1/16 from Thursday's close on the New York Stock Exchange.
Lucent's troubles were apparently seen as a gain for its main
rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the
communications networks that make up the Internet. Nortel Networks
was up 14 9/16 at 91 9/16 on the NYSE, while in heavy Nasdaq
trading, Cisco Systems was up 3 3/16 at 103 3/16, Ciena was up 14
1/16 at 59 15/16 and JDS Uniphase was up 17 1/4 at 167.

	   Y2K Glitch Hits Some Credit Cards
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Buyers beware: Your credit card might get
charged more than once because some merchants failed to update
their computer software for the Year 2000. Visa and Mastercard said
today they have checks in place to catch duplicate charges, but
they suggest that customers review their credit card statements
anyhow. A vast majority of transactions are going through without
problems, they added. The problem is being caused by outdated IC
Verify software from CyberCash, which makes electronic transaction
processing software. The company offered free fixes last year, but
some merchants didn't get them.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's largest computer chipmaker,
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., said Friday it will buy the
island's third largest producer in a stock swap that analysts
valued at more than $3 billion. With an earlier deal, the purchase
will make TSMC the world's largest chip foundry. TSMC's agreement
to buy Worldwide Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. follows recent
speculation that Taiwan's No. 2 company, United Microelectronics
Corp., had been courting Worldwide. The deal will put pressure on
United Microelectronics to find its own merger partner, said Nathan

accounting giant reported having violated rules prohibiting them
from owning stock in companies they audit. The review made public
by the Securities and Exchange Commission also said many more such
lapses were said not to have been reported. A
PricewaterhouseCoopers managing partner, Kenton J. Sicchitano, told
The New York Times that in addition to the dismissals, other
employees were disciplined but not fired. He declined to give

series of changes'' in how it markets itself to America's youth,
the Army said it hired a Chicago consulting firm, Jones-Lundin
Associates Inc., to help it select an ad agency for a new contract
that, unlike the existing arrangement, would pay the agency based
on how many recruits it attracts. The Army said Young &AMP; Rubicam is
welcome to compete for the new contract. The agency's current
five-year contract is due to expire in July. Officials said it was

<HEADLINE> Floor brokers sentenced for greed on Wall Street  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A judge Friday blamed greed for the corruption of New
York Stock Exchange floor brokers as he ordered prison terms or home detention
for four of them snared in the first prosecution of its kind.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff handed the stiffest sentence to the head
of a company that helped the brokers to trade illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   William Killeen, crying so much that he had to hand his statement to his
lawyer to be read out loud, was sentenced to a year and eight months in prison
for his part in the scam engineered in part through his company, Oakford Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Killeen, 40, of Colts Neck, N.J., was president of the now defunct company
that engaged in a securities conspiracy by allowing floor brokers to execute
personal trades ahead of orders from their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Floor brokers are paid a commission to conduct trades for client brokerages
and their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   They are not permitted to make trades for themselves or for any account in
which they have an interest because their positions on the floor can provide
them with immediate access to market-moving news, giving them an unfair
advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Rakoff also fined Killeen $50,000 after the defendant said he was "extremely
sorry."
</P>
<P>
	   "It is with great regret that I stand here today," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said Killeen's honorable dedication to his family and his
community conflicted with his business life in which he and others engaged in "a
series of blatantly unlawful acts motivated by greed."
</P>
<P>
	   "He is the proverbial person who led two lives," Rakoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that Killeen appeared to be a good family man and a good community
man.
</P>
<P>
	   "But in his business life, greed overcame respect for the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Killeen's sentencing was one of six to occur throughout the day, four of
them floor brokers.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge rejected arguments by lawyers that the brokers should not face
prison terms because they were not properly informed by the NYSE that what they
were doing was a crime. The prosecution is believed to be the first case to
result from illegal personal trades made by floor brokers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It involved not only intentional violations of the rules but the making of
false statements and the making of false records," the judge said. "It was done
out of greed."
</P>
<P>
	   John Savarese, 41, and his brother, Mark, 37, both floor brokers from Garden
City, were each sentenced to four months in prison to be followed by two months
of home detention. Both were fined $15,000 as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Edward Mueger, 65, of Port Washington was sentenced to three months in
prison and three months of home confinement. He was also fined $15,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Cavallino, 42, of Shrewsbury, N.J., was sentenced to six months of
home confinement and fined $100,000. The judge spared Cavallino a prison term
but increased his fine to make up for it after listening to pleas that he be
left at home to care for his son.
</P>
<P>
	   A sixth defendant remained to be sentenced late Friday.

<HEADLINE> No Christmas for Beleaguered Copts  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA BRYSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EL-KUSHEH, Egypt (AP) -- Coptic Christmas passed without celebration in this
mostly Christian corner of southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   No one came to Father Markos Abdel-Masih's midnight Mass. His parishioners
have been too afraid to leave their homes after dark -- even to pray for peace
-- since an outbreak of Muslim-Christian fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of Mass, Father Gabriel Abdel-Masih officiated at a Christmas Eve
funeral for the 21st victim, a 25-year-old civil servant who died of gunshot
wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Friday, when el-Kusheh would normally have been crowded with thousands
of Christmas worshippers, the only sign of life drifted down from windows far
above the darkened streets. It was the faint, televised voice of Coptic Pope
Shenouda preaching from his cathedral in Cairo, 275 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All those people who died -- how can we forget?'' said Gabriel
Abdel-Masih, who shares with the priest a name common among Egyptian Christians.
``It is only the Lord who can resolve the tensions between people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Copts, whose independent church broke away from the Byzantine Orthodox
church in the sixth century, are the largest religious minority in predominantly
Muslim Egypt. Nationwide, they make up about 10 percent of the population of 60
million. But in el-Kusheh they are by far in the majority, and a relative
prosperous one.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Dabba Michael Habib, a shop owner, said there was no warning before his
Muslim neighbors shot his 17-year-old son Waiel on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   From his father's house down the street, Habib and his wife watched as the
top floor of their four-story apartment building erupted in flames. Waiel and
his aunt were in an apartment on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
	   Habib watched as Waiel jumped from the second floor and ran toward him.
Habib opened the door to find a mob chasing his son and shooting at him, hitting
him 12 times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was bleeding a lake of blood,'' Habib sobbed. Police stood by
helplessly while the attackers kept him from taking his son to a doctor, Habib
said. The aunt was able to flee to safety.
</P>
<P>
	   To help tell his story Friday, Habib pulled out the blood-stiffened gowns he
and his wife were wearing when Waiel died in their arms.
</P>
<P>
	   Like many Muslims in el-Kusheh, police officer Abdul Sohour said the attacks
were not set off by widespread religious hatred, but by ``fights between
families.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government, often reluctant to discuss religious intolerance, has blamed
the violence on ``conflicting reactions between Muslims and Christians on
business matters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police said Friday that 15 Muslim suspects had been arrested. No violence
has been reported since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am so sad about the people who were killed, the Christians, because they
are like my brothers,'' said Abdul Nasser Abdul Rady, a Muslim shopkeeper.
</P>
<P>
	   Coptic families described being attacked for about two hours beginning at
10:30 a.m. Sunday, when Mass let out. All could identify many of their attackers
-- neighbors they had known amicably for years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They stole everything in the house, and what they couldn't steal, they
burned,'' Habib said. ``I wish they had taken everything I had, but left me my
son.''
</P>
<P>
	   Father Abdel-Masih said animosity has lurked beneath cordial
Christian-Muslim relations since he was a child. From time to time, he said,
violence erupts when groups of Copts and Muslims take sides in conflicts between
individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   The priest said last week's trouble, which began two days after a dispute
between a Coptic merchant and a Muslim shopper, appeared orchestrated.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Sunday, black-uniformed officers from the elite national State
Security force have been patrolling in armored vehicles and on foot.
</P>
<P>
	   Copt victims said they did not believe their trust would ever be revived. In
an ironic coincidence of faiths, their Christmas this year fell on the day that
ended Ramadan, the Muslim holy month.

<HEADLINE> Trucks Dominate Detroit Auto Show  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- If there's one message that will be heard loud and clear
over the glad crowing of automakers at this year's Detroit auto show, it's this:
The car of the future is a truck.
</P>
<P>
	   From hulking four-door pickups to micro-sport utility vehicles and station
wagons on steroids, trucks will dominate the turntables of the 2000 North
American International Auto Show, just as they dominated the sales charts in
1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet industry watchers point to some warning lights such as rising
competition and fuel prices that may make the vehicles a tougher sell.
</P>
<P>
	   All the large American manufacturers, along with several Asian and European
automakers, will show off new production models and concept vehicles at the
show, which begins media previews Sunday. The emphasis on trucks is so strong
that the hometown gang -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler
division of DaimlerChrysler AG -- have no major passenger car introductions
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies can say they're just giving consumers what they're asking for.
SUVs were the fastest growing segment in 1999, up 15 percent over the previous
year, according to Morgan &AMP; Co. in West Olive, Mich. Trucks accounted for 58
percent of the 11.6 million vehicles sold by GM, Ford and Chrysler in 1999 --
and probably a much larger percent of their vehicle profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim O'Connor, Ford division president, noted that more than 40 new SUV
models have been introduced since 1991, and that at least 10 more are due out in
the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone wants a piece of this action," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Why the boom in trucks? One reason is the "wealth effect" -- a term covering
all the benefits of a strong economy, such as low unemployment, low interest
rates for car loans, a strong stock market and even good mortgage rates that
allowed some consumers to refinance and use home equity to buy vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   That wealth allows consumers to buy more expensive vehicles and to keep more
vehicles parked outside their homes. Ken Cherven, an analyst with The Polk
Company, found that trucks and SUVs were often the second vehicle in a family,
and that 61.5 percent of U.S. households owned more than one vehicle in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Another reason is the increase in households with children. Analyst Michael
Ward with Salomon SmithBarney found that increases in SUV sales in the 1990s ran
parallel to the boom in children under 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "The SUV segment has been pulling customers from the traditional family
sedan market," Ward said in a November report.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Detroit auto show, considered the most important event of its kind
in North America, automakers have prepared several new truck and SUV models.
</P>
<P>
	   GM has already shown its Pontiac Aztek SUV and Chevrolet Avalanche truck-SUV
combo; it will also have further details about its deal with AM General, the
maker of the monster Hummer SUV. Chrysler will unveil new versions of its
minivans. Ford will display a new mini-SUV, its entry against models already on
the market from Honda and Toyota.
</P>
<P>
	   Toyota and Honda will show off new SUVs heading for production, while Audi,
Subaru and even Volkswagen will show off SUV and pickup concept vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   While experts say total U.S. vehicle sales in 2000 could decline slightly
from a record 16.9 million in 1999, it could also be the year that automakers
sell more trucks than cars. They came close in 1999, with trucks accounted for
48.5 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
	   But with all the new models entering the market, automakers may have to
reduce the profit margins to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
	   "If history is any indication, companies won't let vehicles sit on their
lots, and price will be the competing mechanism," Cherven said. "There's
certainly some potential benefit to consumers if some of those segments become
overly competitive."
</P>
<P>
	   Rising gasoline prices also could be a threat to truck and SUV sales. Art
Spinella, an industry sales analyst with CNW Marketing Research in Bandon, Ore.,
said GM, Ford and Chrysler could feel a pinch if customers switch back to more
fuel-efficient cars.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's short-sighted, because effectively what they're doing is giving up the
car market," he said. "They're releasing the car market to the Japanese and
Europeans."
</P>
<P>
	   But many of the newer SUVs are designed to deliver better fuel economy. In
his report, Ward predicted that given a strong economy and stable demographics,
truck and SUV sales would show little signs of weakening in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fuel prices certainly are a risk to the SUV market, but we believe that
increasing gas prices would only shift the mix toward minivans -- kids don't
disappear in a recession or when fuel costs are higher," Ward said.
</P>
<P>
	   The show opens to the public on Jan. 15.

<HEADLINE> Judge orders Internet porn site to drop Teen magazine's name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - At the request of Teen magazine, a federal judge has
ordered the operators of an Internet pornography site to stop using the
publication's name in its Web address.
<P>
	   "Our magazine is geared to teen girls, and when they find pornography
instead, you can well understand why not only our client would be upset, but our
readers would be upset. It's appalling," Teen magazine lawyer David Jacobs said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine's president, Lynn Lehmkuhl, said staff discovered the
pornography site the last week of 1999, and soon heard from puzzled girls.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was horrified. It was really hardcore. Not even 'Playboy.' It was really,
really creepy," Lehmkuhl said.
</P>
<P>
	   The operator of the pornography site, Blue Gravity Communications, and its
owner, Thomas Krwawecz III, were temporarily restrained on Thursday from using
the address by U.S. District Judge Joseph E. Irenas.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine's Web address is www.teenmag.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Irenas scheduled a hearing Jan. 14 on whether to impose an injunction
against Blue Gravity. He ruled, however, that Teen" was likely to prevail
because it would be "irreparably injured" by the use of its name by another.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue Gravity representatives did not attend the hearing, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
	   Messages left Friday for Krwawecz at his home in Pittsgrove, and at his
company, which has addresses there and in Pennsauken, were not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The pornography Web site could not be reached Friday morning, but was
available later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit filed Thursday for Teen is among the first in the nation to rely
on federal law enacted in November to ban "cybersquatting," the practice of
pre-empting of Internet domain names from people or companies with trademark
associations to them.
</P>
<P>
	   Domain names are the addresses computer users enter to reach a Web site.
They come between "www" and "com," "net" or "org."
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit seeks to have the site transferred to the publishers of "Teen,"
and unspecified monetary compensation, including any profits the defendants made
from using the name.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit also cites trademark law, which has generally persuaded judges
in Web site disputes to side with the holder.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our client owns the trademark in Teen magazine, and is going to do
everything it can to protect its rights in Teen magazine, especially in this
case where the defendants have taken the name ... and linked it to a pornography
site," Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
	   Teen, published since 1957, claims 2 million monthly subscribers with an
average age of 15, Lehmkuhl said.
</P>
<P>
	   The current paper edition features articles on "The Ultimate Crush List" and
"87 Hot Hair and Makeup Tips," while visitors to the Web site could click on
"Dumped? How to deal," and "Weather proof your hair."
</P>
<P>
	   In a cybersquatting case in 1998, a federal judge in Newark ruled that a New
Jersey man can criticize the Jews for Jesus group on the Internet, but he cannot
use the group's name as part of his Web site's address.
</P>
<P>
	   That followed a similar ruling in 1997, when a federal judge in New York
barred an anti-abortionist from using Planned Parenthood's name on his Internet
site.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 269 Nasdaq Up 155  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory
today after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit
warning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite, which
tumbled earlier this week, recorded its best day in history.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30 to close at 11,522.56, topping
its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally, which was fueled by consumer
goods stocks, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble.
</P>
<P>
	   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index soared 155.45 to 3,882.58 after
plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions.
Other broad-market indicators also posted sizable gains.
</P>
<P>
	   The sharpness of the rally perplexed some analysts, who believed the selloff
that began on Tuesday would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   "We viewed the selling all week as being healthy for the market," said
Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management.
"Is that over? Probably not."
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, investors today proved their reluctance to stay out of a market
that richly rewarded them in 1999. The Nasdaq ended a three-day bout of
profit-taking despite news of weakness from Lucent Technologies, a leading
telecommunications equipment maker.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucent said late Thursday it won't meet most profit forecasts for the final
quarter of 1999. On record-breaking volume, Lucent plunged well below its
Thursday close on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a sign of extraordinary resilience, investors used Lucent's troubles
as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic
equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not an industry issue," said Alex M. Cena, an analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent, but said its woes
were due to specific problems at the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Nortel Networks, Cisco Systems, Ciena and and JDS Uniphase all rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks dodged another potential problem today: the latest sign that the
nation's labor market remains strong.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the start of trading, the government reported the nation's
unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade low of 4.1 percent in December
as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since
July. Economists fear that the low jobless rate will force employers to pay
higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate.
</P>
<P>
	   While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, the Federal
Reserve has already bumped up interest rates three times in less than a year to
slow the economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists believe the
Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting, possibly hurting
company profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, many of today's strongest issues were companies that make products
that consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop. Procter &AMP; Gamble
surged. Also, Coca-Cola, Merck and Johnson &AMP; Johnson contributed to the Dow's
new record.
</P>
<P>
	   Those companies, considered cyclical stocks, have thrived this week as
investors took profits from a big run in technology shares at the end of 1999.
But their resurgence may be short-lived, argued Gannon.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the leadership in this market is going to change
dramatically," he said. "At the end of 2000, we'll look back and see that the
dominant players remained telecom and technology."

<HEADLINE> French Soprano Debuts as Butterfly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    An AP Arts and Entertainment Review
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sylvie Valayre made her Metropolitan Opera debut in the
title role of "Madama Butterfly," touchingly conveying emotions though her voice
is not supremely sweet.
</P>
<P>
	   The slim French soprano used vibrato to add vocal texture to her role as a
young Japanese woman deeply in love. She sank to her knees often and as
naturally as though she'd done it all her life. Applause for her was lavish.
</P>
<P>
	   Valayre, who is from Paris, has sung the role in San Francisco and Naples.
She made her La Scala debut in 1996 in "La Gioconda."
</P>
<P>
	   Conductor Marcello Viotti also made his debut, shaping the Puccini music
with care. Viotti was born in Switzerland to Italian parents, lives in France
and is a guest conductor at European opera houses and principal conductor of the
Bavarian Radio Orchestra in Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Vladimir Galouzine sang Pinkerton. His was not the portrayal of a man too
young to realize what he's doing. His Pinkerton acts confident that it is his
right as an American Navy lieutenant to marry a Japanese woman, then leave her
and have a "real" marriage at home. Galouzine's singing, straightforward, loud
and without nuances, complements the portrayal, though musically it's
uninteresting.
</P>
<P>
	   William Shimell sang the American consul. His warning advice to Pinkerton
that Butterfly trusts him and he should be careful with her came across as
unusually tentative and wimpy, as it bounced off Pinkerton's strong confidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernard Fitch ably sang Goro, the marriage broker. When he sings something
not terribly important, early in Act 1, his music is beautiful, reaching heights
that some operas do not at their best moments.
</P>
<P>
	   Suddenly one realizes why "Madama Butterfly" is such a popular opera.
Between its big numbers -- such as the love duet which ends Act 1 and
Butterfly's "Un bel di" -- the connecting music is one beautiful melody after
another.
</P>
<P>
	   Jane Bunnell sang Suzuki, Butterfly's devoted maid, with compassion and
devotion in her voice. Their voices blended admirably. James Courtney as
Butterfly's uncle was frightening, arriving just after the wedding and singing
his denunciation of the bride.
</P>
<P>
	   Baritone Richard Hobson sounded stalwart in his Met debut in the small part
of the rich man who wants to marry the deserted Butterfly. Marie Zifchak's part,
Pinkerton's American wife, is so small her voice couldn't be judged. However, a
director put her unnecessarily close to Butterfly when the latter is beginning
to realize what Pinkerton has done.
</P>
<P>
	   This cast will sing the opera four more times. "Butterfly" will be broadcast
live on Feb. 26, with a different cast.

<HEADLINE> Life Cereal To Revive Mikey Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- "Mikey" is coming back.
</P>
<P>
	   The finicky kid who wouldn't eat his breakfast -- unless it was Life cereal
-- is returning to television, but this time as a grownup.
</P>
<P>
	   The rejiggered reprise of one of TV's most famous advertising campaigns
represents the latest move by the ad industry to bring back its past icons. In
recent months, viewers have become reacquainted with the Green Giant, Charmin's
Mr. Whipple, StarKist's Charlie the Tuna and others.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mikey ad campaign is being relaunched more than a quarter-century after
its debut with an all-adult cast as an appeal to the baby boomers' bent for
nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
	   The lines are the same, the shtick is the same and so is the product. Only
the actors playing Mikey and his breakfast mates are new.
</P>
<P>
	   Quaker Oats Co., which makes Life, hopes the new Mikey can work some old
magic on a product now facing fiercer-than-ever competition from endless rows of
cereals lining supermarket shelves.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Mikey ad has the kind of charm that bridges across time," says Gary
Rosenbaum, creative director of ad agency Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding, which
resurrected Mikey.
</P>
<P>
	   The original Mikey ad was "the best kid commercial ever," said David Lubars,
president of the Fallon, McElligott ad agency in Minneapolis, who has no
connection to either ad. "It was a combination of a good idea and because the
kid was so likable," he said. "There's something magic about it. You can't plan
for that."
</P>
<P>
	   The commercial is to be launched Jan. 17 and run through June.
</P>
<P>
	   In the original ad, which aired from 1972-84, two kids share their suspicion
of a cereal that's "sposed ta be good for ya." They decide to test it out on
Mikey, because "he hates everything."
</P>
<P>
	   But pudgy-faced Mikey, who never utters a word, takes to it, prompting the
famous lines: "He likes it! Hey, Mikey!"
</P>
<P>
	   The ad agency heeded research, which found that 70 percent of adults could
identify the Life cereal ad from just a brief description. The ad placed No. 10
in TV Guide's list of "The 50 Greatest Commercials of All Time."
</P>
<P>
	   So why not bring back a freckled 3-year-old, like the one who filmed the
spot with his two brothers in 1971?
</P>
<P>
	   Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding executives say they wanted to add a twist. They
selected a handsome Mikey in his 20s -- New York-based actor Jimmy Starace --
who eats Life as he sits reading his morning newspaper, alongside a man and
woman. In the spirit of the original, all three act like kids.
</P>
<P>
	   The original Mikey was assured by Quaker that he would remain anonymous in
publicity associated with the campaign's return. But icons, even former ones,
find it hard to escape the media.
</P>
<P>
	   Tracked down at New York radio station WKTU where he works as an advertising
account manager, John Gilchrist, now 31, said he remains under contract to
Quaker and couldn't say much.
</P>
<P>
	   "It never ends, it seems," he said of Americans' fascination with the
character.
</P>
<P>
	   Hey Mikey -- what about a reprise of that role?
</P>
<P>
	   "That would be nice. ... Hopefully you'll see me again."
</P>
<P>
	   It's unlikely the commercial will give Life back the lofty share of the
cereal business it once claimed. Quaker sold some $78 million worth of Life last
year, a respectable showing, and sales have grown in recent years. But cereals
proliferated in the 1990s, leaving Life a much smaller slice of an $8 billion
industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes the best ideas are not the newest ideas," John McMillin, a food
industry analyst for Prudential Securities, said of the ad. "But I don't think
they can go to the well too many times with this."
</P>
<P>
	   Could Mikey help bring back the good old days for Life?
</P>
<P>
	   "If they can get Michael Jordan, maybe," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow At New High; Nasdaq Up 155  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory
today after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit
warning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite, which
tumbled earlier this week, recorded its best day in history.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30 to close at 11,522.56, topping
its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally, which was fueled by consumer
goods stocks, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble.
</P>
<P>
	   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index soared 155.45 to 3,882.58 after
plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions.
Other broad-market indicators also posted sizable gains.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 38.02 to 1,441.47.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 2,263 up, 864 down and 420 unchanged. On the Nasdaq Stock
Market, five stocks rose for every three that fell.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.21 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.08 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 12.97 to 488.31.
</P>
<P>
	   The sharpness of the rally perplexed some analysts, who believed the selloff
that began on Tuesday would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   "We viewed the selling all week as being healthy for the market," said
Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management.
"Is that over? Probably not."
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, investors today proved their reluctance to stay out of a market
that richly rewarded them in 1999. The Nasdaq ended a three-day bout of
profit-taking despite news of weakness from Lucent Technologies, a leading
telecommunications equipment maker.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucent said late Thursday it won't meet most profit forecasts for the final
quarter of 1999. On record-breaking volume, Lucent plunged well below its
Thursday close on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a sign of extraordinary resilience, investors used Lucent's troubles
as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic
equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not an industry issue," said Alex M. Cena, an analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent, but said its woes

<HEADLINE> New Mudslides Feared in Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Incessant rains in Venezuela could cause new
flooding and landslides, a top weather official said Friday, raising the
possibility of a repeat of the disaster that killed thousands of people last
month.
</P>
<P>
	   Air Force meteorology director Jose Pereira said the rains are causing a
``high risk'' situation on Avila, the mountain ridge that separates the capital
of Caracas from the Caribbean Sea. Landslides along the Avila on Dec. 15 killed
as many as 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Pereira said forecasters are predicting continued rains in the region,
``increasing the possibility of new mudslides.''
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, he said, there are light rains in the area. He warned residents
to be ready to move quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   The threat of landslides is especially acute in the state of Vargas, the
coastal zone hardest hit in December. The region has received 10 times the
normal rainfall.
</P>
<P>
	   Pereira said Mount Avila is now so saturated that if there is another heavy
rain, ``the consequences could be terrible.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Bankruptcy Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Friday to clarify how difficult
it should be for states to collect money from bankrupt debtors who owe back
taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   An Illinois dispute over sales taxes owed on a $12 million jet centers on
the narrow and arcane issue of who carries the ``burden of proof'' in certain
bankruptcy cases. But the real-world consequences are considerable, and spurred
nine other states to urge the court to resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   William J. Stoecker was president and sole director of Chandler Enterprises
Inc. when in 1988 the corporation bought a Falcon 50 airplane from an
out-of-state seller.
</P>
<P>
	   After Stoecker obtained a legal opinion that the purchase was exempt from
Illinois tax, Chandler Enterprises did not file any tax return on it.
</P>
<P>
	   The corporation also failed to register the plane with the Illinois
Department of Aviation, so it was years later that state officials decided
Chandler owed more than $900,000 in taxes and interest. By that time, Chandler
Enterprises had ceased to exist and Stoecker had filed for federal bankruptcy
protection.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials sought to a collect a penalty from the bankruptcy trustee
for Stoecker's estate, but a federal judge ruled that the trustee could not be
forced to pay.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said the government had the burden of proving that Stoecker, as a
``responsible officer'' of Chandler Enterprises, had willfully failed to pay the
tax.
</P>
<P>
	   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling, saying the
burden of proof was on Stoecker to prove he did not willfully avoid paying the
sales tax.
</P>
<P>
	   Stoecker' bankruptcy trustee then sought the Supreme Court's help.
</P>
<P>
	   In a friend-of-the-court brief, nine other states told the justices that the
7th Circuit court was correct but that the Supreme Court should definitively say
so to resolve conflicting rulings in lower courts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The current split of authority could wreak havoc on state tax
administration and promote forum shopping in tax cases,'' the court was told by
lawyers for California, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Oregon, South Dakota and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision is expected by late June.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Raleigh vs. Illinois, 99-387.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Are estate rights granted before birth?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - A judge will decide if a fetus has the right to
share in the estate of a dead man believed to be the father.
<P>
	   That man, Keith Bosch, 31, died Dec. 27 from third-degree burns he suffered
in an electrical explosion in Erie County. An attorney said he seeks a civil
suit in the death which could result in a large award or settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The expectant mother lived with Bosch for two years before his death. On
Thursday, her attorney, Robert Boreanaz, said he will offer court motions to
protect the rights of the fetus. The birth is expected in six months.
</P>
<P>
	   But John F. Maxwell, an attorney representing the mothers of two of Bosch's
other children, is expected to argue that the fetus does not gain rights to an
estate until birth.
</P>
<P>
	   Maxwell added that the father must be identified through DNA and blood
testing, which can only happen after birth.
</P>
<P>
	   Erie County Surrogate Judge Joseph S. Mattina said the decision may hinge on
Roe vs. Wade in which the Supreme Court ruled that "a fetus is not a person . .
. (and) does not have a legal personality or identity until it sees the light of
day."
</P>
<P>
	   If Mattina follows that ruling, the future well-being of the fetus could be
decided by the guardians and attorneys who represent Bosch's two other children.
</P>
<P>
	   Maxwell told Mattina that he would be seeking a "substantial claim ... for
the wrongful death" of Bosch.
</P>
<P>
	   The two mothers he is representing are asking the court to appoint Bosch's
father, Roger Bosch, as administrator of his son's estate and themselves as
co-administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   But Boreanaz countered that because the expectant mother had been living
with Bosch for two years prior to his death, she should be named guardian for
the fetus and co-administrator of the estate.
</P>
<P>
	   Tissue and blood samples from Bosch have been preserved for DNA tests.

<HEADLINE> Heart Transplant Raises Questions  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- A 79-year-old Canadian has a new heart, and his operation
has kindled a debate on transplant surgery ethics.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray Nelson received the heart from a 55-year-old donor whose organ normally
would have been rejected because of its advanced age. And Nelson himself was 14
years older than what had previously been considered the maximum age for a
transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dec. 27 transplant has provoked a debate in Canada, where fewer than 200
heart transplants are performed each year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One has to wonder whether or not the process was being manipulated to
provide some advantage to someone who otherwise might not be eligible,'' said
Dr. Douglas Kinsella, a lecturer on medical ethics at the University of Calgary.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson, a director of the Alberta Treasury Branches, a government-owned
financial institution, is well-known in provincial business and political
circles. He is also a friend of Dr. Dennis Modry, an Edmonton heart transplant
specialist.
</P>
<P>
	   Complications after a bypass operation last year forced Nelson, an active
man who used to swim at least 50 laps a day, to be hospitalized in September.
Ten days after his transplant at the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton,
he was sitting up and talking.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Arvind Koshal, regional director of the hospital's cardiac science
program, acknowledged the committee of cardiologists, social workers and others
that approved the transplant took unusual steps.
</P>
<P>
	   While 65 had been considered the maximum age for a transplant, that was
never ``carved in stone,'' Koshal said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the transplant committee asked the hospital's ethics board for
guidance in Nelson's case. The ethics board said that while age alone should not
be the determining factor, it also noted that patients needing hearts far exceed
the number of donor organs available. As many as 6,000 Canadians are considered
possible candidates for a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   After ``rigorous debate,'' Koshal said, the transplant committee voted in a
secret ballot to permit a transplant, but only if Nelson received a heart that
would otherwise go unused.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearts from donors older than 50 normally get used only for ``status four''
patients, meaning emergency cases in which ``somebody is going to die
otherwise,'' Koshal said.
</P>
<P>
	   When the heart of a 55-year-old brain dead patient became available, he
said, no emergency cases were pending. Two independent cardiologists on the
transplant committee decided the heart was not appropriate for others on the
eligibility list, so Nelson got it, Koshal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Glenn Griener of the University of Alberta's John Dossetor Health Ethics
Center questioned whether giving Nelson the heart ``amounts to substandard
medical care.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I haven't seen a coherent rationale for using this organ,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kinsella said the transplant committee's lengthy review was unusual and
seemed intended to counter any accusations that Nelson ``jumped the queue'' for
a transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   To Koshal, the decision hinged on whether cardiac patients younger than
Nelson could wait for ``a better heart.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not that we're giving him (Nelson) a bad heart,'' Koshal said. ``It's
that we're giving him one better than what he had and would give him a better
quality of life.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal budget surpluses for the next decade could be up
to $800 billion larger than last year's $3 trillion estimate, auguring an
election-year fight over whether the huge kitty should be used for tax cuts,
spending or debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic and Republican budget analysts say at the very least, new
official projections will equal that earlier estimate, no small feat considering
last year's spending splurge by lawmakers that ate well into those surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   The hardy economy has continued generating unanticipated piles of federal
revenue, more than offsetting the extra spending, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A surging economy is bailing out Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress
... outpacing even Congress' and Clinton's spending inclinations,'' said Stephen
Moore, fiscal policy director for the conservative-leaning Cato Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   Depending on what assumptions are made about spending, the new estimates --
one by the Congressional Budget Office, the other by the White House Office of
Management and Budget -- may exceed last year's by hundreds of billions of
dollars, said the Capitol Hill aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO and White House officials declined to discuss their numbers. CBO will
release its new projections later this month, the White House on Feb. 7, when
President Clinton presents his budget for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The new estimates will cover the fiscal years 2001 through 2010. Last year's
projections were for the 10 years beginning with 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   For the short run, analysts say the estimates will show a budget surplus,
excluding Social Security, of perhaps $10 billion to $20 billion for this year,
and perhaps up to $60 billion for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Those numbers are important because they would let Republicans claim they
honored last year's promise to not use Social Security money to pay for other
programs. That pledge -- which President Clinton also embraced -- seemed in
jeopardy when lawmakers approved tens of billions in extra spending, threatening
to eat into Social Security's surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures also mean there would be plenty of resources for the tax cuts
Republicans want and the extra spending Democrats prefer for fiscal 2001.
Congress will begin working on tax and spending legislation for 2001 when it
returns to work Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   With both parties trying to create distinctions between themselves that
voters will remember on Election Day, bipartisan agreement on major tax or
spending issues seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the projected surpluses should be so big that some of the money
could be used for tax cuts or new spending for Medicare, defense and other
programs, and still leave huge sums that can be apportioned later. In the
meantime, any unused surplus money would automatically reduce the $5.8 trillion
national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most of the largesse is off in the future, and political gridlock will
ensure those resources are available for the next president and the 107th
Congress,'' said Robert Reischauer, a former CBO director who is now a senior
fellow at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the $3 trillion surplus projected last year, $2 trillion was to come from
Social Security, money that both parties consider politically untouchable for
spending for other programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The remaining $1 trillion in black ink was to come from the rest of the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The size of the projected surplus is growing chiefly because, for yet
another year, the unexpectedly strong economy is producing more federal revenue
than anticipated. In addition, spending for programs including Medicare has been
less than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   The size of the new surplus projections will also depend on whether the
estimates assume that spending limits enacted in 1997 will be obeyed this year.
Assuming the limits will be heeded would produce 10-year surplus estimates that
would well exceed $3 trillion, leaving more money for potential tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers, however, have ignored those limits the last two years,
outspending them by tens of billions of dollars. They seem certain to do the
same this coming year with its campaign-generated spending pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans are split over whether to obey those limits. House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., refused to say if they would when asked about it
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides expect White House budget writers to base their surplus forecasts on
an assumption that the spending limits will be breached.
</P>
<P>
	   The precise size of this year's surplus will be known right before the
November elections, when final data on revenue and spending is tallied.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chats With Mrs. Barak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton popped into a luncheonette
Friday for a cup of coffee and a chat with the wife of Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   Nava Barak had cappuccino while the president had coffee with no sugar as
they chatted in the Pharmacy, a downtown Shepherdstown establishment known for
its lunch counter and good ice cream.
</P>
<P>
	   Reporters said the conversation was partly about the Clinton family's move
to Chappaqua, N.Y. The president spent time this week with his wife, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, unpacking belongings in their new home.
</P>
<P>
	   The move is to give Mrs. Clinton a New York base for her expected campaign
this year for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   The Baraks are in Shepherdstown for U.S.-sponsored Israeli-Syrian peace
talks.

<HEADLINE> New York a magnet for out-of-staters with high political hopes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Give me your tired, your poor ... your politically
ambitious.
<P>
	   Long a lure for immigrants, New York is showing it is also still a magnet
for out-of-staters who have their eye on elected office.
</P>
<P>
	   On the same day that Hillary Rodham Clinton moved into her new Westchester
County home to set down New York roots to run for the U.S. Senate, former
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld unpacked his bags in Manhattan with thoughts on
a possible run for the New York statehouse in 2006.
</P>
<P>
	   Now there's talk that Sen. Bob Kerrey, often mentioned as a Democratic
presidential contender, might accept a job as head of Manhattan's New School
University. That means that if the Nebraska Democrat and former Navy SEAL did
someday mount another run for the White House it could be from the Empire State.
</P>
<P>
	   What's going on?
</P>
<P>
	   "We always lay out the welcome mat in New York. The more the merrier," said
Maurice Carroll, a pollster with Quinnipiac College Polling Institute, which
does some carpetbagging of its own. Despite being based in Hamden, Conn., many
of its polls are on the hot political races in neighboring New York.
</P>
<P>
	   New York does, after all, have a rich heritage of electing outsiders.
</P>
<P>
	   The most noteworthy example is Robert F. Kennedy. Despite the Kennedy name
being virtually synonymous with Massachusetts, he ran for and won a Senate seat
in New York in 1964.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York has a reputation as enough of a cosmopolitan place that you don't
have to have spend your whole life here to develop the political credentials to
win office," said Michael Knox Beran, who wrote "The Last Patrician: Bobby
Kennedy and the End of American Aristocracy."
</P>
<P>
	   More proof was that after Kennedy, James Buckley, of Connecticut,
represented New York in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   One of New York's first senators, Rufus King, hailed from Massachusetts and
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the man Mrs. Clinton wants to replace, grew up in
New York City's Hell's Kitchen but also spent significant time in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   The trail from Boston to New York has also been famously traveled by
baseball greats Babe Ruth, Wade Boggs and Roger Clemens, noted Marist College
pollster Lee Miringoff.
</P>
<P>
	   "That raises the key question for Weld of course," Miringoff joked. "Is he a
Yankee or a Red Sox fan? The answer to that question will determine his
acceptability."
</P>
<P>
	   Weld is not known as a particularly avid baseball fan, preferring to play
squash a few times a week.
</P>
<P>
	   But for a primer on the politics of baseball, just ask Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   She invited a firestorm of skepticism when she tugged on a Yankees cap at
the White House earlier this year and declared she had always been a fan of the
Bronx Bombers. Mrs. Clinton, who rooted for the Chicago Cubs during her
childhood in Illinois, later had to explain that the Cubs had been her National
League favorite while she had adopted the Yankees as her American League team.
</P>
<P>
	   That explanation left some diehard Yankees fans, like her most likely Senate
race rival New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
	   Weld did not return a phone call seeking comment Friday. But in an earlier
interview the moderate Republican said he'd be "hard to stop" if he did decide
to add the title New York governor to his resume. Unlike Mrs. Clinton, who has
never lived or worked in New York, Weld grew up on Long Island and has a
vacation home in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
	   To satisfy New York's residency requirements, Weld must live in New York for
five years before running for governor. For now he's busy buying and selling
companies as a managing partner at McDermott, Will &AMP; Emery's New York office.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton must only be living in New York by election day to run for the
Senate to satisfy residency requirements. She moved into her Chappaqua home this
week to deflect carpetbagging charges.

<HEADLINE> Judge allows case to proceed; more layoffs planned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANCHESTER, Conn. (AP) - A federal judge has refused to dismiss a union
lawsuit trying to block Pratt &AMP; Whitney's restructuring plan, and will hear the
case next week.
<P>
	   The Machinists Union workers contend Pratt's plan to shift work among plants
violates their contract with the company.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Janet C. Hall in Bridgeport on Thursday rejected a
request from the company that the case be dismissed. The company had argued that
she did not have jurisdiction to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Machinists official James Parent said Hall has promised the union's lawyers
that she will make a decision relatively quickly after next week's trial.
</P>
<P>
	   That's important, Parent said, because a six-month notification period
required by the union's contract ends Feb. 16, and the company could go ahead
with its plans at that point.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once the work is moved out of Connecticut, it's really hard to change
that," Parent said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt plans to reduce the work force at its North Haven plant from 2,700 to
about 100.
</P>
<P>
	   About 970 of the jobs would be moved to Pratt's East Hartford plant, while
some 200 overhaul and repair jobs would be transferred from North Haven to Pratt
plants in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. More than 300 other such jobs now done
in Connecticut would also be shifted, and there would be an unspecified number
of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt spokesman Mark Sullivan expressed confidence about the legal
situation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We maintain firmly that we have lived up to all our obligations to the
Machinists, and we believe very strongly that we will prevail at trial," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Pratt President Louis Chenevert told the Connecticut Business and
Industry Association's annual economic conference Thursday that the downturn in
the aerospace industry continues to hurt the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our airline customers today are struggling to make a profit," Chenevert
said, saying demand for large airplanes is only half of 1998's level of 1,200
orders.
</P>
<P>
	   Additional layoffs may be needed, but it's too early to tell how many,
Chenevert said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will have to adjust, based on the volume reduction that we're seeing in
2000," he said.

<HEADLINE> Administration Files Nuclear Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration sent its blueprint for a new
nuclear weapons agency to Congress on Friday and said the Energy Department is
committed to completing the reorganization by March.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress created the new National Nuclear Security Administration last year
in response to concerns about alleged Chinese espionage and lax security at the
Energy Department's nuclear weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Republicans have questioned whether the administration would move
promptly on the reorganization, which by law is required to be completed by
March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are committed to implementing the (new agency) and ensuring that the
national security mission of the department is met,'' Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said Friday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The implementation plan calls for the department's nuclear weapons programs
-- including weapons work at the Lawrence Livermore, Sandia and Los Alamos
research labs -- to be consolidated under a single agency within the department.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional supporters of the reorganization said the agency should be
largely autonomous, although still under the energy secretary. They argued that
clear lines of authority would improve security and safeguard against potential
espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the reorganization plan will continue to allow the energy secretary
and key senior DOE officials a say in the agency's operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan requires that positions responsible for security,
counterintelligence, legal affairs and environmental and health protection be
held by officials who have those responsibilities within the overall department.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, a leading sponsor of the legislation creating
the new agency, accused Richardson of ``attempting to shoehorn'' the DOE
bureaucracy into the new agency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The department is clearly resisting one of the most fundamental elements
of the reform plan'' to establish a nuclear weapons program ``distinct and
separate from the Energy Department,'' Thornberry said.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been concern among critics of the reorganization, including
Richardson, that as crafted by Congress the agency would become a powerful
fiefdom unaccountable to the rest of the department.
</P>
<P>
	   These concerns have been eased under the DOE plan, said Sen. Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The plan complies with the letter and spirit of the law, protects public
health and safety and protects the important national programs and resources of
the (weapons) laboratories,'' said Bingaman in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Bingaman and others also had been concerned that civilian research at Los
Alamos and Sandia in New Mexico, as well as Lawrence Livermore in California,
might be jeopardized once the labs were absorbed within the new agency. But the
reorganization stipulates that the labs be allowed to continue to perform
scientific research for non-defense programs.

<HEADLINE> Floor Brokers Sentenced for Scam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge Friday blamed greed for the corruption of New York
Stock Exchange floor brokers as he ordered prison terms or home detention for
four of them snared in the first prosecution of its kind.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff handed the stiffest sentence to the head
of Oakford Corp., which helped the brokers to trade illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   William Killeen, crying so much that he had to hand his statement to his
lawyer to be read out loud, was sentenced to serve 20 months in prison for his
part in the scam engineered in part through Oakford.
</P>
<P>
	   Killeen, 40, of Colts Neck, N.J., was president of the now defunct company
that engaged in a securities conspiracy by allowing floor brokers to execute
personal trades ahead of orders from their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Floor brokers are paid a commission to conduct trades for client brokerages
and their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   They are not permitted to make trades for themselves or for any account in
which they have an interest because their positions on the floor can provide
them with immediate access to market-moving news, giving them an unfair
advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Rakoff also fined Killeen $50,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this year, Killeen had admitted engaging in a securities conspiracy
and evading taxes by kicking back commissions to Oakford customers by paying
their personal expenses, including beach club dues and rent on apartments.
</P>
<P>
	   Killeen said he was "extremely sorry," adding, "It is with great regret that
I stand here today.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said Killeen's honorable dedication to his family and his
community conflicted with his business life in which he and others engaged in "a
series of blatantly unlawful acts motivated by greed."
</P>
<P>
	   Killeen's sentencing was one of six to occur throughout the day, four of
them floor brokers.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge rejected arguments by lawyers that the brokers should not face
prison terms because they were not properly informed by the NYSE that what they
were doing was a crime. The prosecution is believed to be the first case to
result from illegal personal trades made by floor brokers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It involved not only intentional violations of the rules but the making of
false statements and the making of false records," the judge said. "It was done
out of greed."
</P>
<P>
	   John Savarese, 41, and Mark Savarese, 37, both of Garden City, Edward
Mueger, 64, of Port Washington and Thomas Cavallino, 42, of Shrewsbury, N.J. had
all pleaded guilty earlier this year to unlawfully exercising investment
discretion by entering into on-floor purchases and sales of securities without
proper customer orders.
</P>
<P>
	   The Savarese brothers, both floor brokers, were each sentenced to four
months in prison to be followed by two months of home detention. Both were fined
$15,000 as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Mueger was sentenced to three months in prison and three months of home
confinement. He was also fined $15,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Cavallino was sentenced to six months of home confinement and fined
$100,000. The judge spared Cavallino a prison term but increased his fine to
make up for it after listening to pleas that he be left at home to care for his
son.
</P>
<P>
	   A sixth defendant remained to be sentenced late Friday.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Steady at 4.1 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A burst of hiring at department stores and construction
companies helped keep the nation's unemployment rate at a 30-year low of 4.1
percent in December, marking a strong finish for a year in which Americans
enjoyed the best labor market since the Vietnam War. Wall Street reached record
highs.
</P>
<P>
	   Employers added 315,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, the largest gain
since July. Big increases came at department stores, enjoying their best holiday
sales season in seven years, and construction companies, basking in a building
boom brought on by warmer-than-usual weather.
</P>
<P>
	   "The century ended on a high note for workers," said First Union chief
economist David Orr. He noted that the gain in payroll jobs was far above the
240,000 increase many economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
	   December's jobless rate of 4.1 percent matched the year's low reached in
November. That level is better than any since unemployment stood at 3.9 percent
in January 1970, the Labor Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the unemployment rate averaged 4.2 percent, the best since
a 3.5 percent jobless average in 1969. In 1998, the unemployment rate averaged
4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "The opportunities for employment and for upgrading jobs in 1999 were the
best workers have seen in 30 years," said Ken Mayland, chief economist for
KeyCorp.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong economic growth is keeping unemployment down to levels most workers
haven't seen since they took their first jobs, economists said. And that's
helping workers who historically have had a harder time finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton hailed 1999's performance for producing "the lowest annual
unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics ever recorded." The
annual average unemployment rate for blacks in 1999 was 8 percent and for
Hispanics 6.4 percent, Labor Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, employers boosted jobs and wages by bigger-than-expected
amounts, which caused economists to worry that strong job and wage growth could
trigger inflation down the road.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're creating jobs faster than workers, and the Fed is right that this
can't go on forever," said Bill Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's jobless report adds to the likelihood that Federal Reserve
policy-makers will raise interest rates, by at least a quarter of a point, at
their next meeting in February, many economists said. The central bank bumped up
interest rates three times last year to slow the economy and keep inflation at
bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch's chief economist Bruce Steinberg said the
stronger-than-expected 315,000 jobs created in December "all but guarantees the
Fed will tighten monetary policy on Feb. 2."
</P>
<P>
	   Stock investors brushed off inflation fears raised in the report. The Dow
Jones industrial average posted a record, gaining 269.30 points to close at
11,522.56. That wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. The
Nasdaq index, which also fell earlier this week, reported its largest points
gain in history, soaring 155.45 points to 3,882.58 in preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
	   But bond prices fell as the yields on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bonds
climbed to 6.57 percent from 6.55 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   December's 315,000 additional payroll jobs followed a gain of 222,000 in
November. Department stores hired 34,000 people last month, their first increase
since April. Construction companies added 16,000 jobs, while engineering and
management firms hired a larger-than-normal 23,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Payrolls grew briskly in other industries as well. Bars and restaurants
hired 27,000 workers; health-care providers added 16,000, an above-average gain;
and financial services, including insurance and real-estate, added 12,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   But manufacturers lost 1,000 jobs in December, bringing their total job loss
for 1999 to 248,000. The manufacturing job loss has slowed in recent months as
U.S. exporters began to see a revival in foreign demand from countries
recovering from the global currency crisis of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, employers added 2.7 million jobs, compared with 2.9 million
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, grew
by 0.4 percent to $13.46 in December, the biggest jump in three months. That
followed a tiny 0.1 percent rise in November.
</P>
<P>
	   While strong wage and job growth are good developments for workers,
economists and members of the Federal Reserve worry that the combination could
eventually trigger inflation. Their shared fear: that employers trying to
attract scarce workers to fill job openings will lure them with higher wages and
benefits -- increased costs that could drive up consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
	   A separate report showed that Americans borrowed $15.6 billion more in
November than in October, the largest monthly increase in consumer debt in four
years, the Federal Reserve said. Consumer credit outstanding, excluding mortgage
debt, advanced at an annual rate of 13.7 percent led by strong demand for loans
for a wide array of goods including automobiles, boats, education, vacations.

<HEADLINE> Molinari: McCain on NY primary ballots in 25 CD districts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Sen. John McCain will qualify delegate slates for
New York's March 7 presidential primary in 25 of the state's 31 congressional
districts, the head of the Arizona Republican's New York campaign said Friday.
<P>
	   While that falls short of McCain's goal of getting on the ballot all across
the state through the petition process, it would allow him the opportunity to
give the GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, something of a contest in
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel very pleased," Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, head of
McCain's New York effort, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said that "to have gathered almost 30,000 signatures with very little
resources and without the help of the Republican establishment is simply
astonishing." He also said the fact that he could not get on the ballot
everywhere in the state through petitions, "underscores the unfairness of the
state's Byzantine Republican election laws."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's all-volunteer New York team was working against a midnight Thursday
deadline for mailing petitions to various election boards across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari called the results a major accomplishment given the state's
notoriously difficult ballot access rules and the support for Bush from New York
Gov. George Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and millionaire publisher Steve Forbes filed petitions with the state
Board of Elections on Monday they said qualified them for the ballot all across
the state. Bush, Forbes and McCain are the only Republicans contesting New
York's March 7 GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore, Bill Bradley and Lyndon LaRouche have filed petitions they say
qualify them all across New York for the March 7 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Board of Elections, after considering challenges to any of the
petitions, plans to certify the Democratic and Republican primary ballots Jan.
31.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to have his delegate slates
placed on the ballot throughout the state. Molinari said he expects that lawsuit
to be heard later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Molinari said the congressional districts where McCain forces may
not have been able to collect sufficient signatures from party members to get
delegate slates on the primary ballot are in the lower Hudson Valley and across
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
	   They identified the districts as the 18th (represented by Rep. Nita Lowey),
22nd (represented by Rep. John Sweeney), 24th (represented by Rep. John McHugh),
27th (represented by Rep. Thomas Reynolds) and 30th (represented by Rep. Jack
Quinn).
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari said it was uncertain if enough signatures had been collected by
the midnight deadline in the 26th Congressional District, which is represented
by Rep. Maurice Hinchey.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials soared into record
territory today after investors brushed off signs of inflationary
pressure and a profit warning from Lucent to send stocks sharply
higher. The Nasdaq composite, which tumbled earlier this week,
recorded its best day in history. The Dow rose 269.30 to close at
11,522.56, topping its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The
rally, which was fueled by consumer goods stocks, wiped out the

<HEADLINE> Buddhist's Exile Spotlights Problem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dramatic escape into exile of Tibet's last primary
Buddhist leader was the second incident in two days to show the Chinese
government's persistent problems with organized religion.
</P>
<P>
	   The 14-year-old Karmapa, leader of one of Tibetan Buddhism's four sects,
arrived Wednesday at Dharmsala, India, to meet the Dalai Lama, Tibet's political
ruler in exile.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Catholics aligned with China's communist regime ordained five
new bishops not recognized by Rome on the very day that Pope John Paul II was
conducting his annual elevation of new bishops from around the world. That
timing was interpreted as a snub that dooms, at least for now, Vatican efforts
to normalize the church situation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese regime has also detained thousands of Falun Gong followers since
outlawing the spiritual movement five months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The harrowing flight of the Karmapa across the Himalayas ``reveals the
shambles of China's policy of trying to manage religion,'' says Robert Thurman,
Columbia University professor and friend of the Dalai Lama. ``Their suppression
is not working, and their attempt to pretend to get along with Buddhism doesn't
work, either.''
</P>
<P>
	   John Ackerly, president of the International Campaign for Tibet in
Washington, said the Beijing regime tried to use the Karmapa ``to showcase their
religious freedom policies. It will make it much more embarrassing that he's
been so highly covered by the official media.''
</P>
<P>
	   Thurman said it was essential for the Karmapa to leave so he could receive a
thorough Buddhist education and pass on his tradition, which he said was not
possible under Chinese control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some distinguished teachers still remain behind, but among the leaders of
the major forms of Tibetan Buddhism, all have now felt it necessary to escape in
order to practice their religion,'' said Donald Lopez, professor of Tibetan
studies at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   The only major Buddhist figure who remains in Tibet, said Lopez, is the
Panchen Lama designated by the Chinese government. But he ``has absolutely no
status with the Tibetan people'' because the Dalai Lama has recognized a
different youth whose whereabouts are now unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   China and the Vatican have had no formal relations since 1951, when the
Communist Party kicked out missionaries and forced Catholics to sever ties with
the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese government refuses to accept the pope's authority to appoint and
consecrate bishops worldwide, and has authorized an offical Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
	   By the official church's count, there are 5 million Catholics in China, with
60,000 new members each year. Catholic experts in Hong Kong put the figure at 10
million to 12 million. Many church members, including priests, move between the
official church and an underground church that is loyal to the pope.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas monitoring groups say persecution of underground Catholics persists
in some areas of China, with the detentions of priests and worshippers.

<HEADLINE> Pataki: let welfare families should keep more child support $$s  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Welfare families should keep more of the child
support payments they are getting from parents who are not living under the same
roof, Gov. George Pataki said.
<P>
	   Included in Pataki's 2000-2001 state budget proposal to the Legislature on
Tuesday will be a provision doubling the limit from $50 to $100 in child support
payments that families on welfare can receive.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki will present his sixth budget proposal to the state Legislature in
Albany on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Child advocates praised Pataki Friday for advancing the more generous
pass-through to welfare families, saying that if any families need the extra
money, it's those on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has always been an issue with us for those lucky enough to be getting
child support that they and their children should see the benefits of that
support," said Elie Ward, executive director of Statewide Youth Advocacy. "The
money is supposed to be for the kids."
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of child support that people on welfare can receive is limited so
taxpayers can be reimbursed for the cost of the public benefits their families
are taking in.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Pataki administration reported that about $1 billion child
support payments were made in New York. Of that, about $190 million was
forwarded to the state so state, county and federal taxpayers could be
reimbursed for the cost of welfare payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Ward said that for some families on welfare, getting an extra $50 or $75 a
month could be the difference between their even being on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Christine McKenna, associate director of another youth advocacy group,
SENSES, said increasing the pass through can be an incentive for both the
custodial parent to cooperate in finding the missing parent who is owed child
care and make that missing parent more willing to pay child care.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really frustrating if they are socked for $120 or $150 and their child
is only seeing $50," McKenna said. "It is an incentive for them not to go along
if they don't see their kids actually getting much of the money."
</P>
<P>
	   Other child-related initiatives the governor said would be in his next
budget included:
</P>
<P>
	   -Increasing from 159,000 to 178,000 the number of child care slots available
for the children of working poor families.
</P>
<P>
	   -Increasing the state's child care block grant from $626 million in the
current fiscal year to $711 million in 2000-01. In addition to providing more
day care, the increase would also expand oversight and monitoring of child care
facilities, improve services for the children of migrant workers and provide for
the fingerprinting of all regulated child care providers, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   -Expanding the state's "celebrating fatherhood" campaign to encourage males
to voluntarily take part in their children's lives.
</P>
<P>
	   -Expanding efforts to determine whether parents paying child support have
health care programs which could also cover those children. If the children are
now on welfare, their health care is paid for by taxpayers through the Medicaid
program.

<HEADLINE> More Spending Sought for Farm Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration proposed Friday to almost
double federal spending on farm conservation programs, both to help farmers cope
with depressed commodity prices and to reduce runoff that fouls many of the
nation's rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's 2001 budget would authorize $1.3 billion in new agricultural
conservation spending, including $600 million in payments to farmers who
voluntarily act to prevent erosion on their land. It also would expand the
popular Conservation Reserve Program, which pays producers to take
environmentally sensitive acreage out of production.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have been paying farmers for decades to grow commodities and, in some
cases, not to grow commodities. Now we must start thinking of the land itself as
our most valuable commodity,'' said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agriculture Department predicts that net farm income will drop $7.6
billion this year to $40.4 billion unless Congress steps in this fall with
another large infusion of federal aid. Lawmakers have done that the last two
years, and the administration hopes to steer at least some of the money this
year into conservation programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2001 budget also is expected to include some form of payments to be tied
to decreases in crop prices or farm income but the details have not been
finalized, officials said. The 2001 fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the administration's conservation plan is the new $600
million subsidy program, introduced in Congress last year by Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Payment levels under the ``Conservation Security Program'' would be based on
the scope of farmers' conservation measures. They could include planting grass
along streams and cutting back on livestock grazing.
</P>
<P>
	   An existing program that provides assistance for manure control and a
variety of other conservation measures would be increased from $174 million this
year to $325 million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Other proposals include:
</P>
<P>
	   --Increasing the acreage cap in the Conservation Reserve Program from 3.6
million to 40 million acres. That would allow more than twice as much land to be
enrolled in the program during the 2001 fiscal year as would be permitted under
current law. It is by far USDA's biggest existing conservation program at $1.3
billion -- about $5,000 per farm.
</P>
<P>
	   --Expanding a program that pays farmers to restore wetlands by 210,000 acres
in 2001 and an additional 250,000 acres a year after that. The Wetlands Reserve
Program is currently limited to 975,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore announced the conservation moves in a conference call
with reporters in Iowa, which is holding its presidential nominating caucuses
later this month. Gore said the proposals would provide a ``new source of
welcome income for farmers.''
</P>
<P>
	   They also would soften the blow of tougher environmental regulations that
the administration is considering.
</P>
<P>
	   The Environmental Protection Agency proposed last summer to require states
to submit plans to clean up every waterway that fails to meet water quality
standards. The administration is considering other measures to curb farm runoff
believed responsible for an oxygen-deprived ``dead zone'' in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration's plan ``recognizes that we must put more money into the
hands of landowners if we're going to clean up the nation's remaining polluted
rivers,'' said Scott Faber of American Rivers, a conservation group. ``There is
simply no way politically or logistically that we can regulate every landowner
in America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Farm-state lawmakers may not be as receptive to the plan. The proposals
would provide little immediate relief to farmers, and they would have to spend
some of their own money on conservation to qualify for the aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Grain prices collapsed in 1998 and Congress has provided farmers with $15
billion in consecutive bailouts over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Judge orders Internet porn site to drop Teen magazine's name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - At the request of Teen magazine, a federal judge has
ordered the operators of an Internet pornography site to stop using the
publication's name in its Web address.
<P>
	   "Our magazine is geared to teen girls, and when they find pornography
instead, you can well understand why not only our client would be upset, but our
readers would be upset. It's appalling," Teen magazine lawyer David Jacobs said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine's president, Lynn Lehmkuhl, said staff discovered the
pornography site in the last week of 1999, and soon heard from puzzled girls.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was horrified. It was really hardcore. Not even 'Playboy.' It was really,
really creepy," Lehmkuhl said.
</P>
<P>
	   The operator of the pornography site, Blue Gravity Communications, and its
owner, Thomas Krwawecz III, were temporarily restrained on Thursday from using
the address by U.S. District Judge Joseph E. Irenas.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine's Web address is www.teenmag.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Irenas scheduled a hearing Jan. 14 on whether to impose an injunction
against Blue Gravity. He ruled, however, that Teen was likely to prevail because
it would be "irreparably injured" by the use of its name by another.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue Gravity representatives did not attend the hearing, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
	   Krwawecz, of Pittsgrove, said the address was dormant until it was sold Dec.
9 to a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., company, Cyber Entertainment Network.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that Blue Gravity, of Pennsauken, is still registered as owner of
the address because of delays by the organization that registers the names,
Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
	   At Cyber Entertainment Network, chief executive officer Joe Elkind said
Friday he could not immediately determine if they now owned the address. He said
his company operates 14 adult Web sites, and about 3,000 other sites that lead
to them.
</P>
<P>
	   The pornography Web site could not be reached Friday morning, but was
available later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit filed Thursday for Teen is among the first in the nation to rely
on federal law enacted in November to ban "cybersquatting," the practice of
pre-empting Internet domain names from people or companies with trademark
associations to them.
</P>
<P>
	   Domain names are the addresses that computer users enter to reach a Web
site. They come between "www" and "com," "net" or "org."
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit seeks to have the site transferred to the publishers of "Teen,"
and unspecified monetary compensation, including any profits the defendants made
from using the name.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit also cites trademark law, which has generally persuaded judges
in Web site disputes to side with the holder.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our client owns the trademark in Teen magazine, and is going to do
everything it can to protect its rights in Teen magazine, especially in this
case where the defendants have taken the name ... and linked it to a pornography
site," Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
	   Teen, published since 1957, claims 2 million monthly subscribers with an
average age of 15, Lehmkuhl said.
</P>
<P>
	   The current paper edition features articles on "The Ultimate Crush List" and
"87 Hot Hair and Makeup Tips," while visitors to the Web site could click on
"Dumped? How to deal," and "Weather proof your hair."
</P>
<P>
	   In a cybersquatting case in 1998, a federal judge in Newark ruled that a New
Jersey man can criticize the Jews for Jesus group on the Internet, but he cannot
use the group's name as part of his Web site's address.
</P>
<P>
	   That followed a similar ruling in 1997, when a federal judge in New York
barred an antiabortionist from using Planned Parenthood's name on his Internet
site.

<HEADLINE> Greek Govt Promises Border Security  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) -- The Greek government promised tougher border
security Friday after a truck carrying illegal immigrants crashed, killing six
people and injuring dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
	   About 80 immigrants entered Greece from Turkey in a stolen truck heading
west, police said. The driver apparently lost control of the vehicle near the
northern town of Komotini, about 140 miles northeast of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the truck involved in Friday's crash had been speeding down a
small road to avoid highway inspections. The driver fled and was sought by
police. Survivors told police the driver had been drinking.
</P>
<P>
	   The predawn crash brought to at least 29 the toll of immigrants killed in
similar accidents over the last three months.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior security official reiterated plans to deploy 1,000 additional
border guards at frontier units early this year and said the coast guard will
receive extra equipment. The first 200 guards joined patrols along the Evros
River, which separates Turkey and Greece, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe these measures will limit the wave of illegal immigration,''
Dimitris Efstathiadis, general secretary of Greece's public order ministry, told
state-run NET television.
</P>
<P>
	   Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants from Asia and Eastern Europe attempt
to sneak into Greece each year. Many remain in Greece to find work, while others
attempt to make their way to nearby Italy and other European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say an estimated 15,000 immigrants entered Greece illegally over
the Evros River in 1999, up 10 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   Efstathiadis said Greece hoped to sign an immigration control deal with
rival Turkey later this year, but warned that tougher policing might prompt
people smugglers to use more reckless methods.

<HEADLINE> Oil Futures Fall Sharply  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Oil futures dropped sharply Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange in a
continuing Y2K letdown and amid evidence that world producers are increasing
output.
</P>
<P>
	   Other energy commodities also fell.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, corn prices rose sharply and cocoa rose as a result of
concern over tensions in Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil prices finished the week down $1.20 a barrel in a pullback blamed partly
on a lack of any Y2K-related supply disruptions as the new year began.
</P>
<P>
	   Accelerating the decline in oil prices were reports that production by the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had risen in December,
suggesting compliance with last March's cutback agreement might be waning.
</P>
<P>
	   Light sweet crude oil for February delivery fell 56 cents Friday to $24.22 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   "All things considered, I think prices have held up pretty well," said Bill
O'Grady, an energy analyst for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. "I was afraid
we'd be in the $22-$23 range."
</P>
<P>
	   If OPEC's unity on production limits breaks, world supplies could increase
quickly. But key officials of various producing nations have insisted they will
adhere to quotas until the agreement on production curbs expires in March, and
likely beyond. The production limits were established in an effort to thin out a
one-time glut that sent oil prices spiraling as low as $11.26 a barrel last
February.
</P>
<P>
	   "If OPEC holds things together, I expect we'll see a recovery in prices
later on," perhaps as soon as next week, O'Grady said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on the New York Merc, February heating oil fell 1.53 cents to 64.75
cents a gallon; February unleaded regular gasoline fell 1.79 cents to 66.10
cents a gallon; February natural gas fell 2.3 cents to $2.173 per 1,000 cubic
feet.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, North Sea Brent crude for February delivery fell 53 cents to
$23.09 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn led grains and soybeans sharply higher on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn prices rose for a second straight day on Thursday's news that Brazil
had bought U.S. corn and as corn production estimates were down in Brazil and
Argentina -- bullish developments for U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
	   March corn rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.07 a bushel; March wheat rose 3 1/4 cents
to $2.51 3/4 a bushel; March oats rose  1/2 cent to $1.09 1/2 a bushel; March
soybeans rose 3 1/4 cents to $4.78 3/4 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa prices pushed up an additional $12 to $853 a ton on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange as investors took precautions against any weekend unrest
in Ivory Coast, the world's leading producer. A major opposition party failed to
join forces with the new government and talk increased of army dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
	   The developments come two weeks after a former army chief seized power in
the West African nation.

<HEADLINE> Pataki: let welfare families should keep more child support $$s  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Welfare families should keep more of the child
support payments they are getting from parents who are not living under the same
roof, Gov. George Pataki said.
<P>
	   Included in Pataki's 2000-2001 state budget proposal to the Legislature on
Tuesday will be a provision doubling the limit from $50 to $100 in child support
payments that families on welfare can receive monthly.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki will present his sixth budget proposal to the state Legislature in
Albany on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Child advocates praised Pataki Friday for advancing the more generous
pass-through to welfare families, saying that if any families need the extra
money, it's those on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has always been an issue with us for those lucky enough to be getting
child support that they and their children should see the benefits of that
support," said Elie Ward, executive director of Statewide Youth Advocacy. "The
money is supposed to be for the kids."
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of child support that people on welfare can receive is limited so
taxpayers can be reimbursed for the cost of the public benefits their families
are taking in.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Pataki administration reported that about $1 billion child
support payments were made in New York. Of that, about $190 million was
forwarded to the state so state, county and federal taxpayers could be
reimbursed for the cost of welfare payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Ward said that for some families on welfare, getting an extra $50 or $75 a
month could be the difference between their even being on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Christine McKenna, associate director of another youth advocacy group,
SENSES, said increasing the pass through can be an incentive for both the
custodial parent to cooperate in finding the missing parent who owes child care
and to make that missing parent more willing to pay up.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really frustrating if they are socked for $120 or $150 and their child
is only seeing $50," McKenna said. "It is an incentive for them not to go along
if they don't see their kids actually getting much of the money."
</P>
<P>
	   Other child-related initiatives the governor said would be in his next
budget included:
</P>
<P>
	   -Increasing from 159,000 to 178,000 the number of child care slots available
for the children of working poor families.
</P>
<P>
	   -Increasing the state's child care block grant from $626 million in the
current fiscal year to $711 million in 2000-01. In addition to providing more
day care, the increase would also expand oversight and monitoring of child care
facilities, improve services for the children of migrant workers and provide for
the fingerprinting of all regulated child care providers, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   -Expanding the state's "celebrating fatherhood" campaign to encourage males
to voluntarily take part in their children's lives.
</P>
<P>
	   -Expanding efforts to determine whether parents paying child support have
health care programs which could also cover those children. If the children are
now on welfare, their health care is paid for by taxpayers through the Medicaid
program.

<HEADLINE> FCC Chief Pushes for Interactive TV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission on
Friday delivered an ultimatum to broadcasters and manufacturers struggling to
deliver interactive digital television to consumers: Come up with a solution by
April or face regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   FCC chairman William Kennard, in his clearest statement to date on the
government's role in guiding the future of digital television, chided the
industry for creating bottlenecks that have slowed the rollout of the
crystal-clear television for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech at the giant Consumer Electronics Show, Kennard noted that many
companies were showcasing models of high-definition television -- some at prices
analysts say will prove attractive this year to consumers -- with the promise of
delivering not only programming but exchanging data through Internet connections
and home networks.
</P>
<P>
	   But none of those televisions can be plugged into cable, the medium through
which most Americans still get their programming, because of wrangling over
technology compatibility standards for the various equipment and piracy issues,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your time and our patience are running out,'' Kennard said. ``The
commission has tried to let you solve this problem. We have been goading and
nagging. But so far you have not finished the job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American public will not let the commission wait much longer for you
to agree on standards, and the law gives the commission clear responsibility to
act if you do not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The first high-definition televisions began selling in late 1998, and more
than 100 TV stations reaching 50 percent of the American people now offer the
option of receiving high-quality digital TV signals. But the pictures are eroded
through cable converters to quality not much better than traditional analog TVs,
Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The consumer has to be an informed buyer, with all the technologies out
there,'' said technology consultant William Doolittle. ``But those technologies
are so complicated, most people don't go through that process, and they're
largely driven to buy from the price. But that may give them a product that may
not necessarily be the right product when a standard is produced.''
</P>
<P>
	   To address the problem, the chairman said he had directed to FCC to draft
proposed rules on compatibility standards and would move toward making those
rules law if interactive digital television is not moving forward by April.
</P>
<P>
	   Digital technology lets broadcasters squeeze more video and data into
existing channel space, giving them numerous options. They could use it to
provide high definition TV, which offers sharper pictures then standard digital.
They could also offer additional TV channels for sports or movies, or stock
quotes and other data transmitted to home computers -- or a combination.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology, for example, could let people watching a favorite show click
an icon on digital TV sets and obtain information on the actors, writers and
past episodes.
</P>
<P>
	   And, it offers new opportunities to make money. For instance, a viewer
watching a music video could click on an on-screen icon and buy the CD. Stations
would get a piece of the money from these sales, experts say. Or stations could
share the revenues from ads that accompany online services.
</P>
<P>
	   But many industries involved in the interactive television effort have been
more concerned about losing money, Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of working to solve the problem quickly, cable operators are
battling with other media providers over standards that would unleash the full
promise of interactive TV because of concern about the loss of market share and
programming control, Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   	   Lynn Claudy, senior vice president for science and technology at the
National Association of Broadcasters, applauded Kennard for his move.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's really the logical conclusion to a long debate,'' he said. ``We've
gotten to this point after about 10 years, with everyone frustrated. Maybe this
will finally bring a resolution.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned Over South China Sea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Military construction in the South China Sea by several of
the six countries with territorial claims in the area can provide ``flashpoints
for confrontation,'' a senior State Department official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Construction or expansion of military facilities, no matter how modest,
can lead to a counter-response and that is always dangerous,'' said Stanley
Roth, who heads the State Department's East Asia bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said developments in the South China Sea were one of the few negative
trends in the East Asia region last year. In the area of positive developments,
he cited the strong economic rebound in the region, reduced tensions on the
Korean peninsula and the emergence of democratic rule in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
	   The countries with claims in the South China Sea are China, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam. Roth did not name the countries that have
engaged in military construction, but China and Malaysia are known to be among
them.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said that while there have been no major shootouts, there has been ill
feeling generated by the sinking of ships and an increase in military force
presence.
</P>
<P>
	   In one clash last July, a Philippine naval ship collided with and sank a
Chinese fishing boat in the South China Sea. China expressed ``shock and
dissatisfaction'' over the incident. The Philippines said the sinking was not
intentional.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The trend is what I'm concerned about, and there is no diplomatic process
to counter it,'' Roth said. He noted that there has been no agreement on a
proposed ``code of conduct'' to govern activities in the area and to ease
tensions.
</P>
<P>
	   On the plus side, Roth said there is nothing to suggest an effort by any of
the countries in the area to obstruct freedom of navigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the six claimants, the Philippines is among the most concerned because of
construction activities undertaken by China in the mid-1990s on Mischief Reef, a
disputed area in the Spratly Island chain about 150 miles from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
	   The Philippines is worried that concrete structures built by China could
assist military operations. China insists that its claim to all the South China
Sea islands and their adjacent waters is ``indisputable.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen Friday, giving
up early gains as traders cashed in on the dollar's recent rebound to a
seven-week high.
</P>
<P>
	   A surge in U.S. stocks and comments from a Japanese official supported the
dollar early in the day, but the dollar failed to hold on to the gains against
the yen. Still, the dollar rose against the euro, British pound and Swiss franc.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.21 yen, down from
105.40 yen Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar's downturn against the yen late in the day came despite comments
early Friday in Tokyo by Japan's vice finance minister for international
affairs, Haruhiko Kuroda, who said "the yen is still too strong."
</P>
<P>
	   The Japanese government fears a strong yen will hamper a recovery from a
steep recession by making it more difficult for Japanese manufacturers to
compete in world markets. When the yen rises, Japanese goods become more
expensive and less attractive in foreign markets, unless manufacturers cut
prices and thereby reduce their profits to keep market share. A strong yen also
reduces the value of sales proceeds in foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
	   A rally on Wall Street also helped lift the dollar against the Japanese
currency, continuing its recent trend. But with several days of gains already
this week, traders said the dollar was due for a little consolidation.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly quiet against the euro, which fell to $1.0276 in late New
York trading from $1.0315 late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.5652 Swiss francs, up from 1.5555, and
1.4560 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4589. The British pound fell to $1.6375
from $1.6480.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Friday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9033 German marks, up from 1.8958; 6.3834
French francs, up from 6.3586; and 1,884.26 Italian lire, up from 1,877.07.

<HEADLINE> Windham County sheriff facing more charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WINDHAM, Conn. (AP) - Windham County's high sheriff - charged four
months ago with embezzlement and racketeering - was arrested Friday on a new
round of charges, including corrupt election practices.
<P>
	   Thomas White surrendered to police Friday morning and was released after
posting a $5,000 bond, state police said.
</P>
<P>
	   White was charged with three counts of larceny including embezzlement,
racketeering and corrupt election practices, state police said. They would not
give any details of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   White pleaded innocent in September to two counts each of embezzlement,
tampering with a witness and unlawful restraint, and single counts of bribery of
a witness, hindering prosecution, conspiracy, coercion and racketeering.
</P>
<P>
	   Both arrests stem from an investigation which began in May 1998, state
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have no idea what the specific allegations are, but I can tell you that
we deny them," said Art Meisler, White's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   White could not be reached for comment by The Associated Press. Messages was
left for him at his courthouse office in Danielson, at his home, and with a
paging service. He is due in court on Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   White was elected high sheriff last November following a bitter Democratic
primary fight against former Sheriff Jay Kenney. White has been under
investigation in connection with a check he says he inadvertently deposited to a
personal account rather than a business account. The check was for between
$1,000 and $2,000.
</P>
<P>
	   White, 38, has said he repaid that money with interest. He has explained the
deposit as a mistake he made because he was never properly trained as a deputy
sheriff when he was appointed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   He has said his legal woes are related to efforts by Gov. John G. Rowland
and the Legislature to abolish the sheriff system.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the system say it is rife with corruption, mismanagement and
patronage.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past year, the high sheriffs have been hit with a spate of
embarrassments and scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to White's arrest in September, New London County High Sheriff
Gerard Egan was charged with keeping an uncertified assault weapon in his
courthouse office. Egan's department is also being investigated by the state's
Attorney General and other agencies for allegedly double-billing the state. Egan
also was ordered to pay a $4,000 fine for violating the state ethics code by
hiring his son and wife.
</P>
<P>
	   A female prisoner says she was raped by male inmates while they were being
transported in a New Haven County Sheriff Department van, and a black couple
says a Windham County special deputy sheriff chased them across the Rhode Island
border while firing his gun at them and yelling racist slurs.
</P>
<P>
	   The new charges against White are just another reason why the system should
be scrapped, some say.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's so blatantly ridiculous," said Joseph Antinerella, a former Hartford
County deputy sheriff who says he was passed over for reappointment because he
is a political enemy of the high sheriff.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this thing is shaking down in a small community like Windham County, you
can only imagine what's happening in a bigger city like Hartford," Antinerella
said.

	   But Republicans in Congress were skeptical of the plan, saying it doesn't
adequately protect federal computer systems. ``Under his plan, they would be
left vulnerable to hackers,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee and a cosponsor of legislation on computer security, praised Clinton
for ``focusing attention on this important issue'' but said the president's
approach needed to be examined further.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing the plan, Clinton noted that the need to ``accelerate and
broaden'' computer security was underscored by the Y2K threat and the scramble
to prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
	   The new initiative builds on steps the administration announced last year.
It would seek to develop new technologies, increase public and private
cooperation against computer sabotage, improve training for government agents
and boost protection of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his proposal includes a new program to offer college
scholarships to students in the field of computer security, on the condition
that they perform public service afterward, creating ``a new generation of
computer security specialists who will work to defend our nation's computers.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This plan is not the end of the discussion, but the beginning of a
dialogue with Congress, with the American people and especially with the private
sector,'' Clinton said of his proposal, which was three years in the making.
</P>
<P>
	   The $91 million cyberspace initiative is part of a $2 billion proposal for
maintaining the security of the nation's increasingly digitalized
infrastructure. Clinton said he would work to ensure that the security
initiatives do not tread on privacy rights of citizens and businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is essential that we do not undermine liberty in the name of liberty,''
he said. ``I hope that ... we will work together to ensure that information
technology will create unprecedented prosperity in the 21st century in an
atmosphere and environment that makes all Americans more secure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate special committee on the
Y2K problem, said he worries about overlap between security responsibilities of
the Pentagon, the FBI and other agencies that could cause ``private-sector
reluctance in sharing information about high-tech vulnerabilities.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president's plan is a good start,'' Bennett said. ``But Congress and
the administration must work ... in partnership with private industry to
preserve privacy and competition while meeting modern defense challenges.''
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to reporters before departing to West Virginia for the Middle East
peace talks, Clinton said the New Year's Y2K threat underscored ``how really
interconnected we all are'' -- and revealed how one person can use a computer
for good or sinister purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has never been a time like this, in which we have the power to
create knowledge and the power to create havoc, and both those powers rest in
the same hands,'' Clinton said. ``Our critical systems, from power structures to
air traffic control, are connected and run by computers. We must make those
systems are more secure so that America can be more secure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has frequently expressed concern about the emerging threat that
other governments, hackers and thieves pose to a nation and a world now
dependent on high technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The new initiative builds on steps the administration announced last year.
It would seek to develop new technologies, increase public and private
cooperation against computer sabotage, improve training for government agents
and boost protection of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his proposal includes a new program to offer college
scholarships to students in the field of computer security, on the condition
that they perform public service afterward. ``This program will create a new
generation of computer security specialists who will work to defend our nation's
computers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last July, the administration announced that it was creating a
government-wide security network to protect against hackers. The plan included
an elaborate network of electronic obstacles, monitors and analyzers to watch
for suspicious activity. The first 500 intrusion monitors were to be installed
on nonmilitary government computers early this year, and the full system was to
be completed by May 2003.

<HEADLINE> South Beach nightclub mogul to be released on $15 million bond  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A South Beach nightclub impresario accustomed to
partying with Madonna now has the trappings of a mob murder defendant: house
arrest, 24-hour surveillance and a bigger bond package than John "Junior" Gotti.
<P>
	   The defendant, Chris Paciello, won his freedom Friday by agreeing to the $15
million bond package - secured by property pledged by family and South Beach
scene-makers - during a hearing Friday in Brooklyn federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Paciello would not be released from a Brooklyn jail for at
least another week. After that, he will be confined to his mother's home on
Staten Island, where an electronic anklet, wiretaps and video cameras will
monitor his every move.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are more conditions on this bond than I have ever seen," U.S.
Magistrate Joan Azrack commented before signing off on the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello, 28, is charged with felony murder in a racketeering indictment
along with Anthony Spero, identified as the former acting boss of the Bonanno
crime family, and seven family soldiers and associates. The indictment alleges
that as a member of the violent "Bath Avenue crew," he participated in a botched
push-in robbery that left a housewife dead in 1993 and in a $300,000 bank
robbery in 1992, both on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities also have accused Paciello of exporting mob money and strong-arm
tactics to South Beach, where he reinvented himself as the owner of trendy
nightspots like Liquid, Bar Room and Joia. He has been linked romantically to
comic Sandra Bernhard, supermodel Niki Taylor and Madonna, a close friend of his
business partner, Ingrid Casares.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello, whose real name is Christian Ludwigsen, surrendered in Miami on
Dec. 1. He has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Casares and Latin television personality Sophia Vergara - the sultry
ex-girlfriend of Paciello who arrived at the Brooklyn courthouse in a white
stretch limousine - were among the supporters who signed papers backing his
bond. The stocky, dark-haired defendant, dressed in blue prison garb, smiled and
blew a kiss at Casares as he left the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, the way our society works is when someone becomes successful
or a high-profile person, they become a target," Paciello's attorney, Roy Black,
told reporters. "Rather than celebrating people for their success, they want to
bring them down."
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutors allege Paciello led a double life. Last month, Assistant
U.S. Attorney James Walden filed transcripts of a tape - secretly recorded by an
undercover agent posing as a corrupt cop - in which he allegedly talked about
killing a business rival.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm telling you the owner of the club, we got to get his head (expletive)
broken in," Paciello said on a tape recorded Sept. 29. "We got to get him beat
up. I got to get him whacked."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the conditions of his release, Paciello will be barred from using cell
phones and pagers. Authorities will screen all visitors. He will be allowed to
return to Miami on April 1. But even there, he will remain under house arrest
until returning to Brooklyn for trial on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Gotti, son of the notorious boss of the Gambino crime family, was released
on a $10 million bond package last year before pleading guilty to bribery,
extortion and other charges. He was sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Dow At New High; Nasdaq Up 155  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory
Friday after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit
warning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite, which
tumbled earlier this week, recorded its biggest point gain in history.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30 to close at 11,522.56, topping
its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally, which was fueled by
old-fashioned consumer stocks like Procter &AMP; Gamble, wiped out the last remnants
of Tuesday's 359-point tumble.
</P>
<P>
	   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index soared 155.49 to 3,882.62 after
plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions.
Other broad-market indicators also posted sizable gains. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 rose 38.02 to 1,441.47.
</P>
<P>
	   The sharpness of the rally perplexed some analysts, who believed the selloff
that began on Tuesday would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   "We viewed the selling all week as being healthy for the market," said
Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management.
"Is that over? Probably not."
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, investors proved their reluctance to stay out of a market that
richly rewarded them in 1999. The Nasdaq ended a three-day bout of profit-taking
despite news of weakness from a leading telecommunications equipment maker.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucent Technologies said late Thursday it won't meet most profit forecasts
for the final quarter of 1999. On record-breaking volume, Lucent plunged 15
below its Thursday close on the New York Stock Exchange, ending the session at
54.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a sign of extraordinary resilience, investors used Lucent's troubles
as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic
equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not an industry issue," said Alex M. Cena, an analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent, but said its woes
were due to specific problems at the company.
</P>
<P>
	   In active trading, Nortel Networks soared 20 7/16 to 97 7/16, Cisco Systems
rose 5 7/8 to 105 7/8, Ciena rose 11 7/8 to 57 3/4 and JDS Uniphase rose 30 3/16
to 179 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks dodged another potential problem Friday: the latest sign that the
nation's labor market remains strong.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the start of trading, the government reported the nation's
unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade low of 4.1 percent in December
as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since
July. Economists fear that the low jobless rate will force employers to pay
higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate.
</P>
<P>
	   While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, the Federal
Reserve has already bumped up interest rates three times in less than a year to
slow the economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists believe the
Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting, possibly hurting
company profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, many of Friday's strongest issues were companies that make products
that consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop. Procter &AMP; Gamble surged
8 5/8 to 116 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Coca-Cola rose 3 3/4 to 60 3/4, Merck gained 6 9/16 to 74 15/16 and
Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 3 15/16 to 96 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Those companies, considered cyclical stocks, have thrived this week as
investors took profits from a big run in technology shares at the end of 1999.
But their resurgence may be short-lived, argued Gannon.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the leadership in this market is going to change
dramatically," he said. "At the end of 2000, we'll look back and see that the
dominant players remained telecom and technology."
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq Stock Market, five stocks rose for every three
that fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Composite volume totaled 1.49 billion shares, compared with 1.32 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 12.97 to 488.31.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent. European indexes
bounced back sharply from their own declines this week, with Germany's Xetra DAX
rising 4.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 up 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 up
1.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mazda Unveils Car-Like SUV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mazda Corp. on Friday unveiled the Tribute, a trim sport
utility vehicle that marks the company's first serious effort to crack the
growing SUV market.
</P>
<P>
	   Lexus and Lincoln Mercury also introduced new vehicles at the Greater Los
Angeles Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tribute's success is considered important to the continued turnaround of
the Japanese carmaker that's controlled by Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
	   "The addition of the new Tribute to the Mazda lineup marks the company's
resurgence as a full-line manufacturer," said Richard Beattie, president and
chief executive officer of Mazda North American Operations.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1990-93, Mazda sold a version of the Ford Explorer, but dropped it and
has not had a replacement since. SUVs have dominated North American auto sales
in recent years, and grew 15 percent during 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Introduction of the Tribute is "something that's actually going to ensure
their existence. They haven't had an SUV and it's something that's urgently
needed," said George Peterson, an analyst with Auto Pacific Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Mazda expects to build 20,000 Tributes in 2000 and up to 40,000 in 2001.
Versions intended for the U.S. market will be built at a Ford plant near Kansas
City, Mo., and should appear in showrooms by July, Beattie said. A Ford version
of the Tribute will be introduced next week at the North American International
Auto Show in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Beattie declined to reveal the price tag, but said it will be close to the
cost of smaller SUVs. The target buyer, he said, is a 30-something couple with
two children, a household income of nearly $70,000 and an active lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tribute offers a three-liter, 200-horsepower V6 engine and independent
suspension in more expensive LS and ES models. The DX includes a 130-horsepower,
2-liter 4-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tribute comes with front wheel drive and an optional "on-demand"
all-wheel-drive system that kicks in automatically if the front wheels begin to
slip.
</P>
<P>
	   At 172 inches long and 72 inches wide, it is 5.5 inches longer overall than
the Jeep Cherokee and 2 inches longer at the wheelbase. With back seats folded
down, it has 71.7 cubic feet of cargo space.
</P>
<P>
	   Mazda sales suffered during the early 1990s as Japan slid into recession. In
1996 Ford increased its investment in the Hiroshima-based company to a
controlling 33.4 percent and began cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
	   That, and improved sales, helped boost earnings to $126 million for the
fiscal year ending in September, up from $66 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Lexus introduced its IS 300 compact sports sedan for North American sales in
a bid to lure younger buyers to the Toyota's luxury brand. The car, already
available in Japan, Europe and Australia, is designed to compete with the Audi
A4 and BMW 3-series sedans.
</P>
<P>
	   The IS 300 features a three-liter, 215-horsepower inline six cylinder
engine. The five-speed automatic transmission has race-car style controls on the
steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
	   The target customer is a 35-year-old married male who earns about $100,000
per year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The IS 300 buyer probably has never considered buying a Lexus in the past,"
said Bryan Bergsteinsson, Lexus Group vice president and general manager. "...
We're ready to expand the Lexus family and we think this is just the vehicle to
do it."
</P>
<P>
	   In another Friday debut, Lincoln Mercury unveiled its new factory-stretched
version of the luxury Town Car sedan, the Cartier L. The body is extended six
inches at the factory, providing an additional 7.5 cubic feet of space in the
back seat.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Steady at 4.1 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A burst of hiring at department stores and construction
companies helped keep the nation's unemployment rate at a 30-year low of 4.1
percent in December, marking a strong finish for a year in which Americans
enjoyed the best labor market since the Vietnam War. Wall Street reached record
highs.
</P>
<P>
	   Employers added 315,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, the largest gain
since July. Big increases came at department stores, enjoying their best holiday
sales season in seven years, and construction companies, basking in a building
boom brought on by warmer-than-usual weather.
</P>
<P>
	   "The century ended on a high note for workers," said First Union chief
economist David Orr. He noted that the gain in payroll jobs was far above the
240,000 increase many economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
	   December's jobless rate of 4.1 percent matched the year's low reached in
November. That level is better than any since unemployment stood at 3.9 percent
in January 1970, the Labor Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the unemployment rate averaged 4.2 percent, the best since
a 3.5 percent jobless average in 1969. In 1998, the unemployment rate averaged
4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "The opportunities for employment and for upgrading jobs in 1999 were the
best workers have seen in 30 years," said Ken Mayland, chief economist for
KeyCorp.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong economic growth is keeping unemployment down to levels most workers
haven't seen since they took their first jobs, economists said. And that's
helping workers who historically have had a harder time finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton hailed 1999's performance for producing "the lowest annual
unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics ever recorded." The
annual average unemployment rate for blacks in 1999 was 8 percent and for
Hispanics 6.4 percent, Labor Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, employers boosted jobs and wages by bigger-than-expected
amounts, which caused economists to worry that strong job and wage growth could
trigger inflation down the road.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're creating jobs faster than workers, and the Fed is right that this
can't go on forever," said Bill Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's jobless report adds to the likelihood that Federal Reserve
policy-makers will raise interest rates, by at least a quarter of a point, at
their next meeting in February, many economists said. The central bank bumped up
interest rates three times last year to slow the economy and keep inflation at
bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch's chief economist Bruce Steinberg said the
stronger-than-expected 315,000 jobs created in December "all but guarantees the
Fed will tighten monetary policy on Feb. 2."
</P>
<P>
	   Stock investors brushed off inflation fears raised in the report. The Dow
Jones industrial average posted a record, gaining 269.30 points to close at
11,522.56. That wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. The
Nasdaq index, which also fell earlier this week, reported its largest points
gain in history, soaring 155.49 points to 3,882.62.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices, which initially fell after the report's release, ended slightly
higher as yields on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 6.54 percent
from 6.55 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   December's 315,000 additional payroll jobs followed a gain of 222,000 in
November. Department stores hired 34,000 people last month, their first increase
since April. Construction companies added 16,000 jobs, while engineering and
management firms hired a larger-than-normal 23,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Payrolls grew briskly in other industries as well. Bars and restaurants
hired 27,000 workers; health-care providers added 16,000, an above-average gain;
and financial services, including insurance and real-estate, added 12,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   But manufacturers lost 1,000 jobs in December, bringing their total job loss
for 1999 to 248,000. The manufacturing job loss has slowed in recent months as
U.S. exporters began to see a revival in foreign demand from countries
recovering from the global currency crisis of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, employers added 2.7 million jobs, compared with 2.9 million
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, grew
by 0.4 percent to $13.46 in December, the biggest jump in three months. That
followed a tiny 0.1 percent rise in November.
</P>
<P>
	   While strong wage and job growth are good developments for workers,
economists and members of the Federal Reserve worry that the combination could
eventually trigger inflation. Their shared fear: that employers trying to
attract scarce workers to fill job openings will lure them with higher wages and
benefits -- increased costs that could drive up consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
	   A separate report showed that Americans borrowed $15.6 billion more in
November than in October, the largest monthly increase in consumer debt in four
years, the Federal Reserve said. Consumer credit outstanding, excluding mortgage
debt, advanced at an annual rate of 13.7 percent led by strong demand for loans
for a wide array of goods including automobiles, boats, education, vacations.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters hearings end without resolution of ouster of Philadelphia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   COLLINGSWOOD, N.J. (AP) - The third day of hearings on the ouster of
embattled Philadelphia Teamsters Local 115 leader John Morris ended Friday with
no decision on whether he should keep control of the local.
<P>
	   Morris, surrounded by an entourage of supporters, emerged from the
closed-door proceedings at the Local 676 union hall here. Morris said he had not
been given a fair opportunity to present his side at the hearings.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm fighting this thing to the end," Morris told reporters. "I'm going to
go on to what I have to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Teamsters president James P. Hoffa signed an emergency order in November
removing Morris as secretary-treasurer of Local 115 for charges including
alleged weapons purchases with union money and intimidation of members he
considered disloyal.
</P>
<P>
	   A panel of Teamsters officials heard testimony from only two witnesses since
the hearing began Wednesday, said union trustee Edward F. Keyser Jr., who is
presenting the case for Morris' removal. Morris is entitled to cross-examine
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyser blamed Morris for delaying the hearing. He plans to call at least
nine more witnesses and a team of auditors when the hearing resumes. A date has
not been set.
</P>
<P>
	   "He just gets in their babbling. We don't know what he's talking about,"
said Keyser. "He's done nothing but stall these three days."
</P>
<P>
	   Morris, 73, has said the attempt to remove him as head of the 2,700-member
local is a political payback because he backed Hoffa's rival, Ron Carey, for the
union presidency. He won a federal court ruling last week that no emergency
existed to justify removing him without a hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid tight security with dozens of police officers in riot gear and
sharpshooters on the rooftop, the union meeting broke up quietly without
incident Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're trying to make us look bad," said Donald Casey, a Morris supporter.
"We're not bad. We're just trying to stick up for our rights."
</P>
<P>
	   The meetings have been held in Collingswood because the union wanted a
neutral site that was large enough to accommodate the hundreds expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Collingswood Police Chief Thomas Garrity said his department called in a
full contingency of nearly 100 officers as a precaution. The proceedings
Thursday became tense and Morris was twice reprimanded for shouting.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's emotional testimony. It's causing tempers to flare," Garrity said.
</P>
<P>
	   Teamsters international union officials have said that the accusations
against Morris included using Teamster funds to buy and stockpile weapons
including shot guns and stun guns as well as combat fatigues and other clothing.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not saying he stole them. He has mismanaged funds," Keyser said.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris has said the combat gear was for warmth on cold picket lines, and
stun guns might be needed to defend against antiunion violence. He denied any
other wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why don't you ask me the right question?" Morris told reporters. "Was I
ever arrested? Was I ever put in jail? I'm not that way."
</P>
<P>
	   Morris will have a chance to call rebuttal witnesses after Keyser completes
his case.
</P>
<P>
	   One teamster who declined to give her name said she opposes Morris'
reinstatement and favors a trusteeship for the local. Morris founded the local
in 1955.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't like him - never did," said the woman, a member of Local 115 for
more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   When the testimony is complete, the panel of Teamsters officials - Charles
Byrnes, secretary treasurer of Local 926 in Pittsburgh; Denis Taylor, president
of Local 355 in Baltimore; and Ron McClain, president of Local 147 in Des
Moines, Iowa - will send a letter to Hoffa within 60 days recommending whether a
trusteeship should be imposed.

<HEADLINE> Incoming Coke CEO Continues Shakeup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola's incoming chief continued to shake things up
Friday, naming a new head of the company's critical European division -- which
struggled through a costly contamination scare last year -- and appointing a new
chief marketing officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The moves follow Doug Daft's successful effort to convince Coke's highest
black executive to rescind his retirement plans as the company fights a racial
discrimination suit.
</P>
<P>
	   Many analysts viewed the management shuffle as Daft's way of quickly putting
together a new team in time for his official takeover of the Atlanta-based soft
drink company in April at the annual shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's been in Atlanta since 1991 and is familiar with the system and the
players, so there isn't the normal waiting time you would normally get with a
new CEO," said Merrill Lynch analyst Douglas Lane. "And stay tuned, I think
there is more to come."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, Coca-Cola stock rose strongly. It closed at $60.75, up $3.75
or more than 6 1/2 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Daft was named as the successor to Coke's chairman and chief executive, M.
Douglas Ivester, last month immediately following Ivester's surprise retirement
announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Daft picked Charles S. Frenette to take over the Greater Europe Group, which
includes 49 countries, following the retirement of William P. Casey. Frenette
also will become an executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Frenette, 47, is currently the chief marketing officer. Taking his place
will be 44-year-old Stephen C. Jones, president of Coke subsidiary Minute Maid
since November and former deputy division president in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Both appointments must be approved by the board.
</P>
<P>
	   Casey was in charge of the European division when the company underwent a
massive product recall in Belgium and France last year due to contamination that
sickened hundreds of people. Coke also tried to purchase French beverage maker
Orangina but was rebuffed by that country's antitrust regulators -- seen as a
major failure for the company.
</P>
<P>
	   But Coke spokesman Rob Baskin said Casey had long been contemplating
retirement and was not being forced out or punished for the European problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "Absolutely not," Baskin said. "This seemed like a good time to do it, what
with Doug Daft organizing for the future and putting his own team in place."
</P>
<P>
	   Frenette oversaw the creation of the company's new marketing strategy, which
is to be slowly unveiled over the next few months. Coke has already introduced
new glass bottles, and a presentation is expected to be made to the company's
bottlers next week in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   But many experts were not concerned that Frenette was taking a different job
at such a critical point.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was also on the ground a lot in Belgium during the recall and was more
hands-on in terms of fixing the problem than any other one guy," Lane said. "And
the (marketing) plans are already in place ... they just need to be
implemented."
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Daft announced that the company's highest-ranking black
executive had reversed his decision to retire at the end of this year. Carl Ware
instead will become an executive vice president in charge of a new division
overseeing global public and governmental relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Ware had announced his retirement in November after an apparent demotion by
Ivester that coincided with an ongoing racial discrimination suit against the
company by four former and current Coke employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Analyst David Goldman of Banc of America Securities said the moves should
also "build the ranks."
</P>
<P>
	   "Coke may have had a problem when it came to depth in management, and Doug
is moving quickly to correct that problem," Goldman said.

<HEADLINE> More Spending Sought for Farm Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration proposed Friday to almost
double federal spending on farm conservation programs, both to help farmers cope
with depressed commodity prices and to reduce runoff that fouls many of the
nation's rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's 2001 budget would authorize $1.3 billion in new agricultural
conservation spending, including $600 million in payments to farmers who
voluntarily act to prevent erosion on their land. It also would expand the
popular Conservation Reserve Program, which pays producers to take
environmentally sensitive acreage out of production.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have been paying farmers for decades to grow commodities and, in some
cases, not to grow commodities. Now we must start thinking of the land itself as
our most valuable commodity,'' said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agriculture Department predicts that net farm income will drop $7.6
billion this year to $40.4 billion unless Congress steps in this fall with
another large infusion of federal aid. Lawmakers have done that the last two
years, and the administration hopes to steer at least some of the money this
year into conservation programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2001 budget also is expected to include some form of payments to be tied
to decreases in crop prices or farm income but the details have not been
finalized, officials said. The 2001 fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the administration's conservation plan is the new $600
million subsidy program, introduced in Congress last year by Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Payment levels under the ``Conservation Security Program'' would be based on
the scope of farmers' conservation measures. They could include planting grass
along streams and cutting back on livestock grazing.
</P>
<P>
	   An existing program that provides assistance for manure control and a
variety of other conservation measures would be increased from $174 million this
year to $325 million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Other proposals include:
</P>
<P>
	   --Increasing the acreage cap in the Conservation Reserve Program from 36
million to 40 million acres. That would allow more than twice as much land to be
enrolled in the program during the 2001 fiscal year as would be permitted under
current law. It is by far USDA's biggest existing conservation program at $1.3
billion -- about $5,000 per farm.
</P>
<P>
	   --Expanding a program that pays farmers to restore wetlands by 210,000 acres
in 2001 and an additional 250,000 acres a year after that. The Wetlands Reserve
Program is currently limited to 975,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore announced the conservation moves in a conference call
with reporters in Iowa, which is holding its presidential nominating caucuses
later this month. Gore said the proposals would provide a ``new source of
welcome income for farmers.''
</P>
<P>
	   They also would soften the blow of tougher environmental regulations that
the administration is considering.
</P>
<P>
	   The Environmental Protection Agency proposed last summer to require states
to submit plans to clean up every waterway that fails to meet water quality
standards. The administration is considering other measures to curb farm runoff
believed responsible for an oxygen-deprived ``dead zone'' in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration's plan ``recognizes that we must put more money into the
hands of landowners if we're going to clean up the nation's remaining polluted
rivers,'' said Scott Faber of American Rivers, a conservation group. ``There is
simply no way politically or logistically that we can regulate every landowner
in America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Farm-state lawmakers may not be as receptive to the plan. The proposals
would provide little immediate relief to farmers, and they would have to spend
some of their own money on conservation to qualify for the aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Grain prices collapsed in 1998 and Congress has provided farmers with $15
billion in consecutive bailouts over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Relatives File Petition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Lawyers for the relatives of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez filed a
petition Friday to appoint a guardian for the child, a first step toward
preventing the Cuban boy's return to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the attorneys nor the family would comment on the petition until
Judge Rosa Rodriguez made a decision in the case, said family spokesman Armando
Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after his
mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned while trying to reach Florida
by boat.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was placed with his great-uncle and great-aunt in Miami, but the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled Wednesday that he must be returned
to his father in Cuba by next Friday. The decision touched off angry protests in
the Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, accompanied by
one of the family's lawyers, flew to Washington on Friday to appeal directly to
Attorney General Janet Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also asked President Clinton to
reverse the order.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has said she was consulted on the INS decision and approved of it.
Clinton said Friday the INS did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe they followed the law,'' Clinton said. ``This is a volatile and
difficult case. ... We need to keep this out of the political process as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to Thursday, when two Cuban exile leaders and 133 other people
were arrested and police were forced to use tear gas to disperse a crowd,
protesters in Miami were much calmer Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Cuban exile community called for more civil disobedience. The
planned demonstrations included a vigil Friday night at the federal building in
Orlando and a large protest in Little Havana on Saturday. Protesters are also
planning to drive around Miami International Airport on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the child is sent back to Cuba without his day in court, all hell is
going to break loose,'' said Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spoke with some demonstration organizers and asked them to ``do the
demonstrations in a way that does not disrupt daily life in South Florida,
because it would hurt the cause of Elian.''
</P>
<P>
	   The petition was filed Friday on behalf of Elian Gonzalez's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez. It is an attempt by the boy's Miami relatives to get
guardianship and then to file for applications for admission to the United
States and asylum, said David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian played in his relatives' yard Friday with a puppy named Dolphin, a
gift from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. The black Labrador chased Elian
around the yard and playfully nipped at his blue soccer shorts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian tells me he does not want to go back to Cuba,'' said Delfin
Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle. He said Elian wants his family to come here.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has not been available for comment
since the INS ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials have suggested Elian's father come to Florida to get his son,
while the U.S. National Council of Churches said the boy's relatives in Cuba
want the organization to bring the boy back.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Claims Mideast Talks Progress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- In a move portrayed as evidence of progress,
President Clinton presented Israel and Syria a ``working document'' Friday that
could be a pathway to a land-for-peace treaty between the two old foes.
</P>
<P>
	   In another measured step forward, Clinton met with Prime Minister Ehud Barak
of Israel and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, first together, then
separately. It was the first face-to-face meeting between Barak and al-Sharaa
since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are moving down the track,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said before formal talks drew to a close for the Jewish Sabbath and the Muslim
Eid al-Fitr, the end of the holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
	   After returning to the White House, Clinton made a series of phone calls to
other world leaders to ``update them on the status of the peace talks in
Shepherdstown and give them a status report, from his perspective, on what
transpired today,'' said national security spokesman David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton spoke with French President Jacques Chirac for about 10 minutes,
Leavy said. He then spoke with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder for 20
minutes and with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations were to resume Saturday night. He said Barak and al-Sharaa may
go home early next week, leaving experts behind to continue deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is difficult stuff. This is very hard stuff,'' Clinton said on his
fourth day of mediating between Barak and al-Sharaa on details of a settlement
based on the proposition Israel should give up the Golan Heights to gain Syria's
diplomatic recognition.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president gave the U.S.-drafted
document, about seven pages long, to the two sides during the 45-minute
trilateral meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This working document provides a summary of the issues to be decided and
the differences between the parties,'' Lockhart said. ``It is designed as a
procedural tool to focus the substantive discussions and to help bridge the
differences that now exist.''
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations at this college town 70 miles from Washington had stalled over
procedural issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel insisted committees on peace terms and border security meet first,
and they did. But Rubin said committees on the timetable of an Israeli
withdrawal on the Golan Heights and on water resources would meet before the
round ends.
</P>
<P>
	   The document, which Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had directed her
aides to prepare, details both the agreements and disagreements during
negotiations here, in Washington last month and before a breakdown four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's certainly progress to have a document before the parties,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he added, ``We have limited expectations (of) what can be completed with
one round.''
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation told The Associated Press that the
Syrian negotiating team was satisfied with the document ``because matters now
have become more well-defined, and we won't be going back to square one every
time we meet.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Israelis, but Rubin said, ``They
both regard this as a good way to move the process forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he is satisfied everyone is making a good-faith effort. ``They
are working hard and trying to find ways to resolve their differences,'' he
said,
</P>
<P>
	   Before boarding a U.S. Marine helicopter that took him back to the White
House, the president spent a few minutes window shopping on German Street, the
main thoroughfare in 239-year-old Shepherdstown.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 200 spectators lined the street to see him.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright stayed behind and planned to join the Israeli delegation for
traditional Shabat dinner Friday night at the Clarion Hotel, which is off-limits
to journalists. On Saturday, she will join the Syrians for their feast to mark
the end of Ramadan.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily today on
the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   At least four major investment firms downgraded Lucent following late
Thursday's warning by the communications equipment maker that its profits from
the final three months of 1999 won't meet Wall Street forecasts. But Lucent's
troubles were apparently seen as a gain for its main rivals in supplying speedy
fiber-optic gear for the communications networks that make up the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The German software group reported that its pretax profit doubled last year
as the company reached its goal of 15 percent to 20 percent sales growth. SAP is
scheduled to report more precise figures on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlanta-based beverage company named a new head for its European
division, which struggled through a contamination scare and a huge recall last
year. Charles S. Frenette will become an executive vice president and take over
the Greater Europe Group, which includes 49 countries, following the retirement
of William P. Casey. Frenette, 47, is currently the chief marketing officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The company warned that it only expects to break-even in per-share profits
for the fourth quarter. A First Call/Thomson Financial survey of four analysts
predicted the company would earn 25 cents a share for the period. Hanger, based
in Bethesda, Md., blamed transition problems associated with last year's
acquisition of NovaCare O&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is launching a co-branded gaming site with Red Hat, a leading

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Spiritual Leader Defects  </HEADLINE>
   By DEEPAK SHARMA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DHARMSALA, India (AP) -- An exhausted 14-year-old Tibetan Buddhist leader
reached India with scraped hands and blistered feet after trekking across the
snowy Himalayas, a defection that embarrassed Chinese leaders who used him as a
symbol of their rule over Tibet.
</P>
<P>
	   The 17th Karmapa's flight with a few monks was the most significant exodus
since the Dalai Lama -- the spiritual leader of millions of Buddhists -- and
tens of thousands of Tibetans fled their homeland after a failed 1959 uprising
against Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
	   When he arrived Wednesday, the Karmapa met with the Dalai Lama, officials in
his government-in-exile at Dharmsala in northern India said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Few others have spoken to him, and the Dalai Lama's administration has been
reluctant to comment for fear of reprisals in Tibet and out of consideration for
the political situation in India, which has recently enjoyed progress in trade
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
	   The escape could prod China's communist leadership to press an already stern
4-year-old campaign to purge monasteries of Dalai Lama supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second incident in two days showing China's persistent problems
with organized religion. On Thursday, Catholics aligned with China's communist
regime ordained five new bishops not recognized by Rome.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa, head of the Karma Kagyu religious order, crossed Nepal on a
route followed by most Tibetan refugees, said sources close to the Dharmsala
administration. He entered without a visa and traveled across India.
</P>
<P>
	   He eluded his increasingly watchful guards at the 800-year-old Tsurphu
monastery in central Tibet by declaring his intention to go on a retreat, the
sources said. He and a few monks set out across the mountains on Dec. 28,
trekking for days along rocky paths bordered by thorny bushes that scraped their
hands, the sources said. A jeep and other modes of transportation were used
later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's amazing to me that he pulled this off,'' said John Ackerly, president
of the International Campaign for Tibet in Washington, D.C., who visited the
Karmapa's home monastery in 1998. ``He was surrounded by so many Chinese
minders.''
</P>
<P>
	   Those close to the Dalai Lama administration said the Karmapa apparently
left because he was frustrated at not being allowed to meet with his teachers to
obtain the instruction necessary for his religious position. Chinese authorities
repeatedly denied a visa to his principal teacher, Tai Situ Rinpoche, who has a
monastery near Dharmsala.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa's flight ``reveals the shambles of China's policy of trying to
manage religion,'' says Robert Thurman, a Columbia University professor and
friend of the Dalai Lama. ``They couldn't give him enough freedom so he could
pursue his personal growth.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Their suppression is not working, and their attempt to pretend to get
along with Buddhism doesn't work, either.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa's Kagyupa sect, known as the ``Black Hats,'' was once Tibet's
most politically powerful but was supplanted by the Gelugpa school of the Dalai
Lamas 350 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the Tibetan sects are revered as the reincarnations of their
predecessors and are identified in their youth by divination.
</P>
<P>
	   China's State Council Information Office acknowledged that the Karmapa had
left his monastery with a ``small number of followers,'' the state-run Xinhua
News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the Karmapa went abroad to get musical instruments and a
black hat -- the symbol of his power believed to be woven from the hairs of
female deities. The report cited a letter saying he did not mean to ``betray the
state, the nation, the monastery or the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa is the first leading ``tulku,'' or reincarnation of a holy
person, to be officially recognized by the modern Chinese state. He also is the
only Tibetan lama upon whom the Dalai Lama and the Chinese have agreed, and is
the most important Tibetan figure to defect since his predecessor fled with the
Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
	   The 16th Karmapa died in 1981, and a poem he wrote predicting symbolically
where his predecessor could be found was discovered 10 years later. It became
the subject of dispute among two factions of regents in Sikkim, an Indian state
that China claims.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 1992 agreement with the Chinese, the 7-year-old boy born as Ugyen
Trinley Dorje was enthroned as the Karmapa in a ceremony attended by 20,000
Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
	   The winning faction worked with the Chinese leadership to see the boy
installed at Tsurphu, the traditional seat of the Karmapas. Policy papers issued
by the Chinese government have pointed to the 17th Karmapa's investiture and the
restoration of Tsurphu as examples of Beijing's support for Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the deal, exiled teachers would be allowed to come to Tibet to
educate the Karmapa and he was to be allowed to return to Sikkim to retrieve the
black hat.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Chinese ``stopped keeping their side of the deal,'' said Robbie
Barnett, an expert on Tibetan Buddhism at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This could cause the Chinese to be even tougher on Tibet in the future,''
Barnett said. ``They got caught unawares. But the signals were there all year
that the Karmapa was increasingly frustrated, waiting in his monastery for his
teachers.''

<HEADLINE> INSERTS graf 5 with sentencing of vice president, CORRECTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A judge Friday blamed greed for the corruption of New
York Stock Exchange floor brokers as he ordered prison terms or home detention
for four of them snared in the first prosecution of its kind.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff handed the stiffest sentence to the two
heads of a company that helped the brokers to trade illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   William Killeen, crying so much that he had to hand his statement to his
lawyer to be read out loud, was sentenced to a year and eight months in prison
for his part in the scam engineered in part through his company, Oakford Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Killeen, 39, of Colts Neck, N.J., was president of the now defunct company
that engaged in a securities conspiracy by allowing floor brokers to execute
personal trades ahead of orders from their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's vice president, Thomas William Bock, 47, was sentenced to a
year and a half in prison and fined $50,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Floor brokers are paid a commission to conduct trades for client brokerages
and their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   They are not permitted to make trades for themselves or for any account in
which they have an interest because their positions on the floor can provide
them with immediate access to market-moving news, giving them an unfair
advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Rakoff also fined Killeen $50,000 after the defendant said he was "extremely
sorry."
</P>
<P>
	   "It is with great regret that I stand here today," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said Killeen's honorable dedication to his family and his
community conflicted with his business life in which he and others engaged in "a
series of blatantly unlawful acts motivated by greed."
</P>
<P>
	   "He is the proverbial person who led two lives," Rakoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that Killeen appeared to be a good family man and a good community
man.
</P>
<P>
	   "But in his business life, greed overcame respect for the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bock and Killeen had admitted during guilty pleas last year that they caused
their company to pay their personal expenses including car leases, vacations and
mortgage installments between 1992 and 1996. Those payments amounted to $207,000
for Killeen and $330,000 for Bock, the government said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sentencing of Killeen and Bock were two of six to occur throughout the
day, four of them floor brokers.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge rejected arguments by lawyers that the brokers should not face
prison terms because they were not properly informed by the NYSE that what they
were doing was a crime. The prosecution is believed to be the first case to
result from illegal personal trades made by floor brokers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It involved not only intentional violations of the rules but the making of
false statements and the making of false records," the judge said. "It was done
out of greed."
</P>
<P>
	   John Savarese, 35, and his brother, Mark, 38, both floor brokers from Garden
City, were each sentenced to four months in prison to be followed by two months
of home detention. Both were fined $15,000 as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Edward Mueger, 65, of Jupiter, Fla., was sentenced to three months in prison
and three months of home confinement. He was also fined $15,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Cavallino, 43, of Shrewsbury, N.J., was sentenced to six months of
home confinement and fined $100,000. The judge spared Cavallino a prison term
but increased his fine to make up for it after listening to pleas that he be
left at home to care for his son.

<HEADLINE> South Beach nightclub mogul to be released on $15 million bond  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A South Beach nightclub impresario accustomed to
partying with Madonna now has the trappings of a mob murder defendant: house
arrest, 24-hour surveillance and a bigger bond package than John "Junior" Gotti.
<P>
	   The defendant, Chris Paciello, won his freedom Friday by agreeing to the $15
million bond package - secured by property pledged by family and South Beach
scene-makers - during a hearing Friday in Brooklyn federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Paciello would not be released from a Brooklyn jail for at
least another week. After that, he will be confined to his mother's home on
Staten Island, where an electronic anklet, wiretaps and video cameras will
monitor his every move.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are more conditions on this bond than I have ever seen," U.S.
Magistrate Joan Azrack commented before signing off on the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello, 28, is charged with felony murder in a racketeering indictment
along with Anthony Spero, identified as the former acting boss of the Bonanno
crime family, and seven family soldiers and associates. The indictment alleges
that as a member of the violent "Bath Avenue crew," he participated in a botched
push-in robbery that left a housewife dead in 1993 and in a $300,000 bank
robbery in 1992, both on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities also have accused Paciello of exporting mob money and strong-arm
tactics to South Beach, where he reinvented himself as the owner of trendy
nightspots like Liquid, Bar Room and Joia. He has been linked romantically to
comic Sandra Bernhard, supermodel Niki Taylor and Madonna, a close friend of his
business partner, Ingrid Casares.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello, whose real name is Christian Ludwigsen, surrendered in Miami on
Dec. 1. He has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Casares and Latin television personality Sofia Vergara - the sultry
ex-girlfriend of Paciello who arrived at the Brooklyn courthouse in a white
stretch limousine - were among the supporters who signed papers backing his
bond. The stocky, dark-haired defendant, dressed in blue prison garb, smiled and
blew a kiss at Casares as he left the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, the way our society works is when someone becomes successful
or a high-profile person, they become a target," Paciello's attorney, Roy Black,
told reporters. "Rather than celebrating people for their success, they want to
bring them down."
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutors allege Paciello led a double life. Last month, Assistant
U.S. Attorney James Walden filed transcripts of a tape - secretly recorded by an
undercover agent posing as a corrupt cop - in which he allegedly talked about
killing a business rival.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm telling you the owner of the club, we got to get his head (expletive)
broken in," Paciello said on a tape recorded Sept. 29. "We got to get him beat
up. I got to get him whacked."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the conditions of his release, Paciello will be barred from using cell
phones and pagers. Authorities will screen all visitors. He will be allowed to
return to Miami on April 1. But even there, he will remain under house arrest
until returning to Brooklyn for trial on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Gotti, son of the notorious boss of the Gambino crime family, was released
on a $10 million bond package last year before pleading guilty to bribery,
extortion and other charges. He was sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Writer Patrick O'Brian Dies at 85  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOODS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Patrick O'Brian, whose celebrated novels of 19th century
seafaring won praise from critics and the loyalty of legions of readers, has
died. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian died in Dublin, Ireland, where he had been working on a book for
several weeks at Trinity College. The cause of death was not given and there
were conflicting reports of the date.
</P>
<P>
	   The British Embassy in Paris said O'Brian died Tuesday, but his New York
publisher said O'Brian died Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian's major work was a 20-volume series set in the Royal Navy during the
Napoleonic wars.
</P>
<P>
	   A deep knowledge of naval history and 19th century life enabled him to evoke
a time and place so vividly that, in this era of supersonic jets and smart
bombs, his readers were gripped by the slow-motion suspense of sea battles
fought under sail.
</P>
<P>
	   The series, begun in 1969 with ``Master and Commander,'' is the story of the
friendship between a bold and ambitious navy officer, Jack Aubrey, and the
ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, a naturalist and secret agent who doesn't much
like sailing.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the books were well-reviewed and found an enthusiastic readership
from the start, it wasn't until the 1990s that they achieved wide recognition
abroad and were lifted out of the ``historical fiction'' genre in which they
generally were reviewed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, a critic for The Washington Post critic called O'Brian ``the best
novelist you have never heard of.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Patrick O'Brian has written great and enduring literature which happens to
be set largely at sea,'' the Sunday Telegraph wrote in 1997, praising ``the
intensity of characterization, the complex elegance of the plotting, and the
brilliance of the writing.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian also proved that, in the hands of a skilled writer, specialist
language need not be an obstacle to understanding. Readers who can't remember
which side of a ship is starboard still can feel the frantic activity on deck as
the sails unfurl and catch the wind, and the excitement as a man-of-war turns to
engage the enemy.
</P>
<P>
	   A lexicon explaining O'Brian's nautical terminology was published, but
O'Brian didn't think definitions important.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ignorance of the cross-catharpins is not necessarily fatal,'' he once
said. ``Explanation almost certainly would be.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian's fans range from actor Charlton Heston to critic John Bayley, a
former Oxford professor of literature who wrote that O'Brian's ``originality
consists in the unpretentious use he makes of (history) to invent a new style of
fiction.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No other writer,'' Bayley wrote, ``not even Melville, has described the
whale and the wandering albatross with O'Brian's studious and yet lyrical
accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian guarded his privacy, and in his few interviews resisted questions
about his personal life.
</P>
<P>
	   He was born Dec. 12, 1914, in Chalfont St. Peter, west of London, and it
wasn't until 1998 that he was revealed to be the son of an English doctor and
not an Irishman as had been widely believed, the Daily Telegraph said in an
obituary Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said O'Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ, but changed his
name in 1945. During his school years, he was frequently ill, spending much time
reading. His writing career began at age 15, when he published a book about the
union of a giant panda and a snow leopard.
</P>
<P>
	   During World War II, O'Brian drove ambulances and worked briefly with
Britain's Political Intelligence Department.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1949, he and his second wife, Mary, moved to Collioure, southern France.
His first seafaring novel was ``The Golden Ocean'' in 1956, about a Pacific
expedition.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series was already well under way in Britain by the
beginning of the 1990s, when editor Starling Lawrence of the American publisher
W.W. Norton chanced to read one on a flight home.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest, as they say, is publishing history.
</P>
<P>
	   Several years ago, the writer said he would end the series with the 20th
book, but last month he said he was working on volume 21, the Daily Telegraph
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian also wrote biographies of Picasso and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. A
linguist, he translated the work of French writers Simone de Beauvoir and
Colette.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Funeral plans were not announced. He is survived by a son, Richard, from his
first marriage.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise Slightly After Retreat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Government bond prices rose slightly Friday, shaking off an
early setback as traders assessed the inflation risks of a fresh government
report of a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department report of rising wages and a bigger-than-expected
increase in the number of jobs created kept traders betting the Federal
Reserve's inflation-fighters soon will begin raising interest rates again. But
analysts said the employment figures were not viewed as so strong that they
would encourage the Fed to be overly aggressive in efforts to cool off the
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond rose 3/32 point, or 93 3/4 cents per $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.54
percent from 6.55 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department said the economy added 315,000 jobs in December, above
expectations for an increase of 250,000. The average hourly earnings increased
0.4 percent in December, slightly above estimates. The unemployment rate
remained at a 29-year low of 4.1 percent in December, in line with economists'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonds sold off sharply when the figures were released Friday morning, with
the 30-year Treasury losing over 1 point before recovering.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices have fallen in recent weeks amid concerns that the Federal
Reserve, which raised rates three times last year, plans to increase interest
rates again early this year now that fears of a Year 2000 computer disaster have
dissipated.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates hurt bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities were
unchanged to up 1/32 point and intermediate maturities rose 1/32 to  1/8 point,
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.38 percent as the discount fell
0.01 percentage point from Thursday to 5.23 percent. Six-month yields were 5.65
percent, as the discount fell 0.01 percentage point from Thursday to 5.42
percent. One-year yields were 5.99 percent as the discount fell 0.01 percentage
point from Thursday to 5.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was
5.68 3/4 percent, up from 5.50 percent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer said the new contract for its index
of 40 actively traded municipal bonds rose  1/8 to 91 27/32. The average yield
to maturity fell to 6.26 percent from 6.27 percent on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> EchoStar Offers Free Satellite Dish  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- EchoStar Communications Corp. is dangling nearly $400 in
goods and services in front of cable television customers to get them to switch
to satellite service.
</P>
<P>
	   The Littleton-based operator of the Dish Network satellite service hopes to
lure some of the country's 67 million cable subscribers with the offer of a free
satellite dish and installation, EchoStar spokesman Marc Lumpkin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're ripe fruit," Lumpkin said. "They hate their cable companies because
they have poor service, they raise their rates every year, they take off
channels or leave off channels."
</P>
<P>
	   He added: "We have the most channel choices for the lowest prices."
</P>
<P>
	   The promotion steps up the competition between cable and satellite providers
for control of viewers' sets. Last year Time Warner Cable announced an offer of
$100 to anyone who traded a satellite-TV dish for digital cable service.
</P>
<P>
	   EchoStar announced its nationwide deal Thursday at the Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas. To get the free dish and installation, customers will have to
present a valid credit card and cable bill when purchasing equipment and commit
to a year of service at $39.98 a month. The offer expires March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Non-cable customers would get reimbursed later for purchasing a dish.

<HEADLINE> Market Guru Ordered To Return $16M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge on Friday ordered renowned market forecaster Martin
A. Armstrong to produce $16 million of gold bars and rare antiquities in an
attempt to recover the assets of investors who were bilked out of about $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong, 50, of Princeton, N.J., was held in contempt of court by Judge
Richard Owen in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan and ordered to turn over
the valuables by Tuesday at 3 p.m. to a court-appointed receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors believe Armstrong has 102 bars of gold, a $750,000 bust of
Julius Caesar, hundreds of rare coins, a bronze helmet and other antiques.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong has pleaded innocent to charges of fraud brought by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the U.S.
Attorney. He is free on $5 million bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong owes almost $1 billion to some 100 Japanese corporate investors.
His companies, including Princeton Economics and Cresvale International Ltd. in
Tokyo, had raised money from investors and promised to repay the debt, plus
interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of investing the money in safe bonds, as he promised, Armstrong made
risky bets on currencies and derivatives. Only $46 million has been recovered to
repay investors.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Figures Fall in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Consumer prices in Mexico rose 12.3 percent last year,
the lowest yearly rise since the nation's 1994 financial crisis and a sign of
economic strength at the start of this election year.
</P>
<P>
	   The central bank's inflation report on Friday was welcome news for President
Ernesto Zedillo, who has repeatedly stressed that the country's underlying
economic strength will help prevent the kind of crises that have accompanied the
last four presidential transitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, much of the country hasn't recovered from the crisis that broke out
weeks after Zedillo took office in December 1994. Investors stampeded out of
Mexico, sending the peso and stocks plunged and triggering surging inflation and
interest rates. The government avoided default on its international debts only
through a $50 billion U.S.-led international bailout.
</P>
<P>
	   Inflation has gradually eased since jumping to 52 percent in 1995. After
falling to 15.7 percent in 1997, it increased to 18.6 percent in 1998, a year of
international economic turmoil and falling prices of oil -- the country's main
export. The government had projected 13 percent inflation for 1999, but many
analysts thought it would be higher.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech Thursday, Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria credited the
lower inflation to ``fiscal discipline, together with the restrictive monetary
policies of the Bank of Mexico and the joint efforts of all of the sectors of
production.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government has projected 10 percent inflation for this year. But its
ability to meet that projection will depend in part on what happens to the
economy of the United States, its main trading partner. Higher U.S. interest
rates could raise costs for some Mexican businesses and weaken the peso -- both
factors that could accelerate inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the progress in fighting inflation, some economists say the
government and central bank haven't been aggressive enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Twelve-and-a-half percent continues to be too high when our trading
partners, such as the United States, Canada, and European countries, have
inflation levels below 3 percent,'' said Juan Carlos Leal, research director for
TV Azteca's economic strategy division.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Mexicans say they believe prices have risen well beyond the 12.3
percent reported by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Miguel Antonio Colchado, the owner of a business that provides food and
beverages to businesses, said he's paying 15 percent to 17 percent more to his
suppliers and has raised his prices 17 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's OK for those who contract our services,'' he said. ``But for
regular people, the bulk of the economy isn't healthy, because their salaries
aren't increasing by that percentage.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Sues Mercedes for Age Bias  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A Mercedes-Benz employee was denied a promotion because
he was 72 years old, the federal government alleged in an age discrimination
lawsuit against the car maker.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court against Montvale-based
Mercedes-Benz of North America, seeks back wages and other damages for
Archangelo Passarello of Park Ridge.
</P>
<P>
	   Passarello, who still works as a secretary in the company's legal
department, applied in 1996 for the post of national customer assistance
representative after 11 years in the company and satisfactory evaluations, the
lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mercedes-Benz promoted two other applicants who were "substantially younger
and substantially less qualified," the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>

have a long-standing policy of not discriminating on any basis," she said.

<HEADLINE> Founder of Walter Industries Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- James W. Walter, founder of a company that grew into a
leading home builder and industrial company, has died. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter, founder and chairman of Walter Industries Inc., died at home
Thursday of complications from lung cancer. He was diagnosed with the disease
last June and underwent extensive radiation and chemotherapy treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our corporate family is mourning the loss of an inspiring leader and loyal
friend," said Kenneth Hyatt, chairman and CEO of Walter Industries. "Jim
Walter's character and personality are stamped indelibly on this company. His
extraordinary sense of fair play and basic integrity will forever serve as our
guiding standards."
</P>
<P>
	   Walter pioneered a new concept in affordable family homes when, at age 23,
he sold his first shell home for $895 in 1946. The home was finished and painted
on the outside but had only stud framing inside.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tampa-based business he formed out of that venture, Jim Walter Homes,
sold and financed more than 330,000 single-family houses in 24 states.
</P>
<P>
	   His company, later under the names Jim Walter Corp. and Walter Industries,
diversified into coal mining, paper distribution and aluminum products, becoming
one of Florida's largest companies and one of the 200 largest industrial
companies in the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   At its peak, the company had more than $2.4 billion in sales and 25,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The conglomerate went through a five-year bankruptcy case in the early 1990s
as waves of lawsuits were filed alleging asbestos poisoning by a former
subsidiary, Celotex Corp. Walter and his management team emerged in control of
the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter was born in Lewes, Del., and moved to Florida as a baby and grew up
in Tampa. He never attended college but had a chair named for him at the
University of Florida's College of Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Funeral services were set Tuesday at Sacred Heart Church in Tampa. Walter
was survived by his wife, Connie, two sons, a stepdaughter, grandson and three
step-grandsons.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Police Looking for Escapees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Police and prison guards were hunting on Friday for 15
suspects who escaped from a prison in central Kenya, a police official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy police spokesman Dola Ididis said at least 21 suspects charged with
capital crimes ranging from murder to treason scrambled over the prison wall and
a barbed wire fence Thursday evening as guards changed duties at Thompson Falls
Jail in Nyahururu, 100 miles northwest of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
	   Six of the escapees were captured, Ididis said.
</P>
<P>
	   The private Kenya Television Network said guards shot at least three
escapees dead and several guards were injured in fights with the fleeing
prisoners. Ididis said he could not confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Prison authorities were reported to have ordered an investigation into the
jailbreak.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenyan jails and prisons, notoriously congested and disease-infested, have
been described as inhuman by legislators and human rights groups.

<P>
	   Although conviction for crimes of murder, cattle-rustling and treason
carries a mandatory death sentence by hanging, no one has been executed in Kenya
for at least a decade.

<HEADLINE> Market Guru Ordered To Return $16M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge on Friday ordered renowned market forecaster Martin
A. Armstrong to produce $16 million of gold bars and rare antiquities in an
attempt to recover the assets of investors who were bilked out of about $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong, 50, founder of Princeton Economics International, violated a
court order to turn over the valuables to a court-appointed receiver, Judge
Richard Owen in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge ordered him to produce them by Tuesday at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors believe Armstrong has 102 bars of gold, a $750,000 bust of
Julius Caesar, hundreds of rare coins, a bronze helmet and other antiquities.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Armstrong's ex-girlfriend, Tina Mustra, who also is his
executive assistant at Princeton Economics, testified Friday that she helped
Armstrong remove company records from their Princeton, N.J., offices shortly
before they were raided last September by FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
	   "The testimony of Ms. Mustra (supports) that Mr. Armstrong has been
personally involved in the taking and secreting of these items," Judge Owen said
in signing his order.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, attorneys for the receiver searched Armstrong's spacious
vacation home in Long Beach Island, N.J., but said it had been cleaned out.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind some books on the top shelf of a bookcase, they found a bar of fine
Swiss silver, they said. They also found some packaging for antique coins,
complete with auction slips, and two small coins.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is overwhelming evidence the coins are in his possession," said Alan
Cohen, an attorney for O'Melveny &AMP; Meyers and the receiver in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong, who is free on a $5 million bond, had no comment following the
hearing, but his attorney Lawrence S. Feld said, "Mr. Armstrong has authorized
me to say that he will turnover whatever is in his possession."
</P>
<P>
	   Had Armstrong not signaled that he was willing to comply, U.S. Marshals were
standing by to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong has pleaded innocent to charges of fraud brought by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the U.S.
Attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong owes almost $1 billion to some 100 Japanese corporate investors.
His companies, including Princeton Economics and Cresvale International Ltd. in
Tokyo, had raised money from investors and promised to repay the debt, plus
interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of investing the money in safe bonds, as he promised, Armstrong made
risky bets on currencies and derivatives. Only $46 million has been recovered to
repay investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Cresvale filed for bankruptcy last month and its chairman, Akira Setogawa,
was indicted for tax evasion. Setogawa also has admitted giving rebates to
Japanese companies who continued to invest with Armstrong.

<HEADLINE> Floor Brokers Sentenced for Scam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge Friday blamed greed for the corruption of New York
Stock Exchange floor brokers as he ordered prison terms or home detention for
five of them snared in the first prosecution of its kind.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff handed the stiffest sentence to the head
of Oakford Corp., which helped the brokers to trade illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   William Killeen was sentenced to serve 20 months in prison for his part in
the scam engineered in part through Oakford. He was also fined $50,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Killeen, 39, of Colts Neck, N.J., was president of the now defunct company
that engaged in a securities conspiracy by allowing floor brokers to execute
personal trades ahead of orders from their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's vice president, Thomas William Bock, 47, was sentenced to a
year and a half in prison and fined $50,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Floor brokers are paid a commission to conduct trades for client brokerages
and their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   They are not permitted to make trades for themselves or for any account in
which they have an interest because their positions on the floor can provide
them with immediate access to market-moving news, giving them an unfair
advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Bock and Killeen had admitted during guilty pleas last year that they caused
their company to pay their personal expenses including car leases, vacations and
mortgage installments between 1992 and 1996. Those payments amounted to $207,000
for Killeen and $330,000 for Bock, the government said.
</P>
<P>
	   Killeen said he was "extremely sorry."
</P>
<P>
	   "It is with great regret that I stand here today," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said, however, that Killeen's honorable dedication to his family
and his community conflicted with his business life in which he and others
engaged in "a series of blatantly unlawful acts motivated by greed."
</P>
<P>
	   The sentencing of Killeen and Bock were two of six to occur throughout the
day, four of them floor brokers.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge rejected arguments by lawyers that the brokers should not face
prison terms because they were not properly informed by the NYSE that what they
were doing was a crime.
</P>
<P>
	   "It involved not only intentional violations of the rules but the making of
false statements and the making of false records," the judge said. "It was done
out of greed."
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution is believed to be the first case to result from illegal
personal trades made by floor brokers.
</P>
<P>
	   John Savarese, 35, and Mark Savarese, 38, both of Garden City, Edward
Mueger, 65, of Port Washington and Thomas Cavallino, 43, of Shrewsbury, N.J. had
all pleaded guilty earlier this year to unlawfully exercising investment
discretion by entering into on-floor purchases and sales of securities without
proper customer orders.
</P>
<P>
	   The Savarese brothers, both floor brokers, were each sentenced to four
months in prison to be followed by two months of home detention. Both were fined
$15,000 as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Mueger was sentenced to three months in prison and three months of home
confinement. He was also fined $15,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Cavallino was sentenced to six months of home confinement and fined
$100,000. The judge spared Cavallino a prison term but increased his fine to
make up for it after listening to pleas that he be left at home to care for his
son.

<HEADLINE> Service Merchandise's Sales Improve  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BRENTWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- Service Merchandise Co. reported
better-than-expected holiday sales that may give the retailer some breathing
room while it works through bankruptcy reorganization.
</P>
<P>
	   "This company's not dead. We're alive," said Sam Cusano, chief executive
officer of the chain of more than 220 jewelry, gift and home-decorations stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Preliminary financial information showed the company's December sales
exceeded $500 million and its gross profit margin exceeded forecasts from its
business plan by more than $5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Service Merchandise said Thursday it will substantially exceed its operating
earnings target of $35 million for the nine months ended Dec. 31. That's at
least $7 million better than the same period from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The company did not release complete financial results for the holiday sales
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Operating earnings, or earnings before certain expenses, serve as a
barometer of core business performance and are often cited by restructuring
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also said it filed a motion in U.S. Bankruptcy Court to extend
its Chapter 11 plan through April 30, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it hopes to emerge from bankruptcy in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "From the outset of our reorganization cases, the company's goal has been to
first stabilize Service Merchandise's business operations -- including
marketing, merchandising, store operations, E-commerce and other distribution
channels -- in 1999 and then formulate a 2000 business plan which, if
successful, should be the basis for the company's successful emergence from
Chapter 11 in 2001," Cusano said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stabilization of the business is only the first step of a reorganization.
However, we recognize that many challenges lie ahead before Service Merchandise
can return to long-term growth and profitability."
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Stock Exchange suspended trading of Service Merchandise stock
on Dec. 3 and asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve delisting
of the company's common stock.
</P>
<P>
	   The NYSE said the company was not meeting criteria for total stockholders'
equity and market capitalization, two measures of a company's value.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Relatives File Petition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Lawyers for the relatives of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez filed a
petition Friday to appoint a guardian for the child, a first step toward trying
to prevent the Cuban boy's return to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the attorneys nor the family would comment on the petition until
Judge Rosa Rodriguez made a decision in the case, said family spokesman Armando
Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, meanwhile, tens of thousands of people in Elian's hometown rallied
in a seaside plaza Friday night to demand his return. ``Elian, Cardenas awaits
you ... with kisses,'' a Cuban country music band sang.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after his
mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned while trying to reach Florida
by boat.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was placed with his great-uncle and great-aunt in Miami, but the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled Wednesday that he must be returned
to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14. The decision touched off angry protests in the
Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, accompanied by
one of the family's lawyers, flew to Washington on Friday to appeal directly to
Attorney General Janet Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also asked President Clinton to
reverse the order.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has said she was consulted on the INS decision and approved of it.
Clinton said Friday the INS did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe they followed the law,'' Clinton said. ``This is a volatile and
difficult case. ... We need to keep this out of the political process as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to Thursday, when two Cuban exile leaders and 133 other people
were arrested and police were forced to use tear gas to disperse a crowd,
protesters in Miami were much calmer Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Cuban exile community called for more civil disobedience. The
planned demonstrations included a vigil Friday night at the federal building in
Orlando and a large protest in Little Havana on Saturday. Protesters are also
planning to drive around Miami International Airport on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the child is sent back to Cuba without his day in court, all hell is
going to break loose,'' said Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spoke with some demonstration organizers and asked them to ``do the
demonstrations in a way that does not disrupt daily life in South Florida,
because it would hurt the cause of Elian.''
</P>
<P>
	   The rally in Cardenas, Cuba, was marked by songs, tears and personal
recollections of Elian. It was the most personal and emotional of many held
since early December, when Cuban President Fidel Castro promised mass
mobilization until the boy was returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   The speakers included classmates from Elian's elementary school, his
teacher, his school principal, and the female doctor who has been caring for him
since he was a baby.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his four grandparents and his
great-grandmother began weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage
as the group sang of the boy's mother. Gonzalez looked particularly distraught,
his eyes red from crying.
</P>
<P>
	   During the rally, many of the young children broke down in tears and were
carried out by parents or members of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
	   The petition filed Friday was on behalf of Elian Gonzalez's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez. It is an attempt by the boy's Miami relatives to get
guardianship and then to file for applications for admission to the United
States and asylum, said David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian played in his relatives' yard Friday with a puppy named Dolphin, a
gift from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. The black Labrador chased Elian
around the yard and playfully nipped at his blue soccer shorts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian tells me he does not want to go back to Cuba,'' said Delfin
Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle. He said Elian wants his family to come here.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials have suggested Elian's father come to Florida to get his son,
while the U.S. National Council of Churches said the boy's relatives in Cuba
want the organization to bring the boy back.

<HEADLINE> Fla. OKs Death Penalty Overhaul  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida lawmakers on Friday passed the second half
of a plan to overhaul the way the death penalty is administered, sending the
governor a bill to speed up executions.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers said it will shorten the appeals process and cut the time between
death sentences and executions from an average of more than 10 years to five.
</P>
<P>
	   Executions in Florida have been on hold since October, when the U.S. Supreme
Court agreed to review claims that Florida's electric chair -- which has caused
fiery and bloody executions in the past decade -- is cruel and unusual
punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to resume executions, lawmakers called a three-day special session
just to deal with the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, they passed a bill making lethal injection the state's primary
method of execution, although death row inmates would still have the option of
electrocution. Florida has used the electric chair since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Gov. Jeb Bush said he would not approve that measure without
legislation speeding up the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
	   One killer has been on Florida's death row for 25 years, and dozens of
condemned men have lived under death sentences for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he would sign both bills within days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had a year where the courts have made it clear they needed to see
some changes,'' the governor said. ``I believe today will clear the air.''
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals bill limits death row inmates to two appeals in state court in
most cases. The second appeal must be filed within six months of the first
appeal -- rather than the current one year -- and it can also be filed in the
state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the exceptions is for prisoners who have new claims they are
innocent, rather than technical complaints. They may bring up those innocence
claims in additional appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters said the bill would stop frivolous cases and bring legitimate
claims to the attention of judges more quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats who opposed the bill warned that it would lead to the execution of
innocent people. They also said the bill usurps the authority of the judicial
branch.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate voted 30-7 for the appeals bill, and the House passed it 80-35 --
just meeting the two-thirds vote needed to repeal court rules that dictate how
and when death penalty appeals are filed.
</P>
<P>
	   Some opponents complained that the Legislature was acting too quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We really spent more time talking about a license plate last session than
we have about executing people,'' said Democratic Rep. Curt Levine.
</P>
<P>
	   If the governor signs the bills as expected, only three of the 38 states
with capital punishment will still require execution by electrocution --
Georgia, Alabama and Nebraska.

<HEADLINE> Heart Transplant Raises Questions  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- A 79-year-old Canadian's new heart isn't really that new,
and his operation has kindled debate on transplant surgery ethics.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray Nelson was 14 years older than what previously was considered the
maximum age for undergoing a transplant. And the heart he received from a
55-year-old donor normally would have gone unused because of its advanced age.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Canada, the United States has no age limit for potential transplant
patients or organ donors. Cases are based on whether the individual is healthy
enough for the operation, and the condition of the organ to be donated.
</P>
<P>
	   But Nelson's Dec. 27 operation led to questions in Canada, where fewer than
200 heart transplants are performed each year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One has to wonder whether or not the process was being manipulated to
provide some advantage to someone who otherwise might not be eligible,'' said
Dr. Douglas Kinsella, a lecturer on medical ethics at the University of Calgary.
</P>
<P>
	   Nelson, a director of the Alberta Treasury Branches, a government-owned
financial institution, is well-known in provincial business and political
circles. He is also a friend of Dr. Dennis Modry, an Edmonton heart transplant
specialist.
</P>
<P>
	   Complications after a bypass operation last year forced Nelson, an active
man who used to swim at least 50 laps a day, to be hospitalized in September.
Ten days after his transplant at the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton,
he was sitting up and talking.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Arvind Koshal, regional director of the hospital's cardiac science
program, acknowledged the committee of cardiologists, social workers and others
that approved the transplant took unusual steps.
</P>
<P>
	   While 65 had been considered the maximum age for a transplant, that was
never ``carved in stone,'' Koshal said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the transplant committee asked the hospital's ethics board for
guidance in Nelson's case. The ethics board said that while age alone should not
be the determining factor, it also noted that patients needing hearts far exceed
the number of donor organs available. As many as 6,000 Canadians are considered
possible candidates for a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   After ``rigorous debate,'' Koshal said, the transplant committee voted in a
secret ballot to permit a transplant, but only if Nelson received a heart that
would otherwise go unused.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearts from donors older than 50 normally get used only for ``status four''
patients, meaning emergency cases in which ``somebody is going to die
otherwise,'' Koshal said.
</P>
<P>
	   When the heart of a 55-year-old brain dead patient became available, he
said, no emergency cases were pending. Two independent cardiologists on the
transplant committee decided the heart was not appropriate for others on the
eligibility list, so Nelson got it, Koshal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Glenn Griener of the University of Alberta's John Dossetor Health Ethics
Center questioned whether giving Nelson the heart ``amounts to substandard
medical care.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I haven't seen a coherent rationale for using this organ,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kinsella said the transplant committee's lengthy review was unusual and
seemed intended to counter any accusations that Nelson ``jumped the queue'' for
a transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   To Koshal, the decision hinged on whether cardiac patients younger than
Nelson could wait for ``a better heart.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not that we're giving him (Nelson) a bad heart,'' Koshal said. ``It's
that we're giving him one better than what he had and would give him a better
quality of life.''

<HEADLINE> US West Ordered To Refund $12.9M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- U S West failed to meet service standards in Colorado and
must refund about $12.9 million in payments to its customers, the state Public
Utilities Commission ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The refunds, to be provided as one-time bill credits, would range from 51
cents to nearly $20 per customer, depending on the number and duration of
service problems, the PUC said.
</P>
<P>
	   U S West customers from around the state complained the company failed to
meet standards such as providing new basic phone service within 150 working days
of an initial customer order and repairing most broken equipment within 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
	   U S West spokeswoman Anna Osborn said the Denver-based Baby Bell has 20 days
from when it receives the commission's order to decide whether to ask the
three-member panel to reconsider. She said it was too early to tell whether the
company would do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Friday, the commission unanimously approved the merger between U S
West and Denver-based telecommunications company Qwest Communications
International.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, originally valued at $48 billion, already has been approved by
federal antitrust regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Still
pending is approval from the Federal Communications Commission and regulators in
the seven other states in which both companies operate, Ms. Osborn said.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced in Poisoning Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A former Brown University graduate student who used
radioactive iodine to poison his ex-girlfriend was sentenced to 10 years of
probation Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge Francis Darrigan said Cheng Gu, 26, lost his chance for
a U.S. education, was shamed before his friends and family and likely would be
deported to China as a result of his crime. A prison sentence would serve no
purpose, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gu's ex-girlfriend, Yuanyuan Xiao, was not hurt because the dose was so low.
She asked the judge not to impose a harsh sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wanted the iodine to make her ugly so no one else would want her,''
prosecutor Stacey Veroni said. ``This isn't a case of a man in love or a
lovesick defendant. This is a case of domestic violence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gu, a molecular pharmacology graduate student, said he stole a radioactive
isotope of iodine from a Brown lab and spiked his girlfriend's food on more than
one occasion.
</P>
<P>
	   She was found to be contaminated during a routine procedure performed on her
before she was to conduct an experiment using radioactive materials. Brown's
radiation safety officers went to Xiao's apartment and found high levels of
radiation coming from a dish of leftovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Her roommate, James O'Brien, had also eaten the food, and was found to be
contaminated as well.

<HEADLINE> Church Supports Ecuador President  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's Roman Catholic Church on Friday said it was
not taking sides in the growing street demonstrations for President Jamil
Mahuad's resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do not intervene in party politics,'' Monsignor Jose Eguiguren told
reporters. But in an indirect show of support for the embattled president, he
said, ``We maintain the principle that democracy is and always will be the best
road, no matter how imperfect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Eguiguren said he was responding to an invitation from the leftist-led
Popular Front to hear its proposal to replace Mahuad's centrist government with
one made up of workers and grassroots organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Popular Front was one of several leftist-led organizations to lead
demonstrations on Thursday in Ecuador's main cities. Police used tear gas to
disperse about 1,000 demonstrators who tried to march on the presidential
palace, and the government called a state of emergency, giving the armed forces
authority to maintain order and detain protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Cross said at least two people were injured in confrontations with
police, including a 17-year-old male student who suffered a bullet wound in the
neck. It was unclear who fired the shot, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the last six months, Mahuad has faced increasing calls to step down from
political rivals on both the left and right, as well as business leaders and
labor unions, who accuse him of incompetence in handling Ecuador's economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador is struggling through its worst financial crisis since the 1920s.
Last year, the economy shrank 7 percent and inflation topped 60 percent, and
Ecuador's currency has plunged to 23,000 sucres to the dollar from 7,000 sucres
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad has said he plans to finish his term, which runs until January 2003,
and the politically powerful armed forces have expressed their support for him.
</P>
<P>
	   But a poll released Thursday showed that 53 percent of Ecuadoreans would
like Mahuad to step down, and only 7 percent of those surveyed expressed support
for the Harvard-educated president.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll, conducted by the private firm Cedatos, surveyed 1,800 people and
had a margin for error of plus or minus 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Paul Newman OK After Daytona Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Actor Paul Newman bruised his ribs after his
racecar crashed into a tire barrier at Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
	   Newman, 74, was examined by a doctor in the infield and later went to
Hallifax Medical Center for further evaluation following the accident Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   He was treated for bruised ribs on the upper left side of his chest. He was
in obvious pain and left the track with an ice pack strapped to his chest.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got overconfident on a fresh set of tires," Newman said. "The tires
weren't warm enough and I slipped."
</P>
<P>
	   Newman's car, a Porsche 996 GT3R, had superficial damage to the windshield,
nose and rear bumper.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a hiccup, that's all," said Kevin Jeannette, Newman's team manager.
"Paul was the unlucky one today. It's not the first time I've seen a great
driver crash a car. It happens to everyone."
</P>
<P>
	   Newman, an accomplished driver, plans to run the Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona
race next month with Gunner Jeannette, Michael Lauer and Michael Brockman.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm angry at myself," Newman said. "It was a stupid thing to do."

<HEADLINE> Big political donor accused of shredding documents to thwart probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A big political donor who was arrested last month
was indicted Friday, accused of working with an aide to shred 10 bags of
documents and delete computer files to obstruct an investigation by the Justice
Department of campaign finances.
<P>
	   David Chang, whose commodity trading companies are based in Bergen County,
also is charged with misleading a witness before he testified to the federal
grand jury, and instructing another witness to lie so that her testimony would
corroborate testimony already given by the aide.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the grand jury probe dealt with an $11,000 check from one of those
companies, Bright &AMP; Bright Corp. A Bergen County lawyer who pleaded guilty to
campaign finance charges in May said he helped Chang illegally funnel that money
to Sen. Robert Torricelli's 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrat has not been charged. He has maintained he was unaware when
unlawful donations were made and that such money has now been donated to
charity.
</P>
<P>
	   Chang's aide, Audrey Yu, was indicted last month on charges that she lied to
a grand jury. This 11-count superseding indictment adds Chang as a defendant,
charging him in four counts: conspiracy, obstructing justice, and two counts of
witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
	   It added those four charges against Yu, as well as two charges of lying to a
grand jury. She already faced five counts of lying to a grand jury about
shredding.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment does not name the witnesses, but said the man misled in
September by Chang and Yu was Bright &AMP; Bright's chairman. At the time, the
chairman was a retired admiral, Daniel J. Murphy, who was chief of staff for
George Bush when he was vice president, and a deputy director of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli spokesman Richard McGrath said Friday, "We are saddened that Mr.
Chang and Ms. Yu continue to experience these legal difficulties. They have been
friends and supporters for many years. Because these charges involve private
business transactions, and have absolutely nothing to do with campaign
activities, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further."
</P>
<P>
	   Messages left for Yu's lawyers were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Chang attorney David Schertler said his client is innocent, asserting that
the Justice Department has taken a "low-level felony allegation" about campaign
finance "and they've blown it out of proportion and attempted to create crimes
where there aren't any because of the highly charged atmosphere around campaign
finance contributions."
</P>
<P>
	   He questioned why the indictment did not charge Chang with making illegal
donations, as Berek Paul Don claimed when he pleaded guilty in May and agreed to
cooperate with investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   Don had been the Republican leader in Bergen County, which Torricelli
represented in the House before becoming a senator. Don pleaded guilty to
illegally donating $11,000 from a Bright &AMP; Bright check labeled "legal fees" by
cashing it and using the money to reimburse straw donors because Chang asked him
to get it into Torricelli's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Bright &AMP; Bright was a client of Don's law firm.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal election law limits individual contributions to $1,000 per election
to a single candidate for federal office, and prohibits corporate donations to
candidates for federal office.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin could not immediately comment on
why no campaign finance charges were brought against Chang in light of the Don
plea.
</P>
<P>
	   Chang, 55, Cresskill, and Yu, 31, of Fort Lee, are free on bail, and are to
enter pleas to the indictment on a date to be scheduled in the next two weeks.
Yu's lawyer has said she no longer works for Chang.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chang indictment followed nearly three years of investigation,
culminating with government agents spending at least four months examining
Bright &AMP; Bright's garbage, according to court papers filed by the FBI. The
indictment expands on FBI charges of shredding brought last month with his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Chang was listed by Mother Jones, a left-leaning political magazine, as one
of the top 400 donors during the 1997-98 election cycle with contributions of
$41,586 to candidates and organizations of both parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Some donations he made in 1999 were returned after the Don plea.
</P>
<P>
	   Chang was linked several years ago to the problems that toppled former Rep.
Jay Kim, R-Calif. Court records show that Kim's campaign had taken more than
$250,000 in illegal contributions, including $12,000 in 1992 from Nikko
Enterprises Inc., a Chang company. Kim was sentenced to probation. Chang
cooperated with federal authorities and was not charged.

<HEADLINE> Co. To Recall Electric Heaters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A Washington state company whose electric heaters have
been blamed for house fires and three deaths plans to recall 1.9 million heaters
next month and sell customers replacement units at reduced cost.
</P>
<P>
	   Cadet Manufacturing said Friday that the $12 million recall would begin as
soon as a federal bankruptcy judge and the Consumer Product Safety Commission
approve it, probably by the first week of February.
</P>
<P>
	   Cadet, a privately held company in Vancouver, Wash., filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection last January, citing financial pressure from a 1997 recall
and a class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Consumer Product Safety Commission had sought the recall of Cadet- or
Encore-brand heaters, saying they had resulted in three deaths, four house
fires, two serious burn injuries and more than $1.2 million in property damage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first thing we want to do is apologize,'' Cadet's president, Hutch
Johnson, said Friday at a news conference in Portland, just across the Columbia
River from Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
	   The heaters are designed to be installed inside walls or baseboards. The
safety commission said that design flaws allowed flames, sparks or molten
particles to spew through the front grill cover of the heaters.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson said the commission and the company worked together to redesign the
heaters and make them ``the safest product available.''
</P>
<P>
	   The heaters were distributed mainly in six Western states -- California,
Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming -- but they also were sold
nationally.
</P>
<P>
	   Customers will have to seek the replacement heaters directly from Cadet, not
through retailers, and will have to install the units themselves -- or hire a
licensed electrician.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson said the replacements will be sold nearly at cost, and many of the
heaters to be recalled are more than 12 years old, well beyond the eight- to
12-year service life of the units, so the upgrade will improve overall safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Cadet was founded 40 years ago. Sales were about $23 million in 1998, but
fell to $16 million last year with the bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hancock Sued Over Plan To Go Public  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- John Hancock's plan to convert to a stock company has been
met with a class-action action lawsuit filed by a policyholder who claims he and
other policyholders are not being properly compensated for their ownership in
the company.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, filed Friday in state court, challenges the John Hancock Mutual
Life Insurance Co.'s plan to shift from a mutual company -- owned by
policyholders -- to a stock company owned by stockholders.
</P>
<P>
	   State regulators and policyholders have already approved the plan. The
company plans an initial public offering later this month on the New York Stock
Exchange, and it is in the process of changing its name to John Hancock
Financial Services.
</P>
<P>
	   "The crux of the complaint is that a policyholder of John Hancock, when he
buys a policy, has an expectation that they're a part owner of the company, and
that they're going to receive what's called a participating policy," said James
M. Pietz, a lawyer representing Thomas Tierney of Framingham.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Hancock plans to give stock to eligible policyholders who
request it, Pietz argued that the plan changes the nature of the policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Tierney, an insurance actuary, has been a John Hancock policyholder for 56
years. He is also a former Hancock employee, and has been a vocal critic of the
company's plan to go public.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit also argued that the initial public offering contains
anti-takeover provisions that will lower the company's initial value to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan, which bars any investor from accumulating more than 10 percent of
the stock for three years, would initially depress the price of the stock while
protecting executives' stock options, according to Tierney and Pietz.
</P>
<P>
	   "Policyholders are not getting, we believe, fair value," Pietz said. "There
should be an open market for these shares. The anti-takeover provisions preclude
an open market."
</P>
<P>
	   A message left Friday evening for a John Hancock spokesman was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, John Hancock filed papers with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in which it said it planned to offer 102 million shares in the IPO,
at a price of between $16 and $18 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had previously estimated the shares would sell for $15 to $25.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Times Promotes Veterans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Times promoted newsroom veteran Leo
Wolinsky to executive editor Friday and created a new position to oversee the
relationship between the editorial and business departments.
</P>
<P>
	   Ardith Hilliard, editor of the San Fernando Valley edition, was named
associate editor. She's charged with implementing ethical guidelines adopted by
the paper in response to a much-criticized revenue-sharing deal with the city's
new Staples Center arena.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Staples Center incident and the subsequent analysis helped clarify the
need for these positions," Editor Michael Parks wrote in a staff memo. "Leo and
Ardie are great newsroom leaders with vision and drive."
</P>
<P>
	   Wolinsky and Hilliard will report to Parks.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolinsky, a member of two Pulitzer Prize-winning teams and one of four
managing editors at the Times, will oversee metro, business, photos and Los
Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service staffs. Times managing editors for
regional editions, projects and features will report to Wolinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Many journalists criticized the deal involving the Oct. 10 edition of Los
Angeles Times Magazine as a violation of the journalistic principle that
reporters and editors must avoid financial dealing with the people and
institutions they write about.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper has said reporters and editors who worked on the magazine didn't
know of the revenue deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper printed a front-page apology to readers Dec. 19 for failing to
disclose the arrangement, and the next day ran an unprecedented 14-page section
examining the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   That report criticized Parks, Publisher Kathryn M. Downing and the policies
of Mark Willes, a former General Mills executive who was Downing's predecessor
and now is chairman and CEO of the newspaper's parent Times Mirror Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Willes has ordered closer cooperation between the paper's advertising and
news staffs.
</P>
<P>
	   With the apology, the Times published a newly formulated statement of
journalistic principles that included remaining "free of associations or
activities that might compromise our integrity or damage our credibility."
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing the promotions at a newsroom meeting, Parks began by saying he
would not resign. Staffers cheered when he announced the promotion of Wolinsky,
who led the effort to draw up the paper's new principles and guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolinsky joined the Times in 1977 as a staff writer. He was named assistant
bureau chief in Sacramento in 1987, assistant city editor in 1989, California
political editor in 1990, city editor in 1991, metropolitan editor in 1994 and
assistant managing editor in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Hilliard has been a part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams. She joined
the Times in 1989 after working at papers including The Press of Atlantic City,
N.J., St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times, Dallas Times Herald and San Jose Mercury
News. She became editor of the Times' San Fernando Valley edition in 1997. A
replacement wasn't named for that edition.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Canadian man who worked as a contractor for the U.S.
polar program in Antarctica has died of unknown causes, officials of the
National Science Foundation announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   John G. Biesiada, 43, of St. Catharines, Ontario, was pronounced dead about
8 a.m. EST by medical personnel at McMurdo Station, the main U.S. scientific
base in Antarctica, the NSF said in a statement released Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the cause of death was not known. An autopsy is planned.
Biesiada's body was discovered at 1 a.m., Saturday, Antarctica time. McMurdo is
17 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Biesiada was a civilian radar technician working for the Space and Naval
Warfare Center at McMurdo.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said that Biesiada had passed the medical examination required of
all personnel deployed to the South Pole in the U.S. Antarctica program.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. scientific research in Antarctica is coordinated by the NSF which

<HEADLINE> Big Political Donor Indicted  </HEADLINE>

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A big political donor was indicted Friday and accused of
working with an aide to shred 10 bags of documents and delete computer files to

<HEADLINE> Gore Tries to Soothe Powell  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore called Gen. Colin Powell Friday to
express his respect for the Gulf War hero after comments by his campaign manager
earlier in the week angered the Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign manager Donna Brazile said earlier this week that Republicans
``would rather take pictures with black children than feed them,'' saying they
use Powell and Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, two of the most prominent blacks in
the GOP, to improve their image with minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Powell wrote Gore Thursday to say that he was ``disappointed and offended''
about her comments
</P>
<P>
	   Under mounting criticism, Gore called Powell to express his great respect
for the general. But campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said his comments to Powell
beyond that were personal.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehane said the two men were friends after having worked together at the
White House and Gore ``thought it was appropriate'' to personally call.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Brazile had called Powell and let him know that she
personally and the Gore campaign consider him ``an American hero.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republicans bring out Colin Powell and J.C. Watts because they have no
program, no policy,'' she said in an interview with Bloomberg.com. ``They play
that game because they have no other game. They have no love and no joy. They'd
rather take pictures with black children than feed them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Gore had stood by his campaign manager and publicly
praised Powell.
</P>
<P>
	   ``General Powell is a great hero, who I admire greatly,'' Gore said.
``Having General Powell and Congressman (J.C.) Watts in the Republican Party is,
in fact, no substitute for an agenda that supports all of our people, including
African-Americans. That is what Donna was trying to say.''
</P>
<P>
	   He defended Brazile, saying ``she's doing a great job and she will continue
doing a great job.''
</P>
<P>
	   Watts, an Oklahoma representative who is chairman of the House Republican
Conference, called the comments ``racist.'' Watts said he and Powell have
``worked hard to help African-Americans, especially children.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush called it ``slash-and-burn
politics'' and said he would ``watch and see how Vice President Gore handles
it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be an indication of the kind of administration he might have
should he win the vote,'' Bush said. ``It is unacceptable for her to have done
that to two good people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Powell has been very popular since his role as America's military leader in
the Persian Gulf War. He wrote that his involvement in numerous charities and
youth organizations is intended ``to help feed, educate and spiritually nourish
all of America's children, black and white, and not just for a photo op. And I
do so as a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
	   He asked that the Gore campaign ``not start the new century by playing the
polarizing 'race card' which immediately contaminates and destroys the
opportunity for open debate on issues of importance to our children.''
</P>
<P>
	   Brazile's blunt comments have ruffled feathers before.
</P>
<P>
	   She resigned from the presidential campaign of Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis in October 1988 after telling reporters they should check out personal
rumors about then-Republican nominee George Bush, former president and father of
the current GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this year, Brazile said ``the four pillars of the Democratic Party
are African-Americans, labor, women, and what I call other ethnic minorities.''
That comment prompted the moderate Democratic Leadership Council to caution the
Gore campaign that such a view risked alienating moderates and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Edward Kennedy, who was campaigning with Gore in Iowa Friday, said that
congressional Republicans have not, by their record, ``been the voice of the
voiceless, the dispossessed, or the minority.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the Massachusetts Democrat said Brazile's comments were unfortunate in
terms of the ``individual references.''

the killing of Shaline Sequinot, but the arrest was seen by many as a potential
breakthrough in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   "I will never give up hope," said Sister Helen Cole, of Holy Name Church in
North Camden, where the 13-year-old was found sexually assaulted and stabbed to
death. "I couldn't do the work I do without believing this will be resolved."
</P>
<P>
	   Shaline, an honor student, disappeared on Aug. 4, 1995 after riding off on a
borrowed bicycle. She was found dead three days later. She had been sexually
assaulted and stabbed 10 times, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last March, detectives traveled to Puerto Rico searching for Figueroa, a
native of the island commonwealth. Posters there said he was wanted for
questioning in Shaline's killing and on a warrant charging him in a sexual
assault case.
</P>
<P>
	   "It paid off. We're glad to have him in custody," said Camden County
Prosecutor Lee A. Solomon.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting on a tip, investigators from Camden and Camden County nabbed Figueroa
in the Tampa area Thursday night with assistance from Florida law enforcement,
Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Figueroa, 29, was being held in Florida pending extradition to New Jersey,
Solomon said. It was not known when Figueroa would return to face attempted
sexual assault charges involving a 14-year-old girl, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The alleged sexual assault attempts occurred on several dates between
January and April 1995, Solomon said. Authorities have been searching for
Figueroa since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Solomon declined comment on whether Figueroa was wanted for questioning in
Shaline's killing. So far, Figueroa has only been charged with attempted sexual
assault, and could face up to 10 years in prison, if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't identify suspects until they are charged," the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaline's killing struck a nerve in Camden, a city where a record 60 people
were killed that year. Relatives and friends put up bright yellow ribbons to
encourage anyone with information about the killing to come forward.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are people out there who know what happened," said Sister Helen. "I
just hope they have the courage to come forward."
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have revealed few clues in the murder. Human blood stains were
found inside the school, raising speculation that Shaline was killed there, but
there was not enough blood to determine whether it belonged to her.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators also revealed in August 1998 that they were searching for at
least two suspects, but did not disclose their identities. An $8,000 reward has
been offered.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Unveils Cyber-Terror Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying technology has brought with it too much ``power to
create havoc,'' President Clinton on Friday unveiled a plan to guard against
cyber-terrorism and said he will ask Congress to earmark $91 million for it in
the next budget.
</P>
<P>
	   But Republicans in Congress were skeptical of the plan, saying it doesn't
adequately protect federal computer systems. ``Under his plan, they would be
left vulnerable to hackers,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee and a cosponsor of legislation on computer security, praised Clinton
for ``focusing attention on this important issue'' but said the president's
approach needed to be examined further.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing the plan, Clinton noted that the need to ``accelerate and
broaden'' computer security was underscored by the Y2K threat and the scramble
to prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
	   The new initiative builds on steps the administration announced last year.
It would seek to develop new technologies, increase public and private
cooperation against computer sabotage, improve training for government agents
and boost protection of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his proposal includes a new program to offer college
scholarships to students in the field of computer security, on the condition
that they perform public service afterward, creating ``a new generation of
computer security specialists who will work to defend our nation's computers.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This plan is not the end of the discussion, but the beginning of a
dialogue with Congress, with the American people and especially with the private
sector,'' Clinton said of his proposal, which was three years in the making.
</P>
<P>
	   The $91 million cyberspace initiative is part of a $2 billion proposal for
maintaining the security of the nation's increasingly digitalized
infrastructure. Clinton said he would work to ensure that the security
initiatives do not tread on privacy rights of citizens and businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is essential that we do not undermine liberty in the name of liberty,''
he said. ``I hope that ... we will work together to ensure that information
technology will create unprecedented prosperity in the 21st century in an
atmosphere and environment that makes all Americans more secure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate special committee on the
Y2K problem, said he worries about overlap between security responsibilities of
the Pentagon, the FBI and other agencies that could cause ``private-sector
reluctance in sharing information about high-tech vulnerabilities.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president's plan is a good start,'' Bennett said. ``But Congress and
the administration must work ... in partnership with private industry to
preserve privacy and competition while meeting modern defense challenges.''
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to reporters before departing to West Virginia for the Middle East
peace talks, Clinton said the New Year's Y2K threat underscored ``how really
interconnected we all are'' -- and revealed how one person can use a computer
for good or sinister purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has never been a time like this, in which we have the power to
create knowledge and the power to create havoc, and both those powers rest in
the same hands,'' Clinton said. ``Today our critical systems, from power
structures to air traffic control, are connected and run by computers. We must
make those systems more secure so that America can be more secure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has frequently expressed concern about the emerging threat that
other governments, hackers and thieves pose to a nation and a world now
dependent on high technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The new initiative builds on steps the administration announced last year.
It would seek to develop new technologies, increase public and private
cooperation against computer sabotage, improve training for government agents
and boost protection of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Last July, the administration announced that it was creating a
government-wide security network to protect against hackers. The plan included
an elaborate network of electronic obstacles, monitors and analyzers to watch
for suspicious activity. The first 500 intrusion monitors were to be installed
on nonmilitary government computers early this year, and the full system was to
be completed by May 2003.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Demands Return of Boy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- In Cuba's most emotional demonstration since an
international custody battle broke out over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, tens of
thousands of people from the boy's hometown rallied in a seaside plaza Friday
night to demand his return from Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Marked by tears, songs and personal recollections, the rally matched the
emotional content of angry demonstrations by Cuban exiles in Miami who fiercely
oppose a U.S. government decision to return Elian to his father's home here.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian, Cardenas awaits you ... with kisses,'' a Cuban band sang.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his four grandparents and his
great-grandmother began weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage
as the group sang of his mother, who was lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez looked particularly exhausted and distraught, his eyes red from
crying.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been at the center of an international custody battle since
fishermen found him lashed to an inner tube floating off the coast of Florida on
Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami, has temporary custody of the
boy and want to keep him permanently in the United States. He says he can give
Elian a better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has demanded that his child be returned to him, and the U.S.
government has ruled that the father and child should be reunited by next
Friday, Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally in Cardenas was the most personal and emotional of many held since
early December when President Fidel Castro promised mass mobilization until the
boy was returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   The speakers included classmates from Elian's elementary school, his
teacher, his school principal, and the doctor who has been caring for him since
he was a baby.
</P>
<P>
	   In a homage to the small boy with dark eyes who loves all things that fly,
two kites sailed high over the rally -- one of them flown by a boy named Julio.
</P>
<P>
	   It was imprinted with Elian's portrait and read, ``Julio claims you,
Eliancito.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the rally, many of the young children broke down in tears and were
carried out by parents or members of the Red Cross.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela To Sue US Customs Service  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The Venezuelan government plans to sue the U.S.
Customs Service for seizing millions of dollars from a bank during a major
international money laundering sting.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit will be presented in Venezuelan courts, and could reach $8 million,
Banco Industrial de Venezuela president Fernando Alvarez Paz said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Ministry and Attorney General's office confirmed Alvarez Paz's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Banco Industrial claims that U.S. Customs agents illegally seized $4 million
during the May 1998 undercover operation, the largest anti-money laundering
sting in U.S. history. More than 100 Mexicans and Venezuelans were arrested, and
millions of dollars seized.
</P>
<P>
	   Alvarez Paz said his bank would also present its case to recover the funds
to a Los Angeles court in a trial set to begin May 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Banco Industrial was implicated in the case when its branch manager in
Miami, Esperanza Matos, was arrested in 1998 and later convicted of money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
	   A California court exonerated the bank of legal responsibility last
February.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Debate Again  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush
said Friday night that South Carolinians should decide for themselves whether
the Confederate flag should fly atop their statehouse, finessing a
racially-tinged question in campaign debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe the people of South Carolina can figure out what to do with this
flag issue,'' Bush said in the opening moments of the second Republican debate
in as many nights. The question itself drew a chorus of boos from South
Carolinians gathered to watch the six-man Republican field address the issues.
And when moderator Brian Williams pursued the issue, the booing grew louder.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain, who has campaigned hard in the state, defended anew the
letters he has written to federal agencies on behalf of campaign donors.
``Whenever a constituent of mine or a citizen ... can't get an answer ... I
believe that people like me should weigh in,'' said McCain, who wrote the
letters in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator was addressing a question about an Associated Press story
detailing a letter he wrote last year on behalf of Ameritech, which was seeking
permission to merge with SBC, another phone company.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter-writing issue is a troubling one for McCain, whose candidacy has

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Settles Bias Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Wal-Mart will provide two deaf job applicants
employment and $132,500 to settle a discrimination case.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeremy Fass and William Darnell filed complaints with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission after they were both turned down for night jobs at a
Tucson Wal-Mart. Both men said they were refused jobs in the stocking and
unloading area because they are deaf.
</P>
<P>
	   "We realize that in this instance, we did something wrong at the local
level," said Mike Maher, a spokesman for the Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
	   The EEOC and the Arizona Center for Disability Law filed suit in federal
court in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement calls for them to be offered jobs with corporate service
dates of Sept. 1, 1995. In addition to the $66,250 each they will receive, Fass
and Darnell will be paid their share of profit-sharing and be reimbursed for
out-of-pocket expenses that would have been covered by Wal-Mart's health plan
had they been hired.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart will make a number of policy changes, including adding
closed-captioning on training videos and making other changes to reasonably
accommodate deaf employees.

<HEADLINE> Man Steals Plane, Dies in Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARYSVILLE, Wash. (AP) -- A man who stole a small plane with half a tank of
gas Friday was killed when it clipped power lines above Interstate 5, flipped
upside down and slid under an overpass.
</P>
<P>
	   No cars were hit on the freeway, and the pilot, the only person aboard, was
the sole casualty, said fire Lt. Jeff Thornton in Marysville, about 30 miles
north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Patrol identified the man as Randy Lee Yttri, 45.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane's owner said there was nothing of value aboard, and it was not
clear why Yttri stole the craft. A warrant had been issued for his arrest last
month for delivery of dangerous drugs, said Lt. Walt Fisch of the Washington
State Patrol.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisch said Federal Aviation Administration investigators found only a small
amount of gas in the 1966 single-engine Cessna 150G's tank, and they suspected a
power loss downed the plane.

<P>
	   The letter-writing issue is a troubling one for McCain, whose candidacy has
flourished on the basis of his call for a ridding the nation's political system
of the influence of big-monied special interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain and the other contenders, Steven Forbes, Alan Keyes, Gary Bauer
and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, were meeting in South Carolina before that state
holds a primary on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   As he has numerous times in the campaign, Bauer stressed his unalterable
opposition to abortion, saying that even if a relative were raped, ``I would
explain she couldn't make right the terrible thing that happened to her by
taking the life of an unborn child.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes was passionate on the same subject. Asked whether he would rather face
another Democratic administration or live with a pro-choice Republican in the
White House, he said, ``I don't think that has to be out choice. ... This party
was born in principle. This party will die if it doesn't stand by its decision
of principle.''
</P>
<P>
	   The debate produced a flourish or two -- the contenders fielded questions
submitted by the internet, for example. And for the first time in their
campaign, they were asked about their own charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch said he and his wife give away about 11 percent of their income.
</P>
<P>
	   The hour-long debate came 24 hours after the GOP contenders met on stage in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday night, in a sometimes-raucous debate at the University of New
Hampshire, McCain defended his action as chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee in prodding the Federal Communications Commission to act on a license
request from one of his campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator has made campaign finance reform a cornerstone of his
presidential campaign, saying that money is corrupting the political process.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most objective observers believe the FCC hasn't done their job,'' he told
a questioner. ``That's my obligation as a senator and as the chairman of a
powerful committee.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has not only focused his campaign on New Hampshire, which holds the
nation's first primary election on Feb. 1, but also South Carolina, where voters
go to the polls on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   A Nov. 27 survey by CNN/Time magazine showed Bush leading McCain 62 percent
to 15 percent in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and Forbes entered Friday's debate arguing over a new TV ad in which
the publisher contends Bush broke a 1994 tax pledge by supporting Texas
legislation that would have raised some business taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to the ad, Bush said he had cut taxes twice as Texas governor,
despite the legislation Forbes pointed out. Bush also trumpeted the five-year,
$483 billion tax-cut plan he has proposed as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The plan that I've laid out is the plan I'm campaigning on,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meeting with New Hampshire reporters before flying to South Carolina, the
governor said the ad was reminiscent of attack ads Forbes aired against Bob Dole
in the last presidential primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said it was a sign that Forbes' ``political clock is ticking down.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's now reacting in the year 2000 like he did in '96,'' Bush said. ``He
must be beginning to feel that sense of gloom that affects a candidate who
cannot sell his message in a positive way.''

<HEADLINE> 'Hurricane' Fights Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL NOWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- While a movie about his 20-year battle to clear his
name plays in theaters, Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter would rather talk about the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My life is dedicated to executing the death penalty,'' Carter said Friday
before making a speech at the sold-out Great Aunt Stella Center. ``It does not
belong in life.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ex-boxer, who never wavered in his claim that he was innocent of a
triple murder in a New Jersey bar in 1966, was wrongfully convicted and
sentenced to three life terms. He narrowly escaped the electric chair and spent
the next 19 years in prison until his case drew international attention from the
likes of songwriter Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
	   Dylan's 1975 song ``Hurricane'' made Carter a celebrity. Still, it would be
years before he was freed and his reputation was restored. Now, he is the
subject of ``The Hurricane,'' a new movie starring Denzel Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've had books written about me and movies made about me and songs written
about me,'' Carter said, his voice dropping to a near-whisper. ``If my life
isn't a miracle, there aren't any miracles anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, who lives in Canada, was in Charlotte to deliver the keynote speech
at a conference on criminal justice and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The conference comes as the number of executions is rising. The 98
executions in the U.S. last year represented a 30 percent increase over 1998 and
the highest total since 1951, when there were 105.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter has been joined by retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, some members of
Congress and the American Bar Association in calling for a national moratorium
on executions.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted the irony in the conference's subtitle: ``Executions in a Civilized
Society.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any society that promotes the death penalty cannot be civilized, so it's
an oxymoron,'' he said. ``The United States is the only Western industrialized
nation in the world that refuses to do away with it. That makes the U.S.
uncivilized.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Relatives File Petition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Lawyers for relatives of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez filed a
petition Friday to appoint a guardian for the child, a first step toward trying
to prevent the Cuban boy's return to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the attorneys nor the family would comment on the petition until
Judge Rosa Rodriguez makes a ruling, said family spokesman Armando Gutierrez.
Rodriguez will make a decision early next week, said Selena Rios, the
administrator for the Office of Family Court in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, meanwhile, tens of thousands of people in Elian's hometown rallied
in a seaside plaza Friday night to demand his return. ``Elian, Cardenas awaits
you ... with kisses,'' a Cuban country music band sang.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after his
mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned while trying to reach Florida
by boat.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was placed with his great-uncle and great-aunt in Miami, but the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled Wednesday that he must be returned
to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14. The decision touched off angry protests in the
Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, accompanied by
one of the family's lawyers, flew to Washington on Friday to appeal directly to
Attorney General Janet Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also asked President Clinton to
reverse the order.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has said she was consulted on the INS decision and approved of it.
Clinton said Friday the INS did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe they followed the law,'' Clinton said. ``This is a volatile and
difficult case. ... We need to keep this out of the political process as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to Thursday, when two Cuban exile leaders and 133 other people
were arrested and police were forced to use tear gas to disperse a crowd,
protesters in Miami were much calmer Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Cuban exile community called for more civil disobedience. The
planned demonstrations included a vigil Friday night at the federal building in
Orlando and a large protest in Little Havana on Saturday. Protesters are also
planning to drive around Miami International Airport on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the child is sent back to Cuba without his day in court, all hell is
going to break loose,'' said Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spoke with some demonstration organizers and asked them to ``do the
demonstrations in a way that does not disrupt daily life in South Florida,
because it would hurt the cause of Elian.''
</P>
<P>
	   The rally in Cardenas, Cuba, was marked by songs, tears and personal
recollections of Elian. It was the most personal and emotional of many held
since early December, when Cuban President Fidel Castro promised mass
mobilization until the boy was returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   The speakers included classmates from Elian's elementary school, his
teacher, his school principal, and the female doctor who has been caring for him
since he was a baby.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his four grandparents and his
great-grandmother began weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage
as the group sang of the boy's mother. Gonzalez looked particularly distraught,
his eyes red from crying.
</P>
<P>
	   During the rally, many of the young children broke down in tears and were
carried out by parents or members of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
	   The petition filed Friday was on behalf of Elian Gonzalez's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez. It is an attempt by the boy's Miami relatives to get
guardianship and then to file for applications for admission to the United
States and asylum, said David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian played in his relatives' yard Friday with a puppy named Dolphin, a
gift from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. The black Labrador chased Elian
around the yard and playfully nipped at his blue soccer shorts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian tells me he does not want to go back to Cuba,'' said Delfin
Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle. He said Elian wants his family to come here.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials have suggested Elian's father come to Florida to get his son,
while the U.S. National Council of Churches said the boy's relatives in Cuba
want the organization to bring the boy back.

<HEADLINE> 'Puffy' Faces Shooting Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Rap mogul Sean "Puffy" Combs was sued Friday for $50
million by a man who was shot in a Times Square-area nightclub last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Thompson, 38, of Danbury, Conn., alleges he was shot in the right
shoulder by Combs protege Jamal Barrow during a dispute in Club NY on Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other people were wounded in the shooting, and one is suing Combs and
Barrow for $100 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Barrow, 19, has been indicted on weapons and attempted murder charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs has said he was not involved in the shooting. He is charged with
illegal possession of a gun that was found in his sport utility vehicle minutes
after he and girlfriend Jennifer Lopez fled the club.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson sued Combs, Barrow, Club NY and a company that was handling
security at the club.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs' lawyer Harvey Slovis called Thompson's complaint "another in the
unending lawsuits against Puffy Combs, who did nothing that night. It is a
frivolous lawsuit. He is not responsible for what Jamal Barrow does."
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Nolan, Thompson's lawyer, said Combs was sued because it is unclear
whether the rapper encouraged Barrow to fire and whether Combs had a gun in the
club. Nolan said that if he learns that Combs did nothing illegal, he will amend
the complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   Barrow's attorney did not return a message seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Gore Backpedals on Gay Policy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, under fire from military
brass and some of his own political allies, backpedaled Friday from a statement
that he would require his appointees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to support his
policy that gays should be allowed to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I meant to convey was I would not tolerate, nor would any commander
in chief, nor would any president tolerate orders not being followed,'' he told
reporters at a hastily convened news conference after a campaign rally at a Des
Moines-area high school.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spoke two days after his original comments at a debate and after two
days of dissent from former members of the joint chiefs and from Sen. John
Kerry, a Vietnam veteran campaigning for Gore in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did not mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of inquiry into
the personal political opinions of officers in the U.S. military,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president's remarks Friday evening matched those that that Bill
Bradley gave Wednesday night in New Hampshire, when the two men were asked if
they would use a litmus test for appointments to the joint chiefs agreements
that gays should be allowed to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Wednesday: ``I would insist before appointing anybody to the joint
chiefs of staff that that individual support my policy and yes, I would make
that a requirement.'' Gore has insisted he would allow gays to serve openly in
the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination, said that night that a
litmus test was unnecessary because military officers follow orders from their
commander in chief no matter what.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, was not the only Gore supporter who took
issue with the vice president's on remarks Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   At the high school where Gore campaigned Friday with his daughter Karenna,
Carolyn Klein, 59, said such a requirement for the joint chiefs was wrong
because people can work together even if they disagree.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not everybody agrees with me on my job either,'' the woman from Pella,
Iowa said, adding she thought Gore was spending too much time on the question.
``I think that's the least of our issues right now, We have so many problems to
work on that he's making too much of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kerry, a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, said Friday that he generally
supports allowing gays to serve in the military, but that in some very rare
situations, commanders should have flexibility to remove someone from a unit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's say tomorrow you're at war and you had an immediate mission need,''
he said. ``You're going to have to allow some kind of capacity for people to
make those kinds of command judgments.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another military veteran, Arizona Sen. John McCain, called the Wednesday
night pledge by Gore ``a disgraceful statement'' during a South Carolina GOP
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Pentagon, the Gore statements on the pledge of support were viewed as
campaign talk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Candidates for political office are certainly free to do that and must do
that in order to explain their views to the American people,'' said Rear Adm.
Craig Quigley, a spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen said Thursday.
``But I would not speculate as to what that may or may not mean a year from
now.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Pressed FCC on Phone Merger  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two weeks after Ameritech's chairman held a fund-raiser
for him, Sen. John McCain sent a stinging letter to federal regulators accusing
them of being unfair toward the phone giant's proposed merger with another Bell
company, memos show.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's letter of last April 12 stated that the Senate Commerce Committee
chairman and some of his colleagues were ``extremely troubled'' by the Federal
Communications Commission's handling of the proposed merger between SBC
Communications and Ameritech.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter signed by the Arizona senator accused the commission of
``applying a different, and much stricter, burden of proof in this merger
proceeding than the commission has applied in evaluating other mergers.''
</P>
<P>
	   It also said, ``This letter expresses no view on the merits of any issues in
this proceeding and is not written to benefit any particular party.''
</P>
<P>
	   The letter followed on the heels of a $1,000-per-person fund-raiser hosted
March 30 at a Chicago hotel by Ameritech chief Richard Notebaert, a member of
McCain's fund-raising team.
</P>
<P>
	   At a debate Friday night, McCain was questioned about the Ameritech letter
and said ``all the times when I have weighed in, I have asked them to do their
duty and to expedite the procedures as they're laid out under the law and
according to existing regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will continue to do that job, and when a constituent, a person of mine
who has trouble -- or a citizen of this country who can't get a reaction or an
answer from a bureaucracy that's paid for with their tax dollars -- I believe
that people like me should weigh in,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain letter, like one relating to a different FCC matter that surfaced
earlier in the week, came to light at a pivotal time for McCain in his bid for
the Republican presidential nomination. The Arizona senator has risen in the
polls while campaigning as an advocate of overhauling the campaign finance
system and ridding the nation's political system of what he calls the
``pernicious'' influence of money.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Ameritech, a Midwest phone giant, had been trying for months to
get FCC approval for its merger with SBC, which is based in the Southwest. The
deal, which eventually was approved, created the nation's largest local phone
company.
</P>
<P>
	   A flier for the fund-raiser hailed McCain as a ``leader in the most critical
issues facing the country'' and praised his efforts to deregulate the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters and fund-raising fliers were obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Ameritech denied any connection between the fund-raiser and McCain's letter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was totally Dick Notebaert's personal involvement as a member of the
host committee in Chicago,'' said spokesman Dave Pacholczyk. ``It was personal
for Mr. Notebaert.''
</P>
<P>
	   That campaign theme has struck a chord among independents, according to
public opinion polls, and has helped vault McCain into a highly competitive race
with Texas Gov. George W. Bush in New Hampshire, the nation's first primary
state.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was hardly alone in his letter writing. The FCC said this week it had
received between 7,000 and 8,000 pieces of correspondence a year from lawmakers
in the past three years about issues pending before the agency. No figures were
available for other regulatory and administrative agencies of the government.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain acknowledges he often writes letters as a committee chairman to
regulatory agencies, and that some involve companies that donate to him.
</P>
<P>
	   He has suggested his campaign finance proposals, which would restrict
corporate donations to political parties, would help eliminate inevitable
appearance-of-conflict questions that arise under such circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Ameritech matter, FCC Chairman Bill Kennard sent letters to both
companies in the first part of April expressing ``serious concern'' about their
deal, which would create a company controlling one-third of the nation's phone
lines.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain responded April 12 in a letter to Kennard: ``Your improvisational
process will only kill more time and raise the chances of a legally flawed
decision.'' The letter also was signed by Sens. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., and Sam
Brownback, R-Kan.
</P>
<P>
	   A month later, McCain sent another letter to the FCC, criticizing agency
personnel for public statements about the merger and accusing the commission of
bias.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You must do whatever is necessary to remove the institutional unfairness
and prejudgment that has been permitted to taint this proceeding,'' McCain
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, Ameritech's Notebaert was host for a second fund-raiser for
McCain at a Chicago club.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee chairmen routinely are entertained at fund-raisers in their honor
or receive donations from executives of companies under their jurisdiction. And
lawmakers, particularly chairmen, write hundreds of letters a year on behalf of
companies and constituents involved in matters at federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   In this case, employees of Ameritech and their families and the company's
political action committee had contributed $16,000 to McCain's presidential
campaign through Sept. 30, his ninth most generous giver. SBC Communications
employees and their families and the company PAC had given a total of $9,750.

<HEADLINE> California Gets Massive New Dam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHLAND, Calif. (AP) -- A massive new flood-control dam built to safeguard 3
million people but criticized by environmentalists was dedicated Friday in the
foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   The $420 million Seven Oaks Dam, erected above the growing sprawl of the
inland region east of Los Angeles, is the cornerstone of a $1.5 billion effort
to lessen the effects of catastrophic floods along the 75-mile course of the
Santa Ana River.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics worry that the dam, which is designed to hold back water only during
periods of heavy runoff, could evolve into a semi-permanent reservoir,
jeopardizing its flood-control objectives and destroying wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
	   The 550-foot-high earth-and-rock structure was nine years in the making and
is the 12th-highest dam in the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   While this winter is one of the driest on record for Southern California,
the channel has been hit several times in the past by massive runoff from the
towering mountain range.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest of those storms was in 1938, when high water killed 100 people
and destroyed nearly all the bridges along the river in Orange County, according
to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which oversaw the dam's construction.
</P>
<P>
	   Such an event, called a 100-year-flood, has just a 1 percent chance of
striking in any given year, according to the Corps.
</P>
<P>
	   But the stakes are higher today than in pre-World War II California: In the
river's flood plain now are thousands of homes and businesses. Damage from a
major flood could reach $15 billion in San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange
counties, the Corps estimated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Flood warnings out here are in hours,'' Corps spokesman Herb Nesmith said.
``You might not need (the dam) for 10 years, but that 11th year you might need
it two or three times. We don't want to gamble with public safety.''
</P>
<P>
	   A tunnel at the dam's base allows the river to pass through during normal
runoff periods. During a flood, gates will seal the tunnel and hold back the
water. It would then be released slowly so the river stays within its banks
downstream.

<HEADLINE> Confederate Flag Supporters Rally  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM DAVENPORT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- With a bell ringing for South Carolina's Confederate
War dead, Confederate flag supporters began a three-day rally Friday at the only
statehouse where the Confederate flag still flies from the dome.
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederate flag, with its field of red and star-studded blue cross, is
seen as symbol of hate by some opponents. But groups like those gathering at the
rally see it as a symbol of Southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina remains the only state that flies the flag above its
Statehouse, and the NAACP has called a tourism boycott of South Carolina until
the Legislature brings it down.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-day rally shows ``it's OK for us to care about and promote our
heritage,'' said the Rev. Bobby Eubanks, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   As each name of a fallen Confederate soldier was read, a small, gold-colored
bell was rung. By sundown, about 50 people had gathered, some in full battle
dress, with bayonets and mess cups at their side. Supporters hoped to draw
thousands to the rally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are honoring these men who sacrificed everything they had,'' said
Denise Woods of the Order of the Confederate Rose.
</P>
<P>
	   The group planned to spend a full day reading about 18,600 names from the
Confederate Book of the Dead -- about 7,400 others are illegible.
</P>
<P>
	   The reading was expected to continue through the night and finish Saturday
morning. On Saturday, there was to be a march to the Statehouse from a cemetery
that has numerous Confederate graves, and a prayer service was set for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   H.K. Edgerton, a former NAACP chapter president from Asheville, N.C., joined
in reading the names.
</P>
<P>
	   Too many people ``can't understand the love black people and white had for
each other in the South'' he said. ``If the NAACP is successful, all you will
have done is alienated white people who have been very tolerant.''
</P>
<P>
	   A black man who refused to give his name walked around the Statehouse
grounds with two small signs taped to a cane: ``I too sing America'' and ``I too
am America.''
</P>
<P>
	   The flag issue came up in the opening moments of a debate among Republican
presidential candidates, held a few miles away from the rally.
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush said South Carolinians should decide for themselves whether
the flag should fly atop their statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, publisher Steve Forbes also called it a local issue. Arizona Sen.
John McCain said: ``To me personally, I understand how it could be offensive to
some people, but I had ancestors who fought in the Confederate Army and I
thought they fought honorably.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also said he had resented it when the NAACP announced a boycott of
his state to pressure officials to approve a holiday honoring the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore ``supports the
right of the people of South Carolina to remove the Confederate flag,'' his
spokeswoman Laura Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wouldn't fly it,'' said his opponent, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Buchanan, a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, said the
Southerners ``ought to be respected and so should the flag under which they
fought and died.''
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina raised the Confederate flag over its Statehouse in 1962 to
commemorate the Civil War's centennial.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Sen. Kerry Campaigns for Gore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry campaigned for Vice
President Al Gore on Friday, but voiced disagreement with Gore's statements at a
Wednesday debate on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said in a New Hampshire debate with rival Bill Bradley on Wednesday he
would require his nominees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree with his policy
to allow gays to serve openly.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday night, Gore backpedaled on that statement, saying at a hastily
convened news conference in Des Moines, Iowa: ``What I meant to convey was I
would not tolerate, nor would any commander in chief, nor would any president
tolerate orders not being followed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley did not voice such a requirement, but said good soldiers would
follow the president's orders. On Friday, Gore altered his statement to conform
to Bradley's view.
</P>
<P>
	   The president would not be able to change the current ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy without consent of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerry told The Boston Globe on Thursday that Bradley and Gore were wrong not
to allow leeway for commanders of small, specialized units to choose members
without the hindrance of broad policies.
</P>
<P>
	   He said, for example, it would be impractical to remove everyone else in a
unit if they became disruptive because of one person's sexual orientation. He
also said the flexibility to remove an individual -- whether that person was
gay, homophobic or bigoted -- could help prevent violence in a unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerry said after a meeting with veterans at a Portsmouth restaurant that
integrating gays into the military will take time, just as it took time to
integrate minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there's a transition process in certain units where you have to be
sensitive to 'don't ask, don't tell' as a means of changing the culture,
changing the ethic. And it takes a little time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerry said he didn't think Gore wanted to require military nominees to agree
with his policy before they were appointed, just that they follow orders.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the debate, Gore has been criticized by conservatives and military
officers who believe such a requirement is out of line.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would say, knowing people who have held the position before and some who
serve now, that there are some who would take themselves out of the running
rather than submit to such a litmus test,'' Gen. Charles Krulak, retired
commandant of the Marine Corps, told The New York Times.

<HEADLINE> Big political donor accused of shredding documents to thwart probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A big political donor who was arrested last month
was indicted Friday, accused of working with an aide to shred 10 bags of
documents and delete computer files to obstruct an investigation by the Justice
Department of campaign finances.
<P>
	   David Chang, whose commodity trading companies are based in Bergen County,
also is charged with misleading a witness before he testified to the federal
grand jury, and instructing another witness to lie so that her testimony would
corroborate testimony already given by the aide.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the grand jury probe dealt with an $11,000 check from one of those
companies, Bright &AMP; Bright Corp. A Bergen County lawyer who pleaded guilty to
campaign finance charges in May said he helped Chang illegally funnel that money
to Sen. Robert Torricelli's 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Jersey Democrat has not been charged. He has maintained he was
unaware when unlawful donations were made and that such money has now been
donated to charity.
</P>
<P>
	   Chang's aide, Audrey Yu, was indicted last month on charges that she lied to
a grand jury. This 11-count superseding indictment adds Chang as a defendant,
charging him in four counts: conspiracy, obstructing justice, and two counts of
witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
	   It added those four charges against Yu, as well as two charges of lying to a
grand jury. She already faced five counts of lying to a grand jury about
shredding. Yu faces up to 70 years in prison if convicted on all counts, while
Chang's charges carry up to 35 years. The charges carry about $250,000 each in
fines.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment does not name the witnesses, but said the man misled in
September by Chang and Yu was Bright &AMP; Bright's chairman. At the time, the
chairman was a retired admiral, Daniel J. Murphy, who was chief of staff for
George Bush when he was vice president, and a deputy director of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli spokesman Richard McGrath said Friday, "We are saddened that Mr.
Chang and Ms. Yu continue to experience these legal difficulties. They have been
friends and supporters for many years. Because these charges involve private
business transactions, and have absolutely nothing to do with campaign
activities, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further."
</P>
<P>
	   Messages left for Yu's lawyers were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Chang attorney David Schertler said his client is innocent, asserting that
the Justice Department has taken a "low-level felony allegation" about campaign
finance "and they've blown it out of proportion and attempted to create crimes
where there aren't any because of the highly charged atmosphere around campaign
finance contributions."
</P>
<P>
	   He questioned why the indictment did not charge Chang with making illegal
donations, as Berek Paul Don claimed when he pleaded guilty in May and agreed to
cooperate with investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   Don had been the Republican leader in Bergen County, which Torricelli
represented in the House before becoming a senator. Don pleaded guilty to
illegally donating $11,000 from a Bright &AMP; Bright check labeled "legal fees" by
cashing it and using the money to reimburse straw donors because Chang asked him
to get it into Torricelli's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Bright &AMP; Bright was a client of Don's law firm.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal election law limits individual contributions to $1,000 per election
to a single candidate for federal office, and prohibits corporate donations to
candidates for federal office.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said he could not comment on why
no campaign finance charges were brought against Chang in light of the Don plea
because "the entire investigation is still under way."
</P>
<P>
	   Chang, 55, Cresskill, and Yu, 31, of Fort Lee, are free on bail, and are to
enter pleas to the indictment on a date to be scheduled in the next two weeks.
Yu's lawyer has said she no longer works for Chang.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chang indictment followed nearly three years of investigation,
culminating with government agents spending at least four months examining
Bright &AMP; Bright's garbage, according to court papers filed by the FBI. The
indictment expands on FBI charges of shredding brought last month with his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Chang was listed by Mother Jones, a left-leaning political magazine, as one
of the top 400 donors during the 1997-98 election cycle with contributions of
$41,586 to candidates and organizations of both parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Some donations he made in 1999 were returned after the Don plea.
</P>
<P>
	   Chang was linked several years ago to the problems that toppled former Rep.
Jay Kim, R-Calif. Court records show that Kim's campaign had taken more than
$250,000 in illegal contributions, including $12,000 in 1992 from Nikko
Enterprises Inc., a Chang company. Kim was sentenced to probation. Chang
cooperated with federal authorities and was not charged.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore called Gen. Colin Powell Friday to
express his respect for the Gulf War hero after comments by his campaign manager
earlier in the week angered the Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign manager Donna Brazile said earlier this week that Republicans
``would rather take pictures with black children than feed them,'' saying they
use Powell and Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, two of the most prominent blacks in
the GOP, to improve their image with minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Powell wrote Gore Thursday to say that he was ``disappointed and offended''
about her comments.
</P>
<P>
	   Under mounting criticism, Gore called Powell to express his great respect
for the general.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're friends of long standing ... it was a very friendly and warm
conversation,'' Gore said. ``I reaffirmed my total respect and regard for him as
an American hero, for him as a national leader and for him as a personal
friend.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president would not say whether he apologized to Powell for
Brazile's comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Brazile had called Powell and let him know that she
personally and the Gore campaign consider him ``an American hero.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republicans bring out Colin Powell and J.C. Watts because they have no
program, no policy,'' she said in an interview with Bloomberg.com. ``They play
that game because they have no other game. They have no love and no joy. They'd
rather take pictures with black children than feed them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Gore had stood by his campaign manager and publicly
praised Powell.
</P>
<P>
	   ``General Powell is a great hero, who I admire greatly,'' Gore said.
``Having General Powell and Congressman (J.C.) Watts in the Republican Party is,
in fact, no substitute for an agenda that supports all of our people, including
African-Americans. That is what Donna was trying to say.''
</P>
<P>
	   He defended Brazile, saying ``she's doing a great job and she will continue
doing a great job.''
</P>
<P>
	   Watts, an Oklahoma representative who is chairman of the House Republican
Conference, called the comments ``racist.'' Watts said he and Powell have
``worked hard to help African-Americans, especially children.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush called it ``slash-and-burn
politics'' and said he would ``watch and see how Vice President Gore handles
it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be an indication of the kind of administration he might have
should he win the vote,'' Bush said. ``It is unacceptable for her to have done
that to two good people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Powell has been very popular since his role as America's military leader in
the Persian Gulf War. He wrote that his involvement in numerous charities and
youth organizations is intended ``to help feed, educate and spiritually nourish
all of America's children, black and white, and not just for a photo op. And I
do so as a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
	   He asked that the Gore campaign ``not start the new century by playing the
polarizing 'race card' which immediately contaminates and destroys the
opportunity for open debate on issues of importance to our children.''
</P>
<P>
	   Brazile's blunt comments have ruffled feathers before.
</P>
<P>
	   She resigned from the presidential campaign of Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis in October 1988 after telling reporters they should check out personal
rumors about then-Republican nominee George Bush, former president and father of
the current GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this year, Brazile said ``the four pillars of the Democratic Party
are African-Americans, labor, women, and what I call other ethnic minorities.''
That comment prompted the moderate Democratic Leadership Council to caution the
Gore campaign that such a view risked alienating moderates and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Edward Kennedy, who was campaigning with Gore in Iowa Friday, said that
congressional Republicans have not, by their record, ``been the voice of the
voiceless, the dispossessed, or the minority.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the Massachusetts Democrat said Brazile's comments were unfortunate in
terms of the ``individual references.''

</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain, Keyes, Bauer and the two other contenders, Steven Forbes and

city, before an occasionally raucous audience that booed at questions deemed to
be impertinent.
</P>
<P>

Confederate flag, which flies atop the Statehouse.
</P>

flag issue,'' the Texas governor replied, declining to take sides in a
racially-tinged issue. Moderator Brian Williams sought to pursue the issue, but
the crowd booed louder, and Bush merely repeated that he thought it was an issue
for South Carolinians to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who has campaigned hard in the state, defended anew the letters he
has written to federal agencies on behalf of campaign donors. ``Whenever a
constituent of mine or a citizen ... can't get an answer ... I believe that
people like me should weigh in,'' said McCain, who wrote the letters in his
capacity as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>

detailing a letter he wrote last year on behalf of Ameritech, which was seeking
permission to merge with SBC, another phone company.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter-writing issue is a troubling one for McCain, whose candidacy has
flourished on the basis of his call for a ridding the nation's political system
of the influence of big-monied special interests.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Major Faces Court-Martial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Air Force major said Friday he faces a court-martial
for refusing to take the anthrax vaccine because he fears it could jeopardize
his health.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Sonnie Bates, a pilot stationed at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, is
believed to be the highest-ranking military officer facing court-martial for
refusing to follow a direct order to take the shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Department has ordered the anthrax vaccine to be administered to
all 2.4 million active duty and reserve military troops as protection against
biological warfare. More than 380,000 service members have started the six-shot
regimen.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 military personnel have refused to take the vaccine because
they fear its safety, Pentagon officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Bates could have accepted a so-called Article 15, a nonjudicial punishment
provided under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. But he said that would not
solve his problem because his commander would simply order him again to take the
shots, restarting the disciplinary process.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm facing a court-martial,'' Bates said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   His military lawyer, Capt. Bill Burke, said a court-martial was the standard
next step in such cases. In refusing the Article 15 on Friday, Bates' only other
option was to demand a court-martial even though he has offered since November
to resign his commission instead.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After 13 years of exemplary service to my country, I am willing to give up
my job, my rank, and everything I have worked for to avoid taking an unsafe
drug,'' Bates said in a letter to the Air Force explaining his decision.
</P>
<P>
	   In testifying before a congressional committee in October, Bates said he
became concerned about taking the shot after he found a dozen people in his
squadron had ``unusual or disabling illnesses that did not exist prior to the
anthrax vaccine and the causes are unknown.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the conditions included autoimmune disorders, crippling bone or
joint pain, memory loss, inability to concentrate, thyroid damage, liver damage
and cysts around the heart.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can only conclude the vaccine poses an undue risk,'' Bates said in his
letter.
</P>
<P>
	   Bates regards the shots as experimental and said a soldier's consent should
be required for the vaccine. He cannot afford to get sick because he must
provide financially for his wife and three children, including an autistic son,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Frank Smolinsky, a public affairs officer at Dover, said the Air Force
could not comment on Bates' case specifically. But he did confirm Bates declined
the Article 15 punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform Committee,
wrote to Defense Secretary William Cohen on Dec. 28 saying it appeared the Air
Force was retaliating against Bates for testifying before Congress. After
testifying, Bates had been told to take the vaccine sooner than other personnel,
Burton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The congressman has asked Cohen to allow Bates to resign. On Friday, Cohen
told Burton he would look into the allegation of retaliation.

<HEADLINE> Gore Backpedals on Gay Policy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore backpedaled Friday from a
statement that he would require his appointees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to
support his policy that gays should be allowed to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did not mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of inquiry into
the personal political opinions of officers in the U.S. military,'' Gore told
reporters at a hastily convened news conference after a campaign rally at a Des
Moines-area high school.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, under fire from military brass and some of his own political allies,
spoke two days after his original comments at a candidates' debate. The comments
have sparked two days of dissenting comment from former members of the joint
chiefs and from Sen. John Kerry, a Vietnam veteran campaigning for Gore in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I meant to convey was I would not tolerate, nor would any commander
in chief, nor would any president tolerate orders not being followed,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president's remarks Friday evening matched those that that Bill
Bradley gave Wednesday night in New Hampshire, when the two men were asked if
they would use a litmus test for appointments to the joint chiefs agreements
that gays should be allowed to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Wednesday: ``I would insist before appointing anybody to the joint
chiefs of staff that that individual support my policy and yes, I would make
that a requirement.'' Gore has insisted he would allow gays to serve openly in
the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination, said Wednesday night
that a litmus test was unnecessary because military officers follow orders from
their commander in chief no matter what.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, was not the only Gore supporter who took
issue with the vice president's on remarks Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   At the high school where Gore campaigned Friday with his daughter Karenna,
Carolyn Klein, 59, said such a requirement for the joint chiefs was wrong
because people can work together even if they disagree.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not everybody agrees with me on my job either,'' the woman from Pella,
Iowa said, adding she thought Gore was spending too much time on the question.
``I think that's the least of our issues right now, We have so many problems to
work on that he's making too much of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kerry, a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, said Friday that he generally
supports allowing gays to serve in the military, but that in some very rare
situations, commanders should have flexibility to remove someone from a unit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's say tomorrow you're at war and you had an immediate mission need,''
he said. ``You're going to have to allow some kind of capacity for people to
make those kinds of command judgments.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another military veteran, Arizona Sen. John McCain, called the Wednesday
night pledge by Gore ``a disgraceful statement'' during a South Carolina GOP
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Pentagon, the Gore statements on the pledge of support were viewed as
campaign talk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Candidates for political office are certainly free to do that and must do
that in order to explain their views to the American people,'' said Rear Adm.
Craig Quigley, a spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen said Thursday.
``But I would not speculate as to what that may or may not mean a year from
now.''

<HEADLINE> Windham County sheriff facing more charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WINDHAM, Conn. (AP) - Windham County's high sheriff - charged four
months ago with embezzlement and racketeering - was arrested Friday on a new
round of charges, including corrupt election practices.
<P>
	   Thomas White surrendered to police Friday morning and was released after
posting a $5,000 bond, state police said.
</P>
<P>
	   White was charged with three counts of larceny including embezzlement,
racketeering and corrupt election practices, state police said. They would not
give any details of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   White pleaded innocent in September to two counts each of embezzlement,
tampering with a witness and unlawful restraint, and single counts of bribery of
a witness, hindering prosecution, conspiracy, coercion and racketeering.
</P>
<P>
	   Both arrests stem from an investigation which began in May 1998, state
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have no idea what the specific allegations are, but I can tell you that
we deny them," said Art Meisler, White's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   White could not be reached for comment by The Associated Press. Messages was
left for him at his courthouse office in Danielson, at his home, and with a
paging service. He is due in court on Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   White was elected high sheriff in November of 1998 following a bitter
Democratic primary fight against former Sheriff Jay Kenney. White has been under
investigation in connection with a check he says he inadvertently deposited to a
personal account rather than a business account. The check was for between
$1,000 and $2,000.
</P>
<P>
	   White, 38, has said he repaid that money with interest. He has explained the
deposit as a mistake he made because he was never properly trained as a deputy
sheriff when he was appointed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   He has said his legal woes are related to efforts by Gov. John G. Rowland
and the Legislature to abolish the sheriff system.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the system say it is rife with corruption, mismanagement and
patronage.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past year, the high sheriffs have been hit with a spate of
embarrassments and scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to White's arrest in September, New London County High Sheriff
Gerard Egan was charged with keeping an uncertified assault weapon in his
courthouse office. Egan's department is also being investigated by the state's
Attorney General and other agencies for allegedly double-billing the state. Egan
also was ordered to pay a $4,000 fine for violating the state ethics code by
hiring his son and wife.
</P>
<P>
	   A female prisoner says she was raped by male inmates while they were being
transported in a New Haven County Sheriff Department van, and a black couple
says a Windham County special deputy sheriff chased them across the Rhode Island
border while firing his gun at them and yelling racist slurs.
</P>
<P>
	   The new charges against White are just another reason why the system should
be scrapped, some say.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's so blatantly ridiculous," said Joseph Antinerella, a former Hartford
County deputy sheriff who says he was passed over for reappointment because he
is a political enemy of the high sheriff.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this thing is shaking down in a small community like Windham County, you
can only imagine what's happening in a bigger city like Hartford," Antinerella
said.

</P>
<P>
	   One such question went to Bush in the opening moments, and concerned the
Confederate flag, which flies atop the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe the people of South Carolina can figure out what to do with this
flag issue,'' the Texas governor replied, declining to take sides in a
racially-tinged issue. Moderator Brian Williams sought to pursue the issue, but
the crowd booed louder, and Bush merely repeated that he thought it was an issue
for South Carolinians to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who has campaigned hard in the state, defended anew the letters he
has written to federal agencies on behalf of campaign donors. ``Whenever a
constituent of mine or a citizen ... can't get an answer ... I believe that
people like me should weigh in,'' said McCain, who wrote the letters in his
capacity as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator was addressing a question about an Associated Press story
detailing a letter he wrote last year on behalf of Ameritech, which was seeking
permission to merge with SBC, another phone company.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter-writing issue is a troubling one for McCain, whose candidacy has
flourished on the basis of his call for a ridding the nation's political system
of the influence of big-monied special interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain were the only two asked about the Confederate flag, and the
two men both said it was up to residents of the state to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   Several of the contenders tackled another volatile South Carolina issue, a
proposed state-run lottery.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said he was opposed, adding, ``the gambling industry is corrupting our
culture.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes harkened back to the lessons learned in his home state of New Jersey,
saying intending to use a lottery to fund education improvements -- as proposed
in South Carolina -- is ``a false deal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes was emphatic. ``If you solicit my advice I'll tell you this: All
governments everywhere -- federal, state, local -- should get out of the
business of putting a corrupting, regressive tax on the backs of their people,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As he has numerous times in the campaign, Bauer stressed his unalterable
opposition to abortion, saying that even if a relative were raped, ``I would
explain she couldn't make right the terrible thing that happened to her by
taking the life of an unborn child.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes was passionate on the same subject. Asked whether he would rather face
another Democratic administration or live with a pro-choice Republican in the
White House, he said, ``I don't think that has to be out choice. ... This party
was born in principle. This party will die if it doesn't stand by its decision
of principle.''
</P>
<P>
	   The debate produced a flourish or two -- the contenders fielded questions
submitted by the internet, for example. And for the first time in their
campaign, they were asked about their own charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch said he and his wife give away about 11 percent of their income.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd booed loudly when the contenders were asked to admit to the
biggest mnistake of their lives. Steven Forbes referred to editorials he wrote
long ago advocating raising the gasoline tax. McCain mentioned his involvement
in the Keating Five scandal of several years ago; Bush joked about having signed
off on a notoriously bad trade of ball players when he ran the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes interjected that the question itself was out of bounds -- and the
crowd agreed heartedly.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Duel Over Farm Policy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Democratic rivals Al Gore and Bill Bradley waged a
long-distance duel over health care and farm issues Friday, less than three
weeks before Iowa's leadoff caucuses. Gore brought in big-name help from a
former Senate colleague.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore is going to be our health-care president,'' Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts told a fairgrounds crowd. ``Al Gore is going to be our protector
of senior citizens.''
</P>
<P>
	   While Gore was revving up his campaign in Iowa with a high-profile ally,
Bradley was releasing his sharpest ad to date in New Hampshire -- challenging
Gore's descriptions of his proposals as ``risky.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real risk is doing nothing about gun control. The real risk is doing
nothing about reducing child poverty. The real risk is ignoring the people who
don't have health care,'' Bradley says in the ad, which doesn't mention Gore by
name. Gore has hammered Bradley for putting forward expensive programs that will
eat up every available dollar and risk the nation's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president was in Dubuque with Kennedy, challenging Bradley on his
centerpiece health-care package as Bradley headed to a community center in Des
Moines where he met with about 50 people to tout the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are differences that give people something to select,'' Bradley said
of the two presidential contenders' plans on health care, an issue that has
become central to their battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Both have offered plans to expand health coverage, but Bradley's is far
larger. Gore argues it would fritter away the budget surplus, while Bradley
argues that Gore is timid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not satisfied with nibbling around the edges,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy has long been a liberal champion on health care issues, and his
endorsement of Gore this week bolstered Gore's standing on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley shrugged off Kennedy's appearance and said he'll have senators
backing him in Iowa, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that Paul Wellstone and Bob Kerrey will be stumping around the
state, as well as a few other of my friends,'' said Bradley. ``We're probably
going to have 400 or 500 people here or more.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore argued that Medicare was the key difference between the two, saying his
proposed budget would set aside $374 billion to shore up Medicare for baby
boomers' retirement. Bradley says it's unnecessary right now; the Medicare trust
fund is in fine shape.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we want to be the kind of nation that continues to take care of its
seniors, we have to plan ahead,'' Gore contended.
</P>
<P>
	   A 100-mile drive later, Gore cast Bradley as out on his own limb. ``Even
John McCain on the Republican side puts more into'' Medicare, Gore told voters
at a Cedar Rapids union hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said voters are paying attention to his plan. ``I think that a lot
of middle-class and lower middle-class Americans have felt left out for a long
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scarlett Lunning of Des Moines listened to Bradley's health care pitch and
said, ``There's a fear because we're all getting older. ... Everything moves
with the baby boomers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, in a conference call with reporters, also took a shot at Bradley on
farm policy as he touted an administration plan to spend nearly $1.3 billion on
new conservation programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is going to be a new source of welcome income for farmers,'' said
Gore, who indicated he would use a debate Saturday to underscore differences on
farm policy.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Bradley had voted against ethanol subsidies and flood relief as a
member of the Senate. Bradley has said he had a different responsibility
representing New Jersey in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley spokesman Jim Farrell rejected the charges, saying the farm crisis
erupted while Gore was in office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore has no credibility on the issue of the farm crisis,'' Farrell
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy has a political history in the state, campaigning in Iowa heavily
when he challenged then-President Carter in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   He lost badly and Bradley sought to use that race as a benchmark for his own
performance in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The high point for an insurgent in Iowa was 1980 when Ted Kennedy got
around 30 percent or 31 percent of the vote,'' Bradley said. ``That's the most
that anybody ever got as an insurgent in Iowa.''

<HEADLINE> Church Supports Ecuador President  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's Roman Catholic Church on Friday said it was
not taking sides in the growing street demonstrations for President Jamil
Mahuad's resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do not intervene in party politics,'' Monsignor Jose Eguiguren told
reporters. But in an indirect show of support for the embattled president, he
said, ``We maintain the principle that democracy is and always will be the best
road, no matter how imperfect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Eguiguren said he was responding to an invitation from the leftist-led
Popular Front to hear its proposal to replace Mahuad's centrist government with
one made up of workers and grassroots organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Ecuadorean officials said President Clinton phoned Mahuad Friday
and delivered his vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``President Clinton has expressed in a firm manner his admiration and
support,'' Foreign Minister Benjamin Ortiz told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Popular Front was one of several leftist-led organizations to lead
demonstrations on Thursday in Ecuador's main cities. Police used tear gas to
disperse about 1,000 demonstrators who tried to march on the presidential
palace, and the government called a state of emergency, giving the armed forces
authority to maintain order and detain protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Cross said at least two people were injured in confrontations with
police, including a 17-year-old male student who suffered a bullet wound in the
neck. It was unclear who fired the shot, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the last six months, Mahuad has faced increasing calls to step down from
political rivals on both the left and right, as well as business leaders and
labor unions, who accuse him of incompetence in handling Ecuador's economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador is struggling through its worst financial crisis since the 1920s.
Last year, the economy shrank 7 percent and inflation topped 60 percent, and
Ecuador's currency has plunged to 23,000 sucres to the dollar from 7,000 sucres
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad has said he plans to finish his term, which runs until January 2003,
and the politically powerful armed forces have expressed their support for him.
</P>
<P>
	   But a poll released Thursday showed that 53 percent of Ecuadoreans would
like Mahuad to step down, and only 7 percent of those surveyed expressed support
for the Harvard-educated president.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll, conducted by the private firm Cedatos, surveyed 1,800 people and
had a margin for error of plus or minus 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Debate Again  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Friday night that
he would ``liberate the (Panama) Canal if I have to'' as president to safeguard
American interests. The Republican presidential front-runner and Sen. John
McCain also clashed sharply over tax cuts in the second GOP debate in as many
nights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's fiscally irresponsible to promise a huge tax cut that is based on a
surplus that we might not have,'' McCain said to his rival, standing a few feet
away on a debate stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush retorted that his plan was more generous than McCain's for lower income
taxpayers, and added firmly: ``There is enough money to take care of Social
Security. There is enough money to take care of the basic services of
government, and there is enough money to give the people a substantial tax cut.
And that's what I intend to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing in a state with substantial military facilities and numerous
military retirees, the GOP contenders also sharply criticized Democratic
presidential contenders for saying they would only appoint officials to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff who would permit gays to serve openly in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes led the attack, saying he would renew a ban on gays in the
military that was in effect until Bill Clinton won the White House. He
challenged McCain to join him, but the Arizona senator refused. He said he would
stick with the current ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
	   They attacked as Vice President Al Gore was backpedaling on comments he had
made earlier in the week, declaring he had not meant ``to imply that there
should ever be any kind of inquiry into the personal political opinions of
officers in the U.S. military,'' Gore told reporters at a hastily convened news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP field of hopefuls -- Gary Bauer, Steven Forbes and Sen. Orrin Hatch
in addition to Bush,. McCain and Keyes -- met in a warehouse a few weeks before
the South Carolina presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   They were joined by an occasionally raucous audience that booed at questions
deemed to be impertinent.
</P>
<P>
	   One such question went to Bush in the opening moments, and concerned the
Confederate flag, which flies atop the Statehouse.

<HEADLINE> McCain Letters Spark Questions  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At least 15 times since 1997, Sen. John McCain wrote
federal regulators in his capacity as Commerce Committee chairman on behalf of
major donors from airlines to telephone companies, hundreds of memos obtained by
The Associated Press show.
</P>
<P>
	   In one such letter, McCain urged the Federal Communications Commission in
the fall of 1998 to give ``serious consideration'' to BellSouth's request to
offer long-distance service. BellSouth employees are the third-largest
contributor to his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   And two weeks after Ameritech's chairman held a fund-raiser for him last
spring, McCain sent a stinging letter to federal regulators accusing them of
being unfair toward the phone company's proposed merger with another Bell
company.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter accused the commission of ``applying a different, and much
stricter, burden of proof in this merger proceeding than the commission has
applied in evaluating other mergers.''
</P>
<P>
	   It also said, ``This letter expresses no view on the merits of any issues in
this proceeding and is not written to benefit any particular party.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a debate Friday night, McCain was questioned about the Ameritech letter
and said, ``All the times when I have weighed in, I have asked them to do their
duty and to expedite the procedures as they're laid out under the law and
according to existing regulations.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will continue to do that job, and when a constituent, a person of mine
who has trouble -- or a citizen of this country who can't get a reaction or an
answer from a bureaucracy that's paid for with their tax dollars, I believe that
people like me should weigh in,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   He called on the other candidates to release letters showing their
intervention on behalf of donors.
</P>
<P>
	   The documents, which were provided to the AP by the Senate Commerce
Committee, were among more than 500 letters McCain has written to federal
agencies over the last three years as the panel's chairman. The committee plans
to make then public Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen letters reviewed by the AP were on behalf of companies the McCain's
staff identified as large contributors. Most of the rest were on behalf of
constituents, such as more than 20 travel agents who had complained their
commission fees were being capped by airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is hardly alone in his letter writing. The FCC said this week it had
received between 7,000 and 8,000 pieces of correspondence a year from lawmakers
in the past three years about issues pending before the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters come to light at a pivotal time for McCain in his bid for the
Republican presidential nomination. The Arizona senator has risen in the polls
while campaigning to rid the nation's political system of what he calls the
``pernicious'' influence of money.
</P>
<P>
	   That campaign theme has struck a chord among independents, and has helped
vault McCain into a highly competitive race with Texas Gov. George W. Bush in
New Hampshire, the nation's first primary state.
</P>
<P>
	   But in recent days, he has been forced to answer questions about his role
helping donors.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Ameritech matter, McCain wrote April 12 that the Senate Commerce
Committee chairman and some of his colleagues were ``extremely troubled'' by the
Federal Communications Commission's handling of the proposed merger between SBC
Communications and Ameritech.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain wrote FCC chairman William Kennard: ``Your improvisational process
will only kill more time and raise the chances of a legally flawed decision.''
The letter also was signed by Sens. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., and Sam Brownback,
R-Kan.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter followed on the heels of a $1,000-per-person fund-raiser hosted
March 30 at a Chicago hotel by Ameritech chief Richard Notebaert, a member of
McCain's fund-raising team.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Ameritech, a Midwest phone company, had been trying for months
to get FCC approval for its merger with SBC, which is based in the Southwest.
The deal, which eventually was approved, created the nation's largest local
phone company.
</P>
<P>
	   In May, McCain sent another letter to the FCC, criticizing agency personnel
for public statements about the merger and accusing the commission of bias. In
September, Ameritech's Notebaert was host for a second fund-raiser for McCain at
a Chicago club.
</P>
<P>
	   Employees of Ameritech and their families and the company's political action
committee had contributed $16,000 to McCain's presidential campaign through
Sept. 30, his ninth most generous giver. SBC Communications employees and their
families and the company PAC had given a total of $9,750.
</P>
<P>
	   Ameritech denied any connection between the fund-raisers and McCain's
letter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was totally Dick Notebaert's personal involvement as a member of the
host committee in Chicago,'' spokesman Dave Pacholczyk said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the BellSouth matter, McCain urged FCC Chairman William Kennard to
consider wireless services, such as Sprint PCS, as competitors to BellSouth.
Such a ruling would remove a regulatory barrier the regional Bell companies
faced in their bids to provide long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I encourage you to give serious consideration to whether PCS is providing
competition to the local exchange market,'' McCain wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Commerce Committee Republican staff director Mark Buse said McCain's
advocacy on behalf of the Baby Bells is consistent with his support for
telecommunications competition that would result in lower prices for customers.
</P>
<P>
	   BellSouth and their employees have contributed $30,000 to his presidential
bid through Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   In other letters on behalf of donors:
</P>
<P>
	   --At the behest of Global Crossing, McCain asked the FCC in March 1999 to
encourage the development of undersea cables for transmitting telecommunications
signals.
</P>
<P>
	   --In December 1998, McCain urged the FCC to make it easier for companies to
own more than one television station in a market. The letter's advocacy helps
local TV station owners like Paxson Communications and Sinclair Broadcasting,
two donors to McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   --In February 1998, McCain wrote Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater on
behalf of America West airlines, whose employees are contributors to his
campaign, and the city of Flagstaff, Ariz. The letter urged better routes to
surrounding cities.

<HEADLINE> Gore Backpedals on Gay Policy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Under political pressure, Vice President Al Gore
backpedaled Friday from his statement that he would require candidates for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree with his intention to let gays serve openly in
the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did not mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of inquiry into
the personal political opinions of officers in the U.S. military,'' Gore told
reporters at a hastily convened news conference after a campaign rally at a Des
Moines-area high school.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, under fire from military brass and some of his own political allies,
spoke two days after his original comments at a candidates' debate. The comments
have sparked dissent from former members of the joint chiefs and from Sen. John
Kerry, a Vietnam veteran campaigning for Gore in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I meant to convey was I would not tolerate, nor would any commander
in chief, nor would any president tolerate orders not being followed,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president's remarks Friday evening matched those that that Bill
Bradley gave Wednesday night in New Hampshire, when the two men were asked if
they would make agreement on gays in the military a litmus test for appointments
to the joint chiefs.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Wednesday: ``I would insist before appointing anybody to the joint
chiefs of staff that that individual support my policy and yes, I would make
that a requirement.'' Gore has insisted he would allow gays to serve openly in
the military.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday night, Gore said, ``I didn't use that term, litmus test.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination, said Wednesday night
that a litmus test was unnecessary because military officers follow orders from
their commander in chief no matter what.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, was not the only Gore supporter who took
issue with the vice president's on remarks Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   At the high school where Gore campaigned Friday with his daughter Karenna,
Carolyn Klein, 59, said such a prerequisite for serving as a joint chief was
misguided because people can work together even if they disagree.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not everybody agrees with me on my job either,'' the woman from Pella,
Iowa said, adding she thought Gore was spending too much time on the question.
``I think that's the least of our issues right now, We have so many problems to
work on that he's making too much of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kerry, a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, said Friday that he generally
supports allowing gays to serve in the military, but that in some very rare
situations, commanders should have flexibility to remove someone from a unit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's say tomorrow you're at war and you had an immediate mission need,''
he said. ``You're going to have to allow some kind of capacity for people to
make those kinds of command judgments.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another military veteran, Arizona Sen. John McCain, called the Wednesday
night pledge by Gore ``a disgraceful statement'' during a South Carolina GOP
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Pentagon, the Gore statements on the pledge of support were viewed as
campaign talk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Candidates for political office are certainly free to do that and must do
that in order to explain their views to the American people,'' said Rear Adm.
Craig Quigley, a spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen said Thursday.
``But I would not speculate as to what that may or may not mean a year from
now.''

<HEADLINE> Writer Patrick O'Brian Dies at 85  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOODS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Patrick O'Brian, whose celebrated novels of 19th century
seafaring won praise from critics and the loyalty of legions of readers, has
died. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian died in Dublin, Ireland, where he had been working on a book for
several weeks at Trinity College. The cause of death was not given and there
were conflicting reports of the date.
</P>
<P>
	   The British Embassy in Paris said O'Brian died Tuesday, but his New York
publisher said O'Brian died Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian's major work was a 20-volume series set in the Royal Navy during the
Napoleonic wars.
</P>
<P>
	   A deep knowledge of naval history and 19th century life enabled him to evoke
a time and place so vividly that, in this era of supersonic jets and smart
bombs, his readers were gripped by the slow-motion suspense of sea battles
fought under sail.
</P>
<P>
	   The series, begun in 1969 with ``Master and Commander,'' is the story of the
friendship between a bold and ambitious navy officer, Jack Aubrey, and the
ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, a naturalist and secret agent who doesn't much
like sailing.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the books were well-reviewed and found an enthusiastic readership
from the start, it wasn't until the 1990s that they achieved wide recognition
abroad and were lifted out of the ``historical fiction'' genre in which they
generally were reviewed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, a critic for The Washington Post critic called O'Brian ``the best
novelist you have never heard of.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Patrick O'Brian has written great and enduring literature which happens to
be set largely at sea,'' the Sunday Telegraph wrote in 1997, praising ``the
intensity of characterization, the complex elegance of the plotting, and the
brilliance of the writing.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian also proved that, in the hands of a skilled writer, specialist
language need not be an obstacle to understanding. Readers who can't remember
which side of a ship is starboard still can feel the frantic activity on deck as
the sails unfurl and catch the wind, and the excitement as a man-of-war turns to
engage the enemy.
</P>
<P>
	   A lexicon explaining O'Brian's nautical terminology was published, but
O'Brian didn't think definitions important.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ignorance of the cross-catharpins is not necessarily fatal,'' he once
said. ``Explanation almost certainly would be.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian's fans range from actor Charlton Heston to critic John Bayley, a
former Oxford professor of literature who wrote that O'Brian's ``originality
consists in the unpretentious use he makes of (history) to invent a new style of
fiction.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No other writer,'' Bayley wrote, ``not even Melville, has described the
whale and the wandering albatross with O'Brian's studious and yet lyrical
accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian guarded his privacy, and in his few interviews resisted questions
about his personal life.
</P>
<P>
	   He was born Dec. 12, 1914, in Chalfont St. Peter, west of London, and it
wasn't until 1998 that he was revealed to be the son of an English doctor and
not an Irishman as had been widely believed, the Daily Telegraph said in an
obituary Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said O'Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ, but changed his
name in 1945. During his school years, he was frequently ill, spending much time
reading. His writing career began at age 15, when he published a book about the
union of a giant panda and a snow leopard.
</P>
<P>
	   During World War II, O'Brian drove ambulances and worked briefly with
Britain's Political Intelligence Department.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1949, he and his second wife, Mary, moved to Collioure, southern France.
His first seafaring novel was ``The Golden Ocean'' in 1956, about a Pacific
expedition.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series was already well under way in Britain by the
beginning of the 1990s, when editor Starling Lawrence of the American publisher
W.W. Norton chanced to read one on a flight home.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest, as they say, is publishing history.
</P>
<P>
	   Several years ago, the writer said he would end the series with the 20th
book, but last month he said he was working on volume 21, the Daily Telegraph
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The first three chapters of the new book featured Aubrey and Maturin on
holiday in Chile, Harper Collins editor Arabella Pike told The Independent
newspaper. Pike said she did not expect anyone else would complete his last
story.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian also wrote biographies of Picasso and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. A
linguist, he translated the work of French writers Simone de Beauvoir and
Colette.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brian was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Funeral plans were not announced. He is survived by a son, Richard, from his
first marriage.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Relatives File Petition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker and lawyers for relatives of 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez took steps Friday to try to prevent the Cuban boy's return to his
homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said he subpoenaed Elian to testify before the
Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10, so that he remains in the country
while the courts can consider his case.
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 supporters cheered wildly as Elian -- holding the subpoena in
front of his face while being held high by a relative -- appeared outside the
house where he has been staying with relatives. Elian gave the crowd the peace
sign before heading back indoors.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton said in a release said that he ``issued a subpoena to Elian Gonzalez
to ensure that no precipitous action is taken until the Florida State court in
Miami can adequately address the Gonzalez case.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope that the people of Miami will remain calm and allow the court to do
its work,'' said Burton, chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that while
the subpoena requires that Elian attend the hearing in Washington, it's highly
unlikely that the boy's actual appearance will be sought.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Congress of the United States is affording Elian Gonzalez what INS and
this administration has not, which is his legal right and his right to due
process,'' said Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation. ``This gives him the protection that he will not be repatriated to
Cuba between now and Feb. 10.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, lawyers for Elian's relatives filed a petition to appoint a
guardian for him, a first step toward trying to prevent his return to Cuba.
Neither his lawyers nor his relatives would comment on the petition until the
judge's ruling is made. A ruling is expected early next week.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, meanwhile, tens of thousands of people in Elian's hometown rallied
in a seaside plaza Friday night to demand his return. ``Elian, Cardenas awaits
you ... with kisses,'' a Cuban country music band sang.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after his
mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned while trying to reach Florida
by boat.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was placed with his great-uncle and great-aunt in Miami, but the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled Wednesday that he must be returned
to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14. The decision touched off angry protests in the
Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, accompanied by
one of the family's lawyers, flew to Washington on Friday to appeal directly to
Attorney General Janet Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also asked President Clinton to
reverse the order.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has said she was consulted on the INS decision and approved of it.
Clinton said Friday the INS did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe they followed the law,'' Clinton said. ``This is a volatile and
difficult case. ... We need to keep this out of the political process as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to Thursday, when two Cuban exile leaders and 133 other people
were arrested and police were forced to use tear gas to disperse a crowd,
protesters in Miami were much calmer Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Cuban exile community called for more civil disobedience. The
planned demonstrations included a vigil Friday night at the federal building in
Orlando and a large protest in Little Havana on Saturday. Protesters are also
planning to drive around Miami International Airport on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the child is sent back to Cuba without his day in court, all hell is
going to break loose,'' said Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spoke with some demonstration organizers and asked them to ``do the
demonstrations in a way that does not disrupt daily life in South Florida,
because it would hurt the cause of Elian.''
</P>
<P>
	   The rally in Cardenas, Cuba, was marked by songs, tears and personal
recollections of Elian. It was the most personal and emotional of many held
since early December, when Cuban President Fidel Castro promised mass
mobilization until the boy was returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   The speakers included classmates from Elian's elementary school, his
teacher, his school principal, and the female doctor who has been caring for him
since he was a baby.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his four grandparents and his
great-grandmother began weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage
as the group sang of the boy's mother. Gonzalez looked particularly distraught,
his eyes red from crying.
</P>
<P>
	   The petition filed Friday was on behalf of Elian Gonzalez's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez. It is an attempt by the boy's Miami relatives to get
guardianship and then to file for applications for admission to the United
States and asylum, said David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian played in his relatives' yard Friday with a puppy named Dolphin, a
gift from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. The black Labrador chased Elian
around the yard and playfully nipped at his blue soccer shorts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian tells me he does not want to go back to Cuba,'' said Delfin
Gonzalez, another of Elian's great-uncles. He said Elian wants his family to
come here.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials have suggested Elian's father come to Florida to get his son,
while the U.S. National Council of Churches said the boy's relatives in Cuba
want the organization to bring the boy back.

<HEADLINE> New Guatemalan Leader Visits Mexico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Alfonso Portillo, who once fled Mexico after killing two
men in a brawl, returned here Friday for the first time since winning
Guatemala's presidential election last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexican President Ernest Zedillo congratulated Portillo on his new job
during a formal reception, telling the president-elect that he wanted to
strengthen ties between the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Though he has returned to Mexico several times since fleeing after the
killings in 1982, this was Portillo's first trip since his Dec. 26 run-off
victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Portillo has admitted to shooting the two men to death in the southern
Mexican state of Guerrero during an argument between political rivals that
turned violent. Portillo has said he killed the men in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he fled Mexico because he feared he would not get a fair trial. A
Guerrero judge declared the cased closed in 1995, and Portillo now has
diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   The killings apparently played a role in the presidential race. At a
September campaign rally, he told supporters, ``Seventeen years ago, I was able
to defend my life, just as I would defend yours and the those of the people of
Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
	   Guatemalan voters apparently accepted his explanation of the incident, and
he won 68 percent of the vote.

<HEADLINE> McCain Balances Reform and Power  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain the political reformer is face to face with
John McCain the power-wielding Senate committee chairman, and the fate of John
McCain the Republican presidential hopeful may depend on their compatibility.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My job is to make the bureaucrats work for the people,'' McCain insisted
this week when pressed about a letter he wrote to the Federal Communications
Commission on behalf of a political donor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would do the same thing again, almost anytime,'' added the Arizona
senator, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee with jurisdiction over
communications, transportation and other sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   He merely asked the FCC to issue a ruling after two years of deliberations,
he said, and didn't suggest which way the agency should come down on a request
for Paxson Communications to purchase a television station in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's defenders say that what he did is business-as-usual in Washington,
and they're right.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC says it has received between 7,000 and 8,000 pieces of
correspondence a year from members of Congress in the past three years. McCain's
office authored 215 of them. And apart from the senator's letter about Paxson,
the agency heard from nine other lawmakers interested in the same issue.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a form of constituent service. Members of Congress have legal
jurisdiction over federal agencies, and private interests have a right to appeal
to their representatives for help.
</P>
<P>
	   That makes the two groups natural partners in alliances that -- in the
current era -- often are sealed with campaign cash, and lots of it.
</P>
<P>
	   The nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity released its quadrennial book
recently on the ties between presidential hopefuls and their political donors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the leading presidential candidates have a long-standing group of
career patrons who have sponsored their careers and for whom they have done
favors using their government offices,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director
of the center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a mutually beneficial relationship.''
</P>
<P>
	   Except now for McCain, who has emerged as George W. Bush's leading rival for
the GOP presidential nomination on the stength of his pledge to rid the nation
of what he calls the ``pernicious'' influence of big money.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue arose anew in a debate Friday night, and again McCain defended his
actions. Seeking to turn the issue to his advantage, he announced in a
post-debate interview that his Senate office on Saturday would be releasing
numerous pieces of letters he had written to agencies and his campaign manager
suggested that other presidential hopefuls do likewise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's suspicion about all of us as a result of these huge amounts of
money that wash around political campaigns,'' the senator said this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With me, being the 'reformer,' obviously those stories are more
relevant.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ``story'' in this case is that Paxson officials made $20,000 in campaign
donations, and the senator was permitted to use the company's jet. McCain
vigorously denies a quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator's advocacy of campaign finance reform is especially attractive
to independent voters, and in New Hampshire independents are allowed to vote in
either the Republican or Democratic primary. McCain hopes thousands of them show
up to support him when the Granite State holds the first presidential primary of
the year on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The importance of the state to his prospects couldn't be clearer.
</P>
<P>
	   He himself has said he needs to win or at least come in a close second to
maintain his viability in a race that looks otherwise like a romp for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In private, several GOP sources said during the week that McCain was furious
over the issue coming up -- and wondering whether Bush had a hand in it.
</P>
<P>
	   In public, though, McCain has faced the first major flare-up of his campaign
with equanimity. He smiled his way through Thursday night's debate, much as he
kept his good humor in the Senate last fall when fellow Republicans challenged
him during debate over campaign finance legislation to specify who among them
had been corrupted by the power of big money.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican sources, speaking privately at the time, said those challenges
were part of an effort to make the Arizonan lose his temper in public.
</P>
<P>
	   That would be unsenatorial inside the Capitol, unpresidential in the context
of his current pursuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is dealing carefully with the issue, declining to attack McCain
directly, yet subtly seeking gain. ``I'm not a committee chairman,'' he said on
Thursday. ``I'm an outsider.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, though, opened up another front: He criticized McCain's campaign
finance proposal for threatening to harm the Republican Party and the
``conservative cause.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain never figured to win the New Hampshire primary on the strength of
conservative Republicans alone, but he can scarcely afford to be viewed as an
enemy of the effort to turn the Democrats out of the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   So now he's got to blunt that charge, at the same time taking care that the
message conveyed by his senatorial letter writing doesn't drown out the one he's
trying to project to the voters who have warmed to his insurgent's campaign.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Debate Again  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Friday night that
he would ``liberate the (Panama) Canal if I have to'' as president to safeguard
American interests. The Republican presidential front-runner and Sen. John
McCain also clashed sharply over tax cuts in the second GOP campaign debate in
as many nights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's fiscally irresponsible to promise a huge tax cut that is based on a
surplus that we might not have,'' McCain said to his rival, standing a few feet
away.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush retorted that his plan was more generous than McCain's for lower income
taxpayers, and added firmly: ``There is enough money to take care of Social
Security. There is enough money to take care of the basic services of
government, and there is enough money to give the people a substantial tax cut.
And that's what I intend to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing in a state with substantial military facilities and numerous
military retirees, the GOP contenders also sharply criticized Democratic
presidential contenders for saying they would only appoint officials to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff who would permit gays to serve openly in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes led the attack, saying he would renew a ban on gays in the
military that was in effect until Bill Clinton won the White House. He
challenged McCain to join him, but the Arizona senator refused. He said he would
stick with the current ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
	   They attacked as Vice President Al Gore was backpedaling on comments he had
made earlier in the week, declaring he had not meant ``to imply that there
should ever be any kind of inquiry into the personal political opinions of
officers in the U.S. military.''
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP field of hopefuls -- Gary Bauer, Steven Forbes and Sen. Orrin Hatch
in addition to Bush, McCain and Keyes -- met in a warehouse at a party
fundraising dinner a few weeks before the South Carolina presidential primary.
They were joined by an occasionally raucous dinner crowd that booed at questions
deemed to be impertinent.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate topics ranged broadly, and touched briefly on a controversy
surrounding letters that McCain wrote to federal regulatory agencies on behalf
of political donors. For the second night in a row, McCain, chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee, said he was merely trying to prod a sluggish
bureaucracy, and said after the debate that his office would release numerous
pieces of correspondence on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was asked about the Panama Canal by Bauer, who said he opposed the
recent turnover of the waterway to Panama under a treaty ratified by the Senate
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush noted that as a young congressional candidate at the time, he had
opposed the treaty. If elected president, he said he will uphold the treaty, but
added that he would do ``whatever it takes to keep the canal open. ... I'll
liberate the canal if I have to'' to maintain Americans trade and other
strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's father, former President George Bush, dispatched troops to Panama
while serving in the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain jabbed Bush over taxes as part of a running disagreement between the
two men, and Bush returned fire on the subject of campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
	   He said, as he had in New Hampshire on Thursday night, that McCain's
proposal would hurt Republicans. Hatch said with his insistence on campaign
finance overhaul, McCain was beginning to remind him of ``an accordion player
who only knows one tune.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain stood his ground, though, and said it was essential to rid the
country of the influence of interests.''
</P>
<P>
	   At times, the audience appeared to view the event more as an athletic
contest than a political debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Boos erupted early, in response to a question posed to Bush about the
Confederate flag, which flies atop the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe the people of South Carolina can figure out what to do with this
flag issue,'' the Texas governor replied, declining to take sides in a
racially-tinged issue. Moderator Brian Williams sought to pursue the issue, but
the crowd booed louder, and Bush merely repeated that he thought it was an issue
for South Carolinians to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also said it was an issue for the state's residents to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who has campaigned hard in the state, defended anew the letters he
has written to federal agencies on behalf of campaign donors. ``Whenever a
constituent of mine or a citizen ... can't get an answer ... I believe that
people like me should weigh in,'' said McCain, who wrote the letters in his
capacity as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator was addressing a question about an Associated Press story
detailing a letter he wrote last year on behalf of Ameritech, which was seeking
permission to merge with SBC, another phone company.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter-writing issue is a troubling one for McCain, whose candidacy has
flourished on the basis of his call for a ridding the nation's political system
of the influence of big-monied special interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain were the only two asked about the Confederate flag, and the
two men both said it was up to residents of the state to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   Several of the contenders tackled another volatile South Carolina issue, a
proposed state-run lottery.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said he was opposed, adding, ``the gambling industry is corrupting our
culture.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes harkened back to the lessons learned in his home state of New Jersey,
saying intending to use a lottery to fund education improvements -- as proposed
in South Carolina -- is ``a false deal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes was emphatic. ``If you solicit my advice I'll tell you this: All
governments everywhere -- federal, state, local -- should get out of the
business of putting a corrupting, regressive tax on the backs of their people,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush used a post-debate interview with moderator Williams to criticize
commercials the Forbes campaign is preparing in New Hampshire attacking on the
subject of taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it doesn't serve the Republican Party well,'' he said, and
predicted that the voters would turn against them.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Debate Highlights  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Highlights of Friday's debate between Republican presidential hopefuls Gary
Bauer, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Alan Keyes, Steve
Forbes and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, as transcribed by the Federal Document
Clearing House:
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if Affirmative Action has made America a better nation:
</P>
<P>
	   MCCAIN: Yes, but quotas have made it worse.
</P>
<P>
	   BAUER: I think that the idea behind affirmative action was legitimate and
decent, but when you start counting by race, you divide America, you don't bring
it together.
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH: Only if affirmative action means equal opportunity for everybody.
</P>
<P>
	   FORBES: Quotas and set asides are wrong, and that's why we genuinely need
real affirmation of opportunities starting by letting parents choose their own
schools for their own children.
</P>
<P>
	   HATCH: When affirmative action means job training outreach and education
it's good. When it starts pitting one group against another throw a system of
preferences, it's bad. And I've got to tell you quotas are wrong for America,
and I agree: Equal opportunity is what we should have for everybody.
</P>
<P>
	   KEYES: I think it maybe more important to ask whether it's helped the people
it was supposed to help. And I think it has actually hurt them by damaging the
reputation of many minorities in this country and not giving them credit for
their real achievements, and I think that's wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was asked by Bauer about the recent turnover of the Panama Canal back
to Panamanian control:
</P>
<P>
	   BAUER: Are you willing to take the steps necessary including putting our
military back in Panama in order to stop the Chinese from taking over influence
there?
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH: Our country has signed a treaty; I believe we ought to honor the
treaty. But when I'm the president, if I find in any way, shape or form the
canal is closed to world interests, I will do whatever it takes to keep the
canal open.
</P>
<P>
	   It is in our national strategic interest to have a peaceful hemisphere. It
is in our national strategic interest to have a hemisphere in which trade can
flow freely. And I will liberate the canal if I have to.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was asked, for the second night in a row, about his role overseeing
the FCC, which makes important decisions regarding some of his key campaign
donors.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: Senator, I'm reading from the Associated Press ... ``two weeks after
Ameritech's chairman held a fund-raiser for him, Senator John McCain sent a
stinging letter to federal regulators accusing them of being unfair toward the
phone company.''
</P>
<P>
	   Senator, your letter went on to say that the letter was not meant to benefit
any one single person.
</P>
<P>
	   And you have said in your own defense that this is part of what is wrong
with Washington. However, do you understand now the appearance here and can you
tell us here tonight is there anything else about the transportation you use,
about the letters you have written, anything else that you know of that is about
to come out?
</P>
<P>
	   MCCAIN: I have, first of all, no idea. But the fact is that again my job as
chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is the
oversight of bureaucracies that are supposed to be serving the people. The
Federal Communications Commission has not been doing that. But all the times
when I have weighed in I have asked them to do their duty and to expedite the
procedures as they're laid out under the law and according to existing
regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   I will continue to do that job, and when a constituent, a person of mine who
has trouble -- or a citizen of this country who can't get a reaction or an
answer from a bureaucracy that's paid for with their tax dollars -- I believe
that people like me should weigh in, particularly when it is my responsibility
as chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was given the chance to ask Gov. Bush about the differences between
their two proposed tax cut plans.
</P>
<P>
	   MCCAIN: Well, governor, I know your people are running around saying that
your tax cut is bigger than mine. I think the phrase they used was the tax gap
between Bush and McCain. I'm more concerned about the surplus gap. It's fiscally
irresponsible to promise a huge tax cut that is based on a surplus that we may
not have. My tax plan is fiscally conservative. It's about the same as yours for
middle-income and lower income Americans. It places a top priority on saving
Social Security. It offers a needed tax break for middle income people and it
begins paying down the national debt. My friends, we ought to pay down the
national debt. George, the American people are tired of people who make
promises, who make promises about tax cuts that they can't keep.
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH: The senator and I have a fundamental disagreement. Let me see if I can
put it in human terms for you.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris and Beth Bradley came to airport today. They make $42,000 a year in
income. Under the plan that you laid out, Mr. Senator, here in South Carolina,
they will receive a $200 tax cut. Under the plan that I propose and will get
through the United States Congress, they receive $1,852 tax cut. The fundamental
difference is that the additional $1,600 -- the difference will go to Washington
under your idea, and under my idea it goes into people's pockets. There is
enough money to take care of Social Security. There is enough money to meet the
basic needs of our government. And there is enough money to give the American
people a substantial tax cut and that's exactly what I'm going to do.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Relatives File Petition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- In efforts to prevent Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba, a
Republican lawmaker subpoenaed him Friday to testify before a congressional
committee and one of his Miami relatives sought to become his legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said he subpoenaed 6-year-old Elian to testify
before the Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10, so that he remains in the
country while the courts can consider his case.
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 supporters cheered wildly as Elian -- holding the subpoena in
front of his face while being held high by a relative -- appeared outside the
house where he has been staying with relatives. Elian gave the crowd the peace
sign before heading back indoors.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after his
mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned while trying to reach Florida
by boat.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was placed with his great-uncle and great-aunt in Miami, but the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled Wednesday that he must be returned
to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14. The decision touched off angry protests in the
Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton, the committee's chairman, said in a release said that he ``issued a
subpoena to Elian Gonzalez to ensure that no precipitous action is taken until
the Florida State court in Miami can adequately address the Gonzalez case.''
</P>
<P>
	   Committee sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that while
the subpoena requires that Elian attend the hearing in Washington, it's highly
unlikely that the boy's actual appearance will be sought.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Congress of the United States is affording Elian Gonzalez what INS and
this administration has not, which is his legal right and his right to due
process,'' said Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation. ``This gives him the protection that he will not be repatriated to
Cuba between now and Feb. 10.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives filed a petition to
appoint a guardian for him, a first step toward trying to prevent his return to
Cuba. Neither his lawyers nor his relatives would comment before the judge's
ruling, which is expected early next week.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, meanwhile, tens of thousands of people in Elian's hometown rallied
in a seaside plaza Friday night to demand his return. ``Elian, Cardenas awaits
you ... with kisses,'' a Cuban country music band sang.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, accompanied by
one of the family's lawyers, flew to Washington on Friday to appeal directly to
Attorney General Janet Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also asked President Clinton to
reverse the INS order.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has said she was consulted on the INS decision and approved of it.
Clinton said Friday the INS did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe they followed the law,'' Clinton said. ``This is a volatile and
difficult case. ... We need to keep this out of the political process as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to Thursday, when two Cuban exile leaders and 133 other people
were arrested and police were forced to use tear gas to disperse a crowd,
protesters in Miami were much calmer Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Cuban exile community called for more civil disobedience. The
planned demonstrations included a vigil Friday night at the federal building in
Orlando and a large protest in Little Havana on Saturday. Protesters are also
planning to drive around Miami International Airport on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the child is sent back to Cuba without his day in court, all hell is
going to break loose,'' said Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally in Cardenas, Cuba, was marked by songs, tears and personal
recollections of Elian. It was the most personal and emotional of many held
since early December, when Cuban President Fidel Castro promised mass
mobilization until the boy was returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his four grandparents and his
great-grandmother began weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage
as the group sang of the boy's mother. Gonzalez looked particularly distraught,
his eyes red from crying.
</P>
<P>
	   The petition filed by Elian's Miami relatives was on behalf of his
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. It is an attempt by the boy's Miami relatives to
get guardianship and then to file for applications for admission to the United
States and asylum, said David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   During the day Friday, Elian played in his relatives' yard with a puppy
named Dolphin, a gift from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. The black Labrador
chased Elian around the yard and playfully nipped at his blue soccer shorts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian tells me he does not want to go back to Cuba,'' said Delfin
Gonzalez, another of Elian's great-uncles. He said Elian wants his family to
come here.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials have suggested Elian's father come to Florida to get his son,
while the U.S. National Council of Churches said the boy's relatives in Cuba
want the organization to bring the boy back.

<HEADLINE> McCain Balances Reform and Power  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain the political reformer is face to face with
John McCain the power-wielding Senate committee chairman, and the fate of John
McCain the Republican presidential hopeful may depend on their compatibility.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My job is to make the bureaucrats work for the people,'' McCain insisted
this week when pressed about a letter he wrote to the Federal Communications
Commission on behalf of a political donor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would do the same thing again, almost anytime,'' added the Arizona
senator, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee with jurisdiction over
communications, transportation and other sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   He merely asked the FCC to issue a ruling after two years of deliberations,
he said, and didn't suggest which way the agency should come down on a request
for Paxson Communications to purchase a television station in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's defenders say that what he did is business-as-usual in Washington,
and they're right.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC says it has received between 7,000 and 8,000 pieces of
correspondence a year from members of Congress in the past three years. McCain's
office authored 215 of them. And apart from the senator's letter about Paxson,
the agency heard from nine other lawmakers interested in the same issue.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a form of constituent service. Members of Congress have legal
jurisdiction over federal agencies, and private interests have a right to appeal
to their representatives for help.
</P>
<P>
	   That makes the two groups natural partners in alliances that -- in the
current era -- often are sealed with campaign cash, and lots of it.
</P>
<P>
	   The nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity released its quadrennial book
recently on the ties between presidential hopefuls and their political donors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the leading presidential candidates have a long-standing group of
career patrons who have sponsored their careers and for whom they have done
favors using their government offices,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director
of the center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a mutually beneficial relationship.''
</P>
<P>
	   Except now for McCain, who has emerged as George W. Bush's leading rival for
the GOP presidential nomination on the stength of his pledge to rid the nation
of what he calls the ``pernicious'' influence of big money.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue arose anew in a debate Friday night, and again McCain defended his
actions. Seeking to turn the issue to his advantage, he announced in a
post-debate interview that his Senate office on Saturday would be releasing
numerous letters he had written to agencies and his campaign manager suggested
that other presidential hopefuls do likewise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's suspicion about all of us as a result of these huge amounts of
money that wash around political campaigns,'' the senator said this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With me, being the 'reformer,' obviously those stories are more
relevant.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ``story'' in this case is that Paxson officials made $20,000 in campaign
donations, and the senator was permitted to use the company's jet. McCain
vigorously denies a quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator's advocacy of campaign finance reform is especially attractive
to independent voters, and in New Hampshire independents are allowed to vote in
either the Republican or Democratic primary. McCain hopes thousands of them show
up to support him when the Granite State holds the first presidential primary of
the year on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The importance of the state to his prospects couldn't be clearer.
</P>
<P>
	   He himself has said he needs to win or at least come in a close second to
maintain his viability in a race that looks otherwise like a romp for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In private, several GOP sources said during the week that McCain was furious
over the issue coming up -- and wondering whether Bush had a hand in it.
</P>
<P>
	   In public, though, McCain has faced the first major flare-up of his campaign
with equanimity. He smiled his way through Thursday night's debate, much as he
kept his good humor in the Senate last fall when fellow Republicans challenged
him during debate over campaign finance legislation to specify who among them
had been corrupted by the power of big money.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican sources, speaking privately at the time, said those challenges
were part of an effort to make the Arizonan lose his temper in public.
</P>
<P>
	   That would be unsenatorial inside the Capitol, unpresidential in the context
of his current pursuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is dealing carefully with the issue, declining to attack McCain
directly, yet subtly seeking gain. ``I'm not a committee chairman,'' he said on
Thursday. ``I'm an outsider.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, though, opened up another front: He criticized McCain's campaign
finance proposal for threatening to harm the Republican Party and the
``conservative cause.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain never figured to win the New Hampshire primary on the strength of
conservative Republicans alone, but he can scarcely afford to be viewed as an
enemy of the effort to turn the Democrats out of the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   So now he's got to blunt that charge, at the same time taking care that the
message conveyed by his senatorial letter writing doesn't drown out the one he's
trying to project to the voters who have warmed to his insurgent's campaign.

<HEADLINE> China Sentences Teen-age Dissident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A 19-year-old dissident in eastern China's Jiangsu province
has been sentenced to three years in prison on subversion charges, a human
rights group reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Xuzhou city Intermediate Court sentenced Wang Yingzheng late last month
after a closed trial, and his family only discovered the verdict after receiving
a letter, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members who recently visited Wang were told he had been refusing
food, the fifth time he has staged a hunger strike since he was arrested last
February, the center said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wang is believed to have been convicted for writing an open letter to
President Jiang Zemin urging the Communist Party to eradicate rampant
corruption, the Information Center said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police seized Wang while he was photocopying an article he wrote about
corruption. The article said the party would not be able to root out corruption
unless it allowed opposition parties and freed the news media from state
control, according to the group.
</P>
<P>
	   After graduating from high school, Wang helped Qin Yongmin, a veteran
dissident, organize an opposition group, the China Democracy Party. Authorities
refused to register the party legally and in December sentenced Qin to 12 years
in prison.

<HEADLINE> Speculation in Shipyard Killings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A fired shipyard employee gunned down two men in a deliberate
act of revenge that was elaborately plotted, prosecutors alleged in filing
murder charges Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin William Cruz, 30, was charged with two counts of aggravated
first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder in the Nov. 3 attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a horrible crime and it fits an alarming trend of incomprehensible
violence in our workplaces, schools and even in our churches,'' King County
Prosecutor Norm Maleng said Friday. Maleng declined to say whether he would seek
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Cruz was fired from the Northlake Shipyard in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors believe he harbored a grudge because he was fired soon after the
company's insurance company cut off his benefits for a work-related injury,
saying he wasn't really hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Cruz was arrested Tuesday and was being held on $4 million bail.
</P>
<P>
	   He ``claims to have serious mental problems and states that he hears
voices,'' according to court documents. But Maleng said Cruz, who has an
extensive criminal record, has never been evaluated or treated by the state for
mental illness.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, prosecutors detailed a carefully crafted revenge plot.
</P>
<P>
	   They alleged that Cruz grew out his hair and beard to change his appearance,
then, wearing camouflage clothing, slipped into the shipyard's main building and
opened fire on the business office.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said the gunman first targeted Peter Giles, 27, the shipyard
owners' nephew and acting supervisor, and then shot the foreman, Russell James
Brisendine, 43. Both were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Ming, 19, a receptionist, was shot in the arm, and Jaromir Moch, 58,
a customer, was shot at least once in the chest.
</P>
<P>
	   The day after the shootings, Cruz shaved his beard and had a new driver's
license photo taken, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   The insurance company alerted investigators after the shooting that Cruz
might have a grudge. But neither Moch nor Ming recognized a photo of Cruz, who
was then clean-shaven.
</P>
<P>
	   The break in the case came after a bicyclist on Sunday spotted a weathered
backpack hidden in blackberry bushes near the shipyard, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the pack was a Glock 9mm semiautomatic pistol and, among other things, a
United Airlines toiletry kit. Cruz's mother, who shares a home with her son near
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, works for United Airlines, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cruz acknowledged that the backpack was his, prosecutors said, and
ballistics tests determined the gun had been used in the shipyard
shootings.

   MIAMI (AP) -- In efforts to prevent Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba, an
anti-Castro lawmaker subpoenaed him Friday to testify before a congressional

</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said he subpoenaed 6-year-old Elian to testify
before the Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10, so he remains in the
country while the courts consider his case.
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 supporters cheered wildly as Elian -- holding the subpoena in
front of his face while being held aloft by a relative -- appeared outside the
house where he has been staying with relatives. He gave the peace sign before
heading back indoors.
</P>
<P>
	   But in Cuba, Elian's father was angry about Burton's subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What right does that man have?'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said during a news
conference in his hometown of Cardenas. ``I am the father of Elian and
immigration has said that I am the only one who can speak for him
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why should it be delayed? Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after his
mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned while trying to reach Florida
by boat.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was placed with his great-uncle and great-aunt in Miami, but the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled Wednesday that he must be returned
to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14. The decision touched off protests in the
Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton, the committee's chairman, said in a release he ``issued a subpoena
to Elian Gonzalez to ensure that no precipitous action is taken until the
Florida State court in Miami can adequately address the Gonzalez case.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton is an outspoken critic of the Castro regime. A 1996 law named for him
and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., strengthened the 1959 trade embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that while
the subpoena requires that Elian attend the hearing in Washington, it's highly
unlikely that his actual appearance will be sought.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Congress of the United States is affording Elian Gonzalez what INS and
this administration has not, which is his legal right and his right to due
process,'' said Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation. ``This gives him the protection that he will not be repatriated to
Cuba between now and Feb. 10.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, lawyers filed a petition on behalf of Elian's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez. It is an attempt by his Miami relatives to get guardianship and
then to file for applications for admission to the United States and asylum,
said David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the lawyers nor Elian's relatives would comment before the judge's
ruling, which is expected early next week.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, meanwhile, tens of thousands of people rallied in a seaside plaza
Friday night to demand his return. ``Elian, Cardenas awaits you ... with
kisses,'' a Cuban country music band sang.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo,
accompanied by one of the family's lawyers, flew to Washington to appeal
directly to Attorney General Janet Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also asked President
Clinton to reverse the INS order.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno said she is considering the issues raised in the meeting and the state
court action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I plan to respond as quickly as possible,'' she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has said she was consulted on the INS decision and approved of it.
Clinton said Friday the INS did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe they followed the law,'' Clinton said. ``This is a volatile and
difficult case. ... We need to keep this out of the political process as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to Thursday, when two Cuban exile leaders and 133 other people
were arrested and police were forced to use tear gas to disperse a crowd,
protesters in Miami were much calmer Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Cuban exile community called for more civil disobedience. About
100 protesters marched in front of the federal building in Orlando on Friday
night, waving Cuban and American flags and chanting ``Cuba libre'' and ``long
live the USA.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two men carried a banner that said ``President Clinton, Please keep Elian in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters planned a large demonstration in Little Havana on Saturday and
were planning to drive around Miami International Airport on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the child is sent back to Cuba without his day in court, all hell is
going to break loose,'' said Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally in Cardenas, Cuba, was marked by songs, tears and personal
recollections of Elian. It was the most personal and emotional of many held
since early December, when Cuban President Fidel Castro promised mass
mobilization until the boy was returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, his four grandparents and his great-grandmother began
weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage as the group sang of the
boy's mother. Gonzalez looked particularly distraught, his eyes red from crying.
</P>
<P>
	   During the day Friday, Elian played in his relatives' yard with a puppy
named Dolphin, a gift from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. The black Labrador
chased Elian around the yard and playfully nipped at his blue soccer shorts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian tells me he does not want to go back to Cuba,'' said Delfin
Gonzalez, another of Elian's great-uncles. He said Elian wants his family to
come here.

<HEADLINE> McCain Letters Spark Questions  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At least 15 times since 1997, Sen. John McCain wrote
federal regulators in his capacity as Commerce Committee chairman on behalf of
major donors from airlines to telephone companies, hundreds of memos obtained by
The Associated Press show.
</P>
<P>
	   In one such letter, McCain urged the Federal Communications Commission in
the fall of 1998 to give ``serious consideration'' to BellSouth's request to
offer long-distance service. BellSouth employees are the third-largest
contributor to his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   And two weeks after Ameritech's chairman held a fund-raiser for him last
spring, McCain sent a stinging letter to federal regulators accusing them of
being unfair toward the phone company's proposed merger with another Bell
company.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter accused the commission of ``applying a different, and much
stricter, burden of proof in this merger proceeding than the commission has
applied in evaluating other mergers.''
</P>
<P>
	   It also said, ``This letter expresses no view on the merits of any issues in
this proceeding and is not written to benefit any particular party.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a debate Friday night, McCain was questioned about the Ameritech letter
and said, ``All the times when I have weighed in, I have asked them to do their
duty and to expedite the procedures as they're laid out under the law and
according to existing regulations.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will continue to do that job, and when a constituent, a person of mine
who has trouble -- or a citizen of this country who can't get a reaction or an
answer from a bureaucracy that's paid for with their tax dollars, I believe that
people like me should weigh in,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign manager, Rick Davis, called on the other candidates to release
letters showing their intervention on behalf of donors. Of particular interest
to the McCain campaign is Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
	   The documents, which were provided to the AP by the Senate Commerce
Committee, were among more than 500 letters McCain has written to federal
agencies over the last three years as the panel's chairman. The committee plans
to make then public Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen letters reviewed by the AP were on behalf of companies that McCain's
campaign identified as large contributors. Most of the rest were on behalf of
constituents, such as more than 20 travel agents who had complained their
commission fees were being capped by airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is hardly alone in his letter writing. The FCC said this week it had
received between 7,000 and 8,000 pieces of correspondence a year from lawmakers
in the past three years about issues pending before the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters come to light at a pivotal time for McCain in his bid for the
Republican presidential nomination. The Arizona senator has risen in the polls
while campaigning to rid the nation's political system of what he calls the
``pernicious'' influence of money.
</P>
<P>
	   That campaign theme has struck a chord among independents, and has helped
vault McCain into a highly competitive race with Bush in New Hampshire, the
nation's first primary state.
</P>
<P>
	   But in recent days, he has been forced to answer questions about his role
helping donors.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Ameritech matter, McCain wrote April 12 that the Senate Commerce
Committee chairman and some of his colleagues were ``extremely troubled'' by the
Federal Communications Commission's handling of the proposed merger between SBC
Communications and Ameritech.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain wrote FCC chairman William Kennard: ``Your improvisational process
will only kill more time and raise the chances of a legally flawed decision.''
The letter also was signed by Sens. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., and Sam Brownback,
R-Kan.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter followed on the heels of a $1,000-per-person fund-raiser hosted
March 30 at a Chicago hotel by Ameritech chief Richard Notebaert, a member of
McCain's fund-raising team.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Ameritech, a Midwest phone company, had been trying for months
to get FCC approval for its merger with SBC, which is based in the Southwest.
The deal, which eventually was approved, created the nation's largest local
phone company.
</P>
<P>
	   In May, McCain sent another letter to the FCC, criticizing agency personnel
for making public negative statements about the merger before a decision was
made, saying such comments ``cast an indelible stain on the fairness of this
proceeding.'' It was the second time in five months McCain had criticized the
FCC for making inflammatory remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain officials said the senator was simply concerned about the conduct of
FCC officials and never intended to force a positive ruling for Ameritech. They
noted McCain has even raised questions about whether the merger might stifle
competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Employees of Ameritech and their families and the company's political action
committee had contributed $16,000 to McCain's presidential campaign through
Sept. 30, his ninth most generous giver. SBC Communications employees and their
families and the company PAC had given a total of $9,750.
</P>
<P>
	   Ameritech denied any connection between the fund-raisers and McCain's
letter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was totally Dick Notebaert's personal involvement as a member of the
host committee in Chicago,'' spokesman Dave Pacholczyk said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the BellSouth matter, McCain urged FCC Chairman William Kennard to
consider wireless services, such as Sprint PCS, as competitors to BellSouth.
Such a ruling would remove a regulatory barrier the regional Bell companies
faced in their bids to provide long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I encourage you to give serious consideration to whether PCS is providing
competition to the local exchange market,'' McCain wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Commerce Committee Republican staff director Mark Buse said McCain's
advocacy on behalf of the Baby Bells is consistent with his support for
telecommunications competition that would result in lower prices for customers.
</P>
<P>
	   BellSouth and their employees have contributed $30,000 to his presidential
bid through Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   In other letters on behalf of donors:
</P>
<P>
	   --At the behest of Global Crossing, McCain asked the FCC in March 1999 to
encourage the development of undersea cables for transmitting telecommunications
signals.
</P>
<P>
	   --In December 1998, McCain urged the FCC to make it easier for companies to
own more than one television station in a market. The letter's advocacy helps
local TV station owners like Paxson Communications and Sinclair Broadcasting,
two donors to McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   --In February 1998, McCain wrote Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater on
behalf of America West airlines, whose employees are contributors to his
campaign, and the city of Flagstaff, Ariz. The letter urged better routes to
surrounding cities.

Bush, McCain Clash Over Taxes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) --Republican presidential front-runner Texas Gov.
George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain clashed sharply over tax cuts in the second
GOP campaign debate tonight. Referring to Bush's tax plan, McCain said it was
fiscally irresponsible to promise a huge tax cut that is based on a surplus the
U.S. might not have. Bush retorted that his plan was more generous than McCain's
for lower income taxpayers.

Relatives Aim To Keep Elian in U.S.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- In efforts to prevent Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba, a
Republican lawmaker subpoenaed him today to testify before a congressional
committee and one of his Miami relatives sought to become his legal guardian.
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said he subpoenaed 6-year-old Elian to testify before
the Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10, so that he remains in the country
while the courts can consider his case. About 100 supporters cheered wildly as
Elian -- holding the subpoena in front of his face while being held high by a
relative -- appeared outside the house where he has been staying with relatives.
Elian gave the crowd the peace sign before heading back indoors.

Supporters Rally for Confederate Flag
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- With a bell ringing for South Carolina's Confederate
War dead, Confederate flag supporters began a three-day rally today at the only
statehouse where the Confederate flag still flies from the dome. The Confederate
flag, with its field of red and star-studded blue cross, is seen as symbol of
hate by some opponents. But groups like those gathering at the rally see it as a
symbol of Southern heritage. South Carolina remains the only state that flies
the flag above its Statehouse, and the NAACP has called a tourism boycott of
South Carolina until the Legislature brings it down. The three-day rally shows
"it's OK for us to care about and promote our heritage," said the Rev. Bobby
Eubanks, a spokesman.

Speculation Looms in Shipyard Killings
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- A fired shipyard employee gunned down two men in a
deliberate act of revenge that was elaborately plotted, prosecutors alleged in
filing murder charges today. Kevin William Cruz, 30, was charged with two counts
of aggravated first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder in the Nov.
3 attack. Cruz was fired from the Northlake Shipyard in January 1999.
Prosecutors believe he harbored a grudge because he was fired soon after the
company's insurance company cut off his benefits for a work-related injury,
saying he wasn't really hurt. Cruz was arrested Tuesday and was being held on $4
million bail.

China Sentences Teen-Age Dissident
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- A 19-year-old dissident in eastern China's Jiangsu province
has been sentenced to three years in prison on subversion charges, a human
rights group reported Saturday. Family members who recently visited Wang were
told he had been refusing food, the fifth time he has staged a hunger strike
since he was arrested last February, the center said. Wang is believed to have
been convicted for writing an open letter to President Jiang Zemin urging the
Communist Party to eradicate rampant corruption, the Information Center said.

Rapper Faces Shooting Lawsuit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rap star Sean "Puffy" Combs was sued today for $50 million
by a man who was shot in a Times Square-area nightclub last week. Robert
Thompson, 38, of Danbury, Conn., alleges he was shot in the right shoulder by
Combs protege Jamal Barrow during a dispute in Club NY on Dec. 27. Kenneth
Nolan, Thompson's lawyer, said Combs was sued because it is unclear whether the
rapper encouraged Barrow to fire and whether Combs had a gun in the club. Nolan
said that if he learns that Combs did nothing illegal, he will amend the
complaint.

Dow Soars to Record High

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure as the
Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory today. The Nasdaq composite,

Bulls Whip Wizards 110-103

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Toni Kukoc scored 33 points to help the Chicago Bulls
come up with a series of firsts in a come-from-behind 110-103 victory over the
Washington Wizards on today. It was the Bulls' second consecutive victory, both
against the Wizards, to give them their first winning streak of the season. In
addition, it was Chicago's first road victory after 15 consecutive losses and
the first time the Bulls reached 100 points this season. The Wizards held
several 10-point leads in the first half and had an 11-point advantage early in
the third quarter before Kukoc and B.J. Armstrong sparked the Bulls.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Students Reject Offer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Striking Mexican students rejected university officials'
offer Friday to meet some of their demands to end an eight-month strike that has
shut down the nation's largest public school.
</P>
<P>
	   The strikers, who seized the campus of the National Autonomous University of
Mexico on April 20, said the offer did not go far enough. The students said they
are now demanding the release of several students arrested after launching
bottle rockets at the U.S. Embassy during a December demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   While there are 268,000 students at the university, the strikers represent a
few thousand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have come close to meeting the demands originally put forward'' by the
striking students, said Xavier Soberon, who represents the university's rector
in negotiations with the strikers.
</P>
<P>
	   The offer included eliminating a plan to raise tuition from the equivalent
of a few cents to $140 annually. That proposed tuition increase -- the first in
decades -- was what originally sparked the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   The university negotiators walked out of Friday's talks after six hours
because the students refused to discuss the offer.
</P>
<P>
	   The students' demands also include automatic admission for graduates of the
university's prep school and a lowering of academic standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The university offer, drawn up by newly appointed Rector Juan Ramon de la
Fuente, said those issues should be voted on at a convention of university
staff, faculty and students.

<HEADLINE> Woods Cruising To Another Win  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- Tiger Woods drove the green on two par-4s. His
7-under 66 was eight shots better than the average score Friday. He wound up
with a four-shot lead halfway home to his fifth consecutive PGA Tour victory.
</P>
<P>
	   After watching yet another remarkable display by the No. 1 player in the
world, Ernie Els had only one explanation after the second round of the Mercedes
Championship.
</P>
<P>
	   "The guy is kind of a freak, you know what I mean?" Els said, an
exasperation felt by the other 28 winners from last season gathered in Maui for
what is shaping up to be another runaway victory by Woods.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going to try to win this tournament," Els said. "It's going to take a
lot. You never know, Tiger might make mistakes. Hopefully, he's human."
</P>
<P>
	   Even that might be in question right now.
</P>
<P>
	   No one since Ben Hogan in 1953 has fired off five consecutive victories, and
Woods used Hogan-like precision to make a wind-ravaged Plantation Course at
Kapalua look like a pitch-and-putt.
</P>
<P>
	   "The string is over," Woods said of his four straight victories to close out
the '99 season. "That was last year. This is a whole new year. I need a fresh
start. I need to move on and try to play good golf and improve my game."
</P>
<P>
	   With birdies on five of the last seven holes, Woods finished two rounds at
9-under 137, four shots ahead of Els.
</P>
<P>
	   Els had at 3-under 70 and gets the honor of playing with Woods again on
Saturday. While he crushed Woods over the final 36 holes at Bay Hill in 1998,
Els was also the victim of an eight-stroke comeback in the final round at
Thailand two years ago, and at Disney in October.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like to beat him once," he said. "Don't get me wrong. I'm not out there
playing for second. But it's awfully tough playing a guy who's driving onto
greens that are 450 yards away."
</P>
<P>
	   Jesper Parnevik made two more double bogeys on the back nine and finished
with a 74, five shots back at 143. Jeff Sluman had a 1-under 72 and was at 144.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tiger ... this guy is on fire," Els said. "He's got all the talent in the
world. What can you do? You've just got to stick to your guns. But he's got
bigger guns that I have."
</P>
<P>
	   How big?
</P>
<P>
	   Woods seized control on the tournament with a tee shot that bounded onto the
green on the 373-yard 11th hole, just past the left foot of Jim Furyk as he was
lining up his putt. Should Woods have warned him?
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think I would have heard him, being 500 yards away," Furyk said
with a laugh. "The fans were trying to tell me to watch out, but I didn't know
what they were talking about."
</P>
<P>
	   Watch out, indeed!
</P>
<P>
	   Woods' 66 was more than eight shots better than the average score on Friday,
and only five other players managed to break par. The dominance was similar to
his final round at Valderrama, where he won for the fourth straight time to
close out a sensational season.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven weeks later, not much has changed. The cast of contenders is
different, as it has every week. The name at the top stays the same.
</P>
<P>
	   "The more you're in awe of him, the more you can't beat him," Stuart Appleby
said. "He has the potential to be the best player in the last 50 years, no doubt
about that. You could pat him on the back, but what's the point? He knows how
good he is."
</P>
<P>
	   Defending champion David Duval had two bad swings on the par-5s, both of
which led to bogeys, and wound up with a 73 that left him at 145 -- eight
strokes back.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not surprised," Duval said of Woods' score. "If you're playing well,
you can shoot those type of scores any time."
</P>
<P>
	   Friday would have been the perfect occasion for Els, the two-time U.S. Open
champion, to show that he was ready to raise his talent a notch to challenge
Woods. Not this day.
</P>
<P>
	   The South African known as "Big Easy" tried to keep pace with Woods, but he
was no match, especially off the tee.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods rode the wind to a couple of phenomenal drives. The first came on the
398-yard sixth hole when his tee shot sailed over a bunker in the middle of the
fairway, caught the downslope and stopped 50 feet from the pin. Woods had four
eagle putts on the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik was tied with Woods for much of the round, but he didn't drive the
green on any par-4s. In fact, the Swede hit his tee shot on No. 12 in the same
shrubs that led to double bogey in the first round.
</P>
<P>
	   Notah Begay, a teammate of Woods at Stanford, also made a run until he took
a triple bogey and a quadruple bogey on the back nine, going from three shots
off the lead to 11 shots back in the span of two holes.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Relatives File Petition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- In Cuba's most emotional demonstration since an
international custody battle broke out over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, tens of
thousands of people from the boy's hometown rallied in a seaside plaza Friday
night to demand his return from Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Marked by tears, songs and personal recollections, the rally matched the
emotional content of angry demonstrations by Cuban exiles in Miami who fiercely
oppose a U.S. government decision to return Elian to his father's home here.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian, Cardenas awaits you ... with kisses,'' a Cuban band sang.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his four grandparents and his
great-grandmother began weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage
as the group sang of his mother, who was lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez looked particularly exhausted and distraught, his eyes red from
crying. Telling the crowd of ``hard and difficult days'' suffered since the
child was rescued at sea, Gonzalez said that ``our tears have given way to
patriotic pride'' seeing tens of thousands turn out regularly demand Elian's
return.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been at the center of an international custody battle since
fishermen found him lashed to an inner tube floating off the coast of Florida on
Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami, has temporary custody of the
boy and want to keep him permanently in the United States. He says he can give
Elian a better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has demanded that his child be returned to him, and the U.S.
government has ruled that the father and child should be reunited by next
Friday, Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally in Cardenas was the most personal and emotional of many held since
early December when President Fidel Castro promised mass mobilization until the
boy was returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   The speakers included classmates from Elian's elementary school, his
teacher, his school principal, and the doctor who has been caring for him since
he was a baby.
</P>
<P>
	   In a homage to the small boy with dark eyes who loves all things that fly,
two kites sailed high over the rally -- one of them flown by a boy named Julio.
</P>
<P>
	   It was imprinted with Elian's portrait and read, ``Julio claims you,
Eliancito.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the rally, many of the young children broke down in tears and were
carried out by parents or members of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly, encouraged the crowd
to keep protesting until is back with his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot call a truce yet,'' Alarcon said, warning that exiles in Miami
were trying to delay the child's return. ``We cannot let down our guard until
the kidnapping of Elian comes to an end.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also called to an end to the Cuban Adjustment Act, a 1966 law that he
blamed for the custody flap. Under the law, any Cuban who reaches American soil
has the right to stay and seek permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The case of Elian Gonzalez is the most repugnant expression of this law,''
said Alarcon, Fidel Castro's top man on American policy issues. ``It is the most
vulgar, the most cruel manipulation of a child ... really child abuse.'

<HEADLINE> Dominicans Aim To Keep Out Haitians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Dominican soldiers on Friday began
a 15-day mission on the border with Haiti to guard against the illegal entry of
Haitians and repatriate immigrants without documents.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of Haitians repatriated from the Dominican Republic has caused
friction between the two countries, which share the Caribbean island of
Hispaniola. Haiti accused the Dominican Republic of expelling as many as 5,000
undocumented Haitians without allowing them to collect their belongings, but
Dominican officials claimed that they followed proper procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Manuel de Jesus Florentino, secretary of the armed forces, said the
mission began early Friday morning for training purposes and to guard the border
from illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the Dominican government promised to be more careful to protect
human rights when repatriating undocumented Haitian nationals. In turn, Haiti
promised to step up its own border patrols.

<HEADLINE> Knicks 94, Magic 86  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Allan Houston scored 23 points and Latrell Sprewell
had 19 Friday night as the New York Knicks held off the Orlando Magic 94-86 for
their third straight win.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was the 10th in 13 games for the Knicks, who improved to 9-3
since Patrick Ewing returned to the lineup after being on the injured list for
the first six weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Ewing had 18 points, nine rebounds and three blocks, while reserve Kurt
Thomas finished with 10 points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   New York shot 78 percent in the third quarter, making 14 of 18 shots, and
pulled away during a 21-10 run that built its lead from two to 13. It was 75-64
going into the fourth quarter, and the closest the Magic got in the final period
was six with just under a minute to go.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss was the sixth in seven games for Orlando, which broke a five-game
losing streak with a victory over Vancouver on Wednesday night. The Magic scored
10 straight to pull to 92-86 before Larry Johnson made two free throws to stop
the momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   Darrell Armstrong led Orlando with 16 points. Corey Maggette had 14 points,
while reserve Chris Gatling added 11 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic stayed close early, trailing 23-22 after one quarter and 41-40 at
the half, despite shooting 31 percent from the field. They made up for the poor
marksmanship by outrebounding the Knicks 33-22 with Gatling coming off the bench
to grab nine before halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprewell, Houston and Ewing led New York's torrid shooting in the third
quarter, scoring 29 of the Knicks' 34 points in the period. Sprewell had 12 of
5-for-6 shooting, while Houston (4-for-5) had nine and Ewing (3-for-5) eight.
</P>
<P>
	   The Knicks led 50-48 before they went on their decisive run. Sprewell and
Ewing each had six points in the surge, while Charlie Ward delivered a 3-pointer
for his only points of the game.

<HEADLINE> Howard Fires Basketball Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kirk Saulny was fired Friday as men's basketball coach by
Howard University after an investigation determined he had broken NCAA and
school rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Frelow, a university spokesman, said two assistants also were fired.
The school's web site lists Darryl Bruce and Lamont Franklin as assistants on
Saulny's staff. According to a university statement, two players also were
declared ineligible for the spring semester as a result of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington Post reported in Saturday's edition that the players are
junior forward Donte Lincoln and sophomore forward Darren Kennedy. The newspaper
says the inquiry centered around the recruitment of Lincoln, a junior college
transfer from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations included one that Lincoln's transcript had been altered,
according to the Post.
</P>
<P>
	   Saulny was 0-9 in his second season after going 2-25 last season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We cannot and will not tolerate any conduct inconsistent with the NCAA
bylaws and our own Code of Ethics and Conduct," Raymond Archer, Howard's vice
president of student affairs, said in the written statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Frelow said there would be no comment on findings of the investigation until
they were reviewed by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
	   Athletic director Hank Ford will name the interim coach for Saturday's home
Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference game against North Carolina A&AMP;T. A search for a
permanent coach will begin immediately, Frelow said.
</P>
<P>
	   Saulny, 40, came to Howard in June 1998 after four seasons on the staff at
North Carolina-Wilmington. He also was an assist at Tulane (1981-85), New
Orleans (1985-87) and Columbia (1988-94).
