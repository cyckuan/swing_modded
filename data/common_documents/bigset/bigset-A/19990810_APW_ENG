<HEADLINE> Blues' Tony Twist Hurt in Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Blues enforcer Tony Twist was  
hospitalized in intensive care following a motorcycle accident, the 
Blues said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened shortly after 10 p.m. Monday in Creve  
Coeur, a suburb of St. Louis. Police said a car pulled from a 
parking lot in front of Twist's motorcycle, which struck the side 
of the car, ejecting Twist. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed, Capt. Dale Bailey said. The driver  
of the car was also hurt. His condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Twist was taken to St. John's Mercy Medical Center in suburban  
St. Louis. The Blues said he would be transferred later today to 
Barnes-Jewish Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A St. John's spokeswoman said Twist's family asked that no  
details of his condition be released. 
</P>
<P>
	Blues team doctors were with Twist, considered one of the NHL's  
best fighters. He is one of St. Louis' most popular sports figures, 
largely because he has long been active in community and charitable 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Twist became an unrestricted free agent after the 1998-99  
season, and has not signed with any team. In 63 games last season 
for St. Louis, Twist had two goals and eight points while 
accumulating 149 penalty minutes.

<HEADLINE> Hiker Arraigned on Murder Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- A hiker rescued from the desert back  
country of Carlsbad Caverns National Park says he killed his 
companion to put him out of his misery when the pair became lost 
and were dying of thirst, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raffi Kodikian, 26, of Boston was arraigned Monday on an open  
murder charge. Eddy County Sheriff M.A. ``Chunky'' Click said an 
open count means investigators have not determined how serious the 
charge should be. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy Tuesday showed 26-year-old David Coughlin of Millis,  
Mass., had been stabbed twice in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Stepetic, associate director of the state Office of the  
Medical Investigator, said it may not be possible to determine 
whether Coughlin was dying before he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond was set at $50,000, and Kodikian was freed on bail Tuesday  
morning with the proviso that he not leave the county, jail Lt. 
Dean Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Park rangers on Sunday found Kodikian camped next to Coughlin's  
shallow grave. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodikian was suffering from dehydration and exposure when  
rangers found him about a mile from the nearest road and about two 
miles from the park's visitors center, the sheriff said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The men arrived at the park Aug. 4 and obtained a two-day  
camping permit. Park officials were not concerned at first when 
they did not return on time, since campers often get an extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers launched a search Sunday, two days after the pair were  
supposed to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodikian reportedly told a ranger that Coughlin was in a lot of  
pain and asked him to kill him and that they were going to die 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were best friends for ages. They were very, very close,''  
Sandy Hobson, a co-worker of Coughlin's, said Tuesday from 
Massachusetts.

	Gunman Shoots 5 at Jewish Center  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man with a high-powered gun burst into a  
Jewish community center today and sprayed the lobby with 20 to 30 
shots, wounding five people, including three boys attending day 
camp, and then walked away. Police searched the surrounding 
suburban neighborhood for the man, described as a bald white male 
around 40 years old. The motive was not known. The most seriously 
injured was a 5-year-old boy who was in critical but stable 
condition. Two 6-year-old boys, a 16-year-old girl and a 
68-year-old woman were in stable condition, officials said. ``Once 
again our, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by gun 
violence,'' said President Clinton.

	Tensions High Between Pakistan, India  
</P>
<P>
	LAKHPAT, India (AP) -- Tensions reignited between the world's  
newest nuclear powers today after India shot down a Pakistani 
reconnaissance plane and Pakistan threatened to retaliate. Pakistan 
said the attack killed 16 of its servicemen. The two countries 
disputed where the plane was shot down and on whose territory its 
wreckage landed. The clash dispelled any immediate hope of moving 
relations between the two powers back onto a peaceful track. India 
and Pakistan have fought three wars since they gained independence 
from Britain in 1947.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inseparable was one label for President  
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore today. They scheduled four 
fund-raising events, three meals, a tour and a roundtable together. 
Last weekend, Clinton and Gore paired up for the first time on the 
Campaign 2000 trail, picking up at least $250,000 in Arkansas and 
trying to put to rest lingering reports of dissension between the 
two men. They have several additional joint fund-raisers planned.

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The United States and South Korea said  
today they will conduct a joint military exercise next week amid 
rising tensions with North Korea and fears that the isolated nation 
will test a new ballistic missile. This week, North Korea accused 
the United States of conspiring to start a war on the Korean 
peninsula by insisting the communist country put off the test 
missile launch. North Korea today also threatened ``merciless 
retaliation'' if Japan tries anything provocative.

	HARPUT, Turkey (AP) -- A 4,000-year-old outpost on the old Silk  
Road was transformed into a bustling tourist center today as 
scientists and eclipse chasers from around the world came in search 
of a front row seat for the last total eclipse of the millennium. 
Once a main stop on the Silk Route, the remote southeastern village 
of Harput has only 150 residents and rarely sees any tourists. But 
more than 1,000 people have descended this week on Harput, which 
gets some of the best visibility in Europe and lies on the eclipse 
line that runs around the globe. The eclipse will take place 
tomorrow at 2:36 p.m. local time, and will last for two minutes.

	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. plans to offer  
voice-activated Internet access in a car by the end of next year as 
part of a campaign announced today. GM has formed an independent 
unit called ``e-GM'' to expand its global electronic commerce 
activities. Within five years, in-car services such as Internet 
access and CD-quality satellite radio broadcasts could generate 
revenues for GM in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion annually, 
said Ron Zarrella, president of GM's North American operations.

	Mid-Night Sleeping Pill Developed  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Insomniacs may soon have a sleeping pill they  
can take in the middle of the night with less fear of being groggy 
in the morning. American Home Products hopes to win U.S. government 
approval later this year for Sonata, a drug that wears off faster 
than existing medicines. Sleep experts say the pill is a 
significant improvement because of the new flexibility it gives 
people who have trouble sacking out. Sonata's effects last just 
four hours. Other pills last eight hours or more.

behind Steve Finley's 22nd homer. Arizona (65-49), which began the 
day 5 1/2 games ahead of second-place San Francisco in the NL West, 
has won four straight and 16 of 20. The Diamondbacks finished last 
with a 65-97 record last year in their inaugural season.

<HEADLINE> Medinah Braces for PGA Championship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- CBS Sports announcer Jim Nantz was walking  
the 18th fairway at Medinah Country Club, trying to get an idea how 
difficult a closing hole it will be for the PGA Championship. 
Perhaps he shouldn't have been watching Fred Couples. 
</P>
<P>
	When his game is on, Couples tends to make everything look easy.  
And when Couples plays with a sense of purpose, he can be downright 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to play well,'' Couples said Monday following his  
first practice round at Medinah. ``I've been home practicing, 
working on my game. I'm ready to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has a lot riding on how he plays this week.  
</P>
<P>
	Couples is the most experienced active American in the Ryder  
Cup, having played on every team since 1989. He would like to play 
on his sixth straight team, and told captain Ben Crenshaw as much 
in a meeting two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he wants to prove he deserves it.  
</P>
<P>
	Currently 17th in the standings going into the final event for  
Ryder Cup points, Couples would have to finish at least fourth to 
have any chance of getting one of the 10 automatic berths. The more 
likely scenario is for him to make the team as a captain's choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't play well here, there's no way I'll be on the  
team,'' Couples said. ``That doesn't mean I need to win here. But I 
need to feel as though I can beat anybody. If I play well, I can 
look at the guy and say, `Hey, I'm hitting it where I'm looking. 
I'm going to be ready.''' 
</P>
<P>
	What kind of score will that take? Couples isn't sure.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he's not exactly sure what to make of Medinah, which  
hasn't seen the top players in the world since the 1990 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	All Couples and the rest of the field know is that at 7,401  
yards, Medinah is the longest course for a major championship that 
wasn't played in high altitude. It might play shorter, depending on 
where the PGA of America puts the tees, but there is no mistaking 
the par-5s -- three of them are at least 580 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're fairly boring in a golf way,'' Couples said of the  
par-5s. ``They're beautiful holes. But you hit a drive and then 
say, `What do I have -- 320 to the front?' Hit 4-iron and 80-yard 
shot. But they're very difficult. I wouldn't mind par on every 
other one, because you can make 6s on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That and the greens, which were so baked by record heat in  
Chicago that many of them already had brown spots on them Monday, 
were his only complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Medinah is known as the ``Monster of the Midwest,'' and it has  
Couples' utmost respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to be playing a course of this caliber,'' he said.  
``From the standpoint of hitting the ball, I think it's one of the 
hardest courses we'll play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest course in what has been a tough test of majors was  
Carnoustie Golf Links, something Couples chose not to experience. 
He wanted to go, but didn't consider it a prudent decision to risk 
back problems with a trip over the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	After what he saw on television -- 6-over as the winning score --  
it was a smart decision. But Couples is also enjoying the best of 
times of his life with his wife, Thais, and the six weeks away from 
golf has helped recharge his batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been in competition for a while, so that's tough,''  
he said. ``But I hope to be ready to go. I feel like I'm way better 
than I was a month ago. Even if I don't do well, I feel I'm back to 
playing a little better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be good news to Crenshaw, who fills out the remaining  
two players on his U.S. team the morning after the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Couples is part of that team could depend largely on how  
he handles Medinah. Couples has earned nine points in his five 
years on the Ryder Cup (7-9-4), but he hasn't lost a Sunday singles 
match since his first year in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said his days on the Ryder Cup are numbered. He has said  
he would not be afraid to tell Crenshaw or any other captain not to 
consider him as a captain's pick if he didn't feel like he deserved 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Couples isn't ready to concede that quite yet.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do I want to play? Heck, yeah,'' he said. ``I'd love to be on  
the team.''

<P>
	Vrankovic, 35, played in two games for the Clippers last season,  
scoring two points and grabbing six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-2 Vrankovic came to the Clippers from Minnesota on  
June 25, 1997, in a trade for center Stanley Roberts. Vrankovic

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Leaves Game With Back Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mark McGwire, stuck on 501 career homers  
after passing the historic mark last week, left the St. Louis 
Cardinals' game Tuesday night with tightness in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who thrilled a large crowd at Veterans Stadium with a  
power-hitting show in batting practice, walked in his only at-bat 
against Phillies starter Robert Person. He did not take the field 
for the bottom of the second inning, replaced by Craig Paquette. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals said McGwire left the game as a precaution.  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who leads the majors with 44 homers, hasn't hit one in  
13 at-bats since hitting his 500th and 501st last Thursday against 
San Diego. He was 1-for-10 with no extra-base hits in a four-game 
series at Pittsburgh over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	His longest homerless drought this season was 41 at-bats,  
between his fifth and sixth of the season. He has gone 15 at-bats 
without a homer only five times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who has battled back problems since 1989, missed three  
games last month due to back spasms. During a news conference 
Monday before the opener of this three-game series in Philadelphia, 
McGwire commented that this is the first season since then that he 
hasn't missed at least 10 days because of his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deal with it every day,'' McGwire said.  
</P>
<P>
	He showed no ill-effects during batting practice. With most  
seats in the left-field upper deck filled, McGwire homered on 14 of 
15 swings at one point. A couple of his massive clouts landed 
nearly halfway to the top of the upper deck.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Settles With Sweepstake Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Ed McMahon and Dick Clark didn't deliver  
the check, but North Carolina came out a million-dollar winner 
against the American Family Publishers sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will pay the state $1 million to settle a contempt  
of court case involving deceptive mailings, Attorney General Mike 
Easley said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal court order in 1993 barred the company from sending  
misleading promotions into the state. But the company sent new 
mailings in late 1997 and 1998 that indicated the recipient was one 
of two people with the winning number. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever returns it first wins it all!'' the mailing said.  
</P>
<P>
	A line of tiny type at the top of the envelope said, ``If you  
have the winning number, please be advised ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They thought they had cured the problem with this little trick  
up here,'' Easley said, pointing to the tiny type. ``We told them 
not to use deceptive mailings in North Carolina. They obviously did 
not take our warning seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 mailing led to an agreement between the company and 32  
states to stop some sweepstakes promotion tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Since North Carolina already had a court order barring such  
tactics, the company was found in civil contempt for violating the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	The state will get $200,000 to cover its court and investigation  
costs. The rest of the money will be split between public schools 
and people who purchased numerous magazines from the company, 
Easley said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Gov't OKs Economy Boost Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's cabinet approved a  
multibillion-dollar economic stimulus package on Tuesday that looks 
to boost growth by easing a credit crunch, aiding prospective 
homeowners and cutting production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures are the second major economic stimulus package in  
the past four months designed to lift Thailand out of its waning 
economic crisis and boost growth beyond a predicted 1 percent this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new package, more than $2 billion will be injected  
into the private sector to ease the credit crunch. Banks have been 
reluctant to lend to Thai companies since a financial crash two 
years ago because non-performing loans account for almost half of 
total credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Production costs in key export and other sectors will be reduced  
through cuts in import duties. The government also will mobilize 
$500 million for small and medium-size businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is not enough, we can mobilize up to $1 billion,''  
said Chuti Krairiksh, secretary to Finance Minister Tarrin 
Nimmanhaeminda. ``This is a considerable amount of funds, but it 
can't substitute for investment from the private sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chuti said the government will mobilize $1.25 billion from  
government and private banks to fund home loans for low-income wage 
earners and the middle classes. The government also will 
drastically cut the fee for transferal of land titles, Chuti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those measures are designed to stimulate the moribund real  
estate sector, slumping badly after a property boom imploded along 
with the rest of the economy in mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thai baht ended slightly stronger against the U.S. dollar in  
Tuesday's Asian spot trading, dealers said. Thai stock prices ended 
slightly lower, however, as the package failed to bolster 
confidence in a market which fears a hike in U.S. interest rates.

<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Dell Computer Co. announced Tuesday that  
Amazon.com, the largest retailer of videos, music and books, will 
standardize the company's corporate PC line, OptiPlex. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amazon.com is experiencing a period of phenomenal growth,''  
said John Kinnaird, vice president and general manager of Dell's 
Preferred Accounts Division. ``With that growth comes a vast set of 
complex needs that we can solve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com also will purchase Dell Latitude notebook PCs and  
Dell Precision WorkStations. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal expands the relationship between Seattle-based Amazon  
and Dell, the leading computer system company. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the companies announced a strategic agreement to offer  
linked Web sites and to provide customized content for Amazon.com 
and Dell customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amazon.com and Dell share an obsession with providing the best  
customer experience possible,'' said Jamie Marra, director of 
production services at Amazon.com.

<HEADLINE> USDA Probes Discrimination Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department is investigating  
complaints that black farmers were improperly denied disaster 
assistance in Arkansas and Georgia this year -- even as the 
department was settling a multimillion dollar civil rights lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints involve three of the Farm Service Agency's county  
offices in Arkansas and two in Georgia. A team from the USDA's 
civil rights office was in Georgia last week, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosalind Gray, director of the civil rights office, said the  
department would ``take appropriate action'' when the 
investigations are completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Those cases were among a number of complaints of racial  
discrimination that the department received in distributing the 
disaster aid. Many of the complainants, however, declined to 
cooperate with investigators, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	She provided no details about the Arkansas and Georgia cases.  
</P>
<P>
	Last April, a federal judge approved the settlement of a  
class-action lawsuit alleging that USDA had regularly denied black 
farmers loans and other assistance because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has pledged to root out  
discrimination in the department and said the settlement put a 
``painful chapter of history'' behind the department. Employees 
have undergone training on the department's anti-discrimination 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Some farmers have declined to participate in the settlement,  
saying it was inadequate, and allege that the department hasn't 
disciplined many of the department's local officials who are 
responsible for the discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, about 120 people, including many farmers, marched  
around the Agriculture Department's headquarters, accompanied by 
two mules and chanting slogans such as ``No Justice, No Peace'' and 
``Stop Stealing our Land.'' Later, 14 of the farmers met with Gray 
for 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same system is in place,'' said protest organizer John  
Boyd, referring to department staff. ``Nobody has been held 
accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said some department employees have been fired or  
disciplined but she declined to identify them or even to say how 
many were involved. The department has 1,500 county offices around 
the country managing the department's farm programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd, president of the National Black Farmers Association, said  
he has received complaints recently from producers who say they 
were told by department officials that they didn't need disaster 
grants or loans because they were benefiting from the settlement. 
But he said he was unaware of the Arkansas and Georgia cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm Service Agency officials in the two states declined to  
comment on the investigations except to say they were aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency distributed $2 billion in disaster aid this summer  
for weather-related losses that farmers had suffered in 1998 and 
previous years. Congress is likely to provide additional money for 
losses this year.

<HEADLINE>  Search Is on for L.A. Shooter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A gunman burst into a Jewish community center  
Tuesday and sprayed the lobby with 20 to 30 shots, wounding five 
people, including three boys attending day camp, and then evaded a 
manhunt into the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Several SWAT teams converged on a hotel where authorities found  
a car that they believed may have been carjacked by the suspect, 
described as a balding white man in his 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive for the attack was not known. ``Every possibility,  
including if it's a hate crime, we'll look into it,'' said Officer 
Guillermo Campos. 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously injured was a 5-year-old boy who was shot in  
the stomach and leg and lost 30 percent of his blood. He was in 
critical condition after six hours of surgery and his prognosis for 
recovery was fair, said surgeon Clarence Sutton Jr. said at 
Providence Holy Cross Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a great desire to live and we supported that effort,''  
Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 6-year-old boys and a 16-year-old girl were in stable  
condition at hospitals. Center receptionist Isabelle Shalometh, 68, 
was released from a hospital Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity said the  
receptionist burst into her room with a wounded arm. The teacher 
said she gathered up her students, who joined hands and evacuated 
from the building. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence was the latest in a series of shootings at  
workplaces and schools, and as the search for the gunman continued, 
President Clinton and others spoke out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by  
gun violence,'' Clinton said in Washington. ``It calls on all of us 
not only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their 
families, but intensify our resolve to make America a safer 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis said he was forming a task force of state  
agencies to advise churches, child care centers and other 
operations that care for children on how to upgrade their security 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen children were in the center when the gunman  
burst into the North Valley Jewish Community Center and began 
spraying the lobby with bullets about 10:50 a.m., said Capt. Steve 
Ruda of the Los Angeles Fire Department. He fired up to 30 shots 
before walking down a hallway and out of the building, Ruda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruda said he believed the shooter used a 9mm Uzi. Police Chief  
Bernard Parks however, would only identify the gun as a 
high-powered weapon with a large magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing said by the suspect before the shooting,''  
Parks said. ``It was indiscriminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the shooting, officers raced to a spot about 3  
miles away where a woman reported that a man resembling the 
suspect's description carjacked her Toyota, leaving a red-and-white 
van behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers searched the van, which had Washington state plates,  
and found a large amount of ammunition, bulletproof vests and 
devices that may be smoke grenades, but no weapons, said police 
Cmdr. Dave Kalish. Contents of the van included metal boxes packed 
with ammunition, magazines for an assault rifle, a booklet titled 
Ranger Handbook and freeze-dried food. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalish said it wasn't certain the carjacker and gunman were the  
same person. SWAT teams were called when officers found the Toyota 
in a hotel parking lot a few miles from the community center. 
</P>
<P>
	The van was bought Saturday from the Tacoma (Wash.) Kar Korner,  
said the manager of the lot, who refused to be identified. He said 
police had ordered him not to give out any information on the 
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	While SWAT teams were swarming around the community center and  
news and police helicopters buzzed overhead, about 20 small 
children were led unhurt from the building hand in hand and taken 
to a Jewish temple nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents rushed to the center and jammed against police lines  
trying to find out if their children were all right. Some parents 
wept and hugged one another. One man was handcuffed by officers 
after slipping under yellow police tape, but he was later released. 
Authorities used a fire department loudspeaker to announce the 
whereabouts of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to cry when I saw him,'' said Karen Macofsky, who was  
reunited with her 11-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. ``But I 
held back and just hugged him tightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Macalas prayed and recited psalms as he rushed to check  
on his children, ages 2 and 3. ``My feeling about it is it's 
another case of someone acting out in rage,'' he said. ``I don't 
want to believe this is an act of anti-Semitism here in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were searching for the gunman throughout the  
neighborhood of mostly single-family homes in the San Fernando 
Valley suburbs 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said  
about 20 older children from the Jewish center were touring the 
Wiesenthal center's Museum of Tolerance at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic that the 20 children were here learning about  
man's inhumanity to man, when their own day camp became a target of 
such hatred,'' Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program director at the North Valley center told Hier that  
most of the children had been playing outside when the gunman 
stormed in, Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The community center provides nursery programs, child care and  
camp activities. It has a large main building, a smaller houselike 
structure, a pool and tennis courts.

<HEADLINE> Bank of America To Lend $3 billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Bank of America announced Tuesday it will fund an  
unprecedented $3 billion mortgage program for low- to 
moderate-income borrowers that promises no down payment, no 
application fee and no closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The national program will be overseen by Boston-based  
Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America, led by self-described 
``urban terrorist'' Bruce Marks, who has a track record of getting 
loan commitments from banks after flagrantly accusing them of 
discriminatory lending practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``As cynical as I am that all bankers are evil, this is the  
exception to the rule,'' said Marks. 
</P>
<P>
	The friendly agreement, which the 44-year-old Marks estimates  
will affect 100,000 borrowers nationally, is a watershed for the 
community activist. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Marks and Bank of America say the bank voluntarily decided  
to make the mortgage commitment because it's good business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not charity,'' said Robert Johnston, senior vice  
president for Bank of America's community development bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of cash transactions in the inner city,'' he  
said. ``We see a real value in lending in the inner city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, before NationsBank was acquired by Bank of America, it  
decided to lend $500 million in mortgages through Neighborhood 
Assistance Corp. over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighborhood Assistance, which now has 20 offices nationwide,  
originated the loans with low-income first-time homeowners who were 
often distrustful of banks. The organization helped navigate the 
borrower through the confusing mortgage process and, most 
important, offered post-ownership assistance -- while NationsBank 
made money, said Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always felt that Community Reinvestment Act lending was  
good business for banks,'' said Robert Garsson, spokesman for the 
federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. ``We've 
encouraged them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marks calls the program the biggest ever -- and a tremendous  
opportunity for working people who might not have the savings who 
need to buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a history of having to do whatever it takes to get  
lenders to the table,'' said Marks. ``Now we have lenders say, 
`This works.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America's home mortgage product will be available  
immediately in Atlanta, Baltimore, Buffalo, N.Y., Charlotte, 
Jacksonville, Fla., Los Angeles, Memphis, Tenn., Washington, D.C., 
Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Oakland, Calif., Sacramento, Calif., 
San Antonio and Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Within the next 12 months, the program will be available in New  
York City, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Albuquerque, N. M., San Diego and 
Little Rock, Ark.

<HEADLINE> Busy Hurricane Season Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People shouldn't be fooled by this year's slow  
start to hurricane season, government scientists say. With the peak 
period about to begin, meteorologists are predicting more storms 
than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists say three or more intense Atlantic storms are  
possible, and residents living along the East and Gulf coasts 
should remain prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's hurricane season produced 14 tropical storms,  
including three major hurricanes. In a typical season, the United 
States experiences five to six hurricanes, two of which are severe 
and an average of 1.5 storms make landfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because we haven't seen a hurricane yet this year, don't  
get fooled into thinking that this will be a light season'', said 
Gerald Bell, a research meteorologist at National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, but  
tropical storms don't really rev up until mid-August. The peak 
period runs from mid-August to mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
	The season is expected to be busy due to atmospheric conditions  
globally that contribute to hurricanes, said CPC meteorologist 
Vernon Kousky. Among those conditions are a low wind shear across 
the tropical Atlantic and below-average air pressure across the 
tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The odds are tilted in the favor of more storms than normal,''  
said Kousky. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane expert William Gray of Colorado State University has  
gone a step further, predicting 14 named tropical storms, nine 
hurricanes and four intense hurricanes. Gray figures there is a 54 
percent chance that one or more intense storms with wind speeds of 
111 miles per hour or more will hit the East Coast and a 40 percent 
chance for the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this season, there has been one tropical storm, Arlene,  
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm carries winds of 39 to 73 mph. A tropical storm  
becomes a hurricane when sustained winds reach 74 mph.

<HEADLINE> New Expos Investors Plan Nears OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- The Montreal Expos are close to winning approval  
from major league baseball for their plan to bring in new investors 
and build a new stadium, team chairman Jacques Menard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Menard told radio station CKAC Monday night he expected  
commissioner Bud Selig to give his approval shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We met with the people from major league baseball two weeks  
ago in New York and they seemed satisfied with our plans,'' said 
Menard, adding that 19 versions of the plan were submitted before 
baseball agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner's office had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Menard said the ownership group he heads was close to raising  
$50 million in local investment and was close to finalizing a 
$75-million investment from lead investor Jeffrey Loria, a New York 
art dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	A report said an American engineering firm has also approved  
plans for a $200-million stadium to be built on federal government 
land downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	La Presse reported last week Menard's group hoped to purchase  
the land a block south of the Molson Centre, home of the NHL's 
Canadiens, for $16 to 18 million, rather than take out a long-term 
lease. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also needs to finalize a deal with the provincial  
government, which has indicated it's willing to supply up to $8 
million per year toward a $100-million building loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Menard heads a group of dissident members of the team's  
ownership consortium that resisted pressure to sell and move the 
31-year-old franchise to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A report said team president Claude Brochu, who does not believe  
the Expos can survive in Montreal, turned down an offer to stay on 
until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu's 7.2 per cent interest in the club is to be bought out  
before the stadium project moves forward.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Partnerships Plan Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The nation's largest lawyers' group delayed  
consideration Tuesday of a proposal to allow clients one-stop 
shopping for legal, financial and other professional help. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the longstanding ban on lawyers forming partnerships  
with other professionals such as accountants, psychologists and 
social workers. Many in the American Bar Association want to 
consider dropping the ban amid increased competition from huge, 
multi-service international firms. 
</P>
<P>
	But the proposal drew opposition from other ABA members  
concerned that forming such partnerships would harm lawyers' 
professional standards and their ability to promise confidentiality 
and undivided loyalty to their clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a nightmare,'' said Philadelphia lawyer Lawrence J. Fox.  
He said he dreamed he was attending a conference of 
multi-profession partnerships and an award was being given to Rep. 
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, for his ``bringing together of extermination 
and legal services.'' DeLay formerly ran a Houston pest 
extermination company. 
</P>
<P>
	Outgoing ABA President Philip Anderson said lawyers cannot  
ignore the fact that the practice of law already is changing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response of `I don't like it' is not going to make it go  
away,'' Anderson said. ``I don't like it either but it's here and 
it's going to stay here, and the question is what are we going to 
do about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone will write the rules,'' Anderson said. ``The lawyers  
should write the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA's policy-making House of Delegates decided on a majority  
vote to delay the issue pending more study. Even if the proposal 
had passed, the ethics rule changes would have taken effect only 
after an additional ABA vote at a future meeting and then by 
authorities who regulate lawyers' ethics in each state. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed ethics changes would allow people to get legal help  
and accounting or financial planning advice all in one place. Or 
lawyers who practice family law could form partnerships with 
psychologists or social workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The decades-old rules barring lawyers from forming partnerships  
with non-lawyers were intended to protect lawyers' independent 
judgment, protect confidential client information and ensure 
lawyers' loyalty to their clients by avoiding conflicts of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would specify that legal ethics rules apply to all  
lawyers no matter where they work. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said about 5,000 lawyers already are working for other  
companies on such matters as taxes or mergers and acquisitions. He 
said they are making the ``disingenuous argument that they are not 
practicing law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said another lawyer accused him of ``defending the buggy  
whip in the age of the automobile.'' But he said he wanted to 
``circle the wagons around loyalty to clients, confidentiality, 
client accountability and legal independence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherwin P. Simmons of Miami, who chaired the ABA panel that made  
the proposal, said consumer groups' members want to get legal help 
through non-traditional means, such as at accounting firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we do this in a way which will protect the public? So  
they'll know who's giving them advice and what to expect?'' Simmons 
said. ``We want to have another shot at this. We want to have more 
input from you,'' he told ABA delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons said he hopes the issue will be raised again when the  
bar association meets in New York next July. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Tuesday, ABA delegates passed a resolution urging  
federal, state and local legislators to require police to keep 
statistics to help determine whether traffic stops and searches are 
being conducted for racially discriminatory reasons. A number of 
motorists say they have been stopped for no apparent reason other 
than ``driving while black.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The delegates also defeated a proposed ethics rule that would  
restrict lawyers from making political contributions aimed at 
getting government work, a practice known as ``pay to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Current legal ethics rules do not bar such contributions. Nor  
are they necessarily illegal bribery because lawyers usually don't 
make contributions in exchange for government jobs but to be 
included among those considered for such work.

on his children, ages 2 and 3. ``My feeling about it is it's 
another case of someone acting out in rage,'' he said. ``I don't 
want to believe this is an act of anti-Semitism here in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were searching for the gunman throughout the  
neighborhood of mostly single-family homes in the San Fernando 
Valley suburbs 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said  
about 20 older children from the Jewish center were touring the 
Wiesenthal center's Museum of Tolerance at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic that the 20 children were here learning about  
man's inhumanity to man, when their own day camp became a target of 
such hatred,'' Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program director at the North Valley center told Hier that  
most of the children had been playing outside when the gunman 
stormed in, Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The community center provides nursery programs, child care and  
camp activities. It has a large main building, a smaller houselike 
structure, a pool and tennis courts.

<HEADLINE> Pitchers Appeal Brawl Suspensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Seattle Mariners pitcher Frankie  
Rodriguez and New York Yankees pitcher Jason Grimsley decided 
Tuesday to appeal their suspensions stemming from a brawl last week 
at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimsley was suspended for throwing at and then hitting Edgar  
Martinez of the Mariners on consecutive pitches after Alex 
Rodriguez had homered. One inning later, Seattle's Frankie 
Rodriguez hit Chuck Knoblauch with a pitch, touching off a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankie Rodriguez got a seven-game suspension and $1,500 fine,  
and Grimsley got a three-game suspension and $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimsley's suspension was due to start Tuesday and Rodriguez's  
following a five-game suspension of teammate Jose Paniagua that 
began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the penalties cannot begin until after a hearing before AL  
president Gene Budig. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees catcher Joe Girardi was fined $500 for his role in the  
brawl, but has not decided whether he will appeal.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Could Suspend Sotomayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Javier Sotomayor hasn't given up hope of defending  
his high jump title at the World Championships in Spain this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, who tested positive for cocaine at the Pan American  
Games, faces a possible two-year ban. No suspension has yet been 
imposed, and his status for the World Championships remains 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Giorgio Reineri, spokesman for the International Amateur  
Athletic Federation, said it is up to the Cuban track federation to 
hold a hearing with the two-time world champion and world 
record-holder and decide whether or not to suspend him. 
</P>
<P>
	Track and field's world governing body said Monday that it could  
ban Sotomayor from the Aug. 20-29 championships in Seville, Spain, 
if Cuban officials don't take any action by then. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't act, if they don't suspend the athlete, the IAAF  
can suspend him,'' Reineri said from Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has charged Sotomayor's positive test was part of a larger  
campaign to discredit the Communist government -- possibly by the 
CIA or Miami exiles. It has suggested that the track star's food or 
drink might have been laced with cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban government also raised doubts about tests that showed  
two gold medalist weightlifters -- William Vargas, winner in the 
136.4-pound weightlifting class, and Rolando Delgado, the 152-pound 
class winner -- testing positive for anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the weightlifters, the National Institute of  
Sports, Physical Education and Recreation said Cuban sports 
authorities will launch an investigation ``aimed at clarifying 
whether this is another dirty trick against our country or if this 
anabolic substance really exists in the bodies of said athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The institute said that Cuban sports doctors never use anabolic  
steroids for athletes. ``In capitalist societies they are commonly 
used in professional sports and are distributed without any 
limitation,'' the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said the IAAF Council, the world federation's  
decision-making body, could suspend Sotomayor at its meeting in 
Seville next Monday. One of the council members is former Olympic 
800-meter champion Alberto Juantorena, head of the Cuban athletics 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The case gets more complicated if the Cubans hold a hearing and  
decide to clear Sotomayor. In that event, the IAAF could be forced 
to let him compete in Seville pending its own review of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, the IAAF can do nothing in the short term,''  
Reineri said. ``The only thing the IAAF can do is review the case 
later and maybe decide to go to arbitration. That takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, any suspension would be retroactive, meaning that  
Sotomayor would be stripped of any medal he won in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a situation occurred at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics when the  
IAAF allowed Australian sprinter Dean Capobianco and Italian high 
jumper Antonella Bevilacqua to compete after their national 
federations cleared them of doping violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The two athletes were later found guilty and suspended by an  
IAAF arbitration panel. Their results from Atlanta, including 
Bevilacqua's fourth-place finish, were wiped off the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very political case,'' Reineri said. ``It's not a  
normal doping case. There are different sensibilities at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Monday in the Italian sports daily La Gazzetta  
dello Sport, Sotomayor continued to proclaim his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tests can be manipulated,'' he was quoted as saying from  
his home in Havana. ``Do you think I would need to take drugs, to 
dope myself to jump 2.30 meters? In warmups, I was jumping 2.25. 
Anyway, it would be crazy to dope myself at the Pan American 
Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor said he was continuing to train daily and would travel  
to Madrid on Aug. 14 to await word on whether he can compete in 
Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apart from the death of my coach Jose Godoy, the positive test  
is the worst thing that has ever happened to me,'' he said in a 
separate interview in the French daily L'Equipe. ``I have the 
impression that the sky fell on me.''

<HEADLINE> Pyramid Scheme Operation Faces Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An illegal pyramid scheme that promised big  
profits to new recruits only benefited a select few and cheated 
players out of $200 million, a federal lawsuit against the 
operation says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission, along with law enforcement  
authorities in six states, announced Monday action against Equinox 
International Corp. and its affiliates, Advanced Marketing Seminars 
Inc.; and BG Management Inc. The companies are based in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Nevada, also names  
their founder, William Gouldd. 
</P>
<P>
	While the companies purport to sell water filters, vitamins,  
nutritional supplements and skin care products, the real way 
participants make money is by successfully recruiting other 
distributors, not by actual retail sales, the FTC said. As part of 
this illegal pyramid scheme, new participants paid money to the 
company for the right to sell its products, according to the 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also alleged that while recruits were expressly  
told they would receive substantial income from joining the scheme, 
only those managers at the ``top'' of the pyramid -- who profited 
from the sales of subsequent recruits -- found the venture 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the FTC, the scheme has caused more than $200  
million in consumer injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Jorgenson of Equinox said no one was available to comment  
on the case. BG Management also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Distributors used classified ``Help Wanted'' ads to entice new  
participants, implying that they would earn lucrative salaries, 
according to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a job interview, the recruits were given an hour-long  
sales presentation where they were told that they can make money by 
selling products to consumers, but the distributors indicated that 
real financial gains would come from recruiting others, the FTC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify as a manager and become eligible to sell products and  
recruit others, new participants had to buy $5,000 worth of 
products. They also were encouraged to rent desk space in the local 
office for several hundred dollars a month and spend several 
hundred dollars to attend seminars sponsored by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	All of these expenses typically outweighed any money the  
distributor might make, the FTC said in its complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The court has granted a temporary restraining order against the  
company and placed it in receivership. The FTC is asking for a 
permanent injunction and consumer redress. 
</P>
<P>
	California filed suit against Gouldd in 1990 for another  
multilevel marketing operation. He signed a permanent injunction 
that barred him from future pyramid schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	The states that filed along with the commission are Hawaii,  
Maryland, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> FBI Touts Online Fingerprint Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARKSBURG, W.Va. (AP) -- Police and judges in 15 states no  
longer have to worry about releasing fugitives and repeat offenders 
because they lack information about a suspect's criminal history, 
FBI officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A massive, $640 million electronic database of fingerprints will  
give them the information they need to make critical decisions in 
less than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The system, which should be linked to all 50 states within a few  
years, will help judges determine whether a suspect should be freed 
on bail or kept in custody, said James DeSarno, assistant director 
in charge of the Criminal Justice Information Services Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a revolutionary change in the way we do business,'' he  
said. ``This quicker and more efficient identification technology 
will contribute to a safer America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials demonstrated the new system for reporters Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The new Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System,  
which began operating July 28, cuts the wait for confirmation of a 
suspect's true identity and criminal background from more than 20 
days to just two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI receives about 50,000 fingerprints a day, about half of  
them related to criminal cases. About 10 percent, or 5,000, are for 
people being arrested for the first time, so the FBI has no prior 
data on them. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Clarksburg facility's new fingerprint department,  
fingerprint examiners work at 17-inch computer screens inspecting 
prints side by side. One is the unidentified print, the other the 
computer's pick for a likely match. Each print is checked at least 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer provides a possible match based on a score, but  
humans look for points of identification within a fingerprint's 
patterns, its telltale whirls, loops and arches. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every case, the human makes the final match. It's just too  
important,'' said Billy P. Martin, the system's operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The new system reduces to electronic data some 34 million  
fingerprint cards, the equivalent of 18 stacks as tall as New 
York's Empire State Building. 
</P>
<P>
	It also slashes the wait for civil background checks from more  
than three months to just 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is more than a year and a half late in coming on  
line. The original target date was November 1997, FBI spokesman 
Steve Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The original price was to be $520 million, but that went up to  
$640 million when Congress and an advisory board added more 
functions and requirements, Fischer said.

<HEADLINE> Blues Enforcer Twist in Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Blues enforcer Tony Twist, who  
recently led a motorcycle ride of 1,500 miles to raise money for 
charity, is hospitalized in intensive care following a cycling 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened shortly after 10 p.m. Monday in Creve  
Coeur, a suburb of St. Louis. Police said a car pulled out of a 
parking lot in front of Twist's motorcycle, which struck the side 
of the car. Twist was thrown from the motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed, and none were likely, police Capt.  
Dale Bailey said Tuesday. The driver of the car was also hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found out this morning,'' said Larry Pleau, the Blues'  
general manager, from his offseason home in New Hampshire. ``Our 
concerns are for Tony's health. We're just hoping that everything 
is fine with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues said they had no details about the accident or Twist's  
condition. A spokeswoman at St. John's Mercy Medical Center said 
Twist's family asked that no details of his condition be released. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital released a statement later Tuesday said that  
surgery to stabilize his fractured pelvis is scheduled for later 
this week. He also received a laceration to his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Woodcock, the team's vice president for marketing and  
communication, said the Blues' team doctors were with Twist. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year NHL veteran recently completed his Iron Horse '99  
tour, a 1,500-mile motorcycle ride through several Western states. 
Former Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway and several NHL 
players joined Twist on the ride, which raised money for Head 
First, a charity that encourages children to wear a helmet when 
riding a bike or roller skating. 
</P>
<P>
	Twist's work with charity, and his standing as one of the NHL's  
top fighters, made him one of St. Louis' most popular sports 
figures. He and friend Kelly Chase, a longtime Blues teammate, are 
considered two of best enforcers in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	But the player whose primary mission is to fight is a dying  
breed since the league began cracking down on brawling. Twist 
became an unrestricted free agent in June after the 1998-99 season 
and has yet to sign with the Blues or a new team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked with Tony a couple of time during the summer,''  
Pleau said. ``The conversations are no different that those with 
any other player. I don't comment on what we've talked about, and 
at this time now it is an inappropriate time anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Post-Dispatch said Pleau told Twist on Monday, before his  
accident, that he no longer figured into the Blues' plans and would 
not be re-signed. Twist earned $650,000 last season and was seeking 
a new contract worth $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Twist was the Blues' ninth choice, and 177th selection overall,  
in the 1988 NHL entry draft. He played in 28 games for St. Louis 
during his first NHL season before spending the next four in 
Quebec. He returned to St. Louis as a free agent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In 63 games last season for St. Louis, Twist had two goals and  
eight points while accumulating 149 penalty minutes. In his 
445-game NHL career, Twist has 10 goals and 28 points, with 1,121 
penalty minutes.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed lower Tuesday, led by  
declines in banking and technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies fell 4.36  
points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 291.98. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and technology stocks fared worst, dropping 2.2 percent  
and 3 percent in their respective indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed down 4.49 points 
at 304.08. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 50.48 points to 3,535.10,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 59.02 points at 3,491.39. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Energy index was the only sector that rose  
on the day, with a gain of 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The big losers in local markets were London, whose FTSE-100  
index of blue-chip shares fell 2.4 percent, and Helsinki's HEX 
index, which fell 4.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Energis led blue-chip fallers in London, sliding 11.5 percent.  
Telewest Communications closed down 8.8 percent, with analysts 
pointing to last week's disappointing first-half results. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, BP Amoco rose as much as 37 pence to 1225 pence,  
after the company said second-quarter profit rose to $1.23 billion, 
against $1.08 billion a year before. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it had laid off 12,500 people by the end of  
July and will lay off an additional 2,000 by the end of the year. 
It also doubled its target for annual merger cost savings to $4 
billion by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Other gainers in the oil sector Tuesday were Elf-Aquitaine and  
TotalFina, whose shares rose for the second day amid speculation 
that a friendly merger is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankfurt's Xetra DAX fell 1.7 percent, with chemical companies  
leading the drop, and the Paris CAC-40 index closed down 1.1 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Space Station Illnesses Downplayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Stale air may have caused headaches,  
nausea and dry, itchy eyes for astronauts visiting NASA's new space 
station, but the doctor who was there downplayed the seriousness of 
the ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it was no big deal,'' Dr. Daniel Barry said. ``I  
don't think we had any more nausea on this flight than you would 
typically have on a flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry says the symptoms were so fleeting, and so benign, that  
neither he nor his six crewmates reported their illnesses until a 
couple of weeks after they returned to Earth -- to the dismay of 
NASA, which now may never be able to diagnose the problem. The 
space agency is changing guidelines for future crews. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry says it's impossible to know whether the crew was sickened  
by stagnant air or chemical fumes inside the international space 
station as some reports suggest, or whether it was simply prolonged 
space motion sickness. His own stuffy nose and headaches, for 
example, were no worse than what he experienced on a previous 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Any indication by NASA officials or others that the crew was  
very sick is ``way overblown,'' Barry told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry insists he would have intervened if someone was really  
sick. The astronauts were warned before their May 27 launch about 
possible atmosphere problems aboard the space station, and so Barry 
kept close watch over his crewmates. 
</P>
<P>
	When ill, the astronauts simply retreated to the docked space  
shuttle Discovery and relaxed or had lunch, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is taking the matter seriously. A team has been appointed  
to evaluate the air inside the space station and help prevent 
future visitors from becoming ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronauts are not due back at the space station until December.  
The first permanent crew doesn't move in until March. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation is especially difficult because none of the  
astronauts were wearing medical sensors and none of them took air 
samples when they became ill. As a result, NASA has to rely on 
anecdotal information, said Jim Van Laak, deputy manager of space 
station operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Space flight can be quite uncomfortable for some people'' even  
under the best of circumstances, Van Laak said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA refuses to elaborate on the illnesses or identify who got  
sick, citing medical privacy. But in a seven-page internal report 
obtained and published last month by an independent Web site called 
NASA Watch, the space agency listed the medical problems and 
possible causes. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S., Russian and Canadian crew spent less than 3 1/2 days inside  
the station at the end of May and beginning of June, making repairs 
and stocking its two rooms with supplies. The station had been 
sealed since the last shuttle visit six months earlier; the first 
crew reported no health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Russian module containing air purifiers and other  
life-support equipment had yet to arrive -- its much-delayed launch 
is off until November -- systems aboard Discovery were used to 
cleanse the station atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Air in the station was routed to the shuttle and back again, and  
it's possible a duct could have been blocked, Van Laak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the astronauts used handheld fans and limited their  
time in the Russian control module Zarya -- one astronaut used a 
timer to alert her when to leave -- carbon dioxide still may have 
built up. Unlike on Earth, exhaled carbon dioxide does not float 
away in space. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry said he could tell the air was stale when all seven  
gathered for pictures in the U.S.-built chamber, Unity. In 
retrospect, he wishes he would have taken air samples then. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew collected air samples only twice, just as they were  
supposed to: when they entered and left the station. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is requesting more air samples on future flights,  
especially when astronauts feel sick. Managers also are asking 
crews to promptly report any illnesses, and are considering 
individual carbon-dioxide monitors -- a recommendation from Barry.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Killed in Wall St. Shootout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A suspected bank robber who returned to the  
scene of a June heist was shot and killed after police chased him 
through the Wall Street financial district during a bustling noon 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers fired about 35 bullets but were uncertain whether the  
man fired his gun, said Assistant Chief William Taylor. A passerby 
was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a crazy scene,'' said Anthony Frangello, who works in  
the Wall Street area where Monday's chase began. ``People were 
falling, trampling over each other trying to get out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A teller at an HSBC Bank branch just blocks from the New York  
Stock Exchange recognized a man wearing a business suit in the bank 
as the same person who held her up in June. A security officer 
called police. 
</P>
<P>
	When an officer confronted the man inside the bank, he pulled  
out a gun and refused to put it down, so officers began firing, 
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, whose name was not released, was hit by a bullet, but  
he ran outside and into crowds of office workers on their lunch 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blood flew everywhere, it was on the sidewalk in splatters,''  
said Donald Littlejohn, who works as a clown at a nearby park. ``It 
was like they were shooting a movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The man ducked behind cars and around corners as police chased  
and fired at him. He fell about a block from the bank and was later 
declared dead. Police did not know how many times the man had been 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perpetrator had a loaded gun,'' Taylor said. ``We're not  
sure in the commotion whether or not his gun was fired.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cancer Stamp Brings in About $4M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About $4 million in profits from the Postal  
Service's special breast cancer stamp will be given to a new 
National Cancer Institute research program, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a year of sales, a special stamp that costs 7 cents more than  
regular postage raised $7.8 million to help research on breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were announcing today that more than half of those  
proceeds would fund the NCI's new ``Insight Awards to Stamp Out 
Breast Cancer,'' a program funding progressive pilot studies for 
extensive breast cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, Postmaster General William Henderson and  
this year's Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong, a testicular 
cancer survivor, planned a White House ceremony today to highlight 
other new strides in cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second anniversary of the 1997 Cancer Genome Anatomy  
Project, Gore that said over 30,000 human genes that predispose 
people to cancer have been identified, more than double the 
original goal. Genome project researchers have additionally 
catalogued more than 66,400 genes in one or more cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, in a June speech as part of his presidential  
campaign, challenged scientists to identify every cancer-related 
gene by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	NCI data released today also shows that 8.4 million Americans  
have survived cancer, with the five-year survival rate improving 
over the last decade from 65 percent to 74 percent for children 
with cancer. The adult survival rate improved from 51 percent to 
almost 60 percent.

<HEADLINE> QB Highlights Redskins Scrimmage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers spent the offseason  
looking for an offense. If they've found it yet, they didn't 
display it in a practice with the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins spent the offseason looking for a deep-threat wide  
receiver. They might have found one in Albert Connell. 
</P>
<P>
	With both teams opening their exhibition schedules this weekend,  
they did not scrimmage Tuesday, as they did Saturday at the 
Redskins' camp in Frostburg, Md., but worked mostly on position 
drills and 7-on-7 passing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the rain-splattered, 90-minute practice also was spent  
in goal-line drills, which featured brief skirmishes between 
Steelers nose tackle Anthony Dingle and Redskins tight end Stephen 
Alexander, and Redskins center Mark Fisher and Steelers linebacker 
Earl Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was our third practice against them in a week, and it was  
a real intense session,'' Steelers coach Bill Cowher said. ``But I 
told the players that you don't want to let it become like Kansas 
City and New Orleans. If you do, the only other choice is to 
practice among yourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs and Saints fought so much Thursday in River Falls,  
Wis., that a scheduled Friday scrimmage was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Johnson, the former Minnesota quarterback who is trying to  
upgrade the Redskins' deep passing game, consistently went long, 
mainly to Connell. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics were not kept, but the Redskins went deep far more  
often than they did during last year's 6-10 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to throw it up there and give our guys a  
chance to go get it,'' Johnson said. ``With Albert's speed, he is a 
deep threat. I think he's going to have a great year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Redskins coach Norv Turner said Connell has been a standout  
since training camp began. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albert made some big plays, and he's had good practices the  
last week,'' Turner said. ``We need to keep him going. Brad's 
throwing the ball exceptionally well, but there were a couple of 
things we missed. The bad thing is we still have a lot of work to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So do the Steelers, who are less than two weeks into learning  
new offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride's system. Kordell Stewart 
didn't throw deep that much, although he hit receivers Hines Ward 
and Will Blackwell for long completions. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart expects to play only the first quarter of Friday's  
exhibition game against the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Saturday's scrimmage in Frostburg, when Cowher was  
visibly displeased with rookie kickers Kris Brown and Matt 
Davenport, both were much more consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown made four of five field-goal attempts between the 30 and  
42 yard lines, missing from the 35. Davenport made three of four 
between the 30 and 38, missing his 30-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Redskins' three kickers separated themselves. Brett  
Conway, Jeff Hall and Cary Blanchard each missed once as the 
Redskins also attempted nine field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Redskins fullback Larry Centers provided one light moment,  
high-stepping his way into the end zone, then seeking out a TV 
photographer to flaunt the ball in front of his camera. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the final practice between the two, although they play  
an exhibition game Aug. 28 in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It breaks up training camp,'' Cowher said. ``As I told our  
players, it's much better than practicing against yourselves.''

<HEADLINE> Rehnquist Criticized Over 'Dixie' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's largest organization of black  
lawyers wants Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to quit singing 
``Dixie,'' a song it calls a ``symbol of slavery and oppression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 18,000-lawyer National Bar Association passed a resolution  
at its recent convention in Philadelphia urging Rehnquist to 
``refrain from such offensive behavior in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Supreme Court spokesman said Tuesday that Rehnquist had no  
comment on the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, the nation's top federal judge, led judges and  
lawyers in a rendition of ``Dixie'' during a conference in Hot 
Springs, Va., in late June. He attends the 4th U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals conference each year, and each year leads a sing-along. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual event has for several years included ``Dixie,''  
widely associated with the Southern cause in the Civil War, as well 
as the ``Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' similarly associated with 
the North during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported that some lawyers had avoided the  
event because they objected to singing ``Dixie,'' a sentiment 
Rehnquist apparently was unaware of until he was told so at the end 
of this year's sing-along.

<HEADLINE> School Expulsions for Guns Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite deadly shootings that have left the  
nation wondering what's wrong with America's schoolchildren, the 
number of students expelled for bringing guns and other weapons to 
school dropped nearly a third overall and by more than half in many 
states, the Education Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories  
reported that 3,930 students were kicked out in the 1997-1998 year 
for bringing weapons to their public schools -- 31 percent fewer 
than the 5,724 expulsions reported for 1996-97, the first year of 
the report. There are about 52 million students in U.S. public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The data, however, is based on disciplinary action only and does  
not tell the rate at which students carry firearms to school. The 
expulsions, mandatory under federal law, are not permanent and last 
up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures for some states in the report could be skewed  
because the 1996-97 data that they reported to the Education 
Department included all weapons-related incidents, not just 
firearms possession expulsions. Illinois figures for that school 
year, for example, included expulsions for BB guns, sling shots and 
other weapons; Maryland was for number of incidents not expulsions; 
and Missouri included non-firearms such as brass knuckles, airguns 
and knives in its weapons expulsion count. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the caveats, Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said  
the report, coupled with a recent study by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention indicating a decline in fights and other 
violence at high schools, ``shows that fewer young people are 
carrying guns or taking them into schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Security officials from several large school districts joined  
Riley in a news conference announcing the statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Columbine issue, we truly understand is an aberration,''  
said Wesley Mitchell, chief of police in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. ``We truly understand things are not getting 
worse. They are getting better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school security officers also said many schools have a long  
way to go before they provide adequate security. ``There are a lot 
of school districts that do not know what they are doing with 
regards to security,'' said Jack Martin, chief of police in the 
Indianapolis public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation was stunned last spring by the massacre in Littleton,  
Colo., where two students stormed into Columbine High School with 
handguns and rifles, killing 12 classmates and a teacher before 
shooting themselves. A month later six students were wounded at a 
high school in Conyers, Ga. Those attacks followed fatal 
school-related shootings in recent years in Pearl, Miss., West 
Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., Edinboro, Pa., and Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	This spate of violence has led schools to enhance physical  
security, conduct more locker searches and generally increase the 
time and attention paid to student safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department report is designed to measure the  
progress of the 1994 Gun-Free Schools Act, which required states 
receiving federal education aid to pass their own laws ordering 
school districts to expel for one year any student who brings a 
firearm to school. All 50 states have passed such laws. The 
District of Columbia and five U.S. territories join the states in 
reporting the expulsions each year. 
</P>
<P>
	California and Texas were the only states that expelled 300  
students or more in the 1997-98 school year. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware, Oregon, and South Dakota had the highest concentration  
of expelled students; those states and Minnesota and Mississippi 
also had some of the highest increases in expulsions. South Dakota 
attributed its 600 percent increase in expulsions on more reports 
from its districts for the 1997-98 year. Wyoming and the U.S. 
territories of American Samoa, Guam and Northern Marianas didn't 
expel any students. 
</P>
<P>
	More of the weapons-related expulsions -- 62 percent for 1997-98  
compared with 58 percent for 1996-97 -- were for bringing handguns 
to school. For the 1997-98 year, 7 percent of the expulsions 
involved rifles or shotguns, and 31 percent were for carrying some 
other type of firearm, such as a bomb, hand grenade or starter 
pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of expulsions, 57 percent, were in high schools. Junior  
high schools, usually seventh and eighth grades, accounted for 33 
percent of expulsions. The remaining 10 percent occurred in 
elementary schools that include kindergarten through sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the federal law gives individual districts some room to  
shorten the expulsions for special cases, such as a diagnosed 
behavior problem, 44 percent of the 1997-98 expulsions were 
shortened to less than one year. But 62 percent of those shortened 
expulsions did not involve special education students. 
</P>
<P>
	Many more of the students who were expelled had no other place  
to go for their schooling. The survey found that 43 percent of 
students expelled under the law were referred to alternative 
programs -- down from the 56 percent previously.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Publisher Missing on Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KELSO, Wash. (AP) -- A former publisher whose newspaper won the  
Pulitzer Prize in the early 1980s remained missing today after his 
helicopter vanished during a weekend flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Ted Natt, 58, took off in his two-seat helicopter  
at about 8:30 p.m. Saturday from Oysterville, on Washington's Long 
Beach Peninsula, where he had attended a memorial service. His 
family reported him overdue early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the search was complicated by the fact Natt did  
not file a flight plan for the 60-mile trip. The search was to 
resume today but was delayed by fog this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has more than 20 years' experience flying fixed-wing  
aircraft, Natt has had a helicopter license for only three months, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Natt was publisher of The Daily News of Longview, Wash., when  
nearby Mount St. Helens erupted in May 1980. The paper won a 
Pulitzer for its coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Westmedia Corp., a publishing group owned by the Natt  
family and employees of The Daily News, sold its holdings to 
Seattle-based Howard Publications Inc. The sale, which ended 76 
years of ownership by the McClelland-Natt family, involved the 
Longview newspaper and three weeklies. The Longview paper has a 
circulation of around 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Natt, who had been publisher since 1977, stepped down when the  
sale was completed.

<HEADLINE> Unusual Weather Blamed on Ocean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NASA experts have come up with a possible  
culprit in this summer's strange weather, with unusually cool 
temperatures in the West and unrelenting heat in the East: the 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Unusually warm ocean temperatures off Asia and abnormally cool  
water off North America are shoving the jet stream farther north, 
Bill Patzert, an oceanographer with NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That keeps the West Coast cool and prevents air masses from  
bumping into each other. And that means no thunderstorms or other 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
	During the El Nino winter of 1997 and 1998, the equatorial  
Pacific was unusually warm and sucked the jet stream -- and storms -- 
southward, Patzert said. California and Southern states were 
pummeled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have a flip-flop situation where the Eastern Pacific is  
very cool,'' he said. ``When the jet stream is farther north -- 
north of the Great Lakes -- it robs the mid-Atlantic, Midwest and 
the Southeast of its normal rainfall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the East and Midwest, a heat wave has been blamed for scores  
of deaths in 18 states. Crops are withering and forest fires 
erupting as a drought persists. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest phenomenon, observed by the U.S.-French  
Topex-Poseidon satellite, may be an effect of La Nina, a pool of 
cool water along the equator. La Nina developed after the 
1997-1998's El Nino, or unusually warm water along the equator. 
</P>
<P>
	Patzert and his colleagues used Topex/Poseidon's readings of the  
ocean's height from to calculate the ocean's temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacific, which covers 45 percent of the Earth, fuels the  
weather across North America as water and wind mix along its vast 
surface. The complex interaction affects not only ocean 
temperatures but also air moisture and storm paths over the 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts aren't so sure about Patzert's theory.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the North Pacific is playing a role, but how big a  
role it is -- especially in the summertime -- we don't know,'' said 
Robert Livezey, senior research meteorologist for the National 
Climate Prediction Center in suburban Washington, D.C. ``It's an 
open question.''

<HEADLINE> GM Appointee May Help With UAW </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp.'s appointment of Mark Hogan  
to run the automaker's electronic commerce operations may also 
serve to pave the way for smoother negotiations for a new national 
contract with the United Auto Workers union. 
</P>
<P>
	Until last spring, Hogan -- who had headed GM's small-car  
operations -- had been publicly promoting ``modular assembly'' as a 
way to drastically cut GM's manufacturing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The method, already in use overseas, would allow GM to use fewer  
UAW workers and rely more on independent suppliers to do most 
subassembly work of major parts clusters, or modules. GM workers 
would install the modules along shorter assembly lines in smaller 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW opposes modular assembly as a threat to job security.  
</P>
<P>
	At a union convention in May, President Stephen P. Yokich said  
the issue was dead and that Hogan should be fired. ``If they can't 
fire him, they should put a muzzle on him,'' Yokich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Muzzle him they did.  
</P>
<P>
	Until Tuesday, Hogan had been kept away from reporters and GM's  
top executives had avoided discussing modular assembly. Hogan had 
been scheduled to give a speech on modular assembly at an industry 
conference last week, but was pulled off the agenda after Yokich's 
outburst. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked Tuesday if he could even say ``modular assembly,''  
Hogan declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to be more flexible in the way we design, engineer  
and ultimately manufacture vehicles,'' he said. ``That's what it's 
all about and that's where we're heading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM president G. Richard Wagoner Jr. hinted that GM may still  
adopt modular methods using UAW workers, rather than nonunion 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where you assemble those modules, frankly, is not critical to  
implement the strategy,'' he said. ``I think you'll see across our 
plants in the U.S. a lot of different ideas tried out, as we've 
done around the world. It's not clear that one method or another is 
going to be the winning strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagoner insisted that Hogan's appointment to head the new  
e-commerce unit was not designed to get him out of Yokich's line of 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted somebody who had global expertise, somebody who's a  
broad thinker, somebody who's willing to look at things differently 
and push the needle, and somebody who's got a track record of great 
business results,'' Wagoner said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is focused on rebuilding its relationship with the UAW after  
last year's devastating strikes that shut down the automaker's 
North American operations and seriously hurt its U.S. market share. 
</P>
<P>
	Harley Shaiken, a University of California-Berkeley labor  
professor who monitors UAW issues, said Hogan's move can only help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether that was by design or default, it serves the purpose  
to soften one of the more contentious issues in the bargaining,'' 
Shaiken said.

<HEADLINE> 4 Retailers Settle Sweatshop Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Four prominent retailers will pay for  
independent monitoring of Saipan's garment industry as part of a 
settlement of a federal class-action lawsuit brought to prevent 
worker abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Nordstrom Inc., J. Crew Group Inc., Cutter &AMP; Buck Inc. and  
Gymboree Corp. agreed to the oversight of their contractors with 
factories in the U.S. territory in an effort to comply with 
American labor laws and international human rights treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to destroy the garment industry in Saipan, but it  
should not come at the price of indentured servitude,'' plaintiffs' 
attorney William Lerach said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder still must approve the  
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Three lawsuits filed Jan. 13 described approximately 32  
contractors in Saipan as ``America's worst sweatshop'' where there 
were beatings, forced abortions, vermin-infested quarters, barbed 
wire and armed guards. Employees worked 12 hours a day, seven days 
a week, the suits claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Abuses in Saipan, a 13-mile-long Western Pacific island in the  
Northern Marianas, had been documented previously, but the lawsuits 
were the first legal attempt to hold U.S. retailers accountable for 
alleged mistreatment of workers by subcontractors under the federal 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing made in the Saipan factories are stamped with ``Made in  
the USA'' tags, making it appear it was made in compliance with 
U.S. labor laws, the suits alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the settlement call for the companies to establish a  
$1.25 million fund to finance the independent monitoring program, 
provide money to the workers, create a public education campaign 
and pay attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Nordstrom co-president Erik Nordstrom called the deal ``a  
positive step toward our goal of ensuring that the goods we 
contract to manufacture in Saipan are made in compliance with 
law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Cutter &AMP; Buck chairman Harvey Jones said his company already  
closely monitors its Saipan contractors, and called the firm's 
decision to settle ``a business decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statements released by J. Crew and Gymboree stressed the  
companies have not admitted wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys also filed a letter of agreement in principle to  
settle with Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., 
Donna Karan International Inc. and Chadwick's of Boston Ltd., who 
were to be named as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles on Monday, attorneys for the lawsuit's 13  
remaining defendants argued the case should be shifted to Saipan 
for jurisdictional reasons. No ruling was made. 
</P>
<P>
	A related federal suit filed in Saipan targeting overtime pay  
was dismissed by a judge on Friday, Lerach said. A third suit, 
filed at state court in San Francisco against 18 retailers, will 
also be settled, he said.

<HEADLINE> Baby AIDS Cases Plummet With AZT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Drug treatment of HIV-infected pregnant women has  
been so successful in keeping newborns from catching the virus that 
experts believe mother-to-child AIDS transmission could be 
virtually wiped out in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of babies who got AIDS from their mothers dropped by  
two-thirds between 1992 and 1997 -- largely because of prenatal 
treatment with the drug AZT, researchers reported in today's 
Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a remarkable success story for ... everybody involved  
in caring for these women and the women themselves,'' said the 
study's lead author, Dr. Mary Lou Lindegren, an epidemiologist with 
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have more to go, but we've been dramatically  
successful,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study said it suggests the  
possibility of eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission in the 
United States, an idea that was almost unimaginable a few years 
ago. However the problem is still significant in developing 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found that the number of babies who developed  
AIDS after being infected with HIV before or during birth peaked at 
907 in 1992, then declined over the next five years to 297 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers believe the number of babies born HIV-infected  
is higher, since it can take years for HIV to develop into AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 32 states collect information on HIV infection in newborns,  
but the CDC estimates that 1,650 babies caught the virus from their 
mothers in 1991, at the epidemic's peak. By 1996, that number had 
fallen to 480, a 71 percent drop, Lindegren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists discovered in 1994 that treatment with AZT, now  
called zidovudine, reduced a newborn's risk of catching HIV from 26 
percent to 8 percent. In that study, the drug was given to 
HIV-infected women during pregnancy and labor and to the newborn 
for the first six weeks of life, said Dr. Lynne Mofenson of the 
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, doctors have found that prenatal AZT can actually  
reduce the risk to as low as 3 percent, Mofenson noted in an 
editorial accompanying the study. Delivering at-risk babies by 
Caesarean section lowers the risk further, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, if women are getting treatment with powerful AIDS-fighting  
drug regimens that can reduce virus levels in the blood to 
undetectable amounts, the risk may fall to less than 1 percent, she 
said, citing other research. 
</P>
<P>
	That means virtual elimination of mother-to-child transmission  
in the United States looks possible, Mofenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authors of the study said zidovudine is the main reason for the  
drop in AIDS cases in newborns, but not the only one. One other 
factor is that the number of babies born to infected women fell 17 
percent during the study period. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest challenge now is reducing mother-to-child  
transmission worldwide. An estimated 1,800 HIV-infected babies are 
born daily in developing countries and the cost of zidovudine has 
kept widespread treatment out of reach there. 
</P>
<P>
	In wealthy countries, HIV-infected pregnant women typically  
receive five months of zidovudine therapy, which can cost more than 
$1,000. Zidovudine is offered in developing countries at up to 75 
percent less than in the West, according to British manufacturer 
Glaxo Wellcome Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes are soaring since African scientists' recent finding that  
a new drug, nevirapine, appears to work better and at far lower 
cost -- an anticipated $4 a dose. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mofenson wrote that implementation may be difficult because  
many countries have neither medical systems to take care of 
pregnant women and newborns nor HIV counseling and testing 
capabilities.

<HEADLINE> Ku Klux Klan Rally Scheduled in Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A settlement allowing the Ku Klux Klan to rally  
later this month has not wiped away hard feelings against the black 
mayor who wouldn't stand in the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``This mayor broke the faith. He did not fight the fight,'' said  
Pat D'Angelo, an attorney for the police union. ``Instead he 
succumbed to the KKK and out of his own personal arrogance he has 
refused to do the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association gave up its effort  
Tuesday to block the Aug. 21 rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which represents 1,700 officers and dispatchers --  
most of Cleveland's police force -- said officers would be at risk 
keeping the white supremacist group and anti-Klan protesters 
separated. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also said it would be hard to provide security for all  
the events that day: The National Football League's Browns will be 
playing at home for the first time since the old franchise moved 
nearly four years ago; a convention for black families is expected 
to attract thousands downtown; and a women's professional 
basketball game is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Patricia Gaughan ordered details of  
Tuesday's settlement between the mayor and the union sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Michael R. White has said he's obligated under the  
Constitution to allow the rally. He has said a legal fight against 
the KKK would have been a losing battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disgusted with the mayor,'' union president Robert Beck,  
who is white, said following the settlement. ``The mayor chose to 
hide behind the First Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White said he is confident security will be maintained at the  
Klan rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``The security plan that we developed has not been impaired one  
iota,'' White told television reporters. ``I believe we have done 
what was appropriate and right based on my responsibility as 
mayor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's attorney, Bob Duvin, said White deserves credit for  
taking a politically unpopular position that upholds the right to 
free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understands that political dissent comes in all shapes and  
colors and ugliness and that it's never fashionable to stand up for 
it,'' Duvin said. ``But it was his responsibility to stand and he 
stood.''

<HEADLINE> Man Believed Dead Awakens in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A man pronounced dead after drowning off the  
coast of Egypt's port city of Alexandria regained consciousness 
after spending three hours in a morgue refrigerator, the Al-Akhbar 
newspaper reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Abdel-Rahim Mohammad, 32, an Arabic teacher, said the last  
thing he remembers before blacking out is a dizzy spell and seeing 
a vision of his mother's face while swimming at the Alexandria 
beach Monday, Al-Akhbar said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was awakened by a loud bang and unfamiliar voices.  
</P>
<P>
	``I found myself locked inside tight walls of metal and whispers  
of people I didn't recognize,'' Mohammad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed grabbed the hand of an attendant who was trying to  
close the refrigerator drawer in the Alexandria morgue. His firm 
grip sent the attendant and a family who had apparently come to 
identify the body of a loved one scurrying out of the morgue 
yelling ``help us!'' Mohammed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed stood on his frozen feet with difficulty and left the  
morgue to call his family in the southern Egyptian city of Malawi -- 
only to find that friends who accompanied him to the beach had 
already told his family he was dead.

<HEADLINE> Second Trial in Talk Show Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Attorneys for the man who killed an  
acquaintance after both appeared on a taping of ``The Jenny Jones 
Show'' will shift the focus of his defense to claims that the gay 
man stalked him and drove him to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Schmitz is standing trial a second time in the death of  
Scott Amedure. Jury selection in the second-degree murder case 
began Monday; arguments are expected to get under way late next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, who was convicted of the same charge in 1996, is  
accused of killing Amedure in March 1995, three days after they 
appeared a segment of the show about same-sex crushes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first trial, Schmitz's lawyers argued that mental illness  
and ambush tactics of the Jones show pushed him into a rage that 
led to the killing. The jury convicted him of second-degree murder 
but the verdict was overturned because of errors made by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months ago, a civil jury held Ms. Jones and her show  
liable in the death, awarding the Amedure family $25 million. The 
verdict is being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	For this murder trial, Schmitz has a different set of lawyers,  
who said that they hope to shift the blame to Amedure, a bartender 
who developed a crush on Schmitz and announced his affection for 
Schmitz on the Jones show. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge in the new trial has ruled that the defense won't be  
allowed to present evidence of Schmitz's extensive history of 
mental illness. Under Michigan law, diminished capacity cannot be 
used as a defense against a charge of second-degree murder. Such a 
defense was allowed in the first trial because the charge there was 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first trial they blamed Jenny Jones and they blamed her  
show entirely,'' Schmitz's defense attorney, Jerome Sabbota, said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it all started with Amedure. ``They (Jenny Jones show)  
never would have known about Jonathan Schmitz if not for Scott 
Amedure,'' Sabbota said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the taping, the defense contends, Amedure's affection  
turned into an obsession that frightened Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt he had no choice, he was provoked to the point that he  
broke,'' Sabbota told the Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabbota said the evidence will show Amedure ``stalked him,  
pushed him and wouldn't leave him alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the civil trial, lawyers for the show argued that Schmitz did  
not kill Amedure until after Amedure left a suggestive note on 
Schmitz's front door with a stolen construction light. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say proof of stalking is not a defense to murder.  
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz's previous lawyers also raised the stalking angle, but  
it was not stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty-five years' imprisonment for a man who is mentally ill,  
who was betrayed, who was lied to, who was set up, who was 
ambushed, who was stalked, and who was pursued relentlessly and who 
snapped -- where is the justice in that?'' defense attorney James 
Burdick wrote in December 1996, after probation officials 
recommended Schmitz be sentenced to at least 25 years in prison for 
his first conviction.

<HEADLINE> Blues' Twist Injured on Motorcycle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Blues enforcer Tony Twist, who  
recently led a motorcycle ride to raise money for charity, was 
hospitalized in intensive care Tuesday following a motorcycle 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's Mercy Medical Center issued a statement Tuesday  
afternoon saying surgery to stabilize Twist's pelvis injury is 
scheduled for later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened Monday night in Creve Coeur, a suburb of  
St. Louis. Police said a car pulled out of a parking lot in front 
of Twist's motorcycle, and he struck the side of the car.. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed, and none were likely, police Capt.  
Dale Bailey said. The driver of the car was also hurt. His 
condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found out this morning,'' said Larry Pleau, the Blues'  
general manager. ``Our concerns are for Tony's health. We're just 
hoping that everything is fine with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues said they had no details about Twist's condition.  
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said Twist was able to speak after the accident. The St.  
Louis Post-Dispatch reported on its Web site on Tuesday that Twist 
also sustained injuries to his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Woodcock, the Blues' vice president for marketing and  
communication, said team doctors were with Twist. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year veteran had recently completed his Iron Horse '99  
tour, a 1,500-mile motorcycle ride through several Western states. 
Former Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway and several NHL 
players joined Twist on the ride, which raised money for Head 
First, a charity that encourages children to wear a helmet when 
riding a bike or roller skating. 
</P>
<P>
	Twist's work with charity, and his standing as one of the NHL's  
top fighters, made him one of St. Louis' most popular sports 
figures. He and friend Kelly Chase, a longtime Blues teammate, are 
considered two of best enforcers in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Twist became an unrestricted free agent in June after the  
1998-99 season and has yet to sign with the Blues or a new team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked with Tony a couple of time during the summer,''  
Pleau said. ``The conversations are no different that those with 
any other player. I don't comment on what we've talked about, and 
at this time now it is an inappropriate time anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Post-Dispatch said Pleau told Twist on Monday, before his  
accident, that he no longer figured into the Blues' plans and would 
not be re-signed. Twist earned $650,000 last season and was seeking 
a new contract worth $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Twist was the Blues' ninth choice, and 177th selection overall,  
in the 1988 entry draft. He played in 28 games for St. Louis during 
his first season before spending the next four in Quebec. He 
returned to St. Louis as a free agent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In 63 games last season for St. Louis, Twist had two goals and  
eight points while accumulating 149 penalty minutes. In his 
445-game NHL career, Twist has scored 10 goals and 28 points while 
racking up 1,121 penalty minutes.

<HEADLINE> Computer Hacker Mitnick Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Computer hacker Kevin Mitnick, who admitted a  
multimillion-dollar crime wave in cyberspace, has been sentenced to 
three years and 10 months in prison and ordered to pay a token 
amount of restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick, the only computer hacker to make the FBI's 10 Most  
Wanted list, was arrested in 1995 in North Carolina after a spree 
that made him a hero to fellow hackers world wide. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of an earlier plea agreement, U.S. District Judge  
Mariana Pfaelzer sentenced Mitnick to three years and 10 months in 
prison. With credit for time served, he will be eligible for parole 
in one year. 
</P>
<P>
	That parole will last three years, Pfaelzer said, and until it's  
over Mitnick is to keep his hands off anything computer-related. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfaelzer told the 36-year-old Mitnick in strong terms Monday  
that he must pay $4,125 in restitution to various companies, though 
she doubted he will be able to earn more than minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just so we have an understanding, Mr. Mitnick, this is a token  
restitution order and you will be required to pay it. Do you 
understand?'' the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I understand it,'' answered Mitnick.  
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick's victims included such companies as Motorola, Novell,  
Nokia and Sun Microsystems, and the University of Southern 
California. He was accused of breaking into a North American Air 
Defense Command computer, although that allegation was never 
proven. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick admitted in March that he broke into the computers of  
several high-tech companies, stole software and installed programs 
that caused millions of dollars in damage. He pleaded guilty to 
five felony counts as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had asked that Mitnick be ordered to pay $1.5  
million, claiming his notoriety and skills would eventually allow 
him to earn money through book, film or TV contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Donald Randolph proposed his client be committed  
to a halfway house or rehabilitation center because of Mitnick's 
``obsessive behavior.'' The judge refused. 
</P>
<P>
	During his incarceration and while on parole, Mitnick is  
prohibited from having access to anything that can be used for 
Internet access -- including computers, software, hardware, cellular 
telephones and televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also prohibited from working as a consultant to any firms  
with access to computers, and may not obtain access codes, 
encryption data or any altered telephone equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Young computer aficionados crowded the courtroom to show their  
support for Mitnick. 
</P>
<P>
	A 17-year-old, who would only identify himself by his computer  
call sign ``Whippet,'' said he believed Mitnick was wrongfully 
locked up. He said he understood Mitnick's motivation as a hacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like an adventure,'' he said. ``You're just  
exploring. It's nothing malicious. It's like playing a sport, 
pushing yourself as far as you can go.''

<HEADLINE> Witness: Private Admitted Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- An Army private accused of beating a  
fellow soldier to death with a baseball bat admitted to the crime 
after being taken into custody, according to testimony at a 
military hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony came Monday at a hearing to determine whether  
there is enough evidence to send the case against Pfc. Calvin 
Glover to a general court-martial. The hearing was to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover, 18, was charged with premeditated murder in July's  
killing of Pfc. Barry Winchell in the hallway of Winchell's 
barracks at Fort Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfc. Ryan Futch guarded Glover after he was taken into custody.  
Futch testified that Glover told him he had hit Winchell several 
times with the bat. Futch also said he overheard Glover make 
disparaging remarks about blacks and homosexuals to another 
prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	Several soldiers have said they believed the killing was a hate  
crime. Winchell, 21, was perceived as a homosexual by some soldiers 
in his unit, according to Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, the 
watchdog group for gays in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army has declined comment on Winchell's sexuality. NBC  
reported Monday night that Winchell's mother and stepfather said if 
Winchell was gay, they were unaware of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, he was murdered, and he was on an Army base,  
where we thought he was safe,'' said Pat Kutteles, his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Winchell and Glover served in the 502nd Infantry Regiment's 2nd  
Battalion at the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Warrant Officer Alfred Brown testified that Winchell  
suffered massive head injuries when he was beaten with a blunt 
object after a party outside the barracks on July 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfc. Arthur Hoffman, a member of Winchell's company and a friend  
of the victim, described Glover as someone with an apparent 
drinking problem who often tried to pick fights. Hoffman said that 
on July 3 Winchell had gotten the better of Glover during a fight.

<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The city police union on Tuesday gave up its  
attempt to block a Ku Klux Klan rally scheduled for the same day as 
a downtown convention for black families and the Cleveland Browns 
first home game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association reached a  
settlement in federal court with Mayor Michael R. White, who had 
refused to mount his own legal challenge to the rally, scheduled 
for Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	White has said he's obligated under the Constitution to allow  
the rally to go forward and a legal fight against the KKK would 
have been a losing battle. 
</P>
<P>
	But the CPPA said the rally would put officers at risk of  
violence as they work to keep the white supremacist group and 
anti-Klan protesters separated. The union also said it would be 
hard-pressed to provide security for all the events in Cleveland 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Patricia Gaughan ordered details of the  
settlement sealed for security reasons.

<HEADLINE> Report: Fraud Guidelines Need Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Justice has made progress  
giving guidance to its offices when investigating fraud and abuse 
in Medicare, but still has work to do, the General Accounting 
Office reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the Department of Justice has been using the  
False Claims Act to more aggressively go after hospitals, doctors 
and other health care providers that are overbilling or providing 
medically unnecessary services. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals have responded that they have been unfairly targeted  
by an overzealous agency. That prompted the Justice Department to 
issue guidance to its offices on the proper use of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released Tuesday, the GAO, Congress' investigative  
arm, reported that work groups in the department ``have made 
further progress'' in issuing the guidance around four national 
initiatives, each targeting a specific type of payment, such as 
those to laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	However, GAO said, Justice's process for assessing progress on  
the guidelines ``may be superficial,'' because it simply involves 
reviewers asking supervisors what they have done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are recommending that (the department) take additional  
steps to improve its oversight of national health care 
initiatives,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	GAO also found the implementation of guidelines varied across  
the country. In some offices, the report said, officials were not 
acting in accordance with the rules. For instance, in several 
offices, government attorneys were sending hospital labs 
threatening letters even though they did not yet have evidence of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, GAO reported that hospital concerns about use of the  
False Claims Act had diminished since establishment of the 
guidelines.

<HEADLINE> Five Grand Slams in One Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On a grand night for hitters, pitchers got slammed.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in 129 years of major league baseball, five  
grand slams were hit in one day. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Tatis of the St. Louis Cardinals and Jose Vidro of the  
Montreal Expos got it started Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Mike Lowell of the Florida Marlins connected, Bernie  
Williams of the New York Yankees followed and Jay Buhner of the 
Seattle Mariners set the record. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner was unaware of the record.  
</P>
<P>
	``I did? That's cool. Right on!'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Four grand slams were hit in one day many times since major  
league baseball began in 1871, but never five. The last time four 
were hit was July 28, 1998, when Sammy Sosa, Gabe Alvarez, Darrin 
Jackson and Ray Lankford connected. 
</P>
<P>
	This has been a season of slams in the big leagues. The five  
raised the majors' total to 96 -- the record of 141 was set in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not necessarily the quality or lack of quality of  
pitching, it's the style,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``I 
think pitchers do not want the guy to hit the ball, so it's ball 
one, ball two and then you've got to come down the middle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After becoming the first player to hit two slams in the same  
inning on April 23 at Los Angeles, Tatis hit the third of his 
career on Billy Brewer's first pitch in the fourth inning during a 
12-6 win at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	With three slams this year, Tatis tied Jim Bottomley (1925) and  
Keith Hernandez (1977) for the Cardinals' record. Tatis is 7-for-10 
with 22 RBIs when hitting with the bases loaded this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Vidro connected on his first pitch from Carlos Almanzar in the  
sixth inning of the Expos' 8-0 win over visiting San Diego. It was 
his first grand slam in the majors and Montreal's first since last 
Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell hit his first career grand slam on a 3-1 pitch in the  
eighth inning against San Francisco's John Johnstone, who had just 
relieved starter Livan Hernandez. The home run tied the score at 4, 
and Florida went on to beat the Giants 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' sixth career slam came at Oakland on a full-count  
pitch by reliever Mike Oquist, capping an eight-run second inning 
that gave the New York Yankees an 8-0 lead in a 12-8 win over the 
Athletics. Williams started toward first after taking a 2-2 pitch 
for a ball, then returned to the plate as his teammates laughed in 
the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner, who had been 0-for-4 with the bases loaded this year,  
connected in the sixth inning at Safeco Field on a 3-1 pitch from 
John Snyder of the White Sox. The homer gave the Mariners a 6-3 
lead in a 6-4 win over Chicago, 
</P>
<P>
	The three grand slams in one day tied the AL record, last  
accomplished last Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been 57 slams in the AL this season and 39 in the NL.  
Both leagues set records in 1996, with 81 slams in the AL and 60 in 
the NL.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska Grain Bins Full from 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- With reports of record-challenging harvests  
for both soybeans and corn expected from Nebraska fields this fall, 
farmers and elevator operators are trying to figure out where to 
put their crop. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is grain storage centers still have plenty of the  
1998 harvest on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	State agriculture officials said that never in history have  
Nebraska farmers moved toward a fall harvest with as many soybeans 
in their bins. And the corn picture isn't much better, where 
carryover from the 1998 crop is the highest since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the perils of farming, unfortunately,'' Ken  
Wurdeman from the Lincoln-based Nebraska Corn Board said Monday. 
``It's not like the auto industry, where you can just shut down an 
assembly line and quit making cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the third straight year, grain supplies have outstripped  
demand. Farmers who can't afford to let acres sit idle are being 
forced to sell stored grain at prices below production cost to make 
room for the new crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like two harvests at one time or one on the heels of the  
other,'' said Pat Ptacek of the Nebraska Grain and Feed 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Valparaiso corn and soybean producer Gary Hellerich said dry  
conditions in eastern states have given a small boost to grain 
prices recently but not enough to make them profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losses are just not as great as they were at an earlier  
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn producers waiting for prices to rise since November have  
gotten little reward for their patience. Soybean farmers saw their 
crop prices drop during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	A primary factor: 55 million bushels of soybeans and nearly 500  
million bushels of corn in storage in the state as of June 1, 
according to the Nebraska Agricultural Statistics Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The soybean carryover amounts to about a third of the 1998 crop.  
It's up more than 17 million bushels from the same date last year 
and well above anything on record books. 
</P>
<P>
	The stored corn equivalent is about 40 percent of the 1998 crop.

<HEADLINE> Jamal Delays Meeting With Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- The Jamal Anderson Watch turned into a  
frenzy Tuesday. Too bad the All-Pro running back wasn't around. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, refusing to report to the Atlanta Falcons training  
camp until he receives a new contract, pushed back his face-to-face 
meeting with coach Dan Reeves and general manager Harold Richardson 
until Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of reporters converged on sleepy Furman University,  
hoping to get a glimpse of the man who played a key role in the 
Falcons' Super Bowl season. But the player's California-based 
agent, Jim Sims, said he had trouble getting a flight to 
Greenville, so the meeting was delayed 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and Sims remained in Atlanta. At training camp,  
everyone had to settle for Morten Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I'm not Jamal Anderson,'' the Falcons' kicker joked on his  
way to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims, reached in Atlanta late Tuesday, said he would ask the  
Falcons to trade Anderson if a deal can't be reached Wednesday. The 
agent first raised the trade possibility a couple of weeks ago when 
his client refused to report to training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I we don't get it done, I think from that point on we'll  
really have to push the trade option,'' Sims said. ``He's not 
retiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he did several weeks ago, Reeves flatly rejected the idea of  
trading Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll meet with them and he won't get traded,'' the coach  
vowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves seemed perturbed by all the attention devoted to his star  
running back, who is refusing to play out the final year of his 
current contract for $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson wants a long-term deal that's in line with the NFL's  
other top runners after rushing for a franchise-record 1,846 yards 
and setting a league mark with 410 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just want more publicity and y'all are doing a great job  
of giving it to them,'' Reeves groused to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who has final say on contract matters, continued to draw  
a line in the sand at Anderson's demands. He said the running back 
should accept the Falcons' offer or live up to his contract and 
become a free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything being different just because we're  
meeting face to face ... instead of talking on the phone,'' Reeves 
said. ``We've stated our stance and that's not going to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did concede a willingness to shift some money to earlier  
years in the contract. While the two sides have basically agreed on 
a new five-year deal worth $28 million to $30 million, Anderson is 
reportedly seeking around $13 million in the first three years and 
the Falcons have offered $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Falcons have offered a $7 million signing bonus, while  
Anderson is seeking at least $7.5 million after initially asking 
for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who lives in Salt Lake City, arrived in Atlanta early  
Monday morning, putting him within a 2 1/2-hour drive of Greenville. 
He spent Tuesday meeting with Sims, going over figures and plotting 
strategy for the meeting with Reeves and Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	If a deal is reached Wednesday, Sims said his client could take  
part in practice that afternoon or, at the latest, Thursday 
morning. The Falcons play their first exhibition game Friday night 
against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves seemed somewhat heartened that Anderson was at least  
making the effort to be at training camp, even if didn't plan on 
being in uniform right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's better than nothing,'' Reeves said. ``We'll sit down  
and talk and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims sparked the first face-to-face talks since training camp  
began on June 29 when he cut short a European vacation and sent a 
new proposal to Richardson on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can't be a bigger commitment than going to training camp  
ready to go to work,'' Sims said. ``Hopefully, we'll get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, facing fines of $65,000 for skipping 13 workouts as of  
Tuesday, has been unwilling to take the field without a new 
contract since the Falcons can still retain his rights next season 
by designating him a franchise player. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in that situation, he would be assured of making at least  
the average salary of the top five players at his position. 
</P>
<P>
	While Anderson can't force the Falcons to trade him, Sims said  
it would be foolish to keep the player if negotiations reach a 
point where he no longer wants to play for the NFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only vindictive for a team not to go forward and try to  
entertain the trade option,'' Sims said, pointing out that the 
Falcons would be stuck with a $3.6 million salary cap cost whether 
Anderson plays or not. ``Then where we are going to be next year? 
Starting off at square one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Falcons went through another day of practice on a  
scorching 95-degree day, their thoughts far away from Anderson's 
contract impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think about Jamal until you asked me,'' linebacker  
Jessie Tuggle told a reporter. ``That's the truth. I want him out 
here as quick as possible, but I'll promise you I'm not losing any 
sleep over him.''

<HEADLINE> Young Finally Back for 49ers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- The orders to Bryant Young were clear:  
Stay out of all team drills at the San Francisco 49ers' training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, Tuesday was Young's first day back on the field since  
a frightening injury 8 1/2 months ago. San Francisco's star defensive 
tackle broke both bones in his lower right leg in a collision with 
teammate Ken Norton Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``All he did was the individual work early in practice. We kept  
him out of everything else, but he looked good to me,'' 49ers coach 
Steve Mariucci said. ``He is so darn happy to be back in a 49ers 
helmet, and the whole team obviously is glad he's back. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, when we went to the two-minute drill, he ran into the  
defensive huddle, and I went, `What is he doing? because we told 
him he wasn't going to get involved. But he was just in there, 
breaking them down. He just wanted to get in there and be with his 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the biggest step yet in the comeback of Young, who was  
activated from the physically-unable-to-perform list. The move 
allowed him to rejoin his teammates on the practice field after 
months of watching from afar as he conducted his rehabilitation 
workouts under the supervision of physical development coordinator 
Jerry Attaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Young remains on course for a return in San Francisco's  
regular-season opener at Jacksonville on Sept. 12 but is not 
expected to play in any exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm letting them know how I feel and at the same time, they're  
being very cautious about letting me do too much too soon,'' Young 
said. ``This is where I am right now. But I was excited, anxious to 
get out there because this is the day I've been waiting for. It was 
what I thought about throughout my rehabilitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates and coaches alike took time to welcome Young back and  
congratulate him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have a lot of sharpening up to do,'' Young said. ``I'm  
going to use practice to my advantage to get ready for the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young underwent three operations in the aftermath of the injury,  
which occurred last Nov. 30. Norton's helmet struck Young's leg as 
he braced to tackle Giants quarterback Kent Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	It took some two months for Young to again walk unassisted.  
</P>
<P>
	``But once I started walking again, the healing process took  
off,'' he said. ``I knew in my mind and my heart I would come 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young will be playing with a metal rod in his leg. It was  
inserted in the tibia, the weight-bearing bone, to stabilize 
Young's leg and promote healing. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Cincinnati tackle Tim Krumrie, who broke his leg playing  
against the 49ers in the January 1989 Super Bowl, and former San 
Francisco center-guard Jesse Sapolu, who also had a leg fracture 
early in his career, both came back to play with metal rods in 
their legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said Young will be brought along gradually. He's  
expected to begin contact drills early next week but he'll be held 
out of the team's four exhibitions. The 49ers followed a similar 
regimen last year when Jerry Rice, coming off two serious knee 
injuries, prepared for the season without playing in any 
exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Young said he's confident he'll be able to play at the same  
level as before the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm pretty close to 100 percent,'' Young said. ``I  
have no pain in my leg where I broke both bones. The one thing that 
slowed me down a bit was my knee, but we worked through that. I 
think I'm pretty much the same as before. I'm very thankful. I have 
a lot to be thankful for.''

<HEADLINE> Schoolmate Urges Trial As Adult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The teen-ager who was the most seriously  
injured during a shooting rampage at Heritage High School testified 
today that she believes defendant T.J. Solomon should be tried as 
an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon should not be kept in the juvenile court system  
``because if he gets off as a juvenile, he could be out in a few 
months, and he doesn't need to be out,'' said 15-year-old Stephanie 
Laster. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanie was one of six students shot May 20 at the school in  
Conyers, a suburb 20 miles east of Atlanta. She underwent two 
operations and was hospitalized for 12 days. Bullet fragments 
remain lodged in her hip and doctors aren't sure whether her 
ovaries have been damaged, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the final prosecution witness at a hearing to determine  
whether 15-year-old Solomon should be tried in Juvenile Court or 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys were to present their case later today.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a state investigator read a note found under  
Solomon's bed that referred to the Trench Coat Mafia, a group 
linked to the April 20 slayings at Columbine High School in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Nicholson, an agent with the Georgia Bureau of  
Investigation, read the note, in which Solomon apparently wrote 
that he had been planning his attack for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``One big question I leave behind for you to find is why,'' the  
note said. ``But for the sake of my brothers and sisters related to 
the Trench Coat Mafia, those answers will have to remain out of the 
public eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, Colo., Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18,  
killed 13 people and then themselves at Columbine High on April 20. 
They were members of the Trench Coat Mafia, a group of students who 
wore black coats and considered themselves campus outcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas said the note distanced its author from the Columbine  
massacre: ``This has nothing to do with Hitler,'' it said, ``and it 
is not because I was picked on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the back of the note, Nicholson said, Solomon wrote: ``I am  
laughing at the victims who are getting down on their knees 
screaming, `Please, dear God, please don't let this crooked ... 
(obscenity deleted) murder me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, immediately after the Heritage High shootings the  
gunman dropped to his knees and pointed a gun at his mouth. A short 
time later, after pointing his gun at an assistant principal, he 
surrendered with a tearful, ``Oh, my God, I'm so scared!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon faces 21 charges, including aggravated assault and  
weapons violations, in the rampage at the Heritage High commons 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	He could be sentenced to five years in detention if Judge  
William Schneider decides to keep the case in juvenile court. If 
convicted in Superior Court, Solomon could face 351 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers spent much of Monday's session discussing Solomon's  
mental state. His attorney hoped to convince Schneider that the 
youth should be sent to a psychiatric hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson said the note also referred to bombs planted at  
Heritage High, although no bombs were found, and was accompanied by 
sheets of bomb-making instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmate Teeunia Stroud testified that Solomon brought the  
instructions to school after the Columbine rampage, but she said 
she thought he was joking. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that the kids at Columbine were aiming at certain  
people, and that slowed them down,'' said Miss Stroud, who ate 
lunch with Solomon. ``He said that if he ever shot up Heritage 
High, he would shoot everybody and not aim.''

<HEADLINE> Hair Shows Jackson Wasn't Poisoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Historians have long believed that  
Andrew Jackson slowly died of mercury and lead poisoning from two 
bullets in his body and the 19th-century medications he took for 
intestinal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, two strands of the seventh president's hair appear to have  
proven otherwise -- 154 years after Jackson's death. Instead, 
researchers said, Old Hickory died of kidney failure at age 78. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers analyzed hair clipped from Jackson in 1815 and  
1839 and preserved by The Hermitage, his Tennessee plantation. 
</P>
<P>
	While the mercury and lead levels found in the hair samples were  
``significantly elevated,'' they were not toxic, said Dr. Ludwig M. 
Deppisch, a pathologist with Northeastern Ohio Universities College 
of Medicine and Forum Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The research is published in Wednesday's edition of the Journal  
of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who served from 1829-37, was among the sickest of all  
presidents. Many of his symptoms were consistent with mercury and 
lead poisoning, including excessive salivation, rapid tooth loss, 
colic, diarrhea, hand tremors, irritability, mood swings and 
paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
	Some historians believed Jackson's frequent ingestion of calomel  
(mercurous chloride) and sugar of lead (lead acetate) -- medicines 
he took for intestinal ailments -- caused the symptoms and led to 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fully thought he was going to have mercury poisoning,  
because of his (kidney) failure and neurological and psychiatric 
problems,'' Deppisch said. ``But the hair analysis came back 
proving that he didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers believe that Jackson's elevated mercury level  
was caused by the calomel and that much of the lead came from two 
bullets, one lodged near his heart and the other in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was shot near the heart during an 1806 duel with Charles  
Dickinson but managed to get off a fatal shot. The duel began as an 
argument over a horse race and escalated when Dickinson insulted 
Jackson's wife, Rachel. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was shot in the shoulder during an 1813 fight in  
downtown Nashville with brothers Jesse and Thomas Hart Benton, who 
went on to become a senator from Missouri. The bullet was removed 
in 1832. 
</P>
<P>
	According to biographers, Jackson's health improved after the  
bullet in his shoulder was removed and he stopped using sugar of 
lead, which he described as ``that potent but pernicious remedy to 
the stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers got the hair samples last summer from a collection  
of nine locks of Jackson's hair kept at The Hermitage, where 
Jackson lived most of his later years as an invalid before his 
death in 1845. 
</P>
<P>
	``During Jackson's lifetime, admirers would write to him and  
request a lock of hair,'' Hermitage spokeswoman Carolyn Brackett 
said. ``Over the years, as people would inherit the hair, they 
would send it back to us.''

<HEADLINE> Title Fight Moved to Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Aug. 21 WBC super-lightweight title fight  
between Kostya Tszyu and Miguel Angel Gonzalez has been moved to 
South Florida after negotiations stalled in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The bout, which will be telecast by Showtime Network, now will  
be held at Miccosukee Indian Gaming, just outside Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Miccosukees are always interested in doing a big fight,''  
said Dan Goosen, who is co-promoting the bout with Don King. ``And 
this is a big fight, wherever you put it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tszyu, born in Russia and now living in Australia, and Gonzalez  
will fight for a championship which has stood vacant for two years. 
Oscar de la Hoya won the belt by beating Gonzalez in January 1997, 
then moved up to the welterweight division without a title defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Tszyu (22-1-1, 18 knockouts) and Gonzalez (43-1-1, 33 KOs) had  
been scheduled to meet for the title three times previously, but 
each bout was canceled because of injuries or legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miccosukees became a late entrant as host when Goosen  
couldn't complete a deal to stage the bout at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan talked to me and said the fight was available,'' said  
Miccosukee executive director Don Hazelton, who secured the 
approval of tribal chairman Billy Cypress. ``We've proven we can 
have big events. I wouldn't say we were lucky. Luck is when 
opportunity meets preparedness.''

	``It's a land grab out there,'' said Salon Chief Executive  
Officer Michael O'Donnell, attributing his company's losses to 
staff buildup and advertising. ``You have to spend to build a brand 
... It's what we have to do to reach critical mass.''

<HEADLINE> DOE: Plutonium Made Its Way to Tenn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) -- The federal government says that 5,600  
tons of uranium contaminated with trace amounts of the more 
radioactive element plutonium were brought here in the 1950s and 
1960s for weapons fuel production. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact on workers and the environment is unknown, but  
Department of Energy officials promised Tuesday to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelation followed a lawsuit accusing DOE of silently  
exposing workers to plutonium over decades at DOE's uranium 
enrichment plant in Paducah, Ky. The Washington Post reported the 
plutonium eventually contaminated the grounds and spilled into 
nearby streams and a wildlife refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Sunday ordered a medical  
review of current and past workers at Paducah. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he told NBC's ``Today'' show, ``We're looking at  
other plants, at Oak Ridge, to see whether this might have 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of contaminated uranium at Oak Ridge's K-25 site  
represented a small portion of the some 40,000 tons of uranium used 
at the facility between the 1950s and the 1970s, said DOE spokesman 
Steven Wyatt. 
</P>
<P>
	Some workers at Oak Ridge fear they were unwittingly exposed to  
more radiation than they realized. 
</P>
<P>
	Uranium operations at K-25 were shut down in 1985, and some of  
the processing facilities currently are being disassembled and 
cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
	The uranium-processing system at K-25 was tightly sealed and  
operated under sub-atmospheric pressure, making it doubtful anyone 
was exposed to radioactive materials, according to a former plant 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The only opportunity for exposure would be if the system had a  
leak and, due to the operating conditions, a leak would tend to 
suck air in rather than expel gas into the workplace, said Ken 
Sommerfeld, a retired vice president at Martin Marietta Energy 
Systems.

<HEADLINE> Lions Send Rep To Meet Sanders' Dad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions have sent a  
representative to Wichita, Kan., to meet with the father of 
recently retired running back Barry Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Hughes, director of security for the Lions, has been at  
Sanders' father's home for two days, apparently in hopes of setting 
up further talks between Sanders, his family and the team's front 
office, The Detroit News reported in Wednesday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's the start of something good,'' William Sanders  
said, confirming Hughes' visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if any talks will be a drawn-out affair, the elder Sanders  
said: ``I hope with all my heart it's not time-consuming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, who retired from the Detroit Police Department as an  
inspector, has headed the Lions' security department for four 
years. He is a former member of the Harlem Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, second on the NFL's career rushing list, announced his  
retirement July 28, the day before the team reported to training 
camp at Saginaw Valley State University. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Sanders said his desire to quit football outweighed  
his desire to play. When camp opened July 29, Sanders was in London 
on a European vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said it was believed he will return this week.  
Sanders has a home in Rochester Hills. He also spends considerable 
time at his parents' home in Wichita, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	William Sanders said Hughes was sent to Wichita by Lions vice  
chairman William Clay Ford Jr., son of owner William Clay Ford. The 
younger Ford talked to Sanders' father by telephone July 29 and 
told him he would do what he could to talk to Sanders and get him 
back in uniform with the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he represents Bill Ford,'' William Sanders said of  
Hughes. ``He (Ford) impressed me as being a fine gentleman.''

<HEADLINE> Giants' Rookie Runner in Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- All halfback Sean Bennett wanted from the  
New York Giants was a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the fourth-round draft pick out of Northwestern via a  
defunct program at Evansville is now the starter heading into 
Friday night's exhibition opener against Minnesota, after a run of 
injuries at the position. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest injury came late in Tuesday's practice at the  
University of Albany when Joe Montgomery, the second-round draft 
pick out of Ohio State, reinjured his right hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	That put him on the shelf with starter Gary Brown (buttocks  
surgery), LeShon Johnson (thumb surgery) and free agent Raymond 
Priester (foot). 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a 1,063-yard rusher who was injured in a motorcycle  
accident in June, and Johnson, who tore a ligament in his right 
thumb on Monday, are hoping to return next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're thin,'' coach Jim Fassel said of his halfback  
situation. ``The good news is we haven't lost anyone seriously. All 
these guys are coming back. The bad news is all these guys are 
losing practice time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Bennett, the injuries have turned into the chance of a  
lifetime. Fassel said it would not be surprising if he got as many 
as 20 carries on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's an unbelievable opportunity for a back who was somewhat  
of a sleeper in the draft. He set seven school records at 
Evansville, rushing for 2,856 yards, including 1,667 in his junior 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	After the school dropped its football program, Bennett  
transferred to Northwestern, where he got lost. The 6-foot-1, 
230-pound Bennett only carried 32 times in 12 games for 160 yards, 
playing mostly as a fullback. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long road,'' Bennett said Tuesday between  
practices. ``I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to play. Now 
it's a great chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only is Bennett going to carry the load at halfback, the  
Giants also plan to use him on the kickoff coverage and return 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery's injury might change those plans, and it might also  
force Fassel to take Tiki Barber, a starter early last year, out of 
his intended third-down role this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll get a few more carries, we'll work him in there,''  
Fassel said of Barber. ``That's all part of game planning. I've 
gone into a game with only four backs before, not in the preseason 
though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Bennett and Barber, the Giants also have fullbacks  
Charles Way and Greg Comella. They could be featured in a one-back 
offense that uses two tight ends. 
</P>
<P>
	A north-south runner who has the quickness to get outside and  
the size to go inside, Bennett still will get the bulk of the work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got here thinking I was going to be last on the depth chart  
and now with all the injuries, I've gotten a lot more reps than I 
otherwise would have had,'' he said. ``You can only learn so much 
from watching everyone else. Right now, I am reading the holes 
well, but I've still got a lot to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who had a painful hematoma drained from his buttocks last  
weeks, said he is feeling better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting anxious,'' said Brown, who has yet to practice.  
``The doctors say let it heal up and don't rush it. If I rush it, 
the fluid is going to go right back in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not known how long Johnson or Montgomery will be sidelined.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who missed last season because of cancer, had surgery  
on his right thumb Tuesday, and a bone and ligament were pinned 
back in place. Fassel hopes to have Johnson back at practice Monday 
if there isn't too much pain.

<HEADLINE> Aluminum Merger May Be in the Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Switzerland's biggest aluminum  
company, Alusuisse-Lonza, is in merger talks with two competitors 
that could result in creation of the world's largest aluminum 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Alusuisse-Lonza, also known as Algroup, said today it was in  
``advanced discussions'' with Alcan Aluminium of Montreal, Canada, 
and the French company Pechiney. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 1 company is Alcoa Inc., headquartered in  
Pittsburgh, which had sales of $15.3 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement from Algroup said it was not certain the talks  
would result in an agreement, and officials declined to give 
further information. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate statement, Pechiney confirmed it was in talks with  
the other two companies over ``a possible merger of their 
operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Algroup were up 4.6 percent in early trading on the  
Zurich stock exchange. Pechiney shares rose 2.5 percent on the 
Paris Bourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Algroup announced it was discussing a possible  
merger with the German industrial concern Viag. The talks came to 
an acrimonious end in March following a disagreement over a share 
swap arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Alcan is the world's second-largest producer of  
aluminum. It recorded sales of $7.8 billion last year. Pechiney, 
based in Paris, is the world's No. 4, with 1998 sales of $10.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Algroup, which nearly went broke in the 1980s after a series of  
disastrous forays into the United States, recorded sales of $6.4 
billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	If the merger goes through, the three companies would have a  
combined workforce of more than 100,000 and would overtake the U.S. 
aluminum giant Alcoa. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company also would have a large packaging business.

<HEADLINE> Hargrove To Coach Portland WNBA Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Linda Hargrove, whose first job in women's  
professional basketball was cut short when the American Basketball 
League folded, will get a second chance as coach of Portland's WNBA 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove will be introduced as coach by Portland Trail Blazers  
president and general manager Bob Whitsitt at a news conference 
Tuesday, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trail Blazers, who own Portland's as-yet-unnamed WNBA  
franchise, would not confirm or deny Hargrove's hiring, as per club 
policy. A telephone call to Hargrove's home in Wichita, Kan., was 
not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	But a source who asked not to be identified said Hargrove had  
taken the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-team WNBA, currently in its third season, announced in  
June it was expanding to 16 teams for the 2000 season. Other cities 
awarded franchises were Seattle, Indianapolis and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove took over as coach of the Colorado Xplosion before the  
1998 ABL season. The team went 5-8 before the financially 
struggling league shut down Dec. 21, one-third of the way through 
its third season. Thirty-seven players from the league's nine teams 
were spread out to the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove had replaced Sheryl Estes, who resigned to return to  
college coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove was 429-248 as a college coach between 1972 and 1998.  
Her teams at Wichita State went 113-136 in nine seasons, and she 
was named Missouri Valley Conference coach of the year in 1993. In 
17 seasons at Cowley Community College in Arkansas City, Kan., she 
went 316-112 with four NCAA Tournament appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	She was an assistant for the 1992 U.S. women's national team  
that won the bronze medal at the Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	She also had a 305-114-8 record as volleyball coach at Cowley,  
and her husband Ed was the softball coach for 14 years at the 
southeastern Kansas school. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers reportedly interviewed four people for the WNBA  
coaching job, including former Portland Power coach Linn Dunn and 
former Boston Celtics coach K.C. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn appeared to be a strong candidate, but she accepted the  
same position with the Seattle team on July 22. She was named ABL 
coach of the year in 1998 after leading the Power to a 27-17 
record, the best in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the other three expansion teams, Portland must sell 5,500  
season tickets by Oct. 15. So far, the Blazers have sold about 
1,650 tickets, a team official said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Catfish Hunter Suffers Head Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Baseball Hall of Famer Jim ``Catfish''  
Hunter is unconscious and in critical condition in a 
neuro-intensive care unit after falling and hitting his head, a 
hospital spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Hunter fell Sunday while negotiating stairs at  
his home in Hertford, said Doug Boyd, a spokesman for Pitt County 
Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was taken to a hospital in Edenton and transferred early  
Monday to Pitt, a hospital that serves the East Carolina University 
medical school. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd said Hunter was awake Monday, but was unconscious Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's family has requested no further information be  
released, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former major league pitcher was diagnosed in September with  
amyothropic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, a neurological disease that 
interferes with the signals the brain sends to the muscles. Over 
time, the muscles degenerate. The cause is unknown, and there's no 
cure. 
</P>
<P>
	ALS also is known as Lou Gehrig's disease.  
</P>
<P>
	Hunter pitched for 15 years, winning 224 games, including a  
perfect game. He received five World Series rings while playing for 
the Kansas City and Oakland Athletics and the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd said Hunter hadn't undergone surgery.  
</P>
<P>
	``The specialists up there are trying to support him as best  
they can,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, residents of Hunter's hometown turned out for a ceremony  
to honor him and kick off a foundation to aid people who suffer 
from the disease.

<HEADLINE> Witness: Slain Soldier Was Taunted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- A platoon leader who served with a  
soldier beaten to death in an Army barracks testified today that 
rumors that the soldier was homosexual made him a frequent target 
of name-callers in his unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Eric Dubielak testified that he knew Pfc. Barry Winchell as  
a gunner in his platoon and was aware of the rumors about his 
sexuality. Dubielak said the rumors started late last year and that 
soldiers in Winchell's own unit started calling him derogatory 
names almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
	And Dubielak and another soldier who testified today, Sgt.  
Michael Kleifgen, both said Winchell, 21, told them that he was not 
a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony at a hearing to determine whether there is enough  
evidence to send the case against Pvt. Calvin Glover to a general 
court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover, 18, was charged with premeditated murder in July's  
killing of Winchell in the hallway of Winchell's barracks at Fort 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, an Army private testified that Glover, while in  
custody, had admitted beating Winchell to death with a baseball 
bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfc. Ryan Futch, who had guarded Glover in custody, testified  
that Glover told him he had hit Winchell several times with the 
bat. Futch also said he overheard Glover make disparaging remarks 
about blacks and gays to another prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	Several soldiers have said they believed the killing was a hate  
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army has declined to comment on Winchell's sexuality. NBC  
reported Monday night that Winchell's mother and stepfather said if 
Winchell was gay, they were unaware of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, he was murdered, and he was on an Army base,  
where we thought he was safe,'' said Pat Kutteles, his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Winchell and Glover served in the 502nd Infantry Regiment's 2nd  
Battalion at the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Warrant Officer Alfred Brown testified that Winchell  
suffered massive head injuries when he was beaten with a blunt 
object after a party outside the barracks on July 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfc. Arthur Hoffman, a member of Winchell's company and a friend  
of the victim, described Glover as someone with an apparent 
drinking problem who often tried to pick fights. Hoffman said that 
on July 3, Winchell had gotten the better of Glover during a fight.

<HEADLINE> Reichl Brings New Voices to Gourmet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``Then, with good friends of such attributes, and good food on  
the board, and good wine in the pitcher, we may well ask, When 
shall we live if not now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	--M.F.K. Fisher, from ``Serve it Forth.''  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ruth Reichl is striding briskly through the  
corridors of Gourmet, looking very much the role she has just 
assumed: editor of one of America's most venerable magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a smart black suit, she stops by the magazine's  
bustling test kitchens, chatting with the staff. It's clear that 
she's reached one of the top positions in food writing after more 
than two decades of work as a chef, editor, restaurant critic and 
best-selling author. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet over lunch, she's your pal. At a Manhattan restaurant run by  
celebrity chef Larry Forgione, she slides her plate closer to make 
sharing bites easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get a belly,'' she says, picking through her plate of fried  
clams to find a fine, plump belly to offer her dining companion. 
``It's the best part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting people together over food is what Reichl is all about.  
``Even though I've spent my life in the food industry, I'll take a 
mediocre meal with great company over a great meal with boring 
company any day,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also a big part of the changes she's making at Gourmet  
magazine, which has been showing a few of its 58 years as 
competitors like Saveur, Cooking Light and Food and Wine liven up 
the sometimes stodgy field of food writing. 
</P>
<P>
	The first issue under Reichl's guidance, due out on newsstands  
Aug. 24, will feature several changes that showcase the philosophy 
of its new editor. There also will be new uses for the magazine's 
sterling assets, such as its finely tuned test kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying she wants to put ``more of a voice in the magazine,''  
Reichl is inviting well-known writers to go on adventurous trips 
and write about them. In the September issue, novelist Pat Conroy 
goes on a honeymoon in Italy and psychedelic monologue artist 
Spalding Gray takes a family trip to Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also an excerpt from the new Julia Child cookbook, a  
regular ``Kitchen Notebook'' feature with first-hand look at the 
work done there, and a back page column where writers get to sound 
off on topics they feel strongly about. In the first one, novelist 
Ann Patchett complains about the frustrations of cooking for 
finicky people. 
</P>
<P>
	Other changes include making recipes more conversational and  
spicing up photos with more people and fancier presentations. 
Reichl is also throwing out a relic of the past, editing copy on 
paper, although in some ways that system allowed its own kind of 
personal touch. One manuscript she held up had a food stain on it, 
which someone had circled with a pen and labeled as ``created in 
the kitchens of Gourmet magazine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time Reichl has stepped in to jazz up an  
established publication. While still working happily as food editor 
of the Los Angeles Times, she was relucant to accept an offer from 
The New York Times to be their restaurant critic, saying she found 
the tone of their criticism ``Olympian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You really can't have a right or wrong. You have to have a  
voice,'' Reichl says. One of the reasons she left the field of art 
history, in which she has a masters' degree, was ``the judgement 
thing,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	After being assured by senior editors that she would have free  
reign to bring her own style to the reviews, she accepted and 
returned to her hometown. For the following six years she brought a 
personal and frank tone as well as eclectic tastes to the food 
pages of The New York Times, earning her a wide following among 
diners. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year she gained a national reputation with her bestselling  
memoir, ``Tender at the Bone,'' which recounted her years as a chef 
in Berkeley, Calif. and her earliest discoveries of fine food as a 
child, many of which came thanks to live-in maids and travel to 
France and Canada. Her own mother's dreadful fare inspired a 
chapter titled ``The Queen of Mold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to editing Gourmet, which is part of the Conde Nast  
magazine family, Reichl is working on a second volume of her 
memoirs and writing the introduction for a new edition of writings 
by M.F.K. Fisher, one of the most renowned food writers. 
</P>
<P>
	As a reviewer, Reichl brough a kind of democracy to restaurant  
criticism with a zero tolerance for attitude. In an incident now 
legendary on New York's culinary scene, she stripped one of the 
four stars from Le Cirque after receiving condescending treatment 
and poor food when the staff did not recognize her. 
</P>
<P>
	She wrote a two-part review, one as the ``Unknown Diner,'' one  
as a ``Most Favored Patron,'' from another occasion when the staff 
spotted her and gave her kid-glove treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Colman Andrews, who worked with Reichl at the Los Angeles Times,  
says she ``brought a personal side to her writing that some people 
didn't like, such as bringing along her husband, whom she described 
as 'The Reluctant Gourmet.' But they were very effective devices 
for humanizing restaurant criticism, which can so easily be lists 
of menu items with adjectives thrown in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews, while an admirer and friend of Reichl's, also edits a  
rival magazine. In the five years since Andrews co-founded Saveur, 
it has won high praise among culinary professionals for its rich 
writing about food history, ingredients and cooking. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean he's not just as excited as other readers  
of Gourmet to see what kind of changes Reichl brings. ``I'm sure 
she'll do something very good, and I hope that it's so good that we 
have to get worried and have to do better ourselves,'' Andrews 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	David Rosengarten, host of three shows on the Food Network, says  
he ``couldn't be more excited'' about seeing the new Gourmet. ``One 
of the great things Ruth brought to her work at The New York Times 
was a strong literary sensibility, which greatly bolstered the 
level of restaurant criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Reichl is still adjusting to the pace of life at a big  
corporate office, which means long hours -- but also not dining out 
every night to survey restaurants, and that means more time to 
spend with her husband and 10-year-old son. In fact, one recent 
evening, Reichl was looking forward to going out to dinner, her 
first meal out in more than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must be the longest stretch I've done without going out to  
dinner in 23 years,'' she says. ``I miss my friends.''

<HEADLINE> Few Changes in All-Century Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There were almost no changes this week in the  
voting for baseball's All-Century team, with Pete Rose still in the 
ninth and final outfield spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Active players Roger Clemens, Ken Griffey Jr. and Cal Ripken  
were among the leaders in totals through Aug. 9. Fans vote for the 
top two players at each infield position, nine outfielders and six 
pitchers, a total of 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Aaron (252,074) led outfielders, followed by Babe Ruth  
(249,877), Ted Williams, (243,961), Willie Mays (242,883), Joe 
DiMaggio (229,303), Mickey Mantle (216,833), Ty Cobb (168,328), 
Griffey (142,072) and Rose (133,140), who was banned from baseball 
and the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The top nine outfielders retained their positions from the first  
week of totals released Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Clemente (122,006) moved past Stan Musial (121,830) into  
10th place, followed by Shoeless Joe Jackson (70,164), Reggie 
Jackson (64,588), Tony Gwynn (50,476), Carl Yastrzemski (48,762) 
and Frank Robinson (46,124). 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn got his 3,000th hit last Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Nolan Ryan (217,833), inducted into the Hall of Fame last month,  
increased his lead at pitcher from about 500 votes to more than 
6,000 ahead of Sandy Koufax (211,718). They were followed by Cy 
Young (188,729) and Bob Gibson (122,707). 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens (105,452) overtook Walter Johnson (100,171) for sixth.  
Next came Greg Maddux (92,634), Satchel Paige (86,338), Steve 
Carlton (84,820), Warren Spahn (72,460) and Tom Seaver (71,381). 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Bench (216,522) led catchers, followed by Yogi Berra  
(156,003) and Carlton Fisk (69,406). Roy Campanella (52,037) moved 
past Josh Gibson (49,503) into fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Gehrig (262,321) topped all players. He was trailed at first  
base by Mark McGwire (112,632), who hit his 500th home run last 
week, and Jimmie Foxx (73,986). 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Robinson (174,444) was ahead at second base, followed by  
Rogers Hornsby (135,638), Joe Morgan (128,075) and Rod Carew 
(93,172). 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken led shortstops at 150,832. Ozzie Smith (129,462) moved  
ahead of Ernie Banks (128,384) into second, and Honus Wagner 
(112,048) was fourth 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Schmidt (181,899) was tops among third basemen, trailed by  
Brooks Robinson (164,783) and George Brett (146,622), who was also 
inducted into the Hall of Fame last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting, which is sponsored by MasterCard International, runs  
through Sept. 15 and the team will be announced before the World 
Series opener. If there are oversights in balloting, a panel could 
be authorized to add up to five players to the team.

<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Suspected railroad killer Angel Maturino  
Resendiz has been indicted on murder and other felony charges in 
the death of a University of Kentucky student. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendiz, 40, is suspected of nine slayings in Kentucky, Texas  
and Illinois. The drifter from Mexico already has been charged with 
multiple counts of murder in Texas and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Fayette County prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty  
for Resendiz, who was indicted Monday by a Fayette County grand 
jury for the 1997 slaying of Christopher Maier, 21, and the rape 
and beating of his girlfriend on railroad tracks near the Kentucky 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury charged him with murder, attempted murder,  
first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree robbery.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Visits New York City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton is winding up her  
monthlong series of ``listening tour'' events right on her likely 
rival's home turf. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady, who said the tour would help her decide whether  
to run for the U.S. Senate from New York in 2000 -- probably against 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani -- was meeting potential voters today at a 
union building in Queens to discuss balancing work and family. Then 
she's going on vacation with her family. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, she visited a Brooklyn church, where the discussion  
centered on crumbling, overcrowded and violent schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your candidacy is a great opportunity to re-vision  
education,'' said the Rev. Emma Jordan-Simpson of Concord Baptist. 
``We'd like to spend time creating after-school programs and not 
chasing money to fund those programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speakers welcomed Mrs. Clinton as ``our senator'' and  
``senator-to-be.'' She, in turn, brought greetings from Eleanor 
Roosevelt, who she said had also visited the Brooklyn neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``As some of you know, I talk to her from time to time and she  
asked me to say hello,'' she joked, referring reports she had 
participated in seances with the former first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	On her first ``listening tour'' visit to the city, Mrs. Clinton  
started by doing the talking. 
</P>
<P>
	She said a $792 billion Republican tax-cut plan would only  
further jeopardize education programs affecting New York's public 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city alone could lose as many as 4,000 desperately needed  
teachers,'' she said. In schools such as Brooklyn's Midwood High 
School, built for about 3,000 students but serving about 4,100, she 
said a tax cut of that size would be ``an irresponsible, damaging 
plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 90-minute discussion focused almost entirely on education  
problems, especially those linked to crime and lack of funds to 
sustain after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I look deep into the reservoir of your eyes, I feel you  
can make a difference,'' said Adelaide Sanford, an educator in the 
Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, the latest stop in the first 
lady's summer-long ``listening tour'' of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineer Ernest Greene, a parent and lifelong resident of the  
area, said basic skills are often badly taught in crumbling schools 
with problems like malfunctioning heating, plumbing and 
``nonexistent air-conditioning systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also criticized congressional Republicans who  
recently defeated gun-control legislation that she said could help 
diminish violence among youth. She claimed 13 young people are 
killed by firearms in America every day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood is heavily minority and  
Democratic, an area likely to support her likely candidacy against 
the city's Republican mayor, Giuliani. Neither Mrs. Clinton nor 
Giuliani have formally said they're running. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady, a likely Democratic candidate in 2000 for the  
seat of retiring U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, started the 
invitation-only ``listening'' events in July.

<HEADLINE> ABA Head Decries Lack of Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Not enough members of racial and ethnic  
minorities are lawyers, the new president of the American Bar 
Association said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our society is increasingly racially and ethnically diverse,  
but our profession is not,'' William G. Paul of Oklahoma City said 
as he assumed leadership of the nation's largest lawyers' group. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty percent of Americans are members of racial or ethnic  
minorities, but the nation's lawyers are 92 percent white, Paul 
said. The legal profession's ethnic mix is expected to fall further 
behind in the next 50 years if current trends continue, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``The legal profession must reflect the general society,''  
because it ``is the connecting link between the rule of law and the 
people,'' Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even among lawyers, there is disagreement about fairness:  
overwhelmingly, black lawyers say the system is not fair, while 
white lawyers say that, for the most part, it is,'' Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ABA will work to encourage more members of minority  
groups to become lawyers and to spur the hiring of more minority 
people as law clerks to federal and state judges. Clerking for a 
judge can be an important career steppingstone for a young 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The bar association will create a scholarship fund to help more  
racial and ethnic minorities go to law school, Paul said. More than 
$300,000 has been pledged to the fund, which has a goal of raising 
$1 million during the first year. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul said he will organize a group of law school deans to  
examine diversity in law schools by looking at admission tests and 
schools' efforts to retain minority students who enroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, corporate lawyers and private attorneys will be asked to  
study efforts around the country that have successfully boosted 
diversity in the profession, Paul said.

<HEADLINE> Expos' Ballpark Plans Move Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Negotiations are progressing on a deal between the  
Montreal Expos and the Canadian government that would allow the 
team to buy land for a downtown stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time since negotiations began, we are really on  
the same wavelength,'' Gord McIvor, a spokesman for the government 
agency. Canada Lands Corp., said Tuesday. ``It's the first time we 
can say there's been real progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal, last in the major leagues in attendance with a 9,556  
average going into Tuesday night's game, has said it may have to 
explore moving unless it gets a new ballpark to replace Olympic 
Stadium, built for the 1976 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the land wasn't revealed Tuesday but Montreal La  
Presse reported last week that Expos chairman Jacques Menard's 
group hoped to purchase an area a block south of the Molson Centre, 
home of the NHL's Canadiens, for $16 million-$18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Menard told radio station CKAC he expects to get the go-ahead  
soon from commissioner Bud Selig for a new ownership group. Menard 
says he is close to raising $50 million in local investment and is 
close to finalizing a $75 million investment from Jeffrey Loria, a 
New York art dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Any sale would have to be approved by at least three-quarters of  
NL owners and a majority of AL owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We met with the people from major league baseball two weeks  
ago in New York and they seemed satisfied with our plans,'' said 
Menard, adding that 19 versions of the plan were submitted before 
baseball officials agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Menard heads a group of dissident members of the team's  
ownership consortium that resisted pressure to sell and move the 
31-year-old franchise, which might be pursued by groups in northern 
Virginia and Charlotte, N.C.

<HEADLINE> Animation Business Moves Eastward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POWELL, Ohio (AP) -- Peeking into Hugo Giraud's office cubicle, a  
visitor might think he's getting ready to attend a movie, not help 
make one. 
</P>
<P>
	Perched on a shelf are ``Star Wars'' and ``Austin Powers''  
action figures. Giraud, 26, wears a casual shirt, denim shorts, 
baseball cap and five o'clock shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	Giraud is one of the 25 employees of Character Builders, an  
independent animation studio that offers filmmakers and advertisers 
direction, production, character design and things much more 
technical. 
</P>
<P>
	Character Builders worked on the 1996 Warner Bros. movie ``Space  
Jam'' and Nickelodeon's popular animated cable TV series ``Ren and 
Stimpy.'' But while most of its clients are in Hollywood, the 
company's office sits on a wooded hillside in this small community 
just north of Columbus. The Ohio capital has become a training 
ground for film industry computer graphics innovators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still amazing to us that we're in the Midwestern U.S.,''  
said co-founder and executive vice president Martin Fuller. ``But 
making a feature film has become so decentralized that we can play 
a significant role and still have the quality of life that having 
our families in Ohio gives us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faxes, modems, teleconferencing and overnight delivery services  
are as important to the company as paper and pencils. 
</P>
<P>
	Character Builders was founded in 1986 by Jim Kammerud, a former  
editorial cartoonist in Virginia; Jeff Smith, who has since left 
the company to develop the comic book ``Bone''; and Fuller, an Ohio 
State University film school graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	The university has a unique program that combines computer  
science and graphics with engineering and the arts, said Wayne 
Carlson, director of Ohio State's Advanced Center for Computing in 
the Arts and Design. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I watch a movie, I spend more time watching the credits  
than the movie to gloat over the names of former students,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them is Doug Roble, who earned a doctorate in computer  
science from Ohio State in 1993 and is now a software engineer with 
Digital Domain of Los Angeles, a company partly owned by James 
Cameron, the Oscar-winning director of ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roble, 36, won a technical Academy Award this year for a program  
that allows filmmakers to easily integrate computer graphics with 
live action. It was used in ``Apollo 13,'' ``Titanic'' and 
``Armageddon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to come to L.A. to make movies, it's just a fact. But  
you don't have to start in L.A. to make movies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Light, who holds bachelor's and master's degrees from Ohio  
State in fine arts and art in cinema, respectively, is a supervisor 
for George Lucas' Industrial Light &AMP; Magic, which did the computer 
effects for ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Light specializes in motion capture, a process by which a  
computer records the movement of a performer in a special suit, 
enabling the creation of computer generated characters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It allows us to fill in the background of big battle scenes  
and make it believable,'' said Light, who taught and did research 
at Ohio State before joining ILM. Fuller was one of his students. 
</P>
<P>
	At Character Builders, animators and producers are always  
working, since a full-length animated feature film takes about two 
to three years to produce, and there are deadlines along the way, 
executive producer and general manager Leslie Hough said. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Character Builders is given a script, then animators draw  
each scene, all of which must be cut to proper length before 
animation can begin. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a live action film, you would go out and shoot each scene  
from a bunch of different angles and then when it's done you go 
edit all the pieces together,'' Hough said. ``In animation, it's so 
expensive and lengthy and tedious to process that before you really 
start animating you have to know exactly every shot in your film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Space Jam'' was about two years of work for 13 minutes of  
movie, said production manager Samantha Tishkosf, who oversees the 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Character Builders is also looking to develop its own characters  
and working with Nickelodeon on turning ``Bone'' into an animated 
film, Hough said. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves little time for joking around. The office may be  
casual, but animators often work alone in their cubicles -- 
headphones plugged into their favorite music their only way to 
break the silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they say they enjoy working for a company that gives them  
a chance to develop their creativity, individuality and 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody here all has the same opinion: `I can't believe  
they're paying me to do this,''' said Andy Friz, 29, an artist who 
helps the animators. ``One of these days they're going to find out 
and make me do real work.

<HEADLINE> Panel Will Probe Columbine Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A state commission will review the massacre at  
Columbine High School to assess how authorities responded and make 
recommendations about improvements, Gov. Bill Owens announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which will be financed with a $68,800 federal grant,  
will be formed after Jefferson County sheriff's deputies complete 
their investigation into the shooting attack that left 15 dead, 
including the two gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all must work together to ensure that a tragedy like that  
which occurred at Columbine must never happen again,'' Owens said 
in a statement. Emergency response crews, law enforcement agencies 
and SWAT teams received some criticism in the aftermath of the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is not to criticize or blame but to learn lessons  
across the board,'' said Troy Eid, the governor's chief counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, he said, ``some law enforcement agencies were not  
able to communicate with other law enforcement or emergency 
responders because different radios are tuned to different 
frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the types of things the panel will look into is whether  
a new system that allows everyone to communicate on the same 
channel would have been helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new panel, to be composed of 12 experts on law enforcement,  
school safety and public education, will also review the emergency 
medical response and evacuation protocols and techniques used at 
Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	A report will be released to the public.  
</P>
<P>
	Owens announced plans to create the commission as Jefferson  
County school officials paid tribute to Dave Sanders, the only 
teacher killed April 20 when seniors Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan 
Klebold opened fire and hurled bombs in the school. Twelve students 
were killed and 23 others injured. 
</P>
<P>
	As gunfire and explosions echoed through the cafeteria, Sanders  
raced through Columbine's hallways, herding students to safety. 
Shot twice in the chest, he bled to death in a classroom several 
hours later.

	Character Builders is also looking to develop its own characters  
and working with Nickelodeon on turning ``Bone'' into an animated 
film, Hough said.

<P>
	That leaves little time for joking around. The office may be  
casual, but animators often work alone in their cubicles -- 
headphones plugged into their favorite music their only way to 
break the silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they say they enjoy working for a company that gives them  
a chance to develop their creativity, individuality and 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody here all has the same opinion: `I can't believe  
they're paying me to do this,''' said Andy Friz, 29, an artist who 
helps the animators. ``One of these days they're going to find out 
and make me do real work.

<HEADLINE> Hair Shows Jackson Wasn't Poisoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Casting doubt on the long-held belief  
that Andrew Jackson slowly died of mercury and lead poisoning, 
researchers reported today that the president known as Old Hickory 
instead died of kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers analyzed two strands of hair clipped from  
Jackson in 1815 and 1839 and preserved by The Hermitage, his 
Tennessee plantation. 
</P>
<P>
	While the mercury and lead levels found in the hair were  
``significantly elevated,'' they were not toxic, said Dr. Ludwig 
Deppisch, a pathologist with Northeastern Ohio Universities College 
of Medicine and Forum Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The research is published in today's Journal of the American  
Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Historians have long thought that the seventh president died of  
mercury and lead poisoning from two bullets in his body and the 
19th-century medications he took for intestinal problems. He died 
in 1845 at age 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who served from 1829-37, was among the sickest of all  
presidents. Many of his symptoms were consistent with mercury and 
lead poisoning, including excessive salivation, rapid tooth loss, 
colic, diarrhea, hand tremors, irritability, mood swings and 
paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
	Some historians believed Jackson's frequent ingestion of calomel  
(mercurous chloride) and sugar of lead (lead acetate) -- medicines 
he took for intestinal ailments -- caused the symptoms and led to 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fully thought he was going to have mercury poisoning,  
because of his (kidney) failure and neurological and psychiatric 
problems,'' Deppisch said. ``But the hair analysis came back 
proving that he didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers believe that Jackson's elevated mercury level  
was caused by the calomel and that much of the lead came from two 
bullets, one lodged near his heart and the other in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was shot near the heart during an 1806 duel with Charles  
Dickinson but managed to get off a fatal shot. The duel began as an 
argument over a horse race and escalated when Dickinson insulted 
Jackson's wife, Rachel. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was shot in the shoulder during an 1813 fight in  
downtown Nashville with brothers Jesse and Thomas Hart Benton, who 
went on to become a senator from Missouri. The bullet was removed 
in 1832. 
</P>
<P>
	According to biographers, Jackson's health improved after the  
bullet in his shoulder was removed and he stopped using sugar of 
lead, which he described as ``that potent but pernicious remedy to 
the stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers got the hair samples last summer from a collection  
of nine locks of Jackson's hair kept at The Hermitage, where 
Jackson lived most of his later years as an invalid before his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``During Jackson's lifetime, admirers would write to him and  
request a lock of hair,'' Hermitage spokeswoman Carolyn Brackett 
said. ``Over the years, as people would inherit the hair, they 
would send it back to us.''

<HEADLINE> High Expectations Persist for Woods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- It's hard to remember what came first, the  
gaudy expectations or the marketing blitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods was going to be the player to top Jack Nicklaus' 18  
major championships. He'd win 10 green jackets at Augusta. The rest 
of the field would have to settle for second whenever he was 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	It's now year four of the Tiger, and 10 majors have come and  
gone without his name on a trophy. When the 81st PGA Championship 
begins Thursday at Medinah Country Club, though, Woods will be a 
favorite again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm honestly playing pretty good,'' he said  
Tuesday. ``I've played pretty good since the Byron Nelson. My worst 
finish has been seventh, and I'm very positive and feel like my 
game is rounding into shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods may not have won a major since steamrolling through the  
Masters in 1997, but his game has never been better. Since tying 
for seventh in the Byron Nelson in May, he's won three tournaments, 
including a European PGA event. 
</P>
<P>
	His victory in the Western Open last month was his third in four  
tournaments. He leads the PGA in top-three finishes this year with 
six. He dropped to No. 2 in the world this week only because of a 
quirk in the way the rankings are figured. 
</P>
<P>
	Even last year, when he struggled to adjust to changes he made  
in his swing, he held the No. 1 ranking and led the tour with 13 
top-10 finishes despite winning ``only'' one PGA Tour event. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the question of when he's going to win another major and  
start chasing Nicklaus again dogs him. Of the 17 players with five 
majors, all won their second in seven attempts or less. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can do is keep giving myself chances and I've come close  
a couple of times this year,'' said Woods, who had an outside shot 
at the Masters entering the final round, tied for third in the U.S. 
Open and tied for seventh in the British Open. ``You can't win 
every time you're in the hunt. You'd like to, but it just doesn't 
happen that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at Jack's career and Jack finished second in 19 majors.  
How did he feel about losing that many times?'' he added. ``The key 
is to keep giving yourself chances and eventually you're going to 
win a few.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's another thing to remember about Nicklaus, Greg Norman  
said. The intensity of the game has increased tremendously in the 
last 10 years, let alone the last 30. While Nicklaus was popular, 
he didn't have the hordes of people following him wherever he went. 
</P>
<P>
	When Woods won the 1997 Western Open, thousands of people broke  
through the security ropes and followed him up the 18th fairway. 
When he left the interview room Tuesday after a 30-minute 
question-and-answer session, he spent another 20 minutes answering 
questions outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy for us to sit here and say, `Yeah, it's just another  
golf tournament.' You can wrap yourself in a cocoon and say, `I'm 
not going to read the paper.' But it builds up,'' Norman said. 
``Any young individual coming out nowadays has to be an extremely, 
extremely talented individual and have the ability to deal with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The depth of talent Woods faces is tougher than what Nicklaus  
saw, too. Every week, he's playing against guys like David Duval, 
Payne Stewart and Phil Mickelson. And if that's not bad enough, 
some no-name always seems to break out and win one of the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Look at this year's British Open. Winner Paul Lawrie was ranked  
159th and had to qualify to get into the tournament. The guy who 
had the tournament won until a disastrous 18th hole, Jean Van de 
Velde, was 23rd on the European PGA Tour last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it a possibility? Well, yeah,'' Woods said of breaking  
Nicklaus' record. ``How realistic is it? I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he isn't so sure if already having five or six majors on his  
resume would be good for him. The pressures of 1997 were so intense 
that only one other person in the world, his ``big brother'' 
Michael Jordan, could identify. 
</P>
<P>
	But while his struggles with his game weren't easy, and it  
hasn't always been fun to be Tiger Woods, it has all made him a 
better person. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only 23,'' he said. ``I'm glad I went through those things  
because it helped me to get to the point where I am at now as 
quickly as I've gotten there. If I had had success in major 
championships, I probably wouldn't have learned as much. Not only 
on the golf course, but on life in general.''

<HEADLINE> IAAF Could Suspend Sotomayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Javier Sotomayor hasn't given up hope of defending  
his high jump title at the World Championships in Spain this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, who tested positive for cocaine at the Pan American  
Games, faces a possible two-year ban. No suspension has yet been 
imposed, and his status for the World Championships remains 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Giorgio Reineri, spokesman for the International Amateur  
Athletic Federation, said it is up to the Cuban track federation to 
hold a hearing with the two-time world champion and world 
record-holder and decide whether or not to suspend him. 
</P>
<P>
	Track and field's world governing body said Monday that it could  
ban Sotomayor from the Aug. 20-29 championships in Seville, Spain, 
if Cuban officials don't take any action by then. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't act, if they don't suspend the athlete, the IAAF  
can suspend him,'' Reineri said from Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has charged Sotomayor's positive test was part of a larger  
campaign to discredit the Communist government -- possibly by the 
CIA or Miami exiles. It has suggested that the track star's food or 
drink might have been laced with cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban government also raised doubts about tests that showed  
two gold medalist weightlifters -- William Vargas, winner in the 
136.4-pound weightlifting class, and Rolando Delgado, the 152-pound 
class winner -- testing positive for anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the weightlifters, the National Institute of  
Sports, Physical Education and Recreation said Cuban sports 
authorities will launch an investigation ``aimed at clarifying 
whether this is another dirty trick against our country or if this 
anabolic substance really exists in the bodies of said athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The institute said that Cuban sports doctors never use anabolic  
steroids for athletes. ``In capitalist societies they are commonly 
used in professional sports and are distributed without any 
limitation,'' the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said the IAAF Council, the world federation's  
decision-making body, could suspend Sotomayor at its meeting in 
Seville next Monday. One of the council members is former Olympic 
800-meter champion Alberto Juantorena, head of the Cuban athletics 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The case gets more complicated if the Cubans hold a hearing and  
decide to clear Sotomayor. In that event, the IAAF could be forced 
to let him compete in Seville pending its own review of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, the IAAF can do nothing in the short term,''  
Reineri said. ``The only thing the IAAF can do is review the case 
later and maybe decide to go to arbitration. That takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, any suspension would be retroactive, meaning that  
Sotomayor would be stripped of any medal he won in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a situation occurred at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics when the  
IAAF allowed Australian sprinter Dean Capobianco and Italian high 
jumper Antonella Bevilacqua to compete after their national 
federations cleared them of doping violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The two athletes were later found guilty and suspended by an  
IAAF arbitration panel. Their results from Atlanta, including 
Bevilacqua's fourth-place finish, were wiped off the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very political case,'' Reineri said. ``It's not a  
normal doping case. There are different sensibilities at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Monday in the Italian sports daily La Gazzetta  
dello Sport, Sotomayor continued to proclaim his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tests can be manipulated,'' he was quoted as saying from  
his home in Havana. ``Do you think I would need to take drugs, to 
dope myself to jump 2.30 meters? In warmups, I was jumping 2.25. 
Anyway, it would be crazy to dope myself at the Pan American 
Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor said he was continuing to train daily and would travel  
to Madrid on Aug. 14 to await word on whether he can compete in 
Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apart from the death of my coach Jose Godoy, the positive test  
is the worst thing that has ever happened to me,'' he said in a 
separate interview in the French daily L'Equipe. ``I have the 
impression that the sky fell on me.''

<HEADLINE> Space Station Illnesses Downplayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Stale air may have caused headaches,  
nausea and dry, itchy eyes for astronauts visiting NASA's new space 
station, but the doctor who was there downplayed the seriousness of 
the ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it was no big deal,'' Dr. Daniel Barry said. ``I  
don't think we had any more nausea on this flight than you would 
typically have on a flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry says the symptoms were so fleeting, and so benign, that  
neither he nor his six crewmates reported their illnesses until a 
couple of weeks after they returned to Earth -- to the dismay of 
NASA, which now may never be able to diagnose the problem. The 
space agency is changing guidelines for future crews. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry says it's impossible to know whether the crew was sickened  
by stagnant air or chemical fumes inside the international space 
station as some reports suggest, or whether it was simply prolonged 
space motion sickness. His own stuffy nose and headaches, for 
example, were no worse than what he experienced on a previous 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Any indication by NASA officials or others that the crew was  
very sick is ``way overblown,'' Barry told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry insists he would have intervened if someone was really  
sick. The astronauts were warned before their May 27 launch about 
possible atmosphere problems aboard the space station, and so Barry 
kept close watch over his crewmates. 
</P>
<P>
	When ill, the astronauts simply retreated to the docked space  
shuttle Discovery and relaxed or had lunch, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is taking the matter seriously. A team has been appointed  
to evaluate the air inside the space station and help prevent 
future visitors from becoming ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronauts are not due back at the space station until December.  
The first permanent crew doesn't move in until March. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation is especially difficult because none of the  
astronauts were wearing medical sensors and none of them took air 
samples when they became ill. As a result, NASA has to rely on 
anecdotal information, said Jim Van Laak, deputy manager of space 
station operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Space flight can be quite uncomfortable for some people'' even  
under the best of circumstances, Van Laak said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA refuses to elaborate on the illnesses or identify who got  
sick, citing medical privacy. But in a seven-page internal report 
obtained and published last month by an independent Web site called 
NASA Watch, the space agency listed the medical problems and 
possible causes. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S., Russian and Canadian crew spent less than 3 1/2 days inside  
the station at the end of May and beginning of June, making repairs 
and stocking its two rooms with supplies. The station had been 
sealed since the last shuttle visit six months earlier; the first 
crew reported no health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Russian module containing air purifiers and other  
life-support equipment had yet to arrive -- its much-delayed launch 
is off until November -- systems aboard Discovery were used to 
cleanse the station atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Air in the station was routed to the shuttle and back again, and  
it's possible a duct could have been blocked, Van Laak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the astronauts used handheld fans and limited their  
time in the Russian control module Zarya -- one astronaut used a 
timer to alert her when to leave -- carbon dioxide still may have 
built up. Unlike on Earth, exhaled carbon dioxide does not float 
away in space. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry said he could tell the air was stale when all seven  
gathered for pictures in the U.S.-built chamber, Unity. In 
retrospect, he wishes he would have taken air samples then. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew collected air samples only twice, just as they were  
supposed to: when they entered and left the station. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is requesting more air samples on future flights,  
especially when astronauts feel sick. Managers also are asking 
crews to promptly report any illnesses, and are considering 
individual carbon-dioxide monitors -- a recommendation from Barry.

Wednesday, while Japanese stocks fell moderately following an 
overnight decline on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.82 yen in early trading, down 0.06 yen

<HEADLINE> Will Lloyd's of London Modernize? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lloyd's of London denied a report Tuesday that its  
chief executive is considering a radical modernization that would 
turn the insurance market, structured on mutual ownership, into a 
profit-making company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph reported that Nick Prettejohn, who became  
chief executive of Lloyd's three months ago, is considering 
transforming it into a company within three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a step would mean the abandonment of Lloyd's traditional  
mutual structure, a step known as demutualization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective is to create a market in which businesses can  
thrive,'' Lloyd's said in a statement. ``To achieve this, we are 
looking at all sorts of ways in which we can modernize the way the 
market does business. However, demutualization is not currently 
being discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's best-known insurance market -- which started in a  
coffee house run by Edward Lloyd -- has been owned for some 300 
years by the Lloyd's Society, which is made up of 4,900 Names, 
mostly private individuals, who provide the money for underwriting 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Telegraph cited unidentified sources at Lloyd's as saying a  
modernizing faction in the market was pressuring Prettejohn and 
that transforming Lloyd's into a private firm was his preferred 
option. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here now is a collection of international  
businesses which are a national asset and I don't think they should 
continue to be tarred by an antique brush,'' Prettejohn was quoted 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a modernization plan would come on the heels of a similar  
move by the London Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The management board of Britain's largest stock market said July  
30 that it plans to end the exchange's 240-year status as a 
member-owned organization and transform it into a company 
controlled by shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd's acknowledged the pressure for such a move, even while  
denying some of the details in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of people within the Lloyd's membership have  
suggested demutualization as an option worth examining, given the 
demutualization of a number of exchanges including the London Stock 
Exchange,'' Lloyd's said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Prettejohn will present a plan next month  
that would include ways to loosen a requirement making those 
seeking insurance go through a Lloyd's broker. This proposed change 
would give overseas customers cheaper and easier access to 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lloyd's spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
such a change could be one of the first steps taken to modernize 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The government must approve any radical change at Lloyd's.

<HEADLINE> Portland WNBA Team Picks Hargrove </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Eight months after Linda Hargrove's trip  
to Portland was canceled -- along with her job, her team and 
everything else in the American Basketball League -- she arrived in 
the city for a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove was introduced as coach and general manager of the  
Portland Trail Blazers' expansion WNBA franchise Tuesday, returning 
to professional women's basketball for the first time since the ABL 
folded last December. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the fans of the WNBA Portland franchise to be as proud  
of our team as you all are of the Blazers,'' Hargrove said at a 
news conference, dressed in a business suit of Blazers red, black 
and white. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, a college coach for 26 years in Kansas, took over the  
ABL's Colorado Xplosion for the 1998 season. The team started 5-8, 
but had won three of four heading into Christmas break. Hargrove 
was looking forward to a nationally televised game against the 
Portland Power on Dec. 27. But on Dec. 22, the league unexpectedly 
announced it was filing for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the most devastating things I've ever  
experienced,'' she said Tuesday. ``I'm sure a lot of people in 
Portland can relate to that. There's always going to be an ABL 
hurt. There's players who put their heart and soul into that 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-team WNBA, now in its third season, took in 37 players  
from the ABL. The WNBA, backed by the marketing muscle of the NBA, 
will expand to 16 teams for 2000. The other new teams will be 
Miami, Indianapolis and Seattle. None of the teams has a name or 
logo yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Portland and Seattle have hired front office personnel.  
Seattle chose former Power coach Lin Dunn as its coach and general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still not decided how many players the existing WNBA teams  
will be able to protect for next year's draft, or where the 
expansion teams will be placed in the draft order. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ABL fizzled, Hargrove stayed in Denver for two months,  
then returned to her home in Wichita, Kan., to take a job with the 
city. But she stayed involved with women's pro basketball, 
evaluating talent for the WNBA's Orlando Miracle and helping the 
team with the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, who signed a three-year contract with Portland, said  
she was contacted by the other expansion teams. She praised 
Oregon's tradition of support for women's basketball, from high 
school through the Power's short history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Northwest is a really exciting place to be if you're a  
women's basketball fan,'' she said. ``I've long believed that a 
competitive spirit is not gender-specific, and I think that by 
bringing this franchise to Portland, young women will grow up with 
the understanding that it's OK to be athletic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, 49, brought the Wichita State program back to life,  
leading the Shockers to six straight Missouri Valley Conference 
postseason appearances in nine seasons. In 17 seasons at Cowley 
Community College in Arkansas City, Kan., her teams went 316-112. 
</P>
<P>
	Blazers president and general manager Bob Whitsitt said Hargrove  
had the passion and work ethic he was looking for. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a 12-month-a-year job for her,'' he said. ``This is  
not four months and `I'll see you next March.' ''

<HEADLINE> Unusual Weather Blamed on Ocean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The nation's weather seems out of whack, with  
unusually cool temperatures in the West and stifling, unrelenting 
heat in the East. The ocean that spawned El Nino and its deadly 
storms may be to blame, an expert says. 
</P>
<P>
	Unusually warm Pacific Ocean temperatures off Asia and  
abnormally cool water off North America are shoving the jet stream 
farther north, Bill Patzert, an oceanographer with NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That keeps the West Coast cool and prevents air masses from  
bumping into each other. And that means no thunderstorms or other 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
	During the El Nino winter of 1997 and 1998, the equatorial  
Pacific was unusually warm and sucked the jet stream -- and storms -- 
southward, Patzert said. California and the Southern tier states 
were pummeled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have a flip-flop situation where the Eastern Pacific is  
very cool,'' he said. ``When the jet stream is farther north -- 
north of the Great Lakes -- it robs the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and 
the Southeast of its normal rainfall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the East and Midwest, a heat wave has been blamed for scores  
of deaths in 18 states. Crops are withering and forest fires 
erupting as a drought persists. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest phenomenon, observed by the U.S.-French  
Topex-Poseidon satellite, may be an effect of La Nina, a pool of 
cool water along the equator. La Nina developed after the 
1997-1998's El Nino, or unusually warm water along the equator. 
</P>
<P>
	Patzert and his colleagues used Topex/Poseidon's readings of the  
ocean's height from to calculate the ocean's temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacific, which covers 45 percent of the Earth, fuels the  
weather across North America as water and wind mix along its vast 
surface. The complex interaction affects not only ocean 
temperatures but also air moisture and storm paths over the 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts aren't so sure about Patzer's theory.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the North Pacific is playing a role, but how big a  
role it is -- especially in the summertime -- we don't know,'' said 
Robert Livezey, senior research meteorologist for the National 
Climate Prediction Center in suburban Washington, D.C. ``It's an 
open question.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Mobley Gets Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker John Mobley  
will have to do 24 hours of community service and undergo an 
alcohol evaluation following his car accident last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobley pleaded guilty to driving while ability impaired,  
careless driving, and driving without a valid driver's license 
during a hearing in Douglas County Court on Tuesday, said Michael 
Knight, spokesman for the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobley originally faced more serious charges, but Knight said  
Mobley's plea agreement is not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't receive anything special,'' Knight said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mobley flipped his 1997 Jaguar on June 23 in suburban Douglas  
County, about 30 miles southeast of Denver. He initially was 
charged with driving under the influence, driving carelessly and 
driving under a suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a blood-alcohol level of 0.139 at the time. A driver in  
Colorado is presumed drunk at 0.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his agreement with the court, Mobley will be on probation  
for one year and must perform the 24 hours' community service, half 
of that for Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
	He must also pay $553 in fines and costs and undergo an alcohol  
evaluation and any recommended treatment.

<HEADLINE> Rail Killing Suspect Indicted in Ky. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Suspected railroad killer Angel Maturino  
Resendiz has been indicted in the 1997 killing of a University of 
Kentucky student, and he now faces charges in seven slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Fayette County prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty  
for Resendiz, who was indicted Monday by a grand jury in the 
slaying of Christopher Maier, 21, on railroad tracks near the 
Kentucky campus. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was charged with the rape and beating of Maier's  
girlfriend. The couple were walking back to campus from a party. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have linked the rail-riding Mexican drifter, who  
went by the alias Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, to a total of nine 
slayings. He is now charged with seven, including two in Illinois 
and four in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	His first trial is scheduled for Feb. 14 in the slaying of a  
Houston-area doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendiz surrendered to authorities last month, ending a  
nationwide manhunt, after his sister brokered an arrangement with 
the Texas Rangers.

<HEADLINE> Romania Prepares for Eclipse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMNICU VALCEA, Romania (AP) -- In the rolling hills of central  
Romania, a soothsayer prepared Tuesday to chase out the demons of 
greed and scientists made final adjustments on their telescopes in 
expectation of the last solar eclipse of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will ring bells and make loud noises to scare away the bad  
spirits,'' said Gheorghe Tugui, repeating an ancient Romanian 
legend about eclipses. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the moon is expected to totally eclipse the sun in  
Romania. In Ramnicu Valcea, a city of 100,000 about 100 miles 
northwest of Bucharest, the eclipse will be seen for two minutes 
and 23 seconds -- the longest anywhere on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The eclipse will actually start in southern England at 11:10  
a.m. (6:10 a.m. EDT). The moon's shadow will then sweep eastward 
across northern France, Germany, Austria and Yugoslavia and Hungary 
before reaching Romania. Bulgaria is next followed by Turkey, Iraq, 
Iran, Pakistan and India before dying in the Bay of Bengal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of scientists from the United States, Japan and Britain  
have descended on this nondescript industrial and mining city to 
view the natural phenomenon. On Tuesday, the group was busy making 
last-minute equipment checks, more concerned with their telescopes 
and lenses than evil spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	For Tugui, evil spirits are daily trade. He traveled hundreds of  
miles from the far north of Romania to sell ghoulish Dracula masks 
in Ramnicu Valcea during the eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
	At countryside festivals, the masks are thrown into a fire to  
cast out demons and atone for people's sins. But with few tourists 
around and the masks going for a hefty $31 for Romanian pockets, 
trade was slow Tuesday in the searing midday sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Tugui, 54, said his energy to rid the world of evil was  
unabated. 
</P>
<P>
	A few miles away in the Govora monastery run by Romanian  
Orthodox nuns, the sisters agreed that greed has driven a wedge 
between God and man, but dismissed the popular belief that the 
eclipse is a portent of doom. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no use in worrying,'' said Mother Hurvima, 45. ``We  
are not interested in the eclipse. The end of the world will come 
when it comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watering red and white geraniums at the 17th century monastery,  
another nun said the eclipse was a scientific phenomenon. ``And 
science is from God,'' she declared firmly. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have other worries, such as Wednesday's weather  
forecast. Skies were hazy Tuesday and forecasters warned that a 
bank of clouds was headed this way from Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very concerned about the weather,'' said Dr. Jay  
Pasachoff, director of the Hopkins Observatory at Williams College 
in Williamstown, Mass. ``All our experiments are completely 
dependent on the weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists will carry out four experiments on solar heating, the  
sun's corona and the sun's magnetic field, funded by NASA, the 
National Geographic Society and the U.S. National Science 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists have set up computers, telescopes and digital  
cameras on the roof of a downtown hotel. They are worried that loud 
music from a rock concert planned during the eclipse could 
interfere with their calibrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're beginning to wish we didn't come here,'' Pasachoff said  
as loud music played nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to such concerns, city officials promised to order a  
pause in the music for an hour Wednesday, coinciding with the time 
of the total eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
	For officials in the city, rarely visited by outsiders, the  
eclipse is a chance for their community's day in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``The eclipse is a happy occasion for us not to be anonymous  
anymore,'' Mayor Sorin Zamfirescu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotels are jammed, and thousands of eclipse chasers are expected  
to arrive in recreational vehicles to view the eclipse.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Fed President Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of  
Dallas said Tuesday that strong economic growth won't necessarily 
rekindle inflation as long as it is driven by technology and 
improved productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert McTeer -- one of the members of the Fed who set interest  
rates -- said that with a 2 percent gain in productivity, economic 
growth could hit 4 percent without causing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sustaining a 2 percent to 3 percent growth rate in  
productivity in the near future seems very doable to me,'' McTeer 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. productivity grew in that range late last year and early  
this year but slowed to 1.3 percent in the second quarter. McTeer 
said, though, that he believes official estimates may understate 
productivity in the all-important service sector. 
</P>
<P>
	McTeer, who made the comments to a Greater Dallas Chamber of  
Commerce gathering, is a voting member of the Federal Open Market 
Committee, the Fed's interest rate-setting body. 
</P>
<P>
	McTeer did his best to give no hint of whether the Fed will  
raise key interest rates at its Aug. 24 meeting, and he declined to 
say whether financial markets have overreacted to recent signs of 
inflation, including reports showing wage costs on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	McTeer said he didn't want to ``second-guess'' the reaction of  
stock and bond markets, but added that he attached most importance 
to direct measures of inflation. McTeer noted that the consumer 
price index, the broadest measure of price increases at the 
consumer level, has not increased since the last open-market 
committee meeting June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, it's not likely that (a flat CPI) can continue, but we've  
already seen that strong growth doesn't necessarily lead to higher 
inflation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fundamental changes of the past 20 years including deregulation  
and corporate restructuring have upset old ways of thinking about 
the economy, such as the belief that growth led inexorably to 
inflation, McTeer added.

<HEADLINE> Five Grand Slams in One Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On a grand night for hitters, pitchers got slammed.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in 129 years of major league baseball, five  
grand slams were hit in one day. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Tatis of the St. Louis Cardinals and Jose Vidro of the  
Montreal Expos got it started Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Mike Lowell of the Florida Marlins connected, Bernie  
Williams of the New York Yankees followed and Jay Buhner of the 
Seattle Mariners set the record. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner was unaware of the record.  
</P>
<P>
	``I did? That's cool. Right on!'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Four grand slams were hit in one day many times since major  
league baseball began in 1871, but never five. The last time four 
were hit was July 28, 1998, when Sammy Sosa, Gabe Alvarez, Darrin 
Jackson and Ray Lankford connected. 
</P>
<P>
	This has been a season of slams in the big leagues. The five  
raised the majors' total to 96 -- the record of 141 was set in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not necessarily the quality or lack of quality of  
pitching, it's the style,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``I 
think pitchers do not want the guy to hit the ball, so it's ball 
one, ball two and then you've got to come down the middle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After becoming the first player to hit two slams in the same  
inning on April 23 at Los Angeles, Tatis hit the third of his 
career on Billy Brewer's first pitch in the fourth inning during a 
12-6 win at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	With three slams this year, Tatis tied Jim Bottomley (1925) and  
Keith Hernandez (1977) for the Cardinals' record. Tatis is 7-for-10 
with 22 RBIs when hitting with the bases loaded this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Vidro connected on his first pitch from Carlos Almanzar in the  
sixth inning of the Expos' 8-0 win over visiting San Diego. It was 
his first grand slam in the majors and Montreal's first since last 
Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell hit his first career grand slam on a 3-1 pitch in the  
eighth inning against San Francisco's John Johnstone, who had just 
relieved starter Livan Hernandez. The home run tied the score at 4,

	Williams' sixth career slam came at Oakland on a full-count  
pitch by reliever Mike Oquist, capping an eight-run second inning

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Gives Carter Top U.S. Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton looked a bit startled when his  
only living Democratic predecessor, Jimmy Carter, talked 
enthusiastically about the time ``in a few months'' when Clinton 
will join the small fraternity of ex-presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, who last year called the Monica Lewinsky impeachment  
scandal an embarrassment, received the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom from Clinton in a ceremony Monday at the human rights 
organization Carter established after leaving the White House 
nearly 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But before Clinton clasped the medal around his neck, Carter  
ribbed Clinton about the not-too-distant future, when Clinton can 
play golf unmolested by news cameras -- ``Isn't that great?'' Carter 
exclaimed ---- and work on setting up his own namesake library or 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning serious, Carter said he left the White House at about  
the same age Clinton will be when he leaves office after the 2000 
elections, and was at a loss as to his next step. 
</P>
<P>
	``We left Washington in something of despair, and embarrassment,  
disappointment and frustration,'' Carter said as he looked out at 
an audience that included many of his former staff, including press 
secretary Jody Powell and chief of staff Jack Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had come to praise Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, as  
partners in peace and democracy, and to award them each the 
nation's highest civilian honor. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke admiringly of the Carters' partnership in and out of  
the White House, and called Carter a man of peace who used his 
retirement from politics to help poor people at home and promote 
democracy abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter have done more good things for more  
people in more places than any other couple on the face of the 
Earth,'' Clinton said during a brief tribute at the Carter Center, 
which works to improve health and sends observers to monitor 
elections worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, the 39th president, was recognized for brokering the  
Camp David peace accords, signing the Panama Canal treaty and 
re-establishing normal diplomatic relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Carter was recognized for work to improve mental health  
care and childhood immunization, women's equality and enhanced care 
for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also noted the Carters' work helping to build  
homes for the needy through Habitat for Humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration has sometimes bridled at Carter's  
freelance diplomacy efforts, and had to endure Carter's blunt 
assessment of Clinton's situation as the impeachment drama neared 
its end late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an embarrassment. I hope it's over soon,'' Carter said in  
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter added that in his own election in 1976, ``people were  
looking for a candidate who wouldn't lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will make the same award to former President Gerald Ford  
and seven other people at a separate ceremony in Washington on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, a Republican who was the 38th president, will be  
recognized for ``his honesty and integrity'' and his efforts to 
restore confidence in government after the Watergate scandal led to 
Richard Nixon's resignation, the White House said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the other living former presidents, both Republicans, Ronald  
Reagan has received the award and George Bush has not. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton awarded the medal earlier this year to Former German  
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and former Sen. George Mitchell, who helped 
broker a peace deal in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Leaves Game With Back Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mark McGwire, stuck on 501 career homers  
after passing the historic mark last week, left the St. Louis 
Cardinals' game Tuesday night with tightness in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who thrilled a large crowd at Veterans Stadium with a  
power-hitting show in batting practice, walked in his only at-bat 
against Phillies starter Robert Person. He did not take the field 
for the bottom of the second inning, replaced by Craig Paquette. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals said McGwire left the game as a precaution.  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who leads the majors with 44 homers, hasn't hit one in  
13 at-bats since hitting his 500th and 501st last Thursday against 
San Diego. He was 1-for-10 with no extra-base hits in a four-game 
series at Pittsburgh over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	His longest homerless drought this season was 41 at-bats,  
between his fifth and sixth of the season. He has gone 15 at-bats 
without a homer only five times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who has battled back problems since 1989, missed three  
games last month due to back spasms. During a news conference 
Monday before the opener of this three-game series in Philadelphia, 
McGwire commented that this is the first season since then that he 
hasn't missed at least 10 days because of his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deal with it every day,'' McGwire said.  
</P>
<P>
	He showed no ill-effects during batting practice. With most  
seats in the left-field upper deck filled, McGwire homered on 14 of 
15 swings at one point. A couple of his massive clouts landed 
nearly halfway to the top of the upper deck.

<HEADLINE> Teens Accused of Stockpiling Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Six teen-agers have been arrested on  
charges of stealing and then stockpiling an arsenal of weapons and 
ammunition, including armor-piercing bullets, firearms and 
bayonets. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, ages 14 to 18, are suspected of taking 140 rounds of  
armor-piercing ammunition, 3,500 rounds of Russian and 
Romanian-made ammunition, three firearms and two bayonets from one 
house, and six guns from another. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very scary that 16-year-olds would be in possession of  
one round, much less 4,000 rounds,'' Escambia County sheriff's 
investigator Steve Hardy said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They were arrested recently after investigators found the  
weaponry buried in the woods and hidden on vacant lots. They were 
being held without bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The teens told investigators they were part of the Folk Nation  
gang and were going to use the weapons for gang-related activity. 
Authorities did not specify what plans the group may have had. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators learned about the stockpiled weapons after the  
recent arrest of Nicholas Andrew Davis, 16, on a warrant for 
failing to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
	An affidavit said Davis agreed to cooperate with investigators  
and that Davis said he and Allan L. Richardson, 18, and Cameron S. 
Griggers and Kamal R. Davis, both 17 -- had broken into a home 
sometime July 18 and July 20. Authorities did not release the names 
of the other two teen-agers because of their age. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 1, according to another affidavit, Nicholas Davis and  
Kamal Davis, who are not related, burglarized another home, 
breaking into a gun safe and taking six guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials expect to find more firearms as part of their  
investigation, and more arrests are expected.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Students Are Expelled for Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For all the attention given recent school  
shootings, fewer guns are being taken onto schoolgrounds, federal 
officials said Tuesday, pointing to new figures showing a decline 
in the number of students expelled for having firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	``America's schools should be safe havens for all children. By  
and large we have done a good job of reaching that standard,'' 
Education Secretary Richard Riley said. ``I believe that all of us 
-- parents, educators, students, all citizens -- can look to this new 
school year with hope, not with fear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report came even as a new shooting incident occurred, with  
three young boys among the wounded at a summer camp at a Jewish 
community center in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of students kicked out of school for bringing weapons  
dropped by nearly a third during the 1997-98 school year -- the year 
before the Columbine rampage in Colorado, Riley's department said. 
Fifty states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories 
reported that 3,930 students were expelled for firearms violations 
that year, down from 5,724 weapons-related expulsions in 1996-97. 
There are about 52 million students in U.S. public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Department officials said the expulsion numbers do not  
provide a complete assessment of the problem of students bringing 
guns to school. Many states' numbers for 1996-97 included 
expulsions of all students caught with weapons, not just those 
kicked out for having firearms. And the department asked 
California, Alabama and Tennessee to recheck their data after 
members of Congress raised concerns that not all districts were 
accurately reporting gun incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bill Modzeleski, director of the department's Safe and  
Drug-Free Schools Program, said officials are confident there 
really is a decline in school gun incidents because other surveys 
and reports have similar findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend line is, fewer guns are going into schools,''  
Modzeleski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas schools expelled 424 students and California schools  
kicked out 382 students for gun violations in the 1997-98 school 
year. Wyoming reported no gun-related expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	South Dakota reported the highest rate of gun incidents: 49  
students were expelled, or about three of every 10,000 students. 
Oregon had the second-highest rate, expelling 135 students, or 
about two of every 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon was the site of one of that school year's deadliest  
school shootings, in which 16-year-old Kip Kinkel was charged with 
killing two fellow students at Thurston High School in Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, site of the April 20 shootings at Columbine, reported  
expelling 76 students for gun violations in 1997-98, a rate of 
about one per 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Many schools are not doing enough to respond to the threat of  
violence, said school security officials who joined Riley at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of school districts that do not know what  
they're doing with regard to security,'' said Jack Martin, chief of 
police for Indianapolis public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	But no reasonable security measures could be sure of preventing  
another outbreak like the shootings at Columbine, in which two 
students killed a dozen classmates and a teacher before committing 
suicide, the security officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an event that's beyond predictability,'' said Edward  
Ray, director of security for Denver's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Tuesday, an independent education group released a  
survey suggesting fewer teens feel safe in school. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``State of Our Nation's Youth'' survey by the Horatio Alger  
Association found just one-third of public school students said 
they always feel safe in school, down from 40 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were based on mailed questionnaires returned by  
more than 1,000 teen-agers. The surveys were mailed April 22, two 
days after the Columbine shootings, and Riley and other officials 
said the findings conflicted with other recent student surveys and 
may have been skewed by the timing.

<HEADLINE> Congress Considers Reviving Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Twenty-six years after the last young American  
was drafted, legislation to abolish the Selective Service System is 
quietly advancing in Congress. But a showdown seems certain with 
some lawmakers who suggest a return to military conscription. 
</P>
<P>
	A provision to shut down the 59-year-old agency, which continues  
to register 18-year-old males for a potential military call-up, is 
tucked in a spending bill to be taken up when the House returns 
after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee approved the agency  
termination before the August recess with little debate, which 
surprised many military-minded lawmakers -- and the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no advance warning,'' said Lew Brodsky, the  
service's director of public and congressional affairs. He noted 
Selective Service survived previous tries to abolish it, in 1993 
and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	If endorsed by the full House and the Senate, the move would  
slash the system's current $24.4 million budget by $17. 4 million 
in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, providing only $7 million 
for ``termination costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abolition supporters suggest that, if Congress and the president  
decide to authorize a return to the draft, the system could be 
re-established quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Few on Capitol Hill foresee Congress and the president reviving  
the draft. But there has been a recent increase in demands, 
particularly among Republicans on major military committees, for at 
least consideration of such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services  
Committee, called the military's recruiting and retention problem 
``a desperate situation that keeps getting worse.'' He suggests 
increased peacekeeping deployments such as those in Bosnia and 
Kosovo may force Congress to consider conscription in some form. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Herbert Bateman, R-Va., chairman of the subcommittee on  
readiness, and Steve Buyer, R-Ind., chairman of the military 
personnel subcommittee; and Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C, former 
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, have suggested a 
fresh look at reviving the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the Pentagon says the 1.4 million all-volunteer force  
is sufficient, although it clearly has been losing a battle to 
attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force may fall 2,500 recruits short of its annual goal  
and come up 1,400 pilots short of requirements. The Army may wind 
up 10,000 recruits beneath its full authorization, and the Navy 
projects a shortage of 22,000 sailors. Only the Marine Corps, the 
smallest service that advertises a need for ``a few good men,'' 
seems capable of meeting recruitment goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday the military is  
working hard to deal with recruiting problems, which he blamed on 
the strong national economy. He said the Pentagon still opposes 
returning to the draft, because ``we believe that the all-volunteer 
force now in its 26th year has been a great success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon also was cool to the idea of terminating Selective  
Service, which he said ``provides a good backup, should that be 
necessary someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Nixon let the draft expire in 1973, and registration  
was stopped in 1975 under President Ford. His successor, President 
Carter, reinstated universal registration of male citizens or 
residents between 18 and 25 in 1980 after Soviet troops entered 
Afghanistan. Roughly 13.5 million men are eligible for military 
service should the need arise. 
</P>
<P>
	Any effort to revive the draft would be certain to run into  
ferocious political resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is close to passing the biggest military pay and  
benefits package since 1981, including 4.8 percent salary 
increases, future raises of one-half a percentage point above 
inflation and generous retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers said the package should be given a chance to work.  
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has done its part. Now it's up to the military to do  
a better job of retention,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, 
senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Re-establishing some form of the draft, perhaps with a new  
lottery, where some get called and others don't, could ``destroy 
public confidence'' in government and revive old complaints about 
fairness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Air Force Col. Paul Arcari, director of the Retired Air  
Force Officers Association, said the new compensation package will 
go a long way toward making military pay and benefits more 
competitive. He characterized reviving the draft as ``politically 
unpalatable.'' Anyway, he said, ``if you do have a draft, you can't 
get the kind of people you need to work the sophisticated weapons 
systems of today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a senior member of the Armed Services  
Committee, has speculated about a possible new draft but now has 
views similar to Arcari's. No longer can you ``spend six weeks 
showing a recruit the right end of a gun and send him on his way,'' 
McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reviving the draft would also raise the issue of whether women  
should be included. Women comprise 14 percent of the military and 
serve in virtually all except the most combat-intensive units. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to ``zero out'' Selective Service was led by Rep. James  
Walsh, R-N.Y., chairman of an Appropriations subcommittee that 
oversees independent agencies, mostly to save money without making 
cuts in other areas, said Walsh's chief of staff, Arthur Jutton.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lauds Bicyclist Armstrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton offered the nation's  
congratulations Tuesday to Lance Armstrong, who recovered from 
cancer to win the grueling Tour de France, the world's most 
prestigious bicycle race. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong posed for photographs in the Oval Office with the  
president, then appeared with Vice President Al Gore in the 
Roosevelt Room in a ceremony to honor cancer survivors and call 
attention to successes of cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore hailed the cyclist as an inspiration to cancer survivors  
everywhere and asked the Office of Personnel Management to explore 
offering federal workers time off for cancer screening. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the idea was based on a program offered to Boston city  
workers under which they can take a half-day paid leave each year 
to get checked out for cancer. ``Prevention and early attention can 
save lives,'' the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Armstrong dashed off autographs for a dozen or so  
bicycle messengers who clustered around the new bicycle hero as he 
arrived for a speech at the National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking questions in the club's crowded auditorium, Armstrong  
told an enthusiastic audience the hardest day physically on the 
tour was its first leg over the steep grades and sizzling heat of 
the Pyrenees Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentally, he said, the toughest 24 hours came when he was  
accused -- falsely, he insists -- of taking drugs to enhance his 
strength and endurance after his cancer battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said that after a lifetime of good health -- ``not even  
a broken bone'' -- and years of successful competition, his cancer 
became a supreme endurance test. His testicular cancer invaded his 
bones and brain and was fought with aggressive chemotherapy and 
three operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The attitude of a cancer survivor like himself, he said, is,  
``You've been to hell and back, and you want a vacation for the 
rest of your life. But nobody gives you that. You have to go on 
because you are living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said for him ``going on'' means continuing the work of  
building and expanding the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which he 
founded to promote cancer research and to help cancer victims and 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he intends to compete in the Tour de France through 2001  
and will keep in training until then. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you show up at the Tour de France overweight or out of  
shape,'' he said, ``it doesn't make any difference (what kind of 
bike) you're riding -- you won't win.''

<HEADLINE> Utah's Layden To Be GM of Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Scott Layden, who masterminded Utah Jazz  
personnel moves for 11 seasons, accepted a job Tuesday with the New 
York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is a homecoming for Layden, who was born in New York,  
and transports him from the NBA's smallest market to its largest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes as a really tough decision to move on, but it just  
feels like the right thing to do,'' Layden, 41, said. ``I need to 
move on and grow up a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was clear as soon as Jazz owner Larry Miller sat down, his  
eyes red and welling with tears before a word was spoken, that 
Layden wasn't staying. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a personal, selfish standpoint and from a standpoint of  
wearing my hat as owner of the Jazz, I wish we weren't here today 
talking about this,'' Miller sniffled. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden declined to discuss the Knicks position, saying details  
would come during a news conference Wednesday in New York. He 
likely will be introduced as the successor of fired general manager 
Ernie Grunfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden met last weekend with Madison Square Garden president  
Dave Checketts about the Knicks' general manager's job, which has 
been vacant since Grunfeld was reassigned in April. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Layden met with Miller and other Jazz officials, who  
were unable to convince him to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the one hand, we hate more than I can express to see him  
go,'' Miller said. ``On the other hand, I wish him well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layden said the deciding factor was his family's enthusiasm for  
living in New York. He and his wife, Marsha, are supporters of the 
arts and Layden lived in New York through his teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
	The boyish-faced Layden also said he's eager to prove himself in  
a way he could not in Utah, where he lived in the shadow of his 
father, former coach Frank Layden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've really felt like I've been on the coattails of some  
brilliant people -- coaches, players, owners and the people who work 
in this organization,'' said Layden, who spent 18 years with the 
Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports indicated Layden could be paid about $1.5 million  
in New York, four times his Utah salary. He wouldn't talk about 
money but denied it was the reason he's leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was all about money, I would have moved on long ago,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Utah's vice president of basketball operations, Layden  
developed a reputation as a skilled evaluator of talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Utah's recent second-round draft selections, Bryon  
Russell and Shandon Anderson, contributed greatly to the team's 
runs to the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But Layden also has had trouble making trades, and his signing  
of center Greg Ostertag to a six-year, $39 million contract was 
widely ridiculed around the league. 
</P>
<P>
	There may have been more reasons for Layden to leave than stay.  
For one, the Jazz's aging trio of Karl Malone, John Stockton and 
Jeff Hornacek are each over 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Salt Lake's clean-cut -- some would say boring --  
image. Layden engineered deals in recent years for players like 
Rony Seikaly and Derek Harper, but neither would report. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden denied those factors contributed to his decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``By no means was that the case. This whole thing came up fast  
and it was an opportunity I felt I couldn't pass up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks player personnel director Ed Tapscott has been performing  
the general manager's duties on an interim basis. New York's only 
player moves this offseason were the signing of free agent forward 
John Wallace and the drafting of French center Frederic Weis. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden's departure leaves Utah without its chief negotiator as  
the Jazz try to resign Anderson, a free agent. Stockton and 
Hornacek also are free agents, but both are likely to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah general manager Tim Howells said he will take over talks  
with Anderson's agent. Meanwhile, he said the Jazz have no list and 
no deadline for hiring Layden's successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't something we had anticipated,'' Howells said. ``We  
met with Scott about some potential candidates. We have no 
timeline, but it's something we will be working on with a great 
sense of urgency.''

<HEADLINE> DOE: Plutonium Made Its Way to Tenn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) -- The federal government said Tuesday that  
5,600 tons of uranium contaminated with trace amounts of the more 
radioactive element plutonium were brought here in the 1950s and 
1960s for weapons fuel production. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact on workers and the environment is unknown, but  
Department of Energy officials promised to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelation followed a lawsuit accusing DOE of silently  
exposing workers to plutonium over decades at DOE's uranium 
enrichment plant in Paducah, Ky. The Washington Post reported the 
plutonium eventually contaminated the grounds and spilled into 
nearby streams and a wildlife refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Sunday ordered a medical  
review of current and past workers at Paducah. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he told NBC's ``Today'' show, ``We're looking at  
other plants, at Oak Ridge, to see whether this might have 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of contaminated uranium at Oak Ridge's K-25 site  
represented a small portion of the some 40,000 tons of uranium used 
at the facility between the 1950s and the 1970s, said DOE spokesman 
Steven Wyatt. 
</P>
<P>
	Some workers at Oak Ridge fear they were unwittingly exposed to  
more radiation than they realized. 
</P>
<P>
	Uranium operations at K-25 were shut down in 1985, and some of  
the processing facilities currently are being disassembled and 
cleaned up.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Portrayals Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In their final pre-verdict arguments, the  
federal government and 19 states alleged Tuesday that Microsoft 
Corp. engaged in a broad pattern of unlawful conduct to maintain 
its lucrative ``desktop paradise'' in the computer software market. 
</P>
<P>
	Denying it's a monopolist, Microsoft said the government has  
failed to show that any of its actions hurt consumers and said its 
antitrust suit is ``largely a vehicle for Microsoft's competitors 
to attack Microsoft rather than compete in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the lengthy filings largely repeat claims made in  
earlier legal documents and over 76 days of courtroom testimony, 
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson will base the first 
phase of his two-part verdict -- expected later this year -- on these 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the foundation for everything,'' said Rich Gray, an  
antitrust lawyer in San Jose, Calif., who has been following the 
trial closely. ``They're critically important. If (the sides) can't 
tell their story forcefully at this stage, then they're in 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of the judge's ruling is expected to telegraph  
in many ways the eventual second part of his verdict, which 
probably will come early next year unless the sides settle. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's factual findings also are particularly important  
because appellate courts rarely challenge a trial judge's decisions 
on the facts of a case, but typically focus on his application of 
the law. Experts predict the Microsoft case to wind through appeals 
courts for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's factual findings will be ``much more difficult for  
Microsoft to attack on appeal,'' said Robert Taylor, another 
antitrust lawyer in California's Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending itself against a central claim by the government,  
Microsoft in its 453-page filing argued that it built its Internet 
browser software into Windows for free, to help consumers use the 
Web more effectively - not to force out of business Netscape 
Communications Corp., which was selling similar browser software 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft's actions have produced higher quality Web browsing  
software and operating systems at lower cost to consumers, thereby 
contributing to the explosive growth of the Internet,'' the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a 776-page filing, the government asserted that  
Microsoft's aggressive actions -- such as allegedly pressuring 
computer makers and others against distributing rival software -- 
``distort the pace and direction of innovation in ways that protect 
its monopoly power rather than serving the interests of 
consumers.'' The Justice Department alleges that Microsoft was 
motivated by the fear that Internet software would evolve to the 
point where it made consumers rely less on computers using Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft complained that the government never proved that it  
blocked Netscape from distributing its Internet software from more 
than 40 percent of consumers, a condition the judge had established 
in an earlier ruling. Microsoft also argued that the $10 billion 
purchase of Netscape by America Online Inc. ``provides new avenues 
for the widespread distribution of Netscape's Web browsing 
software.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government responded that AOL, the world's largest Internet  
provider with more than 16 million subscribers, bought Netscape for 
its popular Web site, not to acquire its browser software. It said 
Microsoft ``has signaled to AOL (and other would-be browser rivals) 
that Microsoft will engage in anticompetitive actions to prevent 
the browser threat from arising again.''

<HEADLINE> Florida's Graddy May Be Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida safety Rod Graddy will be  
kicked off the team for driving a car carrying two robbery suspects 
fleeing a crime scene, a source close to the investigation said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on the condition he not be identified,  
told The Associated Press that Graddy was to meet with coach Steve 
Spurrier on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Graddy, a junior from Cuthbert, Ga., had already been suspended  
for five games for violating university policy. He also had been 
suspended one other time for one game for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Jeremy Foley said Tuesday that Graddy's future  
is ``still to be determined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After practice Tuesday, Spurrier stopped short of saying he  
would dismiss Graddy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he's in dire straits,'' Spurrier said. ``He's had  
some problems. I don't know exactly what will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police stopped Graddy's car shortly after a fight outside the  
Florida Theatre nightclub early last Friday. Two passengers in the 
car, Timothy Taylor, 27, and Kenneth James Welch, 19, were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Taylor and Welch took advantage of a ``mob scene'' at  
the club by snatching a $1,200 bracelet off a man who had been 
involved in another fight. Taylor and Welch fled to Graddy's car, 
and then Taylor pointed a gun at two men who had chased him, police 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Graddy said Taylor threw the gun out of the window before police  
pulled the car over. Police recovered the gun and arrested Taylor 
for strong-armed robbery and aggravated battery. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor count of  
accessory after the fact for hiding the bracelet under his seat 
when the car was stopped by police. Graddy was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Graddy started 11 games last season and was third on the team in  
tackles with 75. He was listed as a co-starter at strong safety 
after spring drills, along with sophomore Marquand Manuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Graddy was the only returning starter from last year's defense,  
but Spurrier said he wasn't counting much on him because of the 
suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has made some bad choices,'' Spurrier said. ``When you make  
bad choices, you suffer the consequences.''

<HEADLINE> Branch Davidian Evidence To Be Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- More than 12 tons of charred evidence from  
the ruined Branch Davidian compound must be turned over to the 
federal court clerk here to allow better access to the material, a 
judge has ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. said Monday the U.S.  
Marshals Service would store the evidence gathered by the Texas 
Rangers. The court clerk would become its official custodian. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Department of Public Safety, of which the Rangers are  
a unit, had previously asked to be relieved of responsibility for 
the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers were deputized as federal marshals to investigate  
the botched raid of the Branch Davidian compound on Feb. 28, 1993, 
by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	A 51-day stalemate followed, ending when group leader David  
Koresh and about 80 of his followers died by fire or gunshots after 
the FBI started filling the compound with tear gas. Four ATF agents 
also were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith did not set a time for the transfer of the evidence, now  
held by the Rangers at an Austin site. 
</P>
<P>
	``First and foremost, the parties to civil litigation pending in  
this court have a right to seek access,'' Smith said. ``Second, the 
events that took place between Feb. 28 and April 19, 1993, and 
thereafter, have resulted in sometimes intense interest from the 
national media and members of the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Smith refused to dismiss a wrongful death lawsuit  
filed against the government by surviving Branch Davidians and 
relatives of those who died at the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	One researcher says the evidence may call into question the U.S.  
government's claim that it did not use incendiary devices when it 
moved into the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has denied the allegations by Michael  
McNulty, a documentary filmmaker. Government investigators 
concluded that sect members set the fires. 
</P>
<P>
	McNulty is the maker of the Oscar-nominated documentary ``Waco:  
The Rules of Engagement'' and continues to research the fire. He 
told The Dallas Morning News last month that he found that at least 
six items listed in Ranger inventories as silencers or suppressors 
were actually ``flash-bang'' devices, commonly used by law 
enforcement to stun suspects to make it easier to arrest them. 
</P>
<P>
	McNulty said the devices sometimes ignite fires in enclosed  
spaces because the loud bang and flash they emit are driven by a 
small pyrotechnic charge. The Rangers' evidence logs indicate the 
devices were found in areas of the Davidian compound in which the 
fires broke out, McNulty said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin called the allegations  
``nonsense'' and said they ignore evidence that the fire was set in 
several places at the same time.

<HEADLINE> Baby AIDS Cases Plummet With AZT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The number of babies who got AIDS from their  
mothers dropped by two-thirds between 1992 and 1997, largely 
because of prenatal treatment with the drug AZT, a new study found. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study said it suggests the  
possibility of virtually eliminating mother-to-child HIV 
transmission in the United States, an idea that was almost 
unimaginable a few years ago. However the problem is still 
significant in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a remarkable success story for ... everybody involved  
in caring for these women and the women themselves,'' said the 
study's lead author, Dr. Mary Lou Lindegren, an epidemiologist with 
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have more to go, but we've been dramatically  
successful,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of babies who developed AIDS after being infected  
with HIV before or during birth peaked at 907 in 1992, then 
declined 67 percent over the next five years, to 297 in 1997, the 
researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers believe the number of babies born HIV-infected  
is higher, since it can take years for HIV to develop into AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 32 states collect information on HIV infection in newborns,  
but the CDC estimates that 1,650 babies caught the virus from their 
mothers in 1991, at the epidemic's peak. By 1996, that number had 
fallen to 480, a 71 percent drop, Lindegren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists discovered in 1994 that treatment with AZT, now  
called zidovudine, reduced a newborn's risk of catching HIV from 26 
percent to 8 percent. In that study, the drug was given to 
HIV-infected women during pregnancy and labor and to the newborn 
for the first six weeks of life, said Dr. Lynne M. Mofenson of the 
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, doctors have found that prenatal AZT can actually  
reduce the risk to as low as 3 percent, Mofenson noted in an 
editorial accompanying the study. Delivering at-risk babies by 
Caesarean section lowers the risk further, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, if women are getting treatment with powerful AIDS-fighting  
drug regimens that can reduce virus levels in the blood to 
undetectable amounts, the risk may fall to less than 1 percent, she 
said, citing other research. 
</P>
<P>
	That means virtual elimination of mother-to-child transmission  
in the United States looks possible, Mofenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authors of the new study said zidovudine is the main reason for  
the drop in AIDS cases in newborns, but not the only one. One other 
factor is that the number of babies born to infected women fell 17 
percent during the study period. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest challenge now is reducing mother-to-child  
transmission worldwide. An estimated 1,800 HIV-infected babies are 
born daily in developing countries and the cost of zidovudine has 
kept widespread treatment out of reach there. 
</P>
<P>
	In wealthy countries, HIV-infected pregnant women typically  
receive five months of zidovudine therapy, which can cost more than 
$1,000. Zidovudine is offered in developing countries at up to 75 
percent less than in the West, according to British manufacturer 
Glaxo Wellcome Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes are soaring since African scientists' recent finding that  
a new drug, nevirapine, appears to work better and at far lower 
cost -- an anticipated $4 a dose. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recent demonstration that a two-dose nevirapine regimen as  
well as short zidovudine regimens can reduce perinatal (at-birth) 
transmission brings new hope to developing countries, but 
implementation will be challenging,'' Mofenson wrote.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Downplays GOP Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRUNDY CENTER, Iowa (AP) -- Steve Forbes said Tuesday that the  
tax-cut plan approved by the GOP-controlled Congress last week was 
better than nothing but would not significantly help Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes to a little more than 3 cents on the dollar over ten  
years,'' the GOP presidential hopeful told people who turned out to 
greet him during campaign stops across north-central Iowa. ``And 
yet to hear all the hoopla in Washington, you would think it was 
the most radical and revolutionary thing since 1776. It's pennies 
to the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey publisher has campaigned as a political outsider.  
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa for Saturday's straw poll, he repeatedly poked fun at  
Washington politics, calling the 10-year, $792 billion package 
approved by Congress a ``supposed, great-big tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to ask yourself, at the end of the day, how much of  
that money will actually be returned to you, who earned it in the 
first place'' he said. ``I warn you, don't spend it in advance 
because Washington is ready to spend it in advance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who advocates a flat-tax plan, said the tax-cut proposal  
would do nothing to alleviate people's concerns over the 
complicated U.S. tax system. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Forbes' campaign, which asked audience members at  
each stop to turn out and support him Saturday at the GOP straw 
poll in Ames, announced new help from another Republican campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich of Ohio dropped out of the Republican  
presidential race in July and threw his support behind Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. But three of Kasich's top Iowa campaign staffers, 
including former state director Karen Slifka, said Tuesday they had 
joined the Forbes campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is fast becoming a two-man race and I am personally  
convinced that Steve Forbes is the one true conservative who can 
win,'' Slifka said.

<HEADLINE> Will Lloyd's of London Modernize? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lloyd's of London denied a report Tuesday that its  
chief executive is considering a radical modernization that would 
turn the insurance market, structured on mutual ownership, into a 
profit-making company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph reported that Nick Prettejohn, who became  
chief executive of Lloyd's three months ago, is considering 
transforming it into a company within three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a step would mean the abandonment of Lloyd's traditional  
mutual structure, a step known as demutualization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective is to create a market in which businesses can  
thrive,'' Lloyd's said in a statement. ``To achieve this, we are 
looking at all sorts of ways in which we can modernize the way the 
market does business. However, demutualization is not currently 
being discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's best-known insurance market -- which started in a  
coffee house run by Edward Lloyd -- has been owned for some 300 
years by the Lloyd's Society, which is made up of 4,900 Names, 
mostly private individuals, who provide the money for underwriting 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Telegraph cited unidentified sources at Lloyd's as saying a  
modernizing faction in the market was pressuring Prettejohn and 
that transforming Lloyd's into a private firm was his preferred 
option. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here now is a collection of international  
businesses which are a national asset and I don't think they should 
continue to be tarred by an antique brush,'' Prettejohn was quoted 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a modernization plan would come on the heels of a similar  
move by the London Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The management board of Britain's largest stock market said July  
30 that it plans to end the exchange's 240-year status as a 
member-owned organization and transform it into a company 
controlled by shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd's acknowledged the pressure for such a move, even while  
denying some of the details in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of people within the Lloyd's membership have  
suggested demutualization as an option worth examining, given the 
demutualization of a number of exchanges including the London Stock 
Exchange,'' Lloyd's said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Prettejohn will present a plan next month  
that would include ways to loosen a requirement making those 
seeking insurance go through a Lloyd's broker. This proposed change 
would give overseas customers cheaper and easier access to 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lloyd's spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
such a change could be one of the first steps taken to modernize 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The government must approve any radical change at Lloyd's.

<HEADLINE> GM Plans 'Web Car' for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. says it plans to move more  
aggressively to use the Internet in all facets of its operations, 
from manufacturing through online sales and in-car electronic 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	GM, the world's largest automaker, on Tuesday formed an  
independent unit called ``e-GM'' to coordinate and expand its 
global electronic-commerce activities. A major focus will be 
packaging its cars and trucks with an array of on-board services 
provided via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most significant examples will be the introduction of  
a ``Web car'' with voice-activated Internet access by the end of 
next year. Test-marketing of the car, most likely a Cadillac, will 
begin in the fall, executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has been struggling for years to lure younger buyers as its  
traditional customer base has continued to age. President G. 
Richard Wagoner Jr. said the Internet offers a way to attract young 
consumers even before they're old enough to drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think about the world differently and they're going to be  
our customers,'' he said. ``We don't have a choice but to get in 
the game big time. We think it's got a high payoff and we need to 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within five years, in-car services such as Internet access and  
CD-quality satellite radio broadcasts could generate revenues for 
GM in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion annually, said Ron 
Zarrella, president of GM's North American operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Web car'' will offer Internet access through GM's OnStar  
system, a satellite-based navigation, security and aid service 
introduced in 1996 through Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
	OnStar, through its service center, can provide directions,  
track a car that's stolen, unlock a car when the keys are left 
inside, and summon an ambulance if necessary after an air bag 
deploys. The subscription cost is about $17 or $33 a month, 
depending on the level of services. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is offered today on 31 of GM's 77 models; there are  
75,000 customers. GM has ambitious plans to expand OnStar to most 
of its fleet, making it standard on some models, with a goal of 
signing up 1 million subscribers by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is negotiating to sell the system to other  
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is betting heavily that OnStar will give it a major  
competitive advantage as its cost comes down and its services 
expand. Over the next five years, GM plans to invest more than $1 
billion in OnStar and other e-commerce activities, Zarrella said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG are considering similar  
systems, but spokesmen said the companies were not prepared to say 
when, or if, they would offer on-board Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott McNealy, chairman and chief executive of Sun Microsystems  
Inc., said putting Internet access in a car is a wise move for GM 
because it has such a large, captive audience: millions of 
commuters who spend an average of 80 minutes a day in their GM 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of eyeball hours per day that General Motors captures  
would make NBC or Fox quite jealous, and it's an untapped market,'' 
McNealy said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM already is heavily involved in Internet commerce through its  
BuyPower Web site and more than 100 other company Web sites. But 
executives said they are committed to making GM a true Web-based 
company, expanding its Internet use to reduce costs in 
manufacturing, distribution, sales and service. 
</P>
<P>
	George Colony, president of the Internet-research firm Forester  
Research Inc., estimated that GM could save 5 percent to 10 percent 
of the cost of building a car if it aggressively uses Internet 
technology in dealing with suppliers and elsewhere in manufacturing 
and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Savings also could come from building smaller, more flexible  
assembly plants throughout the country, to make it possible for 
consumers to custom-order and receive their car or truck more 
quickly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The emphasis on e-commerce means GM will have to increase its  
efforts to recast a corporate culture that for decades was 
complacent and plodding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to change GM from being an automotive company that  
moves on an automotive time frame, to an automotive company that 
moves on an Internet time frame,'' said Mark Hogan, who will head 
the new unit. ``To do that, we have to have our employees think 
about things completely differently than the way they think about 
them today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for  
the Study of Automotive Transportation, said GM leadership's 
determination to change the corporate culture in conservative 
Detroit was the most significant aspect of Tuesday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're talking about doing is using the e-commerce  
company to define GM's culture,'' Cole said. ``That's going to 
really ruffle a lot of feathers.''

<HEADLINE> Stevenson Begins Tuneup for US Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Alexandra Stevenson doesn't scare  
easily, whether she's playing the semifinals at Wimbledon or being 
interviewed by Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson's surprising run on the grass in England created a  
buzz about the 18-year-old tennis star that is still following her 
as she plays the Acura Classic, her first U.S. tournament since 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	She faced Walters for a ``20-20'' interview last month, where  
the topic of her father, Hall of Fame basketball player Julius 
Erving, came up. He admitted during Wimbledon that Stevenson is his 
daughter. He has supported her financially, but hasn't seen her 
since she was 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sat down with Barbara and I said, `You know you always make  
everyone cry after 45 minutes, and you're not going to make me 
cry,''' Stevenson said. ``She started laughing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson said her mother, Samantha, became teary-eyed during  
the interview, which annoyed the teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters asked Stevenson if she had heard of retired Gen. Norman  
Schwarzkopf, who's been interviewed by Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think so,'' Stevenson replied.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, he cried on national television,'' Walters told her.  
``Do you think generals cry?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson said no.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, they do and he cried, so nothing's wrong with crying,''  
Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``OK, but I'm not going to cry,'' Stevenson said.  
</P>
<P>
	She showed the same aplomb Monday in talking about her future in  
pro tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, ranked 41st in the world, plays her first-round match  
tonight against 26th-ranked Anke Huber of Germany. The winner faces 
top-seeded Lindsay Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to go out and be tough every match. They're going to be  
gunning for me and I'm going to be gunning for them,'' she said. 
``I have a lot of work ahead of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson insists her life hasn't changed since her splash at  
Wimbledon. She still has the same friends and lives in the same 
apartment with her mother in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest difference is that she's recognized more, including  
being spotted at dinner Sunday by ``this average Joe guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The man told Stevenson he had never watched women's tennis until  
seeing her at Wimbledon, and now he's coming to watch her tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very happy, that made my night,'' she said. ``This is  
good for women's tennis, by the way. We need a sponsor, so maybe 
this will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She'll have another admirer in the crowd at Manhattan Country  
Club. He's 24-year-old Collin Smith, a beach volleyball player she 
met at the recent Pan American Games in Canada, where Stevenson won 
a bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best part of the Pan Am Games was beach volleyball. I met  
two guys there,'' she said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson and Smith had a dinner date scheduled Monday night. He  
planned to watch her play tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a nice person,'' Smith said. ``She's a great athlete and  
it's really cool to hang out with someone who also does what you 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson said she isn't worried about being labeled a flash in  
the pan if she doesn't make an impact at the U.S. Open, the year's 
final Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just the beginning,'' she said. ``I have a lot of  
years.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Germany Bid for World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Brazil brought a squad of soccer  
heroes, and Germany hosted a beer fest at FIFA headquarters as the 
two countries made their bids to host the 2006 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil and Germany were the last of five countries to make their  
pitches on Tuesday for the 2006 World Cup, the most coveted soccer 
event on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Also presenting to the FIFA were South Africa, England and  
Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	After Monday's presentations by South Africa, accessorized by a  
chanting, dancing Zulu warrior, and England, who flew in singing 
school children, Brazil pumped up its campaign with a squad of 
football heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to revive a fading bid, Brazil recruited superstar  
Ronaldo, as well as football legends Dunga, Zico and Carlos Alberto 
Torres. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, meanwhile, hosted a beer fest, complete with pretzels,  
white sausage and a Bavarian accordion band on the FIFA 
headquarters' lakeside terrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, fighting off negative publicity from football legend  
Pele's recent criticism of the bid, dismissed the former-player's 
disapproval, dispelling speculation it would harm the nation's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the bid is bigger than Pele,'' said Torres, who was on  
the winning squad with Pele at the World Cup in Mexico in 1970. 
``I've known Pele for the past 40 years and I'm sure he will join 
us when he gets to know how serious we are with this project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With South America last hosting the event in 1978, the  
Brazilians felt it would be unfair for Africa to get the next World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It needs to go where it is most loved,'' added Torres. ``If  
you had a first basketball World Cup, it would absolutely have to 
go to the United States. It only makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil also insisted it had gained full governmental backing.  
</P>
<P>
	The German delegation, led by former football great Franz  
Beckenbauer, underlined its organizational skills, modern 
facilities and technical superiority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody still has a chance,'' said Beckenbauer, the captain  
of the 1974 German team that won the World Cup title at home and 
coach of the 1990 side that captured the title in Italy. ``Our job 
is now to convince everybody that Germany is the best place for the 
World Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, South Africa made en emotional appeal to host the  
continent's first World Cup, evoking the nation's troubled, 
turbulent past. The nation insists it has the necessary 
infrastructure to host a World Cup, and spent considerable time 
addressing the issue of safety and security. 
</P>
<P>
	The English, who are hoping to host a World Cup for the first  
time in 40 years, jetted in a 135-strong corps for a half-hour 
presentation and press interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco made its third bid in an attempt to become the first  
African nation to host the World Cup. It has been speculated, 
however, that it may pull out of the running following King 
Hassan's death. 
</P>
<P>
	With FIFA President Blatter repeatedly expressing his wish for  
the 2006 World Cup to go to the African continent for the first 
time, South Africa is being considered the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-member Executive Committee will make its final vote on  
the 2006 host in July 2000.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Follows Market by Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell broadly Tuesday, as U.S. stocks  
sank further and traders ignored political turmoil abroad that has 
traditionally sent foreign exchange traders seeking the safety of 
U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 114.81  
Japanese yen, down from 115.20 yen at the same point on Monday. The 
euro, the single currency of 11 European nations, was quoted at 
$1.0708, down from $1.0712 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rekindled tensions between new nuclear powers India and  
Pakistan, edgy relations between China and Taiwan and another 
makeover of the Russian cabinet failed to stir currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Upheaval in the Russian government has become commonplace, said  
Kevin Harris, international economist at MCM Currencywatch in New 
York, referring to Monday's installation of a new prime minister 
for the fourth time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The standoffs in China and India with their neighbors -- Taiwan  
and Pakistan, respectively -- are also long-term situations that 
don't necessarily affect broad financial markets, Harris said. 
Consequently, currency traders apparently don't feel the need to 
flee to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the absence of other news, the dollar has been following  
the U.S. asset markets,'' he said. The Dow Jones industrial 
average, at one point down 158 points, closed with a loss of 52.55 
at 10655.15. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4957 Swiss  
francs, up from 1.4953 a day earlier, and 1.4992 Canadian dollars, 
down from 1.5029 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound rose to $1.6145 from late Monday's quote of  
$1.6064. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar rose at 1.8275 German  
marks, up from 1.8258; and 6.1275 French francs, up from 6.1237.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Leaves Game With Back Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mark McGwire, stuck on 501 career homers  
after passing the historic mark last week, left the St. Louis 
Cardinals' game Tuesday night with tightness in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who thrilled a large crowd at Veterans Stadium with a  
power-hitting show in batting practice, walked in his only at-bat 
against Phillies starter Robert Person. He did not take the field 
for the bottom of the second inning, replaced by Craig Paquette. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals said McGwire left the game as a precaution.  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who leads the majors with 44 homers, hasn't hit one in  
13 at-bats since hitting his 500th and 501st last Thursday against 
San Diego. He was 1-for-10 with no extra-base hits in a four-game 
series at Pittsburgh over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	His longest homerless drought this season was 41 at-bats,  
between his fifth and sixth of the season. He has gone 15 at-bats 
without a homer only five times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who has battled back problems since 1989, missed three  
games last month due to back spasms. During a news conference 
Monday before the opener of this three-game series in Philadelphia, 
McGwire commented that this is the first season since then that he 
hasn't missed at least 10 days because of his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deal with it every day,'' McGwire said.  
</P>
<P>
	He showed no ill-effects during batting practice. With most  
seats in the left-field upper deck filled, McGwire homered on 14 of 
15 swings at one point. A couple of his massive clouts landed 
nearly halfway to the top of the upper deck.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Down 52.55 at 10,655.15 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks continued their slide Tuesday as  
investors remained unsettled by growing expectations that the 
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least once more this 
year. Battered Internet stocks broke out of a slump to help slow 
the stock market's retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 52.55 points to close at  
10,655.15. The blue-chip index had been down as much as 158 points 
earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell, although they mirrored the  
Dow and crept back from steep early losses. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500 fell 16.37 to 1,281.43, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 
29.48 to 2,489.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The S&AMP;P 500 closed 9.7 percent below its record high, set July  
16, dipping as low as the 10 percent decline that Wall Street 
considers a market correction. The Nasdaq is 13 percent below its 
peak, also reached July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has held up slightly better as investors gravitate  
toward large, well-established names. It is 4.9 percent below its 
record high. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have been driven lower as the market absorbs the  
possibility of higher interest rates. Hoping to keep inflation from 
creeping into the booming U.S. economy, the Fed is widely expected 
to raise short-term interest rates when its policy-making Federal 
Open Market Committee meets Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates typically hurt stocks by cutting into  
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent sessions, market players have begun to debate whether  
the Fed will raise rates in October as well. Increases in August 
and October would be the second and third of 1999, undoing the 
three rate cuts imposed late last year as the Fed sought to keep 
the U.S. economy from being caught up in financial crises spreading 
through Asia, Russia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market always goes to extremes of fear and greed, and  
right now, fear is at an extreme,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief 
market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday afternoon, however, fears were quelled by a spike in  
Internet stocks. Those shares, often highly priced relative to 
their paltry or nonexistent earnings, have been punished harshly in 
the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said bargain-hunters and computer-program-guided  
traders stepped in and drove them higher. Yahoo! rose 6 5/16 to 
127 1/2 and Amazon.com rose 5 1/2 to 91. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been stretched really thin and there's room for them  
to bounce back,'' said Ralph Bloch, chief market analyst at Raymond 
James &AMP; Co. in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay, battered last week when the computer system that runs its  
online auction failed, rose 9 5/8 to 89 1/4. In an upbeat meeting with 
analysts Monday, EBay officials detailed plans to auction cars over 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The selling pressure on stocks also eased after a regional  
Federal Reserve Bank president with a vote on interest-rate policy, 
Robert McTeer Jr. of Dallas, told the Greater Dallas Chamber of 
Commerce that strong economic growth isn't necessarily 
inflationary, especially if it's fueled by gains in technology and 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of Fed action has pushed long-term interest rates to  
the highest levels in almost two years. On Tuesday, the 30-year 
Treasury bond yielded 6.24 percent, a level last seen in November 
1997, compared to 6.23 percent late Monday. The high yields on 
bonds are presenting an attractive, less volatile alternative to 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks, which are highly sensitive to  
interest-rate fluctuations, were mostly lower. J.P. Morgan fell 3 
to 121 15/16, contributing most to the Dow's decline. But its 
shares were also hurt by news of a $735 million lawsuit by Sumitomo 
Corp. over a copper trading scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent fell 2 1/8 to 61 1/2 after agreeing to buy International  
Network Services Inc. for about $3.7 billion. Shares of INS rose 3 
to 50 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent's deal strengthens its competitive position against Cisco  
Systems, analysts said, and helped drag Cisco shares down 1 1/16 to 
58. After the close of trading Tuesday, Cisco reported earnings 
that beat Wall Street's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The market slump created a hostile environment for initial  
public offerings. Shares of HotJobs.com, an online job-search firm, 
were priced at 8 but slipped to 7 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 831.64 million shares 
as of 4 p.m., compared with 674.62 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 6.60 to 603.80, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 9.57 to 768.30. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.07 to 422.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.07 percent.  
European indexes fared worse. Germany's DAX index was down 1.7 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 2.4 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was down 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Rejects Oil-Dumping Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A trade dispute that dumbfounded many  
economists is coming to an end before it even really began with the 
government throwing out a complaint from a group of U.S. oilmen 
that sought steep taxes on oil imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department on Monday rejected a petition from a  
group of U.S. Independent oil companies that charged four of the 
world's leading oil producing countries with dumping cheap oil on 
the U.S. market contrary to American trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said the oilmen from Kansas, Texas and Oklahoma  
did not demonstrate sufficient U.S. industry support to invoke U.S. 
anti-dumping laws that would have triggered tariffs on 60 percent 
of the oil imported into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, the oil producing countries  
involved, and some of the country's biggest energy users 
immediately expressed their relief. Higher tariffs would have meant 
higher energy and gasoline prices, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``The denial is a win-win for U.S. consumers and domestic oil  
producers,'' said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who had been 
frustrated by the oilmen's action. He said the petition distracted 
officials from helping the U.S. industry and jeopardized 
``important strategic relationships'' with Saudi Arabia, Venezuela 
and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The three countries as well as Iraq had been targeted by the  
petition filed last month by a group calling itself Save Domestic 
Oil Inc., based in Enid, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Hamm, chairman of the group and an Oklahoma oil producer,  
reacted sharply to the Commerce decision, calling it `a classic 
example of government disregarding the rights of the `little guy' 
in favor of the greedy self interests of the wealthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm said the group would appeal the decision to the Court of  
International Trade. Such appeals, however, often take several 
years to resolve, according to trade experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The group had argued their industry, especially in the historic  
oil patch of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, had been severely harmed 
by the low prices of imported oil and that the anti-dumping trade 
laws should protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	The petitions charged that the foreign producers sold oil in the  
United States in some cases for less than it cost to produce and in 
other cases for less than they sold it for in other markets such as 
Japan. They also charged that government subsidies to the 
government-owned oil companies violated U.S. trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
	But the allegations won't be investigated.  
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department, after a review by its International  
Trade Administration, found that the Oklahoma-based group had 
``insufficient industry support'' to trigger a formal investigation 
under U.S. anti-dumping trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that ``opposition to the petition from U.S. producers  
exceeded support for the petitions'' and that ``without adequate 
industry support, Commerce is prohibited by law from initiating 
investigations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department made spot checks, direct inquiries and received  
comments from nearly 1,000 oil companies and producers and found 
that only about a third of those responding were in favor of the 
complaint, officials said. By law at least half of those commenting 
must favor a petition to trigger a full investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute, representing the large oil  
companies, vowed to fight the petition it at every step and rallied 
key energy users from truckers to chemical companies, against it. 
</P>
<P>
	The API said while there is no question that low oil prices have  
hurt the U.S. industry, ``these low prices were set by the forces 
of supply and demand ... not by alleged unfair pricing by a handful 
of oil producing countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trade experts also were astonished that anyone would try to use  
of the anti-dumping trade laws on oil imports since petroleum 
prices and the flow of oil is subject to a worldwide market. If a 
foreign producer sold at below-market prices to a specific country, 
it would be impossible later to recoup the losses by raising prices 
above market levels, economists argue. Also it does not matter 
where the oil comes from. If an import tax is slapped on one 
producer by the United States, that producer will sell elsewhere 
while another exporter not subject to the tariff takes up the 
slack, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the U.S. anti-dumping laws have been known to strongly  
favor the domestic industry and economists were not sure what the 
outcome might have been if Commerce found cause to launch a full 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce decision was ``a triumph of sound economics over  
protectionism and the mumbo jumbo of trade legalism,'' said Guy 
Caruso, an energy expert at the Washington-based Center for 
Strategic and International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	If the petition had been accepted, the government would have  
opened formal investigations into whether prices on oil imports 
from the four countries were unfairly being manipulated, and 
whether those actions had harmed the U.S. industry sufficiently to 
trigger import tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign producers deny the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Petroleos de Venezuela, the national oil company of Venezuela,  
said the allegations ``reflected a fundamental misunderstanding of 
the workings of the world oil market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico particularly had expressed outrage and put on hold plans  
to cut tariffs on natural gas imported from the United States. 
Richardson said Monday that Mexican officials had informed him that 
they now intended to go ahead with a tariff phaseout.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Won't Halt Patrols Over Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. warplanes will not modify their patrols  
of no-fly zones in Iraq because of Wednesday's eclipse of the sun, 
the Pentagon said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Iraqis don't want to be attacked, it's very easy for  
them to arrange that. They can simply not challenge allied planes 
flying in patrol of the no-fly zones,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth 
Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't challenge the allied planes, the allied planes  
will not respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked at the Pentagon whether the military would suspend  
airstrikes to avoid hitting Iraqis who might be out in the open 
watching the eclipse, which includes Turkey, Iran, Iraq and 
Pakistan in its sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. warplanes have been striking Iraqi military sites or  
returning fire when provoked on the average of 15 times a month in 
the eight months since Operation Desert Fox, the last use of cruise 
missiles against Iraqi targets, Bacon said. He said the reprisal 
attacks are degrading Saddam Hussein's air defense systems ``slowly 
and systematically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the airstrikes have averaged about six a month in the  
southern no-fly zone and nine a month in the northern one. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. warplanes struck at Iraqi military sites Tuesday in a  
second consecutive day of bombings in the northern zone, the 
Germany-based U.S. European Command said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force F-15s and F-16s dropped precision-guided bombs on two  
separate communications facilities, north and northeast of Mosul, 
250 miles north of Baghdad, the command said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said the sites were relaying radar information to  
anti-aircraft artillery units. 
</P>
<P>
	The jets left the area safely, and damage to the Iraqi sites was  
being assessed, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon also reported U.S. airstrikes Tuesday in the southern zone  
but provided no details. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Iraqi News Agency said two people were injured in  
the attacks in northern Iraq and one was injured in the southern 
part of the country. The report said several more were injured and 
others killed when missiles struck near a church outside the 
northern city of Mosul. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British planes patrol zones in north and south Iraq,  
set up after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Iraq's Kurdish and Shiite 
Muslim minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi forces have challenged allied planes in the zones since  
Dec. 28. Baghdad says the zones violate Iraqi sovereignty and 
international law. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon also was asked whether the London-based Iraqi National  
Congress can expect U.S. protection if the anti-Saddam opposition 
group follows through on plans to hold regular meetings in northern 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that our patrols in the northern no-fly zone  
prevent Saddam Hussein from moving military forces or equipment in 
the area, anybody meeting in northern Iraq would benefit from 
that,'' Bacon said. ``Other than that, there's no specific 
protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition group sought U.S. military protection to allow it  
to meet in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Controversy Taints PGA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Tom Lehman was practicing 5-footers on the  
practice green in front of the clubhouse at the Medinah Country 
Club, all the while keeping a wary eye on a few reporters hanging 
around just outside the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes earlier, Lehman had emerged from a closed-door  
meeting with likely members of next month's Ryder Cup team and PGA 
officials aimed at diffusing a growing controversy over paying 
players to represent their country. 
</P>
<P>
	Much as he would have liked, Lehman knew the questions wouldn't  
be about his chances to win the PGA Championship that begins 
Thursday in this Chicago suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The talk Tuesday wasn't about numbers, such as the 7,401-yard  
length of Medinah or how many under par it might take to win the 
final major of the year. It was about numbers like the $23 million 
profit the PGA reportedly will make from the Ryder Cup, and the 
$5,000 stipend players receive to compete in it. 
</P>
<P>
	It was enough to give Lehman a harried look as he stroked putt  
after putt to try and get ready for a week that could secure him a 
spot on the Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these issues will be resolved in the future. Now is not  
the time,'' Lehman said. ``The idea of boycotting the Ryder Cup is, 
was and always will be ... ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the PGA Championship had enough image problems as the  
perennial stepchild of the four major tournaments, it didn't get 
any better as tournament preparations were overshadowed by the 
issue of paying Ryder Cup players. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA officials did their best to put the spotlight back on the  
tournament by holding an hour-long meeting with players at which 
they agreed to discuss ways of paying money to charities favored by 
the individual players on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed to work as the 16 top players on the Ryder Cup points  
list emerged from the meeting with a unified front, using phrases 
such as ``non-issue'' and ``we're all on the same page'' to 
proclaim their happiness with the current setup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all agreed on everything,'' Jeff Maggert said after the  
meeting that included team captain Ben Crenshaw, PGA Tour 
commissioner Tim Finchem and Jim Awtrey, the CEO of the PGA of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Awtrey and Finchem said they would work in the next few weeks to  
come to an agreement with players on Ryder Cup money being paid to 
their charities. But both said the players will not be paid to 
represent their country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players do not want to be paid,'' Awtrey said. ``But the  
players are looking at how the Ryder Cup can be supportive of 
growth of the game and charities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The midafternoon meeting put a hole in the practice schedules of  
the top players, with Tiger Woods hurrying off to play Medinah 
after it broke up. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman, 11th on the Ryder Cup points list that accounts for 10  
of the 12 team members, said he just wanted to get the issue behind 
him and play well enough to secure a spot on the team this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is on the same page,'' Lehman insisted. ``The  
players are focused on playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval helped spark the controversy with remarks of a  
possible boycott that he said were misconstrued. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never said I wanted to be paid,'' Duval said. ``I said I  
think that we should have money go back to our local communities. 
Some words were put on my mouth that probably shouldn't have 
been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Greg Norman, who can't play in the Ryder Cup because he is  
Australian, was asked and offered his opinion on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you play for the flag,'' Norman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Though the players put on a united front after the meeting,  
Woods said just a few hours earlier that he thought players should 
be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should be able to keep the money and do whatever we  
see fit,'' Woods said. ``For me personally, I would donate all of 
it to charity. With all the money that's being made, I think that 
we should have a say in where it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Ryder Cup controversy was the center of attention  
Tuesday, it was also a day for many in the field to get their first 
looks at Medinah, which will play more than 200 yards longer than 
it did when Hale Irwin won the U.S. Open here in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The course generally met with positive comments from players  
relieved not to find the tiny fairways and knee-high rough that 
plagued the British Open last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we'll ever see fairways that narrow as long as  
we live,'' Davis Love III said of the Carnoustie layout. ``This one 
is just a big, long, hard golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The field of 150 includes defending champion Vijay Singh -- who  
won his first major in this tournament last year at Sahalla Country 
Club near Seattle -- and 25 club pros who were far removed from the 
Ryder Cup talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland's Paul Lawrie also qualified for his first tournament  
in America with his win in the British Open, while France's Jean 
Van de Velde got an invitation despite his spectacular 18th hole 
collapse at Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, it's not going to be too humid,'' Lawrie said.  
``But I've been in the sauna and stuff last week trying to prepare 
myself for the heat.''

<HEADLINE> Horror Follows Deadly Van Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FIVE POINTS, Calif. (AP) -- Dora Portillo was one of the lucky  
ones. So was her mom. After a long night of picking and sorting 
tomatoes, they caught their own ride back to Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Portillo's father, Juan Avila, was among the 15 people who  
piled into a 1983 Dodge Ram van after working the same shift. He 
never made it home. 
</P>
<P>
	The van slammed into a tractor-trailer before dawn Monday,  
killing all but two of the passengers. It split in half across its 
front grill and buckled upon impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told my mom, `You go ahead and go with them, so you can  
rest and go to sleep,''' said Ms. Portillo, 26, sobbing as she 
explained how there was not enough room in her friend's car for 
both her parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened shortly after 5 a.m., just southeast of  
this tiny town in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley. The truck 
driver was turning his rig around on a two-lane road after parking 
on the shoulder to sleep, said California Highway Patrol Officer 
Eric Erickson. The rig's two trailers were empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The van was going at least 55 mph, and ``couldn't avoid hitting  
the tractor-trailer,'' Erickson said. ``Their brakes locked up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The skid marks were 50 to 80 feet long, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver, Adrian Erazo, 44, was not injured. He has a  
clean driving record. 
</P>
<P>
	The van's driver, a Fresno man whose name wasn't released, was  
among those killed. His driver's license had been revoked because 
of several violations, Erickson said. He had been cited for not 
wearing a seat belt and not having a license, and was once arrested 
on a drunken driving charge. Erickson said there was no conviction 
for the DUI, but it wasn't clear why. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the injured survivors, Lucia Gonzalez, was in critical  
condition today after suffering internal bleeding. The other, 
Gilberto Piedra Navarrete, 42, was in stable condition today with 
two broken legs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican government agency Notimex said the Mexican consulate  
in Fresno confirmed that the 13 dead farm workers were Mexicans. No 
one was available at the consulate Monday afternoon for further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In central California's agricultural heartland, farm workers  
often have no alternative to traveling in crowded vans -- a problem 
that has contributed to a disproportionate traffic death rate among 
Hispanics in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 10 men and five women in the van were sitting  
without seat belts on two carpeted benches, said CHP Officer Brian 
Yokley. 
</P>
<P>
	It's illegal in California to have anyone ride without proper  
seats and seat belts, but certified farm vehicles are excluded from 
the law. The van -- owned by Ms. Portillo's grandfather, Jose Lopez 
Rosas -- received its last annual certification in 1997, but had not 
been certified since, the highway patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something has to change because every time you see these you  
don't have one death, you have multiple deaths,'' said Yolanda 
Cervantes, who organizes an annual driver safety awareness program 
in nearby Mendota. ``I've seen too many.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The highway patrol has a team of six officers dubbed ``Los  
Centinales'' -- or ``the Sentinels'' -- who focus exclusively on 
vehicles overcrowded with farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
	They have spent the past three summers patrolling before dawn,  
stopping trucks and vans of farm workers to check whether the 
vehicles are complying with state codes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stop those vehicles that are obviously overloaded ... the  
back end is sagged down because of the weight of the people,'' said 
Sgt. Jorge Chaidez, who runs the unit out of the highway patrol's 
office in Fresno. ``I've seen up to 22 people in a small van.''

<HEADLINE> Layden Discusses Offer With Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah Jazz vice president of basketball  
operations Scott Layden has met with owner Larry Miller to discuss 
Layden's future with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden met with the New York Knicks during the weekend about  
their vacant general manager's job. A Jazz source, who asked not to 
be identified, told The Associated Press that Layden spent Monday 
discussing a counterproposal from Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	When the New York Knicks fired their general manager last April,  
Layden's name surfaced as a possible replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	KSTU Fox television, citing its own unnamed sources, reported  
Layden's departure is imminent. However, Jazz publicist Kim Turner 
said he couldn't confirm the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden has been valuable at recruiting talent, working trades,  
drafting and signing free agents -- making the Jazz one of the NBA's 
top teams. 
</P>
<P>
	And no one knows that better than Dave Checketts, the Knicks'  
president and chief operating officer who was president of the Utah 
Jazz in the 1980s and maintains close ties to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post reported that Checketts offered Layden a  
multiyear deal with a $1.5 million annual salary -- about four times 
his Jazz salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden has repeatedly declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' job opened in April with the firing of Ernie  
Grunfeld, who was general manager before being demoted to 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld was let go less than a week after the Knicks lost in  
the NBA finals. The Knicks had done poorly in the Eastern 
Conference, although they made a miraculous run to the Finals 
before finally losing to the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden, son of former Jazz coach Frank Layden, joined the Jazz  
in 1981 as an assistant coach. In 1988, he became their chief scout 
and was named director of player development. His title was 
upgraded to vice president of basketball operations in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz finished off the 1999 season with a league-best 37-13  
record, but sputtered down the stretch and were eliminated from the 
playoffs in the second round by the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	That was Utah's earliest exit since 1995. The Jazz have had 13  
straight winning seasons, as well as four division titles and two 
Western Conference championships in the last decade.

<HEADLINE> 15 Hostages Freed in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Former junta soldiers freed their  
remaining prisoners today, ending a five-day hostage crisis, Sierra 
Leone's information minister said. 
</P>
<P>
	Julius Spencer said at news conference that the rogue rebels had  
freed 15 West African intervention force soldiers, a U.N. military 
observer and some 200 civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the hostages have been released,'' Spencer said. ``The  
hostage drama is over in Sierra Leone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His account was confirmed by Brig. Gen. Subhash Joshi, the  
United Nation's chief military observer in Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
	At United Nations headquarters in New York, U.N. spokesman Fred  
Eckhard said most of the 200 civilians released were children. 
</P>
<P>
	The freed hostages were headed to Freetown and had radioed from  
a government-controlled checkpoint, Spencer and Joshi said. 
</P>
<P>
	A former junta official returned to his ex-colleagues' camp  
Monday night to negotiate the release of hostages. The kidnapping 
highlighted divisions among Sierra Leone's rebels, who fought an 
8-year civil war for control of the West African nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Idriss Kamara returned to the forest outside  
Freetown, the former junta soldiers freed four U.N. military 
observers and a Sierra Leonean journalist Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	About 35 people were taken hostage Wednesday, sparking a crisis  
that has jeopardized Sierra Leone's fragile peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamara was captured by his former junta colleagues Friday after  
he tried to negotiate a hostage release. He was freed Sunday 
morning with five U.N. drivers, but returned that night to help 
negotiate the release of 13 more hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	``They treated us fine,'' Chernor Bangura, a cameraman for  
Sierra Leone state television, said in a telephone interview. ``We 
were given one meal a day and tea in the morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The junta, led by Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, governed Sierra  
Leone for 10 months beginning in June 1997, ending when the 
military regime was ousted by the West African intervention force. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidnappings took place during what was to have been a  
handover of some 150 civilians abducted by gunmen during Sierra 
Leone's civil war. But after freeing a few hostages last week, the 
ex-junta soldiers instead seized the group that had come to receive 
the prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon Rogers, the rebels' war council chairman, today lashed  
out at the kidnappings, saying the rebels ``vehemently condemn the 
abduction incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The abduction incident will not derail the peace process,''  
said Rogers, who lead a small delegation that met with President 
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. 
</P>
<P>
	Kabbah, reaching out to men who were his sworn enemies a few  
months ago, said he ``commended the efforts'' by rebel leader Foday 
Sankoh, former junta leader Koroma and Liberian President Charles 
Taylor to secure the hostages' release. 
</P>
<P>
	Freed hostages say as many as 2,000 disenchanted members of the  
former junta may be living in the jungle hideaway where the 
prisoners were held. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Embassy official, meanwhile, said a team of staffers from  
the House Appropriations Committee and the International Relations 
Committee today flew to Sierra Leone's interior accompanied by U.S. 
Ambassador Joe Melrose. The nature of the trip to Kenema, a 
pro-government town not far from a key rebel base, was not 
immediately clear.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Man Electrocuted at Bus Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A man was electrocuted while sitting on a metal  
bench in a bus stop shelter, prompting San Diego County to close 
its 475 shelters until authorities can determine why the man was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Williams, 20, of San Diego, was electrocuted Sunday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Newman tried to pry Williams loose from the metal grate,  
but the estimated 5,000-volt current was too great. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a car on fire so I ran to see if I could  
help, and I saw him,'' said Newman. ``He was up against the fence, 
he was shaking, smoke was pouring out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newman, a civilian electrician employed by the California Air  
National Guard, said he briefly examined the electrical system at 
the shelter and found it lacked a circuit breaker that would have 
cut off the current immediately after a short. 
</P>
<P>
	``For $50 worth of parts, whoever owns it could have saved this  
guy's life,'' Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's preliminary analysis confirms Newman's observation,  
Deputy City Manager George Loveland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outdoor Systems Advertising, one of the largest transit shelter  
providers in the country, began shutting off electricity to the 
lighted bus stop shelters Tuesday. Each one will be inspected 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Kosher Foods Producers Expanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIFFLINTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Nestled in the middle of farm country,  
this community is on the front lines of the battle for the stomachs 
of meat-eaters everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	It is here where Empire Kosher Poultry Inc., the nation's  
largest processor of kosher poultry products is gearing up to take 
advantage of the growing interest among non-Jews in kosher food. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our research focus groups show that a wide variety of people  
are very receptive to the notion of eating kosher,'' said Michael 
Strear, Empire's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales figures prove the kosher cravings are serious business.  
</P>
<P>
	Americans bought $45 billion worth of kosher products --  
including snacks, soft drinks and even beer -- last year, up nearly 
29 percent from $35 billion in 1996, according to Integrated 
Marketing Communications, a New York City marketing company that 
specializes in kosher food. In 2000, sales will grow to $55 
billion, IMC projects. 
</P>
<P>
	But kosher foods are still a relatively small part of the total  
market. Empire has about 60 percent of the kosher poultry market, 
but that represents less than 1 percent of all poultry sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The laws of kosher, spelled out in Leviticus in the Bible,  
specify how animals must be killed and prepared for consumption. 
All Orthodox and some Conservative and Reform Jews follow these 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	For meat to be kosher, animals cannot be stunned before they are  
slaughtered and the slaughtering must be done by a rabbi. After the 
animal is killed, it must be soaked in salt for an hour to remove 
all the blood and then washed in cold water. 
</P>
<P>
	Empire, which processes 120,000 chickens and 15,000 turkeys on  
an average day, employs 80 Orthodox rabbis who work at various 
stages of the production process. 
</P>
<P>
	They ride buses from Baltimore, New York City and Philadelphia  
every Sunday and stay in dormitories on the premises through 
Thursday nights. The plant is closed during the Jewish Sabbath, 
which runs from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rabbis not only slaughter the birds but inspect them. Often,  
they reject animals that have passed inspection by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Just off the factory floor is a prayer room.  
</P>
<P>
	Companies like Empire stress that the kosher process is backed  
by more than 3,000 years of religious tradition. But they believe 
they have saturated the market among Jews and see potential for 
increased sales among Muslims, Seventh-day Adventists, vegetarians 
and consumers interested in healthier foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Empire just started a national advertising campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to remain a kosher company and cross over to  
markets where religion is not a factor,'' Strear said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent data shows that a wide range of consumers could be  
receptive to the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jews make up just 20 percent of the 10-million-buyer kosher  
market, according to IMC. Muslims and other religions with dietary 
restrictions make up 30 percent. Vegetarian and lactose intolerant 
make up 25 percent, and the other 25 percent are people who prefer 
kosher products because they may be healthier. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers of kosher foods have long used the health factor  
as a selling point. But Joe Reganstein, a professor of food science 
at Cornell University, said the health value may be over-hyped. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a perception that kosher means cleaner and healthier.  
In actuality, the way most people define those words it's a 
lawyerly argument and distinction,'' he said. ``There is a bit of 
mythology and a bit of reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Platte, the senior marketing manager of New York  
City-based National Foods, which manufactures Hebrew National 
products -- mostly hot dogs and delicatessen foods, said the company 
capitalizes on the quality issue even though many consumers do not 
know exactly what kosher means. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to educate people that kosher is better quality.  
Nobody is interested in the details,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebrew National, which three years ago expanded its distribution  
beyond its traditional markets, launched its first national 
advertising campaign in May and is pursuing other ways to expand 
its market share. 
</P>
<P>
	Platte said the company is in discussions with a fast-food  
restaurant company, which he would not name, about the possibility 
of their opening an all-kosher location.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Root-Lowell Manufacturing Co. is recalling  
90,000 home and garden sprayers with pumps that can spontaneously

<HEADLINE> Census Plans Ads To Improve Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major advertising campaign is being designed  
to help encourage participation in Census 2000, the program's 
director said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The projected $166 million campaign will target the millions of  
people the agency historically has trouble counting, such as 
blacks, Hispanics and immigrants, Census Bureau Director Kenneth 
Prewitt said. Half the money will be used for ads in Spanish and 
other foreign languages. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau expects to get back about 61 percent of the census  
questionnaires that it plans to mail out next year, Prewitt said. 
Enumerators will then be sent out into the streets to find those 
who did not return the forms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, we send the form out. If a hundred percent of them came  
back in, we'd be finished,'' Prewitt said. ``We expect and hope the 
paid advertising campaign, in language, in the communities, giving 
the message about what's in it for you, why your community will 
benefit will do something about that response rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to paid advertising, which is expected to be  
supplemented by promotional work by independent groups, the bureau 
will undertake another effort ``before long'' to reverse the 
declining response rate, Prewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no paid advertising for the 1990 census, which  
government and other officials have criticized as the first to be 
less accurate than the one before it. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau recently asked for an extra $1.7 billion for the  
traditional population count in addition to the $2.9 billion 
already requested for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The House included the $1.7 billion request in its version of a  
spending bill that includes the bureau, but the Senate did not. The 
differences must be worked out before legislation can be sent to 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the funds are needed to conduct a valid census, Prewitt  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has said time and time again that it wants an  
accurate, complete census, and it will have to pay what it's going 
to cost,'' he said. ``We presume, when the conversations are over, 
that's that what will have happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it doesn't, then we will scramble and give this country a  
different census. It will not be an accurate census. It will not be 
a complete census ... but we will certainly do a census one way or 
the other.''

<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Guards Andre Miller and Trajan Langdon, the  
Cleveland Cavaliers' top two draft picks, signed contracts with the 
team Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller will earn approximately $5.4 million over the first three  
years of his contract, with the Cavaliers holding the option for a 
fourth year at $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 200-pound point guard from Utah was the Cavs'  
first pick and No. 8 overall. He averaged 15.8 points last season 
and led the Utes in scoring, assists and steals. With him running 
the point, the Utes went 114-20 the past four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon averaged 14.5 points in 136 games at Duke. Last season,  
the 6-foot-3 guard averaged 17.3 points and made 44 percent of his 
3-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon will earn approximately $4.5 million over his first  
three years, with the Cavs holding the option for a fourth year at

<HEADLINE> Report: Lucent To Buy INS for $3.7B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucent Technologies Inc., plans to buy data  
networking company International Network Services Inc. for about 
$3.7 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was expected to be announced Tuesday, the Journal said,  
quoting people familiar with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies declined to comment for the report.  
</P>
<P>
	INS had annual profits of $25.4 million for the fiscal year  
ended June 30, as sales grew 82 percent, to $315 million, over the 
previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	INS has had close ties with Lucent rival Cisco Systems Inc.,  
which owned 7.8 percent of the company, the newspaper said citing 
Cisco's most recent proxy statement. A Cisco executive sits on 
INS's board, the Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition is expected to boost Lucent's data networking  
operations. INS, headquartered in Sunnyvale, Calif., helps large 
corporations design, install and maintain computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not clear. If structured as an all-stock  
deal, the Journal said the INS purchase be worth $58 an INS, a 22 
percent premium over INS's Monday closing price of $47.43 3/4, up 
$1.37 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent has made several recent acquisitions of computer  
networking companies. In June, the Murray Hill, N.J.-based company 
completed a $24 billion purchase of Ascend Communications Inc. and 
a $972 acquisition of closely held Nexabit Networks Inc.

<HEADLINE> Cargill Takes Hits From Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Cargill Inc. says a lawsuit filed by Pioneer  
Hi-Bred International alleging misappropriation of genetic 
materials was largely responsible for Cargill's $182 million loss 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill's loss for the quarter ended May 31 compared with  
earnings of $219 million in the same period last year, the company 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The private company, which is based in Minnetonka, Minn.,  
markets, processes and distributes agricultural, food, financial 
and industrial products worldwide. The company has about 82,000 
employees in 59 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full fiscal year, Cargill said it earned $597 million,  
including a one-time gain from the sale of its international seed 
business. Cargill earned $468 million in fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating earnings were down 53 percent from the previous year  
to $220 million, and revenues were down 11 percent to $46 billion, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the operating side, our earnings and revenues continue to  
reflect the tough economic climate for agriculture that began in 
Asia two years ago and spread to other parts of the world,'' said 
Robert Lumpkins, vice chairman and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Commodity prices suffered their third straight year of decline  
due to the mismatch of weakened purchasing power in key markets and 
successive big global harvests -- a situation aggravated by trade 
barriers to agricultural goods in importing countries,'' Lumpkins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realized long ago that this will be a difficult, slow road  
to recovery. Hard-hit countries must institute the reforms needed 
to help their economies heal, and much more work is necessary to 
lower trade barriers to agricultural and food products,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioneer, based in Des Moines, filed a lawsuit in Iowa against  
Cargill and two other seed companies last October, claiming the 
companies bred corn hybrids using genetic material developed by 
Pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill has been trying to settle the lawsuit for several months  
since it traced suspicious genetic material in its breeding program 
back to a former Pioneer employee hired by Cargill. Cargill also 
pulled one of its hybrids off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioneer also sued Thomas Ishler of Leola, Pa., alleging he was  
the former employee who had given its genetics to its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill's meat, fertilizer and animal nutrition businesses were  
among several that turned in strong performances, Lumpkins said. 
Cargill's financial businesses, which suffered losses last August 
when Russia defaulted on its debt and devalued the ruble, were 
restructured, and profitability improved in the second half, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lumpkins said the company invested $1.4 billion in the business  
over the past year under its new chief executive officer, Warren 
Staley.

<HEADLINE> FBI Touts Online Fingerprint Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARKSBURG, W.Va. (AP) -- A $640 million electronic database of  
fingerprints will help police around the country decide within two 
hours whether a suspect should be freed on bail or held in custody, 
FBI officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of waiting more than 20 days for critical information,  
judges and law enforcement agencies in 15 states now can uncover a 
suspect's identity and criminal history before leaving the 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	All 50 states are expected to be connected within the next few  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System,  
which began operating July 28, was expected to be dedicated by FBI 
Director Louis Freeh on Wednesday at the FBI's Criminal Justice 
Information Services center in Clarksburg. 
</P>
<P>
	It reduces to electronic data some 34 million fingerprint cards,  
the equivalent of 18 stacks as tall as New York's Empire State 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
	It also slashes the wait for civil background checks from more  
than three months to just 24 hours, said James DeSarno, assistant 
director in charge of the Criminal Justice Information Services 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The original price was $520 million, but that went up to $640  
million when Congress and an advisory board added more functions 
and requirements to the system, FBI spokesman Steve Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The system's debut also was delayed. The original target date  
was November 1997, Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the new system was available, fugitives and repeat  
offenders often were released by judges who had no criminal history 
to peruse before the bail hearing, Freeh and DeSarno said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This quicker and more efficient identification technology will  
contribute to a safer America,'' DeSarno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI receives about 50,000 fingerprints a day, about half of  
them for criminal matters. About 10 percent, or 5,000, are for 
people being arrested for the first time, so the FBI has no prior 
data on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Several federal agencies, as well as 15 states, can now access  
and submit fingerprints electronically, DeSarno said. 
</P>
<P>
	States already online are Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida,  
Maine, New Mexico, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas, Virginia, 
West Virginia, Wisconsin, Georgia, Mississippi and Massachusetts.

<HEADLINE> Al Gore Blasts Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is not paying much public  
attention to Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic 
presidential nomination, but doesn't hold back when it comes to 
Republican foes. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the National Urban League on Monday, he blasted the  
GOP's $792 billion GOP tax cut as ``reckless and wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not need a Republican right-wing U-turn back to the  
deficits of the past,'' Gore said. ``Just when we are able to lift 
our people up, the Republicans have proposed another trickle-down 
tragedy to drag us down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Gore differs on many issues with Bradley, who was  
addressing the convention this afternoon, it was Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush who drew Gore's fire on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president never named the Republican front-runner, who  
spoke to the Urban League Sunday, but Bush's record and agenda of 
``compassionate conservatism'' were clearly under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are going to close the opportunity gap in this nation,  
we're going to need a lot more than crumbs of compassion,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an obvious reference to Bush's ``compassionate  
conservatism'' agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh from a meeting with the family of James Byrd Jr., Gore  
called for passage of federal hate crimes legislation to intensify 
prosecution and stiffen penalties for crimes like the fatal 
dragging of Byrd last year in Jasper, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``That heinous crime wounded not only the Byrd family and the  
Jasper community, it wounded the American spirit,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act was allowed to  
die in the Texas Senate, Gore faulted leaders who see no difference 
between hate crimes and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who was criticized for not taking a position on the  
legislation, said during the session that, ``It's hard to 
distinguish between one degree of hate or another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore painted a dim picture of Bush's Texas, citing high drop-out  
rates by black students, a tax system taxed against the working 
poor and the nation's second-highest percentage of uninsured 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here in Texas, can be we be satisfied when African-Americans  
can be twice as likely to drop out of school?'' Gore said, 
referring to Bush's education policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Touting a ``common American agenda,'' the vice president called  
for a census that corrects the omission of millions of blacks and 
Hispanics in 2000, urged passage of the Democratic-sponsored 
Patient's Bill of Rights and pushed for photo IDs for gun buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed a $1 increase in the minimum wage and a  
continuation of affirmative action programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also speaking Monday was the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who appeared on  
a panel titled ``Political Power of the New Millennium'' along with 
Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson urged Urban League members to focus their search for  
equality on money, not race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to close the resources gap,'' Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally lower  
Tuesday, with the key index falling nearly 3 percent in Hong Kong 
on worries over escalating tensions between Taiwan and China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 2.7 percent, or 348.76 points, to a nine-week low 
of 12,596.71. On Monday, the index slumped 221.59 points, or 1.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the fall was triggered by news reports that Chinese  
warplanes had crossed into Taiwanese airspace over the Taiwan 
Strait amid heightened tensions between Taipei and Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	The political row between China and Taiwan erupted last month  
when Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui suggested that Beijing should 
regard the island as a separate state. The two sides split amid 
civil war in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market was also pushed down by persistent rumors  
that China would devalue its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares slumped on concerns about a rise in U.S.  
interest rates. The main Straits Times Index fell 46.66 points, or 
2.2 percent, to 2,022.56. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan shares however rebounded sharply as investors shrugged  
off the island's strained relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's key Weight Stock Price Index rose 241.59  
points, or 3.43 percent, to 7,269.60. The index has shed 15 percent 
since July 9, when relations with China started to sour. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 11.64  
points, or 0.07 percent, to close at 17,202.09. On Monday, the 
average closed up 106.21 points, or 0.62 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending much of the day in negative territory, the Nikkei  
bounced back in the afternoon after the announcement of a 
better-than-expected figure for June machinery orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency said machinery orders to Japanese  
makers were up 6.3 percent from May. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 114.88 yen in  
late-afternoon trading, down 0.28 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and 
also below its late New York level of 115.20 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares slumped as growing concerns about the  
domestic political situation and the regional markets' bearishness 
dragged down the main index. The Composite Index fell 3 percent, or 
17.766 points, to 576.343. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The benchmark  
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 24.70 points, or 1.1 percent, to 
2,165.10.

rising domestic and U.S. interest rates. The 30-company Philippine 
Stock Exchange Index fell 24.52 points or 1.1 percent, to 2,230.78. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian market's key indicator closed lower,

sector finished in positive territory. The All Ordinaries index 
fell 18.2 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,958.7. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: The key index rose on expectations that the restructuring  
of the financially troubled Daewoo Group will be speeded up. The

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury Investigating Lockheed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal grand jury is investigating  
possible sales kickbacks by a unit of aerospace giant Lockheed 
Martin Corp., the company told federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  
Lockheed said it received a federal subpoena on July 15 seeking 
documents relating to the 1990 sales of radar systems by its New 
Hampshire-based Sanders unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia Beaman and Lockheed refused to  
elaborate on the disclosure Monday. But the Los Angeles Times, 
quoting an anonymous source, reported today that the grand jury is 
seeking information involving sales that may have begun before 
Lockheed purchased Sanders in 1986 and continued long past 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal, which also reported the probe, said  
investigators are focused on the Lockheed unit's efforts to land 
military contracts from Taiwan. It involves alleged improper 
payments to consultant Richard Hei, who was accused of receiving 
millions of dollars in illegal commissions from two other large 
U.S. contractors, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Whitney, spokesman for Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed Martin,  
said company officials ``do not believe we have violated any laws 
or regulations and we continue to cooperate fully with the U.S. 
Attorney's office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hei was a consultant with ties to Taiwan's military and  
government officials and he also worked for units of Litton and 
former Teledyne Inc. Those companies previously pleaded guilty to 
criminal charges stemming from improper payments to Hei and 
admitted trying to hide the payments from federal auditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Journal sources said the current federal grand jury probe of the  
Lockheed unit is an offshoot of those earlier investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury subpoena sought documents relating to the 1990  
international sale of area defense radar systems by the predecessor 
of Lockheed Martin Sanders and the compensation of an international 
sales consultant in connection with that sale, Lockheed said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal source said the focus is on a $44.5 million radar  
contract Sanders won from Taiwan to detect low-flying aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin Sanders Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of  
Lockheed Martin, is the result of the January 1990 merger of 
Lockheed Electronics Co. and Sanders Associates Inc. Sanders is no 
longer in the radar business.

<HEADLINE> IEA Foresees Tighter Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Revised estimates of world oil inventories have  
eased concerns of a looming shortage, but economic recovery in Asia 
and a meager growth in supplies still could cause the market to 
tighten, according to an industry survey released today. 
</P>
<P>
	An unexpected increase of 54 million barrels in estimates of May  
oil inventories in the world's wealthiest countries offsets much of 
the drawdown in stocks during the year's first quarter, the 
International Energy Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	If correct, the revision would weaken the argument the agency  
made last month that the world faces an oil shortage this winter 
that could be its worst in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised figures also would undermine the logic for the  
current strength in oil prices, which continued to rise in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA warned against overreaction to the inventory revisions,  
saying they might be readjusted downward somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even so, the picture painted by the data is of a market still  
in transition from last year's massive glut to what looks to be a 
much tighter market next year,'' the study said. ``That tighter 
market may be farther down the road than had been perceived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris-based IEA is part of the Organization for Economic  
Cooperation and Development, a group of the world's most developed 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	It said U.S. authorities recently added 19.5 million barrels to  
the country's inventories when recalculating figures for May. 
European stocks were revised due to unexpected increases in 
inventories in Germany and some smaller countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the IEA forecast that a gathering economic recovery  
among countries in East Asia, combined with a sluggish growth in 
oil output by non-OPEC producers, still will cause global demand to 
exceed supply by 1.4 million barrels per day in the third quarter 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap is expected to widen to 2.87 million barrels a day in  
the fourth quarter and 3.51 million barrels a day in the first 
quarter of the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said members of the Organization of Petroleum  
Exporting Countries boosted production by 190,000 barrels per day 
in July but still achieved a 91 percent compliance rate with 
cutbacks they agreed upon in March. OPEC's revised compliance rate 
for June was 87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price for widely traded Brent crude has surged on OPEC's  
discipline in limiting output, rising 8 percent in July alone, the 
IEA noted. Brent was trading Tuesday at $20.26 per barrel on the 
spot market, more than $8 per barrel higher than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	West Texas Intermediate crude climbed 3 percent last month and  
was trading Monday at $21.28 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry analysts suggest that prices may have peaked and  
could reverse course. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that the oil price is out of line with the  
fundamentals. It's only a matter of time before there's some 
downward correction,'' said Charlie Sharp, an analyst with the 
London-based brokerage T. Hoare Canaccord. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC's biggest producer, Saudi Arabia, has said it wants Brent  
prices to stay within a range of $18 to $20 per barrel. If oil 
prices rise beyond their current levels, some OPEC members may be 
tempted to exceed production quotas to maximize their earnings. But 
gains would prove short-lived, as more oil would depress prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher prices also would make it possible for non-OPEC suppliers  
with higher production costs to begin pumping crude of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone seriously believes we're in for $20 per  
barrel next year,'' said Alan Sinclair, an analyst at Charterhouse 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair called the current price ``a spike'' and predicted that  
Brent would drift back down toward $16 per barrel, based on its 
level in previous years.

<HEADLINE> Busy Hurricane Season Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People shouldn't be fooled by this year's slow  
start to hurricane season, government scientists say. With the peak 
period about to begin, meteorologists are predicting more storms 
than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists say three or more intense Atlantic storms are  
possible, and residents living along the East and Gulf coasts 
should remain prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's hurricane season produced 14 tropical storms,  
including three major hurricanes. In a typical season, the United 
States experiences five to six hurricanes, two of which are severe 
and an average of 1.5 storms make landfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because we haven't seen a hurricane yet this year, don't  
get fooled into thinking that this will be a light season'', said 
Gerald Bell, a research meteorologist at National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, but  
tropical storms don't really rev up until mid-August. The peak 
period runs from mid-August to mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
	The season is expected to be busy due to atmospheric conditions  
globally that contribute to hurricanes, said CPC meteorologist 
Vernon Kousky. Among those conditions are a low wind shear across 
the tropical Atlantic and below-average air pressure across the 
tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The odds are tilted in the favor of more storms than normal,''  
said Kousky. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane expert William Gray of Colorado State University has  
gone a step further, predicting 14 named tropical storms, nine 
hurricanes and four intense hurricanes. Gray figures there is a 54 
percent chance that one or more intense storms with wind speeds of 
111 miles per hour or more will hit the East Coast and a 40 percent 
chance for the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this season, there has been one tropical storm, Arlene,  
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm carries winds of 39 to 73 mph. A tropical storm  
becomes a hurricane when sustained winds reach 74 mph.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Ace Schilling OK To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Curt Schilling's shoulder showed no signs of  
a bone spur in X-rays Tuesday, and the Phillies' ace is on schedule 
to make his next start Friday in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling received a cortisone injection in the shoulder on  
Sunday and ``feels much better,'' team doctor Michael Ciccotti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not expect that he will need another shot, and I do not  
expect that he will need surgery,'' Ciccotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first good news in a while on Schilling's condition.  
Schilling had made 117 straight starts before missing one July 28 
because of biceps tendinitis. He returned to the rotation Saturday 
and allowed seven earned runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings of an 
8-2 loss to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Schilling was diagnosed with bursitis and received a  
cortisone shot Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays were take of Schilling's acromion bone, a small bone at  
the tip of the shoulder where he had a bone spur removed during 
surgery to repair a torn labrum in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks fine,'' Ciccotti said. ``There is no spur there that  
has reformed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling will throw off the mound Wednesday and make his start  
Friday unless there is a setback. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's on schedule,'' general manager Ed Wade said.  
</P>
<P>
	In other injury news, a recent MRI of right-hander Carlton  
Loewer's humerus bone showed improvement. But if he is able to 
pitch again this season, it is expected to be in a relief role -- 
not in the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Loewer, who has been throwing without pain, also will throw  
Friday. He could pitch in a game in 3-6 weeks -- sometime in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the point of the season it is, the easiest thing to do  
is for him to throw from the bullpen,'' Ciccotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman Scott Rolen still has back spasms, and he's being  
treated with a stretching program. On Monday, Rolen saw spinal 
orthopedist Todd Albert, who agreed with the treatment the Phillies 
prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Desi Relaford had the cast removed from his right  
wrist. He'll start hitting off a tee next week, and could join the 
team in a limited role soon after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Paul Byrd is on an anti-inflammatory for back

</P>
<P>
	GOLDSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- John Dortch ``Booty'' Lewis Sr., a  
Goldsboro insurance executive whose World War II exploits were 
chronicled in part in the movie ``The Great Escape,'' died Sunday 
of pancreatic cancer. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the United States entered World War II, Lewis joined the  
Royal Canadian Air Force and flew fabric-covered Hawker Hurricane 
fighter planes during Great Britain's darkest days of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Wounded and with his plane badly damaged on a mission over  
France, Lewis managed to get the aircraft back across the English 
Channel and crashed in the British countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	Grounded by the RCAF because of extensive injuries, Lewis  
transferred to the U.S. Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, leading a flight of P-39 Bell Airacobra fighters, he was  
shot down in North Africa and captured after eluding German troops 
in the desert for almost two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent most of the next two years in Germany's Stalag Luft  
III. That was the prison camp from which prisoners of war tunneled 
to freedom in an escape later to be made into ``The Great Escape,'' 
starring Steve McQueen. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the exploits portrayed by McQueen were based on escape  
attempts and other activities by Lewis.

                           *Victor Mature    	
</P>
<P>
	RANCHO SANTA FE, Calif. (AP) -- Victor Mature, the brawny star of  
the 1940s and '50s who played Samson in ``Samson and Delilah'' and 
Doc Holliday in John Ford's ``My Darling Clementine,'' died 
Wednesday of cancer. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Tall, dark-haired and muscular, Mature earned the nickname  
``beautiful hunk of man'' in films like ``One Million B.C.'' and 
``Song of the Islands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While first making his name as a glamour-boy star with a  
devil-may-care attitude, he gradually gained more critical respect 
in the late 1940s in such films as ``Cry of the City'' and ``Kiss 
of Death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared in musicals, Westerns, comedies, historical epics  
and melodramas. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``My Darling Clementine,'' 1946, he was Doc Holliday to Henry  
Fonda's Wyatt Earp. The version of the fabled gunfight at the O.K. 
Corral is considered one of Ford's greatest films. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil B. DeMille's 1949 telling of the saga of Samson and  
Delilah cast Mature and Hedy Lamarr in the title roles. It was a 
smash hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Mature's other films: ``The Shanghai Gesture,'' 1941,  
directed by Josef von Sternberg; ``My Gal Sal,'' 1942, with Rita 
Hayworth; ``I Wake Up Screaming,'' 1941, with Betty Grable; 
``Wabash Avenue,'' 1950, again with Miss Grable; ``The Robe,'' 
1953, as the slave Demetrius; a sequel, ``Demetrius and the 
Gladiators, 1954; and ``Chief Crazy Horse,'' 1954, with Mature in 
the title role.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BBC sports anchor Helen Rollason, who won  
admiration and respect for staying on the air during her two-year 
battle with cancer, died Monday at age 43. 
</P>
<P>
	After Rollason was diagnosed with colon cancer two years ago,  
doctors gave her three months to live. But she turned up for the 
British Broadcasting Corp.'s ``Six O'Clock News'' until recently, 
and last month went to Buckingham Palace in a wheelchair to receive 
an honor from Queen Elizabeth II. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, the BBC aired a documentary about her cancer  
fight called ``Hope for Helen'' in which Rollason allowed cameras 
to follow her around. 
</P>
<P>
	Rollason started her career as a physical education teacher. But  
after she got a chance to go on air as a volunteer for an Essex 
radio station, she moved into sports reporting and never looked 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the first woman to serve as host of ``Grandstand,'' the  
BBC's weekend sports program, and received an award as sports 
anchor of the year in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Actor Victor Mature Dies at 86 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANCHO SANTA FE, Calif. (AP) -- Victor Mature liked to joke that  
he once tried to get into a country club that didn't accept actors 
by saying, ``Hell, I'm no actor, and I've got 28 pictures and a 
scrapbook of reviews to prove it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the brawny actor given the nickname ``beautiful hunk of  
man'' also took his job seriously. ``I just couldn't show it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mature died at the age of 86 after suffering from cancer for  
three years, said a friend, Zollie Volchok. The San Diego County 
coroner's office said it was notified that Mature died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tall, dark-haired and muscular, Mature got his nickname from  
films like ``Samson and Delilah,'' ``One Million B.C.'' and ``Song 
of the Islands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared in musicals, Westerns, comedies, historical epics  
and melodramas before largely retiring from films around 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	While first making his name as a glamour-boy star with a  
devil-may-care attitude, he gradually gained more critical respect 
in the late 1940s in such films as ``Cry of the City'' and ``Kiss 
of Death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946's ``My Darling Clementine,'' he was Doc Holliday to  
Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp. The version of the fabled gunfight at the 
O.K. Corral is considered one of director John Ford's greatest 
films. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil B. DeMille's 1949 telling of the saga of Samson and  
Delilah cast Mature and Hedy Lamarr in the title roles. It was a 
smash hit. 
</P>
<P>
	He was at 20th Century Fox for many years but often worked at  
other studios. ``They turned pictures out like crackerjack,'' he 
told The New York Times in 1971. ```Kiss of Death' got made because 
Fox was one black-and-white picture short on its schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That 1947 film paired Mature with a screen newcomer, Richard  
Widmark. Mature played a thief who turned state's evidence, Widmark 
a psychopathic killer. The film caused a sensation and earned 
Widmark an Academy Award nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Mature's other films: ``The Shanghai Gesture,'' 1941,  
directed by Josef von Sternberg; ``My Gal Sal,'' 1942, with Rita 
Hayworth; ``I Wake Up Screaming,'' 1941, with Betty Grable; 
``Wabash Avenue,'' 1950, with Grable; ``The Robe,'' 1953, as the 
slave Demetrius; a sequel, ``Demetrius and the Gladiators, 1954; 
and ``Chief Crazy Horse,'' 1954, with Mature in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
	Mature was a favorite of reporters during his heyday, always  
available for interviews. He enjoyed deflating the pomposities of 
Hollywood as well as his own image. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his favorite stories concerned the making of ``Samson and  
Delilah.'' DeMille wanted him to wrestle with a tame lion for a 
crucial action scene. The actor refused. ``But Jackie never hurt 
anyone; he doesn't even have any teeth,'' DeMille argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah?'' Mature replied. ``I don't want to be gummed to death,  
either.'' A stunt man tussled with Jackie, and Mature did his 
closeups with a lion skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Careful with his money unless a friend was in need, he invested  
in real estate and retail stores, enabling him to retire 
comfortably before he reached 45. He moved to Rancho Santa Fe, and 
once bragged that he played golf four hours a day, six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	He made only a few film appearances in the past 35 years,  
notably the 1966 Italian farce ``After the Fox,'' in which he 
spoofed his old image; and ``Every Little Crook and Nanny,'' a 1972 
comedy in which he co-starred with Lynn Redgrave. In 1984 he made a 
rare appearance on television, playing Samson's father in a new 
version of ``Samson and Delilah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mature was born Jan. 29, 1913 -- some references say 1915 and  
1916 -- in Louisville, Ky., the son of an Austrian immigrant who 
became a successful businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming to California in the mid-'30s, he studied at the Pasadena  
Playhouse, paying his way with odd jobs because he didn't want to 
rely on his father. He made his screen debut with a small role in 
``The Housekeeper's Daughter,'' 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	At the height of his stardom, Mature dated stars such as  
Hayworth and Lana Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	He was married five times. Survivors include his wife, Lorey, a  
former Chicago opera singer, and their daughter, Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral service was to be held today in Louisville.

<HEADLINE> 16 Hurt in Airport Shuttle Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An airport shuttle bus collided with more  
than a dozen vehicles Tuesday at a major intersection bordering Los 
Angeles International Airport, injuring 16 people and tangling 
morning airport traffic for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine people were hospitalized and six people suffered what  
appeared to be serious injuries, Fire Department spokesman Jim 
Wells said. Seven people were treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no passengers on the Alamo rental car shuttle, said  
Oscar Suris, spokesman for Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based AutoNation 
Inc., parent of Alamo. The driver wasn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus crashed into 16 vehicles, including a car that was  
crushed at a Texaco gas station, narrowly missing pumps. 
</P>
<P>
	Alamo spokeswoman Cheryl Budd said the brakes failed on the bus.  
</P>
<P>
	The crash investigation closed the intersection for hours,  
snarling traffic for blocks and delaying airport-bound travelers.

<HEADLINE> Former Alabama Great Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Riley Smith, who quarterbacked Alabama to a  
national championship in 1934, died Monday after a lengthy illness. 
He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith converted from fullback after the 1933 season and  
quarterbacked the Crimson Tide the next two seasons, earning 
All-America honors. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the Jacobs Award, given annually to the Southeastern  
Conference's top blocker, and is still regarded as one of the best 
blockers in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	He came back from an injury to lead the Tide to impressive  
victories over Georgia and Tennessee as a senior. Against 
Tennessee, he rushed for one touchdown and passed for one. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarterback on offense, safety on defense, punter and  
field-goal kicker, Smith was a member of the National Collegiate 
Football Hall of Fame, National Football Foundation Hall of Fame, 
Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and 
Mobile Sports Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who was from Columbus, Miss., was a good friend and  
teammate of the late Alabama coach Bear Bryant. Bryant was also a 
member of that 1934 team which won the national championship with a 
Rose Bowl victory over Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Bryant and Daddy would talk weekly when Bear was  
coaching and winning national titles at Bama, and he would always 
tell Bear that he wasn't throwing the ball enough,'' said Riley 
Boykin Smith, his surviving son who is commissioner of the state 
Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Smith spent some three years in the NFL, but his  
career was cut short by a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving the Redskins, he became coach at Washington &AMP; Lee.  
He left coaching for World War II and eventually settled in Mobile, 
where he worked in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Services will be held at 11 a.m. Friday in the chapel of Radney  
Funeral Home in Mobile. Burial will follow in Pine Crest Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his son, survivors include daughters Ocllo Smith  
Malone of Birmingham and Sandra Smith Norton of Jackson, Miss.; one 
sister; nine grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.

	Gunman Wounds 5 at L.A. Jewish Center  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A gunman sprayed the lobby of a suburban  
Jewish community center with a 9mm Uzi today, wounding three boys, 
a teen-age girl and a woman, authorities said. An 8-year-old boy 
and the 55-year-old were both in critical condition. Police 
searched the grounds of the North Valley Jewish Community Center 
and the Granada Hills neighborhood for a suspect identified only as 
a white male, said police Cmdr. Dave Kalish. Police did not specify 
the suspect's age. Fire Department spokesman Steve Ruda said he is 
a teen-ager.

	Arafat OKs Israel Withdrawal Delay  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has accepted a  
later date for Israel to carry out a pullback from the West Bank, 
but insists that the government of Ehud Barak subsequently follow 
the timetable laid out in a U.S.-brokered peace pact, a Palestinian 
official said today. That appeared to break an Israeli-Palestinian

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State Department spokesman James P. Rubin  
called for dialogue between India and Pakistan and urged restraint 
after Indian fighter planes shot down a Pakistani surveillance 
aircraft today. Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said 16 
servicemen were killed. Rubin said the United States had no role to 
play in the dispute. India said the aircraft was shot down after it 
crossed into Indian airspace and failed to respond to warnings.

	Dutch To Legalize Mercy Killing  
</P>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The Dutch government published  
plans today to legalize mercy killing under strict guidelines, 
which would allow children as young as 12 to demand and receive 
euthanasia. The plans are expected to gain parliamentary approval 
next year, which would make the Netherlands the first country in 
the world to legalize mercy killing. The new law formalizes 
practices already widely accepted and carried out in the 
Netherlands. Although 3 percent of all Dutch deaths -- 3,600 people 
-- each year are reported as euthanasia, the actual number is 
believed to be double because many physicians fail to report cases.

	250 Bodies Exhumed in Bosnia

<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Forensic experts,  
reconstructing a 1995 massacre in the Bosnian enclave of 
Srebrenica, have finished exhuming about 250 bodies from a mass 
grave, U.N. officials said today. Srebrenica was a Muslim enclave 
in northeast Bosnia. The United Nations declared it a ``safe 
heaven'' but did nothing to prevent Bosnian Serb forces from 
overrunning it in July 1995. The enclave's brutal fall left over 
7,000 Muslim men missing. Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and 
his war-time general Ratko Mladic were indicted for war crimes but 
are at large.

their swimming pool, an apparent drowning that authorities said 
they were treating as an accident. The distraught ``Star Trek'' 
star said she ``meant everything to me.'' Shatner said he found his 
wife, Nerine, 40, at the bottom of a swimming pool when he returned 
home last night. Shatner said he dialed 911, pulled his wife out of 
the pool and administered CPR, but his efforts to revive her and 
similar efforts by emergency personnel were unsuccessful.

	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Tupperware, which for decades relied  
solely on face-to-face sales at parties, today began selling its 
housewares over the Internet. The move online is the latest 
innovation for the company in its efforts to get Tupperware 
containers into the hands of its customers following a year of 
declining sales. Tupperware had $1.1 billion in sales last year. 
Tupperware officials emphasized that the new ventures will

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Scott Layden, whose personnel moves helped  
the Utah Jazz become an NBA contender in the 1990s, has accepted an 
offer to become general manager of the New York Knicks. News

four times his Utah salary. The Knicks have been seeking a GM since 
firing Ernie Grunfeld in April. Knicks president Dave Checketts 
worked with Layden in Utah in the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan To Buy Jets From Airbus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Despite pressure from the United States,  
Taiwan's China Airlines will sign a contract this week with 
Europe's Airbus Industrie for seven A340 jets, the carrier said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., met with Taiwan's Transport  
Minister Lin Feng-cheng on Monday in an attempt to salvage China 
Airlines' abandoned deal to buy 12 Boeing 777 passenger jets for $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lin told Gorton the switch to Airbus aircraft was a business  
decision by the air carrier, unrelated to Taiwan's political feud 
with China that has raised U.S. government concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	China Airlines will sign a contract with Airbus to buy the A340s  
on Thursday, with an option to buy five more, officials said. China 
Airlines also intends to buy seven A330 jets, but officials refused 
to say whether the deal will be signed Thursday as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Airbus contract will come right after China Airlines signs a  
deal to buy 13 747-400 freighters from Boeing, with an option for 
four more, the air carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's package is worth about $2.5 billion, while Airbus will  
be getting about $2 billion. The deals are among Asia's largest in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Boeing and Airbus lobbied hard for the orders.  
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation that China Airlines switched its  
order to Airbus so Taiwan's government could retaliate against a 
toughened U.S. policy toward the island following President Lee 
Teng-hui's recent controversial statehood claim. 
</P>
<P>
	But Taiwanese Premier Vincent Siew said Monday the government  
did not intervene, adding that U.S. lobbyists were scrambling to 
salvage the Boeing deal at least a month before Lee said July 9 
that Beijing must deal with Taiwan on a ``state-to-state'' basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan and China split in a civil war in 1949, but China still  
claims sovereignty over the island.

<HEADLINE> Al Gore Blasts Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is not paying much public  
attention to Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic 
presidential nomination, but doesn't hold back when it comes to 
Republican foes. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the National Urban League on Monday, he blasted the  
GOP's $792 billion GOP tax cut as ``reckless and wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not need a Republican right-wing U-turn back to the  
deficits of the past,'' Gore said. ``Just when we are able to lift 
our people up, the Republicans have proposed another trickle-down 
tragedy to drag us down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Gore differs on many issues with Bradley, who was  
addressing the convention this afternoon, it was Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush who drew Gore's fire on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president never named the Republican front-runner, who  
spoke to the Urban League Sunday, but Bush's record and agenda of 
``compassionate conservatism'' were clearly under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are going to close the opportunity gap in this nation,  
we're going to need a lot more than crumbs of compassion,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an obvious reference to Bush's ``compassionate  
conservatism'' agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh from a meeting with the family of James Byrd Jr., Gore  
called for passage of federal hate crimes legislation to intensify 
prosecution and stiffen penalties for crimes like the fatal 
dragging of Byrd last year in Jasper, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``That heinous crime wounded not only the Byrd family and the  
Jasper community, it wounded the American spirit,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act was allowed to  
die in the Texas Senate, Gore faulted leaders who see no difference 
between hate crimes and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who was criticized for not taking a position on the  
legislation, said during the session that, ``It's hard to 
distinguish between one degree of hate or another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore painted a dim picture of Bush's Texas, citing high drop-out  
rates by black students, a tax system taxed against the working 
poor and the nation's second-highest percentage of uninsured 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here in Texas, can be we be satisfied when African-Americans  
can be twice as likely to drop out of school?'' Gore said, 
referring to Bush's education policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Touting a ``common American agenda,'' the vice president called  
for a census that corrects the omission of millions of blacks and 
Hispanics in 2000, urged passage of the Democratic-sponsored 
Patient's Bill of Rights and pushed for photo IDs for gun buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed a $1 increase in the minimum wage and a  
continuation of affirmative action programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also speaking Monday was the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who appeared on  
a panel titled ``Political Power of the New Millennium'' along with 
Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson urged Urban League members to focus their search for  
equality on money, not race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to close the resources gap,'' Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> Jim Nabors Ready To Hit Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Jim Nabors is ready to hit the stage again after  
being hospitalized earlier this summer for a minor stroke, said an 
assistant to the 69-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabors, who played TV's Gomer Pyle, had a scare in late June  
when he briefly lost movement in one arm and had trouble speaking, 
said Judy Murata. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabors had suffered a transient ischemia attack, or temporary  
tissue anemia caused by a blood clot, Murata said. He underwent a 
few days of tests at a hospital in Honolulu and was discharged in 
good health, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no permanent damage and his motor skills came back  
right away,'' Murata said.

<HEADLINE> Ill 49er Coach Keeps Coaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- Coaching is not just Bobb McKittrick's  
job. It's part of his therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if I didn't have cancer, even if i wasn't sick, when you  
get to be older like I am, it's neat to be around young people, 
like the players,'' said the 49ers' longtime offensive line coach, 
who has cancer of the bile duct. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of them, they're in their 20s. Their music is not my  
music and their movies are not my movies, but anyway, it's kind of 
neat to be around them, maybe even more so when you're sick. 
They've got enthusiasm and vigor. It's upbeat. I'm a coach. It's 
what I do. I want to do this, I can do this and I think, `Jimminy, 
I'm going to be OK.''' 
</P>
<P>
	McKittrick, 63, has been coaching NFL offensive linemen for the  
past 28 years, including the last 21 in San Francisco. He has been 
one of the constants in the long-running 49ers success story that 
began in 1981, when they won the first of five Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Last January, shortly after the 49ers playoff loss at Atlanta,  
McKittrick learned that he has bile duct cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has been hospitalized on seven different  
occasions. He has endured rounds of chemotherapy and radiation 
treatment in the spring that left him weak and gaunt. He has lost 
about 25 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	It was hoped his diseased liver could be replaced with a donated  
one, but doctors in April ruled out a transplant when they 
discovered the cancer had spread beyond the duct. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the discouraging news, McKittrick showed up at the  
team's minicamp in May and continued his coaching from a golf cart. 
The team also gave McKittrick some help, moving Pat Morris from 
coaching tight ends to the offensive line and bringing in former 
lineman Guy McIntyre as an intern. 
</P>
<P>
	At the team's training camp, McKittrick has been feeling a lot  
better. The golf cart is still a constant presence, but he's 
getting out now and then, talking to his linemen and demonstrating 
blocking techniques, though not as much as he did before. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, McKittrick said, in some ways he's a better coach now.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little different perspective, particularly with Pat  
Morris and Guy McIntyre doing in the sense the leg work that I used 
to do. I can observe maybe a little better than I did when I was 
more hands-on and so close that you couldn't see other things 
around. So in some ways, I probably have a better feel for some 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just about his only concessions to cancer are turning in early,  
missing the club's final team meeting of the day and sleeping a 
little later, missing the first morning get-together by coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope he's not doing too much,'' 49ers coach Steve  
Mariuci said. ``It's incredible. He doesn't have to do this. He has 
alternatives in his life. Talk about leading by example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKittrick said the work isn't bad and the 49ers have allowed  
him to continue under a reduced coaching schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``All it is is eat, sleep, exercise and get fresh air,'' he  
said. ``It's a pretty good deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the reality of McKittrick's battle is never far away.  
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to undergo an MRI today so doctors can  
determine whether his finger-sized tumor has shrunk, stayed the 
same or gotten bigger. The results were expected Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was to have a 3 1/2-inch shunt in his diseased duct  
replaced. The shunt acts as a drain, but it must be replaced about 
every three months. 
</P>
<P>
	McKittrick said he's staying positive and has refused to even  
entertain the notion, ``Why me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shoot, here I am 63 years old. I've got five Super Bowl rings,  
been to Pro Bowls, American Bowls. I've had a great life. It would 
not be fair to say, `Why me?' I'd be ashamed to even say `Why me?' 
when there are young people and so many others who are lot worse 
off than I am.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton and Gore Campaign Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inseparable was one label for President  
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday. Together, they made 
three fund-raising events, three meals, a tour and a roundtable. 
</P>
<P>
	Insufferable, said Republicans.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have been together under all kinds of circumstances,''  
Clinton said at one of the events. ``They were times of great 
elation, times of great triumphs, times of defeat, times of 
frustration, times of intense difficulty. But we've also been 
together in personal ways. I talk to him about everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's aid to Gore's presidential campaign was spelled out in  
their identical Tuesday calendars: 
</P>
<P>
	--12:15 p.m. Joint tour of Washington-area factory to highlight  
Gore's New Markets Initiative for small businesses and the economic 
success ``that the vice president and I have developed over the 
last 6 1/2 years,'' as Clinton put it. During the tour, Clinton 
learned how to make a wet mop. ``I'm always looking for new skills 
since I have to apply some of these things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--12:35 p.m. His-and-his presentation to a business roundtable;  
message same as above. Share a limo back to the White House and 
then huddle over lunch in Clinton's Oval Office suite. 
</P>
<P>
	--6:10 p.m. Address two dozen Democratic fund-raisers, including  
Seagram Chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr., in front of news cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	--6:45 p.m. Eject reporters, schmooze same fund-raisers over  
chicken on wild rice dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	--7:30 p.m. Running behind schedule, nix speech to different set  
of high rollers, New Jersey Nets basketball star Jayson Williams 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
	--8:00 p.m. Repeat closed-door dinner, this time with grilled  
salmon on crabmeat hash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to have just 25 in each dinner because the more you  
get into a room, the less intimate it becomes,'' Gore spokesman 
Roger Salazar explained about the two supper events. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, Clinton and Gore paired up for the first time on  
the Campaign 2000 trail, picking up more than $300,000 in Arkansas 
and trying to put to rest lingering reports of dissension between 
them. More joint fund-raisers are planned. 
</P>
<P>
	But no money changed hands Tuesday night. Instead, said Salazar,  
the receptions and dinners were intended to energize the people 
organizing future fund-raisers, thank those who already have and 
recruit new blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need your help,'' said Gore. ``The decision will be  
contested because change always is resisted and we have been 
bringing change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, Republican National Committee chairman Jim  
Nicholson mocked up a Gore 2000 campaign poster with the caption 
``Bosom Buddies'' under a photo of Gore hugging Clinton with both 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release, Nicholson recalled Gore's statement in June,  
as he launched his presidential campaign, that Clinton's Oval 
Office affair with a White House intern was ``inexcusable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now Gore and Clinton are back on the prowl, as a fund-raising  
tag team, working to shake down Democrat fat cats,'' Nicholson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Begala, a veteran of the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign and a  
former White House political strategist, said Gore is smart to 
exploit the president's ``unmatched ability to raise issues and 
money'' and to rally Democrats. Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley 
is challenging Gore for the party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	But, added Begala, a Gore booster, ``You don't want them joined  
at the hip. Gore has to stand up and define himself with some 
force.''

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Suspends 2 Racial Prank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASCAR stars Terry Labonte and Derrike Cope fired two employees  
for a racial prank in which one of their workers wore a sheet over 
his head like a Klansman and confronted a black colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses characterized the July 8 episode at the New Hampshire  
International Speedway as a joke by two white motorcoach drivers 
that went too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just needs to be understood that there is a line that  
cannot be crossed, joking or otherwise,'' said Kevin Triplett, 
NASCAR's director of operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the two motorcoach drivers were not employed by NASCAR,  
the sanctioning body could only suspend their licenses, which is 
the most severe punishment within its power. That means the two men 
cannot enter any area of a track over which NASCAR has 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR did not announce the suspensions until its investigation  
was complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte and Cope said the two motorcoach drivers had confronted  
a coachman for another NASCAR driver, Jeremy Mayfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Cope's driver was identified by team and NASCAR sources as Mike  
``Grumpy'' Culberson, and Labonte's as Ray Labbe. Spokesmen for the 
teams said neither former coachman planned any comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The black coachman, David Scott, also would not comment,  
according to a spokesman for Mayfield's team. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the two men wore the sheet over his head and the other  
accompanied him when they confronted Scott three days before the 
Jiffy Lube 300, according to NASCAR and team sources who spoke on 
condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behavior like this simply cannot be tolerated in today's  
society,'' Cope said in a statement. ``This was an example of 
grievous behavior that I do not condone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 Daytona 500 champion called it ``an ignorant act'' that  
left him no recourse but dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``These actions are deplorable and will not be tolerated,'' said  
Labonte, a two-time Winston Cup champion. ``When this situation was 
brought to my attention, the employee was released immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach drivers are employed by most of the circuit's top racers  
who stay at the tracks during events. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR said it would not stand for any racial discrimination.  
</P>
<P>
	``Harassment of any type -- racial, religious, whatever, will not  
be tolerated in any form,'' Triplett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Auto racing is a predominantly white sport, and NASCAR's top  
division has had just one full-time black driver in its history, 
and only a sprinkling of black crew members. Few blacks are seen 
among the vast audiences at race tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Aware of that image, NASCAR has been working to create minority  
interest. Former basketball great Julius Erving and former football 
star Joe Washington have formed a team, while former Olympic 
champion Jackie Joyner Kersee recently announced she is planning to 
be part of a new team. 
</P>
<P>
	The only black driver to reach NASCAR's top level was the late  
Wendell Scott, who got his lone career victory in 1963. His son, 
Franklin, criticized the sport as being exclusionary during his 
father's posthumous induction earlier this year into the 
International Motorsports Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	One driver who has spoken out about the racial makeup of auto  
racing is Frank Kimmel, reigning champion of the second-tier ARCA 
racing circuit, which is not affiliated with NASCAR. He has had 
some black crew members who have talked openly about the difficulty 
of being minorities in auto racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't like to admit it, but it is a redneck sport,'' Kimmel  
said.

<HEADLINE> McKesson HBOC Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- McKesson HBOC Inc., the drug and  
medical-supplies distributor plagued by false income statements, 
reported Tuesday that first quarter earnings were up 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings of 30 cents per share were 4 cents below consensus  
estimates of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. The San 
Francisco-based company's stock fell nearly 7 percent Tuesday to 
close at $29.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter ended June 30, McKesson's net income before  
special charges was $86.4 million. In the same quarter last year, 
net income was $80.1 million. Revenues rose 22 percent, to $6.5 
billion on strength in McKesson's pharmaceutical distribution and 
medical-surgical businesses. The company reported it was hurt by 
lower sales of medical-care information software and hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of improper accounting, McKesson was forced last month  
to lower its net income reports by a total of over $191 million for 
fiscal years 1997 through 1999. The accounting problems were due to 
improperly reported software sales at HBOC, a software company 
acquired by McKesson in January. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson's board of directors fired Chairman Charles W. McCall,  
who led HBOC before McKesson bought it. Mark A. Pulido, president 
and chief executive of the merged company, and Chief Financial 
Officer Richard H. Hawkins both resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Chiarelli, an analyst for J.P. Morgan, said the company's  
failure to meet expectations for the quarter was due in part to 
company executives' reluctance to talk openly with analysts in the 
wake of the reporting problems.

<P>
	It will probably take one to two years for McKesson to regain  
investor confidence, Chiarelli predicted.

<P>
	``They have a very good chances of turning this thing around and  
being on a very good growth path,'' said Chiarelli.

<HEADLINE> NY Police Pull Woodstock Photos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- State Police officials have removed news photos  
from their Woodstock '99 Web pages, the latest step in a 
controversy that brought complaints from news organizations over 
use of the images in police work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we took the pictures off was because they didn't  
provide any more leads,'' said Lt. Jamie Mills, a State Police 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 news photos were posted July 30 without permission and  
removed Friday after a week of protests by media groups to police 
and Gov. George Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
	The source of most of the photos -- The Associated Press and  
Syracuse Online, affiliated with Syracuse Newspapers -- had demanded 
the pictures be removed, arguing that their use violated copyright 
and blurred the traditional separation between journalism and 
police work. 
</P>
<P>
	State Police had hoped the photographs would encourage the  
public to identify suspects in the rioting and looting that marred 
the end of the Woodstock concert. As of Monday, none had led to an 
arrest, Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
	New photos have been posted. Mills said most of those were taken  
by state employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Barrantes, a State Police lawyer, said the state had not  
backed away from its argument that it was legal and fair to post 
the news photos on the Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Penchina, a lawyer for the AP, said the news organization  
would ``remain vigilant in making sure that its intellectual 
property is not misused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We view the fact that the photos have been taken down as a  
victory not only in protecting AP's copyright interests but also in 
avoiding further erosion of the line between investigation and 
reporting done by journalists and the investigatory arm of the 
state,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Various news organizations complained about the posting of the  
photos in letters to police or Pataki, including The New York Press 
Club, The Deadline Club, The New York State Associated Press 
Association, the New York Daily News, The New York Times and The 
Buffalo News. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis D. Boccardi, president and CEO of the AP, had written that  
the role and responsibility of State Police was clear and important 
but that it was equally important to separate police and journalism 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If our photographers are to be seen as proxies for state  
police investigators, they will be placed in danger,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Police officials say the photos have produced more than  
150 e-mail responses. So far, police have arrested 39 people on 
charges ranging from disorderly conduct to sodomy. No one has been 
arrested in the five rapes reported at the event or in other major 
Woodstock-related crimes.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton and Gore Campaign Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inseparable was one label for President  
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday. Together, they made 
three fund-raising events, three meals, a tour and a roundtable. 
</P>
<P>
	Insufferable, said Republicans.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have been together under all kinds of circumstances,''  
Clinton said at one of the events. ``They were times of great 
elation, times of great triumphs, times of defeat, times of 
frustration, times of intense difficulty. But we've also been 
together in personal ways. I talk to him about everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's aid to Gore's presidential campaign was spelled out in  
their identical Tuesday calendars: 
</P>
<P>
	--12:15 p.m. Joint tour of Washington-area factory to highlight  
Gore's New Markets Initiative for small businesses and the economic 
success ``that the vice president and I have developed over the 
last 6 1/2 years,'' as Clinton put it. During the tour, Clinton 
learned how to make a wet mop. ``I'm always looking for new skills 
since I have to apply some of these things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--12:35 p.m. His-and-his presentation to a business roundtable;  
message same as above. Share a limo back to the White House and 
then huddle over lunch in Clinton's Oval Office suite. 
</P>
<P>
	--6:10 p.m. Address two dozen Democratic fund-raisers, including  
Seagram Chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr., in front of news cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	--6:45 p.m. Eject reporters, schmooze same fund-raisers over  
chicken on wild rice dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	--7:30 p.m. Running behind schedule, nix speech to different set  
of high rollers, New Jersey Nets basketball star Jayson Williams 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
	--8:00 p.m. Repeat closed-door dinner, this time with grilled  
salmon on crabmeat hash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to have just 25 in each dinner because the more you  
get into a room, the less intimate it becomes,'' Gore spokesman 
Roger Salazar explained about the two supper events. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, Clinton and Gore paired up for the first time on  
the Campaign 2000 trail, picking up more than $300,000 in Arkansas 
and trying to put to rest lingering reports of dissension between 
them. More joint fund-raisers are planned. 
</P>
<P>
	But no money changed hands Tuesday night. Instead, said Salazar,  
the receptions and dinners were intended to energize the people 
organizing future fund-raisers, thank those who already have and 
recruit new blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need your help,'' said Gore. ``The decision will be  
contested because change always is resisted and we have been 
bringing change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, Republican National Committee chairman Jim  
Nicholson mocked up a Gore 2000 campaign poster with the caption 
``Bosom Buddies'' under a photo of Gore hugging Clinton with both 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release, Nicholson recalled Gore's statement in June,  
as he launched his presidential campaign, that Clinton's Oval 
Office affair with a White House intern was ``inexcusable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now Gore and Clinton are back on the prowl, as a fund-raising  
tag team, working to shake down Democrat fat cats,'' Nicholson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Begala, a veteran of the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign and a  
former White House political strategist, said Gore is smart to 
exploit the president's ``unmatched ability to raise issues and 
money'' and to rally Democrats. Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley 
is challenging Gore for the party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	But, added Begala, a Gore booster, ``You don't want them joined  
at the hip. Gore has to stand up and define himself with some 
force.''

<HEADLINE> Dole Not Distracted by Bush's Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole  
on Tuesday said she's not distracted by Texas Gov. George W. Bush's 
huge financial edge as she seeks to counter his financial muscle 
with brand-new voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at history,'' Mrs. Dole said, in arguing that money can't  
be the sole basis for a bid for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The former head of the American Red Cross slogged through four  
Des Moines campaign stops seeking to lure new voters to the polls, 
and to a big straw poll on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are coming to the events, it's not a matter of having to  
pull them in. They are there,'' Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	At campaign stops, Mrs. Dole carefully positions herself at the  
door after speaking, shaking hands and speaking with all who 
attend. At the same time, aides are busily scurrying around with 
pledge cards, seeking to sign up backers for the Saturday straw 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowds are heavily female and young, and Mrs. Dole said  
that's who she is targeting as she seeks to broaden the Republican 
base. While she claimed progress, the success rate of aides was 
well under 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a tough task, because straw polls and precinct caucuses are  
new to many who attend her events. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have to inform people and educate them in terms of the  
process,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``We're trying to do that as effectively 
as we can, help to get to know the steps you have to follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Dole doesn't focus her campaign strictly on her  
gender, she points to a series of firsts she's had that appeal to 
women voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I think it's important to focus on, what you can  
bring to the table,'' she said. ``It's not a liability. What it 
shows is you've been able to break the glass ceiling in many 
instances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's time to break this glass ceiling,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	With her well-heeled political name and long resume, Mrs. Dole  
said she has the strength to survive the looming straw poll even as 
she works to pull together a turnout operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a do-or-die for us on Saturday,'' she said,  
``but we want to do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said a key to her campaign is electability. Most polls show  
her ahead of Vice President Al Gore and she claimed that adds 
substance to her effort. Bush also leads Gore in head-to-head 
matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not distracted by that,'' she said, noting candidates like  
Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, businessman Ross Perot and former Texas Gov. 
John Connally had plenty of money, but didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have the money he has, but I've got the vision, I've  
got the experience, I've got the ideas on the issues,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you keep going forward with your campaign and not  
distracted,'' said Mrs. Dole. ``It's early and probably less than 5 
percent of Americans across the country are even engaged in 
presidential politics at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her comments came in a campaign swing throughout the central  
part of the state, one of a long list of contenders stumping in the 
state and pointing toward a big straw poll on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm energized,'' Mrs. Dole said.

<HEADLINE> Shatner's Wife Found Dead in Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor William Shatner's wife drowned in their  
pool while home alone, and police said Tuesday the death was 
accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	Former model Nerine Shatner, 40, and the ``Star Trek'' star had  
been married less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``My beautiful wife is dead,'' Shatner, 68, said tearfully when  
he briefly stepped out of his gated hillside estate in the affluent 
Studio City neighborhood. ``She meant everything to me. Her 
laughter, her tears and her joy will remain with me the rest of my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner told police he came home about 9:30 p.m. Monday and  
found his wife at the bottom of the deep end of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Shatner dove into the pool, dragged his wife out of the  
pool and called 911 and was advised by paramedics to perform CPR,'' 
police Lt. Adam Bercovici said. 
</P>
<P>
	When paramedics arrived ``she was beyond our help,'' Fire  
Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was scheduled for Wednesday. However, Detective Mike  
Coffey said there was no evidence of foul play, and that an 
investigation showed Mrs. Shatner had drowned accidentally in the 
short time she was home alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shatners were married in November 1997. It was his third  
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an account of the wedding in People magazine, he  
vowed to her: ``I pledge allegiance to you, Nerine, my queen.'' 
Referring to the ring he placed on her finger, he said, ``When it 
is dark and there is trouble, you need but wave that bauble and 
there will be light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner, best known as Capt. James T. Kirk on the 1960s science  
fiction show ``Star Trek'' and the ``Star Trek'' movies, has also 
starred in the TV police drama ``T.J. Hooker'' and hosted ``Rescue 
911.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also has written a series of science fiction books.

<HEADLINE> McRae Added to Blue Jays Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Toronto Blue Jays placed first baseman  
David Segui on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday to make room for 
Brian McRae. 
</P>
<P>
	Segui fractured a knuckle Saturday at Texas when he was hit on  
the back of his right hand by a grounder from Mark McLemore. The 
move was retroactive to Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The swelling has really gone down today, compared to what it  
was yesterday,'' Segui said before the Blue Jays faced the 
Minnesota Twins at the Metrodome. ``I even lifted weights today, 
but it's still going to take two weeks to heal properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injured hand has been put in a splint.  
</P>
<P>
	McRae, acquired Monday in a trade from Colorado, singled off  
Brad Radke in the first inning in his first at-bat with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	He was picked up from the Rockies for a player to be named, as  
Toronto looks to strengthen its roster for the wild-card playoff 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Segui was batting .297 with 10 home runs and 42 RBI in 97 games  
before his injury.

<HEADLINE> Institute Wants All Knowledge on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- While entrepreneurs and investors worry about how  
to make money from the Internet, Kevin Marsh has a different goal: 
perfect knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsh hopes to put mankind's accumulated knowledge within a few  
keystrokes of anyone with a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine what would happen if all the things that people know  
were recorded online and indexed for easy retrieval. Any question, 
any curiosity, any interest could be quickly and efficiently 
satisfied,'' Marsh, a library scientist, mused to The Dallas 
Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the stuff that keeps me up at night thinking.''  
</P>
<P>
	Marsh runs a nonprofit group, the Information Access Institute  
(www.information.org), from a former blacksmith's shop next to his 
turn-of-the-century home near Georgetown. The institute helps 
libraries and museums put what librarians call ``knowledge 
records'' online. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsh is helping a Web site that will display a complete  
collection of historic Texas constitutions from a collection at the 
University of Texas, and he's consulting with the Florida State 
Photographic Archive and Texas museums to help catalog their 
collections and put them on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``People fret about all the bad stuff that's on the Internet,''  
Marsh said. ``But it's like New York: Everything from museums to 
red-light districts. The way we fight the red-light districts on 
the Internet is not by censorship, but by putting more of the good 
stuff online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marsh said that's the best way to make the Internet a tool for  
progress, and he pointed to medical information on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients can quickly learn and help their doctors gather  
information on obscure diseases,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the institute is to catalog all human knowledge, however, it  
might have to do it on a shoestring. In a world of Internet 
enterprises worth millions of dollars, the institute last year had 
a budget of $60,000, mostly earned for consulting work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest clients so far are museums, and they don't have a  
lot of money,'' Marsh said.

<HEADLINE> 5 Grand Slams in One Day Is Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Baseball's biggest hit had its biggest night.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in 129 years of major league baseball, five  
grand slams were hit in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Tatis of the St. Louis Cardinals and Jose Vidro of the  
Montreal Expos got it started Monday night. Then Mike Lowell of the 
Florida Marlins connected, Bernie Williams of the New York Yankees 
followed and Jay Buhner of the Seattle Mariners set the record. 
</P>
<P>
	It took approximately 20,000 days of major league games to  
accomplish the feat. 
</P>
<P>
	Four grand slams were hit in one day many times since major  
league baseball began in 1871, but never five. The last time four 
were hit was July 28, 1998, when Sammy Sosa, Gabe Alvarez, Darrin 
Jackson and Ray Lankford connected. 
</P>
<P>
	This has been a season of slams in the big leagues. The five  
raised the majors' total to 96 -- the record of 141 was set in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not necessarily the quality or lack of quality of  
pitching, it's the style,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``I 
think pitchers do not want the guy to hit the ball, so it's ball 
one, ball two and then you've got to come down the middle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After becoming the first player to hit two slams in the same  
inning on April 23 at Los Angeles, Tatis hit the third of his 
career on Billy Brewer's first pitch of the fourth inning during a 
12-6 win at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	With three slams this year, Tatis tied Jim Bottomley (1925) and  
Keith Hernandez (1977) for the Cardinals' record. Tatis is 7-for-10 
with 22 RBIs when hitting with the bases loaded this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Vidro connected on his first pitch from Carlos Almanzar in the  
sixth inning of the Expos' 8-0 win over visiting San Diego. It was 
his first grand slam in the majors and Montreal's first since Aug. 
27, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell hit his first career grand slam on a 3-1 pitch in the  
eighth inning against San Francisco's John Johnstone, who had just 
relieved starter Livan Hernandez. The home run tied the score at 
4-4, and Florida went on to beat the Giants 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' sixth career slam came at Oakland on a full-count  
pitch by reliever Mike Oquist, capping an eight-run second inning 
that gave the New York Yankees an 8-0 lead in a 12-8 win over the 
Athletics. Williams started toward first after taking a 2-2 pitch 
for a ball, mistakenly believing it was ball four, then returned to 
the plate as his teammates laughed in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was like, `Oh my God, this is one of the most embarrassing  
moments of my career,''' Williams said. ``Talk about going from 
goat to hero in a snap. I'm just glad I did something to erase what 
was on everybody's mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland catcher Mike Macfarlane turned to plate umpire John  
Shulock as Williams circled the bases and asked, ``Can't we have 
ball four?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner, who had been 0-for-4 with the bases loaded this year,  
connected in the sixth inning at Safeco Field on a 3-1 pitch from 
John Snyder of the White Sox. The homer gave the Mariners a 6-3 
lead in a 6-4 win over Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love how in this game you are a goat one minute, and then  
you can become the hero in the next minute,'' Buhner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into Tuesday's games, 57 slams had been hit in the AL this  
season and 39 in the NL. Both leagues set records in 1996, with 81 
slams in the AL and 60 in the NL.

<HEADLINE> Carnie Wilson Has Surgery on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Singer and former talk show host Carnie Wilson  
gave an unusual performance -- a live broadcast via the Internet of 
her gastric bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, the 31-year-old daughter of Beach Boy Brian Wilson, said  
prior to Tuesday's surgery that she was ``morbidly obese'' and the 
procedure provided a permanent solution to weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so obese to the fact that I could die. That's really what  
it is. I could have a massive heart attack,'' she said in a 
videotaped interview provided on the Web site 
www.adoctorinyourhouse.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery was performed at Alvarado Hospital Medical Center by  
a team of doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people who tried to see the surgery weren't successful  
because the Internet server couldn't handle the demand, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. The Web site features celebrities and their 
health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, part of the now-defunct Wilson Phillips trio, said she  
has battled weight problems since childhood, craving sugar to the 
point of sneaking into the kitchen to eat powdered cake mix.

<HEADLINE> Couch Impressing Browns with Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Two hours, two days, two weeks or two months?  
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Tim Couch will become the Cleveland Browns' starting  
quarterback. It's not if. It's when. 
</P>
<P>
	But following the rookie's sensational NFL debut Monday night,  
the beginning of the Tim Couch Era in Cleveland might come sooner 
than anyone expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he continues to play the way he has been,'' Browns coach  
Chris Palmer said Tuesday, ``it will be an interesting preseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interesting indeed. The Browns wanted to bring Couch, their No.  
1 overall pick in April's college draft, along slowly in his first 
season, allowing him to develop behind starter Ty Detmer before 
making him the No. 1 QB. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was their future, the team insisted.  
</P>
<P>
	But following Couch's 11-for-17, 137-yard performance when he  
moved the Browns up and down the field like a seasoned veteran in 
Cleveland's 20-17 overtime win against the Dallas Cowboys in the 
Hall of Fame game, the Browns may have to rethink their timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media is trying to set a date,'' Palmer said. ``Generally,  
our feeling was if we had him up and running by the middle of the 
(regular) season, management and everybody involved with the 
program would be very happy. But I'm not sure he isn't on a faster 
track than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch does seem to be on a runaway escalator to the top after  
barely three weeks of pro practice. He seems to get better every 
day in training camp, and Monday night he showcased his talents for 
Browns fans and a national TV audience for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the Browns aren't ready to name him their starter just  
yet, Couch sure looked like he was. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there is a hype,'' said Palmer, who admitted he has  
been surprised by Couch's quick development. ``To say it's going to 
happen at the end of training camp, I don't know whether I could 
say that. It could happen two weeks from now or it could happen at 
the end of the season. I will say this, I'm very pleased with what 
he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first pro game, Couch showed why the Browns gave him a  
seven-year, $59 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing Detmer early in the second quarter, Couch threw an  
incomplete pass on his first attempt before connecting on 10 
straight passes -- one a 24-yard TD to rookie wideout Kevin Johnson, 
a combination Cleveland fans hope to see hook up many times in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, some of Couch's work came against Dallas' second- and  
third-unit defenses. But he showed poise in the pocket, took a 
couple of big hits and showed quickness escaping pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the knocks on Couch, who skipped his senior season at  
Kentucky, was a lack of speed. The other was arm strength, but with 
a few deep balls, Couch showed he has all the arm he needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good out there and it was nice to get that first TD out  
of the way,'' Couch said after the game. ``But I'm not where I want 
to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer didn't get to bed following his first NFL game as a head  
coach until after 3 a.m. He was up again at 5, but before leaving 
for work, he caught a graphic on ESPN that showed how Couch fared 
in his first game compared to Jeff George, Drew Bledsoe and Peyton 
Manning -- other No. 1 picks -- in their pro debuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were not as good as his,'' Palmer said of Couch.  
</P>
<P>
	Palmer began noticing a big difference in Couch last week during  
training camp. He saw a more polished player, one becoming 
comfortable with the pro offense and more confident in his ability 
as a passer and leader. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, Palmer said Couch's teammates picked up on the  
same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one of the things that Tim did last night was that  
other players took notice,'' Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer was particularly impressed with Couch's ability to run  
the offense no matter the line of scrimmage or down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased with the way Couch managed the game,'' Palmer  
said. ``I expected Ty to get us in to the right situations. I 
didn't know if Tim, under the lights, would be able to do that. He 
took a timeout and didn't let the clock run out. That shows 
tremendous awareness.''

<HEADLINE> Race-Based Busing Request Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A federal judge has denied the request of a group  
of white parents to end race-based busing in the city's schools by 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston School Committee voted last month to end racial  
assignments for the school year beginning September 2000, but four 
white families said that wasn't soon enough. The parents said their 
children were being denied their first choice of schools because of 
racial considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a hearing last week, they asked U.S. District Court Judge  
Nancy Gertner for a preliminary injunction to revise the busing 
policy by the start of classes on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	The injunction would have affected children entering  
kindergarten and first-grade, as well as transfer students and 
those on waiting lists for their top school choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Gertner said Monday the injunction would inflict ``substantial  
disruption'' on the school assignment plan. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials had said there was simply no time to implement  
it in a matter of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the outgoing Boston plan, children are assigned to schools  
based on race; the proximity of the child's home to the school; 
whether he or she has any siblings there; and the results of a 
yearly school choice lottery. Under the new plan, effective in 
September 2000, race will no longer be considered. 
</P>
<P>
	The outgoing policy emerged out of a federal desegregation court  
order 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston schools Superintendent Thomas Payzant said he was pleased  
with Gertner's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means that there won't be disappointment for students who  
already have received their assignments,'' he said. ``It means 
there will be no disruptions for families.''

<HEADLINE>  Brazil, Germany Bid for World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Brazil brought a squad of soccer  
heroes, and Germany hosted a beer fest at FIFA headquarters as the 
two countries made their bids to host the 2006 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil and Germany were the last of five countries to make their  
pitches on Tuesday for the 2006 World Cup, the most coveted soccer 
event on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Also presenting to the FIFA were South Africa, England and  
Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	After Monday's presentations by South Africa, accessorized by a  
chanting, dancing Zulu warrior, and England, who flew in singing 
school children, Brazil pumped up its campaign with a squad of 
football heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to revive a fading bid, Brazil recruited superstar  
Ronaldo, as well as football legends Dunga, Zico and Carlos Alberto 
Torres. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, meanwhile, hosted a beer fest, complete with pretzels,  
white sausage and a Bavarian accordion band on the FIFA 
headquarters' lakeside terrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, fighting off negative publicity from football legend  
Pele's recent criticism of the bid, dismissed the former-player's 
disapproval, dispelling speculation it would harm the nation's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the bid is bigger than Pele,'' said Torres, who was on  
the winning squad with Pele at the World Cup in Mexico in 1970. 
``I've known Pele for the past 40 years and I'm sure he will join 
us when he gets to know how serious we are with this project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With South America last hosting the event in 1978, the  
Brazilians felt it would be unfair for Africa to get the next World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It needs to go where it is most loved,'' added Torres. ``If  
you had a first basketball World Cup, it would absolutely have to 
go to the United States. It only makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil also insisted it had gained full governmental backing.  
</P>
<P>
	The German delegation, led by former football great Franz  
Beckenbauer, underlined its organizational skills, modern 
facilities and technical superiority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody still has a chance,'' said Beckenbauer, the captain  
of the 1974 German team that won the World Cup title at home and 
coach of the 1990 side that captured the title in Italy. ``Our job 
is now to convince everybody that Germany is the best place for the 
World Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, South Africa made en emotional appeal to host the  
continent's first World Cup, evoking the nation's troubled, 
turbulent past. The nation insists it has the necessary 
infrastructure to host a World Cup, and spent considerable time 
addressing the issue of safety and security. 
</P>
<P>
	The English, who are hoping to host a World Cup for the first  
time in 40 years, jetted in a 135-strong corps for a half-hour 
presentation and press interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco made its third bid in an attempt to become the first  
African nation to host the World Cup. It has been speculated, 
however, that it may pull out of the running following King 
Hassan's death. 
</P>
<P>
	With FIFA President Blatter repeatedly expressing his wish for  
the 2006 World Cup to go to the African continent for the first 
time, South Africa is being considered the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-member Executive Committee will make its final vote on  
the 2006 host in July 2000.

<HEADLINE> 3 Newsmagazines Help CBS Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS had the top three newsmagazines in the  
ratings last week for the first time since the premiere of ``60 
Minutes II'' in January, leading the network to an easy prime-time 
win for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The venerable ``60 Minutes'' was the week's most-watched  
program, drawing an estimated 13.3 million viewers. ``60 Minutes 
II'' on Wednesday and the summertime ``Monday Mysteries'' edition 
of ``48 Hours'' also both made the week's top 10 shows. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 6.7 rating and 13 share, Nielsen Media  
Research said Tuesday. NBC was second with a 5.8 rating and 11 
share, ABC had a 5.4 rating and 10 share and Fox had a 4.0 rating 
and 8 share. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's showdown between golfers Tiger Woods and David Duval had  
an average audience of 9.7 million, making it the 17th-rated 
program of the week. ABC estimated more than 20 million people 
tuned in to at least some of the unusual prime-time golf special. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours of prime-time rock 'n' roll didn't go over well on  
Fox. Its ``Best of Woodstock '99'' special finished in 84th place 
for the week, with only 4.9 million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.3 rating and 4  
share, UPN had a 1.6 rating and 3 share and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
2. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news ratings race  
for the second straight week with a 7.0 rating and 16 share. The 
``NBC Nightly News'' had a 6.8 rating and 16 share, and the ``CBS 
Evening News'' was at 5.7 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Aug. 2-8, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 9.6; ``Frasier'' special, NBC, 
9.4; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 8.8; ``Friends,'' NBC, 8.8; ``CBS Sunday 
Movie: Stolen Women, Captured Hearts,'' CBS, 8.7; ``Just Shoot Me'' 
special, NBC, 8.5; ``CBS Wednesday Movie: Undue Influence, Part 
Two,'' CBS, 8.4; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 8.1; ``60 Minutes 
II,'' CBS, 7.9; ``48 Hours-Monday,'' CBS, 7.7.

	Thunderstorms spread across the Gulf Coast and over isolated  
sections of the West on Tuesday, and showers rolled across the dry 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered thunderstorms and showers developed from southern  
Louisiana along the Gulf Coast into Florida, and grew more numerous 
during the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Those thunderstorms also spread up the lower Mississippi Valley,  
across wide areas of Louisiana and Mississippi into Arkansas, and 
across much of the Florida Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	Another area of showers and a few widely scattered thunderstorms  
moved northward across the West, extending from northern California 
across Nevada and Utah into Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the heaviest rainfall was concentrated in central New  
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northeastern quarter of the nation, an area of low

<HEADLINE> EU Unemployment Holds at 9.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Unemployment in the European Union held  
steady at 9.4 percent in June, unchanged from May but down from 10 
percent in June 1998, the EU's statistics office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 11 euro-zone nations, unemployment remained at 10.3  
percent, as in May, according to the Eurostat monthly report. In 
June 1998, the unemployment rate in the euro-zone nations was 10.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurostat noted that the EU's unemployment was about double the  
rates in its main trading partners, with the U.S. jobless rate 
standing at 4.3 percent and Japan's at 4.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Luxembourg continued to register the lowest unemployment in the  
EU, at 2.8 percent. Spain was highest at 16.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Eurostat gave the following figures for June for the 15 EU  
countries, with May figures in brackets: 
</P>
<P>
	Luxembourg, 2.8 percent (2.9 percent); Austria, 4.3 percent (4.3  
percent); Denmark, 4.5 percent (4.5 percent); Portugal, 4.6 percent 
(4.7 percent); Ireland 6.7 percent (6.8 percent); Sweden, 7 percent 
(6.8 percent); Belgium, 9 percent (9 percent); Germany, 9.1 percent 
(9.1 percent); Finland, 10 percent (10.3 percent); France, 11.1 
percent (11.2 percent), Spain 16.1 percent (16.2 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	A June figure was unavailable for the Netherlands, which  
registered 3.3 percent in May, steady from April. The latest 
figures from Italy and Britain were from April, when Britain posted 
6.2 percent unemployment, down from 6.3 in March, and Italy 
registered 12 percent, up from 11.9.

<HEADLINE> Murderer Executed in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A ninth-grade dropout who shot a bank  
teller to death the day after she picked out her wedding dress was 
executed by injection on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Dwayne Dunn, 39, was the third man executed in Texas in  
the last week and the 19th this year. Three more are set to die in 
the next eight days. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn declined to make a final statement. When the warden asked  
whether he's like to say anything, Dunn shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 17, 1980, Dunn walked into a Houston-area bank where he  
had been seen before as a customer. This time he was armed with a 
.357-caliber Magnum revolver and demanded money from each teller. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said 21-year-old Madeline Peters, known to her friends  
and co-workers as ``Smiley'' and planning for her upcoming wedding, 
was on the phone and unaware of the robbery. When Dunn reached her 
window and ordered her to put cash in a bag, she responded, 
``What?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He fired, killing her with one shot to her head. He fled with  
almost $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her wedding dress was in a box open behind her,'' prosecutor  
Joe Magliolo recalled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later Dunn surrendered to the FBI in St. Louis. He  
had been traveling the country.

<HEADLINE>  Lukas, Baze Join Horse Racing Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- A plaque honoring D. Wayne Lukas  
now hangs on the wall at the National Racing Museum's Hall of Fame. 
That doesn't mean he's going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel even better about the next eight to 10 years than I do  
about the last 10 years,'' Lukas said Monday. ``We're putting 
together an even stronger group, and some serious things are going 
to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has conditioned more champions than any other thoroughbred  
trainer, won a record 13 Breeders Cup races and amassed more than 
$200 million in career purse earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	And it took more than just luck to get him there.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe in the luck factor,'' Lukas said. ``If you  
have to depend on luck in this game, you're gonna get beat a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also inducted Monday were jockey Russell Baze and thoroughbred  
racehorses Exceller, Miesque and Gun Bow. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of Lukas' achievements is long enough to line a  
racetrack. Highlights include receiving the Eclipse Award as the 
nation's top trainer four times, winning the Belmont Stakes three 
times and winning 12 Triple Crown races. His most recent Triple 
Crown victories came this year, when Charismatic won the Derby and 
the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has led the nation in earnings 14 of the last 16 years,  
and his 1998 mark of $17.8 million is a record that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
	With the ceremony spotlight centered squarely on him, Lukas, 63,  
chose to share the glory with a half-dozen assistants who gathered 
around him onstage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those records would never have happened without these guys,''  
Lukas said, his voice quivering. ``You guys have propped me up, 
carried me. And I know I wasn't easy to work for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tradeout here, and I got the best in the trade --  
just like I do every time I trade (horses) with you guys,'' he 
said, grinning at the other trainers in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	His assistants joked about Lukas' short temper and  
``expletive-laced tirades,'' but they were heavy in their praise. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many things have changed in our industry because of Wayne  
Lukas,'' former Lukas assistant Mark Hennig said. ``So many 
trainers never run multiple divisions, and he's shown us the 
reality that any race is just one flight away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with his success, Lukas said it ``hasn't always been blue  
skies and clear sailing in my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been solidly criticized by certain people in the industry  
and the media who don't always agree with what we do. But I make no 
apologies for what we've tried to do,'' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 25-year career, Baze has ridden 6,662 winners and earned  
more than $94.5 million in purses. He has also been the only rider 
to record 400 or more wins in each of the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past four years, Baze has been awarded the Isaac Murphy  
Award, presented by the National Turf Writers Association to the 
jockey with the highest winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I have been able to set those numbers that I have  
for the last couple of years is because I've been able to go out 
every day and do it,'' Baze said. ``I've been blessed that I 
haven't been injured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exceller, who raced from 1975 to 1979, came from 22 lengths back  
to beat two Triple Crown winners in the 1 1/2-mile Jockey Club Gold 
Cup in 1978. Exceller won by a nose over Triple Crown winner 
Seattle Slew and Affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Miesque, who was based in Europe for her entire racing career,  
made two starts in the United States, won two Grade I races, and 
was voted two Eclipse Awards. She also won a total of eight Group I 
races in France and England. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun Bow raised eyebrows in 1964 when he defeated Kelso by 12

<HEADLINE>  Lukas, Baze Join Horse Racing Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- A plaque honoring D. Wayne Lukas  
now hangs on the wall at the National Racing Museum's Hall of Fame. 
That doesn't mean he's going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel even better about the next eight to 10 years than I do  
about the last 10 years,'' Lukas said Monday. ``We're putting 
together an even stronger group, and some serious things are going 
to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has conditioned more champions than any other thoroughbred  
trainer, won a record 13 Breeders Cup races and amassed more than 
$200 million in career purse earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	And it took more than just luck to get him there.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe in the luck factor,'' Lukas said. ``If you  
have to depend on luck in this game, you're gonna get beat a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also inducted Monday were jockey Russell Baze and thoroughbred  
racehorses Exceller, Miesque and Gun Bow. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of Lukas' achievements is long enough to line a  
racetrack. Highlights include receiving the Eclipse Award as the 
nation's top trainer four times, winning the Belmont Stakes three 
times and winning 12 Triple Crown races. His most recent Triple 
Crown victories came this year, when Charismatic won the Derby and 
the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has led the nation in earnings 14 of the last 16 years,  
and his 1998 mark of $17.8 million is a record that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
	With the ceremony spotlight centered squarely on him, Lukas, 63,  
chose to share the glory with a half-dozen assistants who gathered 
around him onstage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those records would never have happened without these guys,''  
Lukas said, his voice quivering. ``You guys have propped me up, 
carried me. And I know I wasn't easy to work for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tradeout here, and I got the best in the trade --  
just like I do every time I trade (horses) with you guys,'' he 
said, grinning at the other trainers in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	His assistants joked about Lukas' short temper and  
``expletive-laced tirades,'' but they were heavy in their praise. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many things have changed in our industry because of Wayne  
Lukas,'' former Lukas assistant Mark Hennig said. ``So many 
trainers never run multiple divisions, and he's shown us the 
reality that any race is just one flight away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with his success, Lukas said it ``hasn't always been blue  
skies and clear sailing in my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been solidly criticized by certain people in the industry  
and the media who don't always agree with what we do. But I make no 
apologies for what we've tried to do,'' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 25-year career, Baze has ridden 6,662 winners and earned  
more than $94.5 million in purses. He has also been the only rider 
to record 400 or more wins in each of the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past four years, Baze has been awarded the Isaac Murphy  
Award, presented by the National Turf Writers Association to the 
jockey with the highest winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I have been able to set those numbers that I have  
for the last couple of years is because I've been able to go out 
every day and do it,'' Baze said. ``I've been blessed that I 
haven't been injured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exceller, who raced from 1975 to 1979, came from 22 lengths back  
to beat two Triple Crown winners in the 1 1/2-mile Jockey Club Gold 
Cup in 1978. Exceller won by a nose over Triple Crown winner 
Seattle Slew and Affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Miesque, who was based in Europe for her entire racing career,  
made two starts in the United States, won two Grade I races, and 
was voted two Eclipse Awards. She also won a total of eight Group I 
races in France and England. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun Bow raised eyebrows in 1964 when he defeated Kelso by 12  
lengths at the Brooklyn Handicap. That autumn, they split in two 
dramatic duels in the Aqueduct and Woodward Stakes.

<HEADLINE> Davidian Evidence Ordered Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered all evidence from the  
deadly 1993 Branch Davidian standoff turned over to his court, 
which will allow lawyers for the Davidians who are suing the 
government to review it. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Walter Smith's order, released Monday,  
breaks a stalemate between the U.S. Justice Department and Texas 
Department of Public Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Public Safety officials had sought the ruling. They have  
maintained some 24,000 pounds of evidence that actually was under 
the control of the Justice Department, making public access 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for nearly 200 Davidians and their relatives will get to  
look at the evidence recovered from the sect's Mount Carmel 
compound, which burned on April 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze ended a 51-day siege and killed Davidian leader David  
Koresh and nearly 80 followers. 
</P>
<P>
	``First and foremost, the parties to civil litigation pending in  
this court have the right to seek access,'' Smith wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second, the events that took place between Feb. 28 and April  
19, 1993, and thereafter, have resulted in sometimes intense 
interest from the national media and the members of the public,'' 
the judge wrote. ``There may come a time when persons other than 
the current civil litigants would be allowed access to the 
materials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Davidians and their relatives have filed a  
multimillion-dollar wrongful death lawsuit against the government. 
Their attorney, Michael Caddell, on Tuesday called Smith's order 
``good news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Carol Florman said the agency is  
still reviewing the order. 
</P>
<P>
	DPS Commissioner James B. Francis Jr. said the transfer of the  
evidence to the district clerk should occur within a few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Man Electrocuted at Bus Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A man was electrocuted while sitting on a metal  
bench in a bus stop shelter, leading San Diego County to close its 
475 shelters until authorities can determine why he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Williams, 20, of San Diego, was electrocuted Sunday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Newman tried to pry Williams loose from the metal grate,  
but the estimated 5,000-volt current was too great. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a car on fire so I ran to see if I could  
help, and I saw him,'' said Newman. ``He was up against the fence, 
he was shaking, smoke was pouring out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newman, an electrician for the California Air National Guard,  
said he briefly examined the electrical system at the shelter and 
found it lacked a circuit breaker that would have cut off the 
current after a short. 
</P>
<P>
	``For $50 worth of parts, whoever owns it could have saved this  
guy's life,'' Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's preliminary analysis confirms Newman's observation,  
Deputy City Manager George Loveland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outdoor Systems Advertising, one of the largest transit shelter  
providers in the country, began shutting off electricity to the 
lighted bus stop shelters Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> MCI Glitch Disables ATMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. could suffer a setback in  
efforts to draw customers to lucrative high-speed data and Internet 
services after a glitch in its network kept customers from 
transferring information and partially disabled thousands of 
automated teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem at the No. 2 U.S. long-distance carrier began late  
last week during a system upgrade and has disrupted high-speed data 
service for nearly 30 percent of MCI's global data network 
customers, spokeswoman Linda Laughlin said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI was upgrading network software from Lucent Technologies  
Inc., a former AT&AMP;T Corp. subsidiary, when the system began 
experiencing problems in large cities such as New York, Boston, 
Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, ATMs nationwide -- and in some cases outside the  
United States -- had intermittent trouble dispensing money because 
the bank machines couldn't communicate with each other, making it 
impossible to determine the customer's balance. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI technicians identified a software problem in the Lucent  
switches and were taking steps to fix the glitch, spokesman Frank 
Walter said late Tuesday. He said service was gradually being 
restored to customers, but he did not have an estimate on when 
operations would return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously regret the problems our customers have  
experienced, and we're working hard very hard to rebuild their 
confidence,'' Walter said. 
</P>
<P>
	ATM networks have not been able to determine the number of  
machines affected because many of the disruptions are only 
short-term, said Kate Coleman, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Cash 
Station, which operates ATMs mainly in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Board of Trade president Thomas Donovan issued a  
stinging rebuke of MCI after the disruption shut down electronic 
trading terminals across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Days before the outage, Donovan said he had met with executives  
from the communications company to complain about the quality of 
service and said he'd been promised things would improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite these assurances, we began experiencing a catastrophic  
outage because of MCI WorldCom just two days later,'' Donovan said 
in a letter sent Tuesday to members of the world's largest futures 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBOT's Project A electronic trading platform allows members  
to trade futures contracts linked to U.S. Treasuries, the Dow Jones 
industrial average, grains and other commodities. The exchange, 
which also maintains open outcry trading pits, was able to keep 
terminals inside the building running through a local network. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange said normal trading was restored Tuesday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	MCI's problems come at a time the company is launching a $100  
million program to build data centers and expand its existing 
facilities in an attempt to lure more customers to its burgeoning 
data and Internet businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is reminiscent of an outage in AT&AMP;T Corp.'s network  
last April, which affected thousands of corporate customers 
nationwide. AT&AMP;T blamed the outage on problems that occurred during 
a similar software upgrade.

<HEADLINE> Martin Holds Off Paraguayan at ATP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASON, Ohio (AP) -- Todd Martin faced two tough sets from  
Paraguayan qualifier Ramon Delgado before rallying for a 6-4, 5-7, 
6-2 victory in a first-round match Tuesday in the $2.45 million ATP 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the first time I've been on the court with Ramon,''  
said the ninth-seeded Martin, who is 10-0 in first rounds of tour 
matches this year. ``He's got a lot of shots, and he's got a nice 
serve. Fortunately, I don't think he was hitting his serve well 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just played a couple of games where he had a few too many  
errors. I probably played a little more aggressively in the third 
set. I think that disrupted his timing, and even when I wasn't 
aggressive, I think he felt some urgency, and that forced him into 
some errors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spaniard Albert Costa, the 14th seed, also was challenged before  
prevailing 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 over Australian Andrew Ilie. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 12 Nicolas Kiefer beat France's Sebastian Grosjean 7-5, 6-3  
and 15th seeded Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador beat Vincent Spadea 
6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteenth-seeded Thomas Johansson of Sweden was forced to retire  
from his match against Germany's Rainier Schuttler after 
aggravating a leg injury suffered while winning last week's du 
Maurier Open in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Chang improved his career record in Cincinnati to 36-9,  
the best of any active player, with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over 
Russia's Marat Safin, who is ranked No. 34 on the ATP Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I walked onto the court, I knew I was in a place where  
I've had some success,'' said Chang, a four-time finalist and 
two-time champion of this tournament who is ranked 58th. ``I almost 
get a hometown feeling here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former No. 1 player Jim Courier improved his career records  
against Croatia's Goran Ivanisevic to 8-3 overall and 5-0 on 
hardcourts with a 7-6, 6-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matches involving non-seeded players, Sweden's Jonas  
Bjorkman beat Romania's Andrei Pavel 6-4, 7-5; Jan-Michael Gambill 
beat Sjeng Schalken of The Netherlands 4-6, 6-3, 6-4; and 
86th-ranked Chris Woodruff beat 36th-ranked South African Wayne 
Ferreira 6-3, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Listens in Queens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton today praised unpaid  
caregivers for children, the sick and the elderly as the nation's 
unsung heroes and said they should benefit from federal tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at a real crossroads. Do we support families in the  
tasks they perform for their loved ones, or do we go on with a 
fiscally irresponsible tax cut?'' the first lady asked several 
hundred participants in a session of her listening tour at a Queens 
union hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Five women on a panel discussed how to balance family and work.  
</P>
<P>
	Carol Levine, whose husband was severely disabled as a result of  
a car accident, said that every day ``is a struggle with all the 
bureaucracies that seem to be resisting helping people in my 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Manhattan woman, who works for the United Hospital Fund,  
told Mrs. Clinton that what is needed in addition to tax breaks are 
training and support of family caregivers like herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's this gap in the middle of the night -- `Who am I going  
to call when the machine doesn't work?''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, taking a swipe at proposed Republican tax cuts,  
said 158,000 unpaid state caregivers eligible for federal 
assistance would have their funding cut off. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a busy schoolteacher, she encouraged, mediated and  
organized the discussion, and she got all the names right when 
addressing the participants. 
</P>
<P>
	She listened carefully and took notes as Mercedes Manne, a  
stay-at-home mother, told her of the difficulties of taking care of 
her four children and sick husband. ``I found myself so alone,'' 
she said of the time when her husband, the sole breadwinner, 
developed a severe back problem. ``My husband is so tired. He needs 
help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the discussion, Mrs. Clinton answered a handful of  
questions from reporters before her spokesman abruptly ended the 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to a comment that the Republican Party, led by Gov.  
George Pataki, appeared to be uniting behind her potential rival 
for the U.S. Senate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, she said: ``I try not 
to think about issues I have no control over. What the other party 
does is strictly their business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She did not comment directly on a report that another potential  
GOP candidate, Rep. Rick Lazio, was bowing to Pataki's request and 
will postpone plans to announce his candidacy until Giuliani 
decides. 
</P>
<P>
	After the event, Mrs. Clinton went to Monroe College in the  
Bronx for a private meeting with county Democratic leaders, 
including Bronx Democratic Party Chairman Roberto Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the day will be spent in closed meetings in  
Manhattan. She returns to Washington on Wednesday morning, said her 
spokesman, Howard Wolfson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Queens discussion is the last stop on the listening tour to  
be held this month. President Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton are 
scheduled to begin a 16-day vacation next Thursday that will 
include stops in Massachusetts and upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady said last week she planned to extend her  
statewide listening tour -- a series of small, controlled 
discussions in various venues -- into the fall. She said the tours 
would help her decide whether to run for the seat being vacated by 
retiring U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

<HEADLINE> Shatner's Wife Found Dead in Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The wife of actor William Shatner was found  
dead Monday evening in the deep end of the swimming pool at his 
home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene. Her name  
was not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Barbara Carranza, Los Angeles Police department  
spokeswoman, said Shatner arrived home around 10 p.m. and found his 
wife in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pulled his wife from the pool, called 911 and was  
instructed to begin CPR, which he did,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time firefighters arrived, the caller had apparently  
pulled the woman out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sadly, she was beyond our help,'' Los Angeles Fire Department  
spokesman Brian Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner's manager, Larry Thompson, said he hadn't heard about a  
death there. ``I know nothing about this,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner is best known as Capt. James T. Kirk on the science  
fiction television show ``Star Trek.'' He also appeared in several 
``Star Trek'' movies and the 1980s television police drama ``T.J. 
Hooker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carranza said the cause of death will be determined by the Los  
Angeles coroner's office.

<HEADLINE>  Taiwan Eyes Chinese Jets in Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Two Chinese warplanes crossed into  
Taiwan's military airspace over the Taiwan Strait, the island's 
president said today, adding that the incursions were apparently 
accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	After repeatedly denying that Chinese aircraft had entered  
Taiwanese airspace, the Defense Ministry also confirmed that China 
passed over the ``center line'' twice last month. The line is 
generally respected by both sides as the limit of their military 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came over the center line, which is pretty unclear,  
probably because their planes were flying too fast,'' President Lee 
Teng-hui said at a government seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as the Chinese pilots realized where they were, ``they  
took off as fast as they could,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of Shenyang J-8 fighters flew three miles into the Taiwan  
side on July 25, and a pair of J-7 fighters crossed six miles over 
the center line on July 30, the ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministry officials had denied the crossings as recently as  
earlier today, and said in the statement that it had done so 
because they were considered mistakes without offensive intent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had the Defense Ministry not taken the background into  
consideration, and simply announced this, it might have created 
doubts and insecurity among the public,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcement of the crossings comes amid tensions between  
Beijing and Taipei that have risen to their highest level in years, 
causing international concern over the possibility of a 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	China's anger was sparked on July 9, when Lee said Beijing must  
deal with Taiwan on a ``state-to-state'' basis, a declaration the 
mainland viewed as a major step toward declaring formal 
independence -- which China says could trigger a war. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, officials in Beijing issued no immediate response to the  
president's comments about Chinese planes entering Taiwan's 
airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Although China has increased training flights in recent weeks,  
its warplanes fly in a mostly north-south direction -- along the 
mainland Chinese coast and not toward Taiwan, said Chung Shen-ning, 
a military data analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said no military aircraft have crossed east of the center  
line in the Taiwan Strait -- an average of 124 miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	But China's most advanced Russian-made Sukhoi-27 fighters have  
recently begun flying sorties over the coast of Fujian province -- 
right across the water from Taiwan. Taiwan says China has about 100 
warplanes within a 286-mile range of the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan has reportedly stepped-up sorties of its French-made  
Mirage 2000-5 interceptors and other warplanes in response, 
although defense officials declined in a news conference to comment 
in detail on Taiwan's military activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwanese military was less shy about voicing its views on  
Hong Kong's press, which has rolled out dozens of unconfirmed 
stories about Chinese war preparations over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	China is selectively leaking material to Hong Kong journalists  
to spread military rumors, with stories that often are accompanied 
by old file photos of Chinese military hardware to increase the 
scare effect, said Hu Yuan-chieh, of the military general 
headquarters' office of intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's stock market has fallen sharply on such rumors. Taipei  
blue chips rose about 3.4 percent today, but they remain off by 
almost 15 percent since the crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
	Though divided politically since 1949, China still considers  
Taiwan a breakaway province to be brought into the fold eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, a bipartisan delegation visiting from the United  
States issued a statement supporting Lee and saying China bears 
full responsibility for creating tensions. The Clinton 
administration, however, has rebuked Lee for challenging the status 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly support President Lee's right to address Taipei's  
views,'' said U.S. Rep. Benjamin Gilman, chairman of House of 
Representative's committee on international relations. ``It is our 
view that the two sides should engage in a dialogue with equals.''

<HEADLINE>  Taiwan Eyes Chinese Jets in Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Two Chinese warplanes crossed into  
Taiwan's military airspace over the Taiwan Strait, the island's 
president said today, adding that the incursions were apparently 
accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	After repeatedly denying that Chinese aircraft had entered  
Taiwanese airspace, the Defense Ministry also confirmed that China 
passed over the ``center line'' twice last month. The line is 
generally respected by both sides as the limit of their military 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came over the center line, which is pretty unclear,  
probably because their planes were flying too fast,'' President Lee 
Teng-hui said at a government seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as the Chinese pilots realized where they were, ``they  
took off as fast as they could,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of Shenyang J-8 fighters flew three miles into the Taiwan  
side on July 25, and a pair of J-7 fighters crossed six miles over 
the center line on July 30, the ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministry officials had denied the crossings as recently as  
earlier today, and said in the statement that it had done so 
because they were considered mistakes without offensive intent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had the Defense Ministry not taken the background into  
consideration, and simply announced this, it might have created 
doubts and insecurity among the public,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcement of the crossings comes amid tensions between  
Beijing and Taipei that have risen to their highest level in years, 
causing international concern over the possibility of a 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	China's anger was sparked on July 9, when Lee said Beijing must  
deal with Taiwan on a ``state-to-state'' basis, a declaration the 
mainland viewed as a major step toward declaring formal 
independence -- which China says could trigger a war. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, officials in Beijing issued no immediate response to the  
president's comments about Chinese planes entering Taiwan's 
airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Although China has increased training flights in recent weeks,  
its warplanes fly in a mostly north-south direction -- along the 
mainland Chinese coast and not toward Taiwan, said Chung Shen-ning, 
a military data analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said no military aircraft have crossed east of the center  
line in the Taiwan Strait -- an average of 124 miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	But China's most advanced Russian-made Sukhoi-27 fighters have  
recently begun flying sorties over the coast of Fujian province -- 
right across the water from Taiwan. Taiwan says China has about 100 
warplanes within a 286-mile range of the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan has reportedly stepped-up sorties of its French-made  
Mirage 2000-5 interceptors and other warplanes in response, 
although defense officials declined in a news conference to comment 
in detail on Taiwan's military activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwanese military was less shy about voicing its views on  
Hong Kong's press, which has rolled out dozens of unconfirmed 
stories about Chinese war preparations over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	China is selectively leaking material to Hong Kong journalists  
to spread military rumors, with stories that often are accompanied 
by old file photos of Chinese military hardware to increase the 
scare effect, said Hu Yuan-chieh, of the military general 
headquarters' office of intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's stock market has fallen sharply on such rumors. Taipei  
blue chips rose about 3.4 percent today, but they remain off by 
almost 15 percent since the crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
	Though divided politically since 1949, China still considers  
Taiwan a breakaway province to be brought into the fold eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, a bipartisan delegation visiting from the United  
States issued a statement supporting Lee and saying China bears 
full responsibility for creating tensions. The Clinton 
administration, however, has rebuked Lee for challenging the status 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly support President Lee's right to address Taipei's  
views,'' said U.S. Rep. Benjamin Gilman, chairman of House of 
Representative's committee on international relations. ``It is our 
view that the two sides should engage in a dialogue with equals.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Olympian Faces Criminal Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A bobsledder who represented Puerto Rico in  
the last three Olympics and whose optometrist license was revoked 
last year was indicted on insurance fraud charges Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John C. Amabile, 37, is accused of cheating 29 insurance  
carriers of more than $200,000 by submitting false claims. The 
indictment charged he directed his staff to create 997 false 
patient records and charts so he could bill the carriers for 
services not rendered, or for treatment and tests for conditions 
that the patients did not have. 
</P>
<P>
	Amabile competed in the two-man bobsled in last three Winter  
Olympics. His sled finished 38th of 39 teams in 1998 at Nagano, 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Amabile, of Spring Lake Heights, faces six counts, including  
conspiracy, theft and falsifying records from January 1994 and July 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges carry up to 16 years in prison and $190,000 in  
fines. They were handed up by a state grand jury in Trenton and are 
to be tried in Freehold, Monmouth County. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the conspiracy, Amabile provided glasses and exams at  
little or no cost to attract large numbers of patients, according 
to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, state regulators revoked his license after  
determining he cheated insurers of about a half-million dollars, 
and ordered him to pay more than $1.7 million in penalties, 
restitution and costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The payment was stayed pending an ongoing criminal  
investigation, so no money is due until these charges are resolved. 
The state froze $2 million of his assets in 1996, and those funds 
remain under court control. 
</P>
<P>
	Amabile had offices in Long Branch and Neptune City in Monmouth  
County, and Toms River in Ocean County. The criminal charges relate 
only to the Monmouth County offices, which accounts for some of the 
difference in the fraud figures, said Edward M. Neafsey, state 
insurance fraud prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal authorities also wanted to focus on allegations in  
which the evidence was strongest, Neafsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, criminal charges go first, but the licensing action -- a  
faster procedure -- went first ``because of the egregious nature of 
the conduct and the need to protect the public,'' Neafsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amabile was sued by the state in June 1997. The board suspended  
his license the next month, but later allowed him to resume 
practicing under a board-appointed supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	His license was again suspended in January when the board  
determined Amabile severed his relationship with the supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Amabile and his last lawyer could not be reached for comment  
because neither had a current phone listing.

<HEADLINE>  Int'l Aluminum Cos. Talk Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Three international aluminum  
companies with combined 1998 sales $25 billion are engaged in 
merger talks that could create the world's biggest aluminum 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Zurich-based Alusuisse-Lonza (Algroup), Pechiney of France and  
Alcan Aluminium of Canada all said they were in ``advanced 
discussions'' over a possible combination. The resulting company 
would be the world's largest, leapfrogging the Pittsburgh-based 
Alcoa, which had $15.3 billion in revenue in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will likely face regulatory hurdles if it moves  
ahead, but analysts said they don't believe the company would be 
able to control the aluminum market. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Alcoa hasn't been able to dictate the price until now I  
can't see that the merged company would,'' said Christian George, 
equity analyst with Credit Lyonnais Rouse in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a strategic alliance which will bring about a  
reorganization of the aluminum industry,'' said Lawrence Eagles, 
head of research at London-based Gerard National Inter Commodities. 
``There will be huge benefits from a production perspective. I 
don't think this is about creating a cartel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Algroup announced it was discussing a possible  
merger with the German industrial concern Viag. The talks came to 
an acrimonious end in March following a disagreement over a share 
swap arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Alcan is the world's second-largest producer of  
aluminum. It recorded sales of $7.8 billion last year. Pechiney, 
based in Paris, is the world's No. 4, with 1998 sales of $10.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Algroup, which nearly went broke in the 1980s after a series of  
disastrous forays into the United States, recorded sales of $6.4 
billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	If the merger goes through, the three companies would have a  
combined work force of more than 100,000. The combined company also 
would have a large packaging business.

<HEADLINE> Actor Victor Mature Dies at 86 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANCHO SANTA FE, Calif. (AP) -- Victor Mature liked to joke that  
he once tried to get into a country club that didn't accept actors 
by saying, ``Hell, I'm no actor, and I've got 28 pictures and a 
scrapbook of reviews to prove it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the brawny actor given the nickname ``beautiful hunk of  
man'' also took his job seriously. ``I just couldn't show it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mature died at the age of 86 after suffering from cancer for  
three years, said a friend, Zollie Volchok. The San Diego County 
coroner's office said it was notified that Mature died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tall, dark-haired and muscular, Mature got his nickname from  
films like ``Samson and Delilah,'' ``One Million B.C.'' and ``Song 
of the Islands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared in musicals, Westerns, comedies, historical epics  
and melodramas before largely retiring from films around 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	While first making his name as a glamour-boy star with a  
devil-may-care attitude, he gradually gained more critical respect 
in the late 1940s in such films as ``Cry of the City'' and ``Kiss 
of Death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946's ``My Darling Clementine,'' he was Doc Holliday to  
Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp. The version of the fabled gunfight at the 
O.K. Corral is considered one of director John Ford's greatest 
films. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil B. DeMille's 1949 telling of the saga of Samson and  
Delilah cast Mature and Hedy Lamarr in the title roles. It was a 
smash hit. 
</P>
<P>
	He was at 20th Century Fox for many years but often worked at  
other studios. ``They turned pictures out like crackerjack,'' he 
told The New York Times in 1971. ```Kiss of Death' got made because 
Fox was one black-and-white picture short on its schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That 1947 film paired Mature with a screen newcomer, Richard  
Widmark. Mature played a thief who turned state's evidence, Widmark 
a psychopathic killer. The film caused a sensation and earned 
Widmark an Academy Award nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Mature's other films: ``The Shanghai Gesture,'' 1941,  
directed by Josef von Sternberg; ``My Gal Sal,'' 1942, with Rita 
Hayworth; ``I Wake Up Screaming,'' 1941, with Betty Grable; 
``Wabash Avenue,'' 1950, with Grable; ``The Robe,'' 1953, as the 
slave Demetrius; a sequel, ``Demetrius and the Gladiators, 1954; 
and ``Chief Crazy Horse,'' 1954, with Mature in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
	Mature was a favorite of reporters during his heyday, always  
available for interviews. He enjoyed deflating the pomposities of 
Hollywood as well as his own image. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his favorite stories concerned the making of ``Samson and  
Delilah.'' DeMille wanted him to wrestle with a tame lion for a 
crucial action scene. The actor refused. ``But Jackie never hurt 
anyone; he doesn't even have any teeth,'' DeMille argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah?'' Mature replied. ``I don't want to be gummed to death,  
either.'' A stunt man tussled with Jackie, and Mature did his 
closeups with a lion skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Careful with his money unless a friend was in need, he invested  
in real estate and retail stores, enabling him to retire 
comfortably before he reached 45. He moved to Rancho Santa Fe, and 
once bragged that he played golf four hours a day, six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	He made only a few film appearances in the past 35 years,  
notably the 1966 Italian farce ``After the Fox,'' in which he 
spoofed his old image; and ``Every Little Crook and Nanny,'' a 1972 
comedy in which he co-starred with Lynn Redgrave. In 1984 he made a 
rare appearance on television, playing Samson's father in a new 
version of ``Samson and Delilah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mature was born Jan. 29, 1913 -- some references say 1915 and  
1916 -- in Louisville, Ky., the son of an Austrian immigrant who 
became a successful businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming to California in the mid-'30s, he studied at the Pasadena  
Playhouse, paying his way with odd jobs because he didn't want to 
rely on his father. He made his screen debut with a small role in 
``The Housekeeper's Daughter,'' 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	At the height of his stardom, Mature dated stars such as  
Hayworth and Lana Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	He was married five times. Survivors include his wife, Lorey, a  
former Chicago opera singer, and their daughter, Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral service was to be held today in Louisville.

<HEADLINE> Barge Spills Oil Into Ohio River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT VERNON, Ind. (AP) -- The Ohio River remained closed to  
traffic today and downstream communities had stopped drawing water 
from the river because a barge collision spilled thousands of 
gallons of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	The collision Monday involved four barges loaded with gasoline  
and another barge carrying cumene, a toxic chemical used in making 
plastics. 
</P>
<P>
	One barge leaked an estimated 69,000 gallons of gasoline into  
the river, Coast Guard spokeswoman Angel Deimler said today. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Deimler said sunlight had dissipated much of the  
gasoline, and the remainder, mostly a floating sheen, had not 
drifted far. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wind was working with us and kept it from spreading,'' she  
said. ``It's stayed within a two-mile area. Mother Nature was on 
our side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard Ensign Kevin Floyd told The Courier-Journal of  
Louisville, Ky., that another of the gasoline barges and the 
cumene-laden tanker also were leaking. Cumene can irritate eyes and 
skin and cause respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries had been reported.  
</P>
<P>
	Foam was to be brought in to soak up any remaining gasoline,  
said Tim Fleming, assistant fire chief of Mount Vernon Fire and 
Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials hoped the river and intake valves downstream could be  
reopened by tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Vernon, a city of about 7,000 that relies on Ohio River  
water, closed its intake valves 45 minutes after the accident and 
hauled water from Morris Township. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're waiting for it to pass,'' said Wanda Bennett, an  
employee at the Mount Vernon Water Works. ``We are operating on our 
reserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, Morganfield closed its river intake and relied on a  
nearby reservoir, water plant manager John Coffman said.

<HEADLINE> Racing Promoters Expanding, Aligning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Buoyed by success at one of its tracks, a  
top promoter in Winston Cup racing is expanding its involvement 
with the World of Outlaws. 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway Motorsports Inc. unveiled plans Tuesday to hold World  
of Outlaws races at three of its Winston Cup venues next year, with 
a fourth track possible in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The multiyear agreement calls for the races to be televised by  
The Nashville Network and to be run as support events on weekends 
that the Winston Cup series is at the SMI tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Concord-based SMI is building dirt tracks of about four-tenths  
of a mile in length at its flagship property, Lowe's Motor Speedway 
at Charlotte, as well as at Texas Motor Speedway near Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The company already has a half-mile dirt track at Las Vegas  
Motor Speedway and is considering building one at Atlanta Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	SMI president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler said the company decided to  
expand its World of Outlaws ties after two 1998 races at Las Vegas 
sold out the 12,000-seat facility for the winged sprint cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Las Vegas certainly got our attention,'' said Wheeler, whose  
company stages nearly one-third of the races on the Winston Cup 
circuit. ``I've always been an advocate of doing a bunch of things 
to keep things going, and this is just another example of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal calls for the SMI tracks to stage World of Outlaws  
events on Thursday and Friday nights, leaving Saturdays free for 
Grand National races and Sundays open for the main Winston Cup 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	The World of Outlaws tracks at Charlotte and Texas would  
initially seat 12,000-15,000 and cost an estimated $3 million 
apiece. Each track is being designed so it could be expanded to 
55,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said SMI hopes to generate $1 million in income next  
year alone from World of Outlaws and related events at its dirt 
tracks in Charlotte, Dallas and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	SMI officials view the World of Outlaws as a potentially more  
reliable revenue source than the 3-year-old Indy Racing League, 
which has struggled to draw consistent crowds at company 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The only SMI track that has been able to annually draw IRL  
crowds in excess of 50,000 is Texas, where IRL ticket sales are 
tied to those for the track's Winston Cup weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, Charlotte and Las Vegas have had difficulty making  
money on IRL events, and SMI is considering dropping the series at 
Charlotte, where three spectators were killed during the circuit's 
race in May. 
</P>
<P>
	While the World of Outlaws deal could prove to be a good fit for  
SMI, the sprint-car series also hopes to profit from the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The World of Outlaws has developed into one of the  
fastest-growing circuits in racing, but its 60-stop-per-year 
schedule remains rooted mainly in the Midwest. New races in other 
areas of the country as well as added television exposure could 
further increase the circuit's fan base. 
</P>
<P>
	``This takes us to major market areas,'' World of Outlaws  
president and founder Ted Johnson said. ``With Speedway Motorsports 
building new facilities to accommodate us, we'll go to a new 
plateau.''

<HEADLINE> Former Alabama Great Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Riley Smith, who quarterbacked Alabama to a  
national championship in 1934, died Monday after a lengthy illness. 
He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith converted from fullback after the 1933 season and  
quarterbacked the Crimson Tide the next two seasons, earning 
All-America honors. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the Jacobs Award, given annually to the Southeastern  
Conference's top blocker, and is still regarded as one of the best 
blockers in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	He came back from an injury to lead the Tide to impressive  
victories over Georgia and Tennessee as a senior. Against 
Tennessee, he rushed for one touchdown and passed for one. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarterback on offense, safety on defense, punter and  
field-goal kicker, Smith was a member of the National Collegiate 
Football Hall of Fame, National Football Foundation Hall of Fame, 
Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and 
Mobile Sports Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who was from Columbus, Miss., was a good friend and  
teammate of the late Alabama coach Bear Bryant. Bryant was also a 
member of that 1934 team which won the national championship with a 
Rose Bowl victory over Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Bryant and Daddy would talk weekly when Bear was  
coaching and winning national titles at Bama, and he would always 
tell Bear that he wasn't throwing the ball enough,'' said Riley 
Boykin Smith, his surviving son who is commissioner of the state 
Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Smith spent some three years in the NFL, but his  
career was cut short by a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving the Redskins, he became coach at Washington &AMP; Lee.  
He left coaching for World War II and eventually settled in Mobile, 
where he worked in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Services will be held at 11 a.m. Friday in the chapel of Radney  
Funeral Home in Mobile. Burial will follow in Pine Crest Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his son, survivors include daughters Ocllo Smith  
Malone of Birmingham and Sandra Smith Norton of Jackson, Miss.; one 
sister; nine grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: L.A. Shootings 'Senseless' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged the nation on Tuesday  
to ``intensify our resolve to make America a better place'' in the 
face of a shooting that wounded two women and three little boys in 
a Los Angeles Jewish community center. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the victims and their families, like all Americans, I offer  
thoughts and prayers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn, Clinton said he  
had been getting updates on the search for the gunman. He called 
the shootings ``another senseless act'' and offered federal 
assistance to local law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by  
an act of gun violence,'' Clinton said. ``It calls on all of us not 
only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their 
families, but intensify our resolve to make America a safer 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Vice President Al Gore offered his thoughts and prayers  
to the victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're monitoring the situation very closely,'' Gore said.  
``There is still a great deal we don't know, except the fact that 
we've seen a neighborhood and a community shattered by violence.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Smits To Return Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Rik Smits, the starting center for the  
Indiana Pacers who considered retiring from the NBA because of 
chronic foot pain, has decided to return next season, a newspaper 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Smits, who said he was leaning toward retirement after losing to  
the New York Knicks in Game 6 of the 1999 Eastern Conference 
finals, told The Indianapolis Star that he will play for a 12th 
season because his feet haven't been hurting lately. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feet are feeling pretty good, and I did some thinking,''  
Smits said from his offseason home in Walton, N.Y. ``I'm going to 
give it a try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smits averaged 14.9 points last season, his lowest since  
1992-93. By season's end he said he had grown tired of coping with 
the foot pain that has dogged him for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time ever, I really didn't enjoy playing this  
season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smits, who played 49 games during last year's condensed  
50-game season, told the newspaper he felt obligated to fulfill the 
final year of his contract, which will pay him $12.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have that feeling now,'' he said. ``If I go back, I'm going  
back to play, not to watch other people play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Smits also said he would consider extending his  
term with the Pacers, depending on how things go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to say this is my last year, but who can say?'' he  
said. ``I'm just going to concentrate on this year for now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last two weeks, the 7-foot-4 center has been undergoing  
treatments with Boston orthopedic therapist Dan Dyrek. At least two 
more sessions with Dyrek have been planned to relieve any lingering 
pain in his size 21 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, they'll feel better than last year,'' Smits said.  
``I was really disappointed a lot of times last year. I lost my 
explosiveness and my balance and it was hard to be effective. 
Hopefully, I'll get that back this year.''

<HEADLINE>  Int'l Aluminum Cos. Talk Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Three international aluminum  
companies with combined 1998 sales $25 billion are engaged in 
merger talks that could create the world's biggest aluminum 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Zurich-based Alusuisse-Lonza (Algroup), Pechiney of France and  
Alcan Aluminium of Canada all said they were in ``advanced 
discussions'' over a possible combination. The resulting company 
would be the world's largest, leapfrogging the Pittsburgh-based 
Alcoa, which had $15.3 billion in revenue in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will likely face regulatory hurdles if it moves  
ahead, but analysts said they don't believe the company would be 
able to control the aluminum market. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Alcoa hasn't been able to dictate the price until now I  
can't see that the merged company would,'' said Christian George, 
equity analyst with Credit Lyonnais Rouse in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a strategic alliance which will bring about a  
reorganization of the aluminum industry,'' said Lawrence Eagles, 
head of research at London-based Gerard National Inter Commodities. 
``There will be huge benefits from a production perspective. I 
don't think this is about creating a cartel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Algroup announced it was discussing a possible  
merger with the German industrial concern Viag. The talks came to 
an acrimonious end in March following a disagreement over a share 
swap arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Alcan is the world's second-largest producer of  
aluminum. It recorded sales of $7.8 billion last year. Pechiney, 
based in Paris, is the world's No. 4, with 1998 sales of $10.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Algroup, which nearly went broke in the 1980s after a series of  
disastrous forays into the United States, recorded sales of $6.4 
billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	If the merger goes through, the three companies would have a  
combined work force of more than 100,000. The combined company also 
would have a large packaging business.

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Leaves Game With Back Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mark McGwire, stuck on 501 career homers  
after passing the historic mark last week, left the St. Louis 
Cardinals' game Tuesday night with tightness in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who thrilled a large crowd at Veterans Stadium with a  
power-hitting show in batting practice, walked in his only at-bat 
against Philadelphia starter Robert Person. He did not take the 
field for the bottom of the second inning, replaced by Craig 
Paquette. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said he won't know until  
Wednesday if McGwire will miss any more games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tight,'' McGwire said after Tuesday's 7-5 loss to the  
Phillies. ``I don't want the disc to move. This muscle is pretty 
tight. And we're playing on not the greatest turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you can save yourself a trip to the DL by sitting  
out a couple of innings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who leads the majors with 44 homers, hasn't hit one in  
13 at-bats since hitting his 500th and 501st last Thursday against 
San Diego. He was 1-for-10 with no extra-base hits in a four-game 
series at Pittsburgh over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	His longest homerless drought this season was 41 at-bats,  
between his fifth and sixth of the season. He has gone 15 at-bats 
without a homer only five times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who has battled back problems since 1989, missed three  
games last month due to back spasms. During a news conference 
Monday before the opener of this three-game series in Philadelphia, 
McGwire commented that this is the first season since then that he 
hasn't missed at least 10 days because of his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deal with it every day,'' McGwire said.  
</P>
<P>
	He showed no ill-effects during batting practice. With most  
seats in the left-field upper deck filled, McGwire homered on 14 of 
15 swings at one point. A couple of his massive clouts landed 
nearly halfway to the top of the upper deck.

<HEADLINE> Bush Campaign Nixes 411 Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush is sitting on a massive  
war chest but his campaign is still pinching pennies, directing 
employees nationwide to lay off the 411 calls and use free 
directory-assistance Internet sites instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential front-runner's campaign sent an  
e-mail memo on the matter to staffers across the country Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been informed that there are Internet sites that allow  
you to look up a person's phone number or address FOR FREE,'' 
stated the memo, written by campaign office manager Julie Thomas. 
``Please try to use them rather than spending money on directory 
assistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush's fund-raising dwarfs that of all other presidential  
candidates, the Texas governor has earned a reputation for thrift. 
Many presidential candidates serve lavish meals at donor 
gatherings, but Bush, who raised $37 million in the first half of 
the year, often hands out peanuts and pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who sent the memo from the campaign's Austin, Texas  
headquarters, declined to comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a suggestion to save the campaign money,''  
campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said Tuesday. ``We try to run an 
efficient operation here at the campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McClellan confirmed that campaign staffers nationwide received  
it, but said he wasn't sure whether they had been running up big 
411 bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Bush campaign employees received the memo early this week.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were all cracking up laughing,'' said one Bush staffer in  
California who received the memo and spoke about it on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why his burn rate is so much lower,'' the employee  
joked, referring to the slow rate at which Bush uses campaign 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush reported last month that he had $30 million in the bank,  
triple that of Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential 
front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign collected $31 for every $1 it spent on  
fund-raising in the first half of the year. The Gore campaign took 
in $6 for every $1 it spent to raise money.

<HEADLINE> Holtz Begins South Carolina Drills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Lou Holtz ran his first practice at South  
Carolina on Tuesday, putting the Gamecocks through the same 
fundamentals drill he has emphasized for 27 previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz, who took the job in December, has worked to improve the  
players' attitudes after going 1-10 last year, their worst season 
ever. Now, he focused on the smaller things, like blocking stances, 
quarterback handoffs and driving from the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is so complicated about this? What is so complicated  
about this?'' said Holtz, who threw down his South Carolina ballcap 
after one sloppy handoff. 
</P>
<P>
	When the team ran a flawless drill, he was in their faces again:  
``That's the way to do it. That's what we want to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In spring practice and the few freshmen-only workouts, Holtz has  
spent much time taking notes in his golf cart. But the Gamecocks 
open at North Carolina State -- the first of eight bowl teams on the 
schedule -- in 25 days, and Holtz knows how much must get done. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be intense at practice, no matter what string  
you're running with,'' said Holtz, who is conducting his first 
college camp since resigning from Notre Dame three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz's sideline style of grabbing fistfuls of jersey and  
getting face-to-face with players has appealed to fans everywhere 
he's coached. But Holtz says his tactics drive home a point that 
technique is critical, and are not meant to ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
	``You make a point because something is very important, you make  
it emphatically,'' Holtz said. ``There's little mistakes, and 
there's major errors. If something is a major error, you make it 
very important.''

<HEADLINE> Minorities Can Join U. Michigan Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Supporters of affirmative action won a court  
ruling Tuesday allowing them to argue in possibly precedent-setting 
lawsuits why the University of Michigan should consider race when 
picking its students. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-1 ruling from a federal appeals court came in class-action  
lawsuits filed by three white applicants turned down by Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati said lower  
federal courts erred when they barred 58 individuals -- most of whom 
are minority students at Michigan -- and four groups from joining 
the school in defending the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the minorities say they want to raise questions that  
Michigan won't. The lawyers say they would argue that the 
university discriminated against minorities in the past, and that 
the administration relies on racially biased standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan had welcomed the minority students' entrance into the  
lawsuits, but lawyers for the white students had fought against it, 
saying the groups would raise too many outside issues and delay 
trials scheduled for the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court's opinion said the groups met the legal burden  
for joining the case as defendants, and could be harmed if Michigan 
loses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is little room for doubt that access to the University  
for African-American and Latino/a students will be impaired to some 
extent and that a substantial decline in the enrollment of these 
students may well result if the University is precluded from 
considering race as a factor in admissions,'' the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous and historic victory,'' said Miranda K.S.  
Massie, an attorney who represented some of the minority students. 
``It means that black and other minority students will be able to 
bring to bear the truths about racism in higher education to the 
affirmative action debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits could change the way public universities attempt to  
lure minority students. 
</P>
<P>
	The three white applicants claim Michigan's affirmative action  
admissions policies discriminated against them in favor of certain 
minorities. They say they were denied admission even though the 
university admitted minorities with lower grades and test scores. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Individual Rights, a Washington-based  
organization guiding the lawsuits, argues the university's 
enrollment procedures violate the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The university says it fairly uses race in admissions to create  
a diverse student body. It has also said that if it could not use 
race, the minority student population would plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is being closely watched by educational groups, many of  
which have filed briefs in support of Michigan. The Clinton 
administration has also filed in support of the university. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk Kolbo, an attorney for the Center for Individual Rights,  
said the ruling would not be appealed. Lawyers for all the parties 
said the trials would be pushed back.

<HEADLINE> Weather Hampers Texas Vintners / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The vintners growing grapes for Texas wines  
are grappling with the consequences of erratic spring weather. 
</P>
<P>
	An unseasonable chill in April led to a freeze in Fredericksburg  
that reduced the region's grape crop, said George McEachern of the 
Texas Agricultural Extension Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Early hailstorms in Lubbock, home of the Llano Estacado winery,  
damaged some vines and wiped out others. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been one of the strangest weather years we've had,''  
Chad Auler, vice president of Fall Creek Vineyards in Austin, said. 
``Quantity is a little light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, the nation's fifth-largest wine making state, produced  
1.3 million gallons of wine in 1998 in its 27 wineries, according 
to the Texas Wine Marketing Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's production has grown 20 percent in the past decade.  
</P>
<P>
	This year, excellent yields in southwest Texas are compensating  
for crop shortfalls from the Lubbock hailstorms and early Hill 
Country freezes, according to the institute. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, early season anomalies may have been a blessing.  
</P>
<P>
	Although grapevines thrive in warm weather, McEachern said  
periods of intense heat -- as in 1996 and 1998 -- can impede 
photosynthesis, the process by which plants produce food. 
</P>
<P>
	And while storms ruined some grapevines this year, he said the  
overall quality of the fruit improves when the crop's quantity is 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need leaves to feed the (grape) clusters, but there's  
usually too many clusters for the number of leaves,'' McEachern 
said. ``When things like weather reduce the number of clusters, we 
can anticipate a higher quality fruit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fall Creek, the state's third-largest winery, still expects to  
squeeze 35,000 cases from its 1999 grape yield despite the fact 
that the weather cut its crop size, Auler said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SHELDON, Ill. (AP) -- The costly and damaging western corn  
rootworm is amazing scientists with its resiliency. 
</P>
<P>
	The rootworm has managed to survive despite a 3-year experiment  
in which researchers tried to lure the pests to fields sprayed with 
an attractant laced with a little insecticide. 
</P>
<P>
	Entomologists from the University of Illinois and Purdue  
University have been working on the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
project at dozens of farms near this tiny Iroquois County 
community, about 58 miles northeast of Champaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The fields were sprayed with a material that contained  
insecticide and also chemicals that attract the beetles, slow them 
down and stimulate feeding. 
</P>
<P>
	It was designed to kill female beetles before they laid their  
eggs -- instead of killing larvae, like most soil-applied 
insecticides. The material also used about 1/16 of the amount of 
active ingredient found in regular soil-applied insecticide. 
Scientists want to reduce chemicals used for farming. 
</P>
<P>
	``By year three, we should begin to see beetles at low levels,''  
UI entomologist Mike Gray said. ``By now, we'd hoped to walk into 
fields and find low densities, but we're not finding them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said results of the experiment have been better in Kansas  
and Texas, but Iowa scientists' results are similar to those in 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Western corn rootworms confounded the scientific community a few  
years ago by adapting to crop rotation, which had been used to keep 
them in check. Rootworms started laying their eggs in soybean 
fields that would be planted with corn the next year. When larvae 
hatched, they tunneled around looking for corn roots to eat.

<HEADLINE> At No. 1, Duval Joins the Limelight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- David Duval is no longer the mystery man  
behind the wraparound shades. 
</P>
<P>
	The knock on Duval used to be that he had nothing interesting to  
say. He would just as soon curl up with a good Ayn Rand book than 
talk about what it was like to become the first player to shoot a 
59 on Sunday to win a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps that reputation was unwarranted.  
</P>
<P>
	Any more, Duval can't say anything without controversy following  
him. While winning four times before the Masters gave him the No. 1 
ranking in the world, it also came with some baggage Duval could 
have done without. 
</P>
<P>
	An audience.  
</P>
<P>
	He spoke Tuesday before a full house at Medinah Country Club, a  
larger gathering than turned up to listen to Tiger Woods about an 
hour later. That's not to say Woods no longer has enough 
electricity to light up Chicago, only that Duval has become 
something of a lightning rod. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's a bit of a transition just in that more people are  
listening,'' Duval said about his recent fame, which he enjoys as 
much as a double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that when I went to No. 1, all of a sudden I  
had to know a lot more than I knew the day before. And I became an 
authority on stuff that I'm not an authority on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibit 1: Carnoustie Golf Links.  
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was terribly fond of the pinched fairways and  
bloated rough of the British Open. Phil Mickelson suggested placing 
red hazard stakes down the fairway. Payne Stewart wasn't sure if 
the short grass could be called a fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval joined the chorus and struck the loudest chords.  
</P>
<P>
	``I heard several players and past Open champions talk about how  
absurd and ridiculous it was, and unfair,'' Duval said. ``For some 
reason, I was picked out. Do I regret that? No. I don't have any 
control over that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibit 2: The Ryder Cup.  
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that Duval has never played in the matches. He  
referred to them as an ``exhibition'' the week after the Buick 
Classic in New York, a word that makes the European press and 
players bite their lips. 
</P>
<P>
	Turns out he was just warming up.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark O'Meara first raised the compensation issue nearly a year  
ago, and that was before the Golf Digest report that estimated $63 
million in gross revenue from the Ryder Cup, with a net profit of 
about $17 million for the PGA of America. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara asked why the players should not get a piece of the pie  
since they were the filling. Woods chimed in later, referring to 
pre-tournament parties as ``pros on parade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Duval who supplied the real dynamite.  
</P>
<P>
	In interviews with Golf Digest, he said the Ryder Cup has become  
``a little overcooked, but it's probably going to stay that way 
until players choose not to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Could that happen?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it could,'' Duval said.  
</P>
<P>
	He did not say for certain he would be among those who chose not  
to play. He also said such a boycott was ``imminent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only he never said boycott, even if that's what it sounded like.  
</P>
<P>
	``I answered the question about what it would take to change  
things,'' he said. ``I said it would take players not playing. I 
have a hard time, as a person, figuring out where that's saying 
it's a boycott. I never said I wanted to be paid. I said I think 
that we should have money to go back to our local communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some words were put in my mouth that probably shouldn't have  
been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The words he produces on his own don't flow as freely from his  
mouth as they did for Woods, although they share the same point of 
view on the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval squirms in his seat. He stammers. He can look  
disinterested. 
</P>
<P>
	He rarely apologizes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to think about ... which untruth did I tell, or  
what did I sugarcoat,'' he said. ``I don't have to do that because 
I say what I think, and I answer honestly. As much as anything, I 
guess more people seem to pay attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The key now is for Duval to bring the attention back to his  
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't won since the BellSouth Classic the week before the  
Masters, and the PGA Championship is his last chance of the year to 
win his first major. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval played the U.S. Open at Medinah as an 18-year-old amateur,  
and still remembers getting to within five shots of the lead on 
Sunday before he fell apart on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no TV cameras following his every move back then. No  
controversy. The only media interested in Duval in 1990 was the 
golf writer from his hometown paper. That's not the case anymore.

<HEADLINE> Govs. Want To Safeguard State Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The nation's governors told Congress on Tuesday  
that state treasuries should not be raided to pay for federal tax 
cuts, closing a four-day meeting that found Republican governors 
seeking more control over the GOP political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Governors' Association also voted unanimously to  
urge President Clinton and Washington lawmakers to move quickly to 
aid struggling farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	A resolution approved without debate said Congress must maintain  
the ``fiscal integrity'' of its relationship with governors by 
funding welfare and other social programs at levels promised by the 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure grew out of concerns expressed by Republican and  
Democratic governors with the GOP-led Congress' tax cut plan. 
Republican governors support tax cuts, but strongly objected to 
reports that congressional leaders wanted to use state welfare 
money to help pay for the $792 billion package. 
</P>
<P>
	They also expressed concern that Congress may be tempted to use  
the money to help keep the federal budget within spending caps. 
</P>
<P>
	``A deal is a deal,'' said Massachusets Gov. Paul Cellucci, a  
Republican who is pushing tax cuts in his own state. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma promised governors  
Sunday that the leadership would not seek the state money. Though 
the governors are still unsure of the House leadership's plans, 
their anger ebbed after Nickles' remarks; confrontational language 
was edited out of drafts of the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Without explicitly mentioning tax cuts, the resolution says  
governors are ``deeply concerned about the potential impact that 
proposed cuts would have on states' ability to provide key human 
services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic aides said the word ``cuts'' referred to the tax  
plan. Republican aides said it referred to possible program cuts, 
not the tax-cut package. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax debate was part of a broader effort by GOP governors to  
seize more control over the party's national agenda. In private 
meetings, they discussed using their influence to put like-minded 
Republicans on the committee that will write the party's platform 
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	With a fellow governor, George W. Bush of Texas, emerging as the  
leading Republican presidential candidate, the state leaders want 
the platform to reflect their pragmatic approach to governing. They 
feel past party statements, written for the social conservative 
wing of the party, have appeared too extreme or irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican governor will chair the party platform committee.  
Michigan Gov. John Engler is said to be top candidate for the post. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors also want to begin fashioning an agenda for the  
first hundred days of the next presidency, assuming the next 
president is a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governors are meeting with party leaders this  
fall to discuss ways they can have greater input on the party's 
election-year strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another NGA resolution said farmers and ranchers were fighting  
against a glut of crops, unstable markets and drought. ``Given the 
current situation, the nation's governors call on the U.S. Congress 
and the president to work together to immediately address the 
crisis facing the farmers and ranchers,'' read the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was not on the NGA agenda when state leaders  
gathered Saturday, but Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa pressed 
the issue in behind-the-scenes meetings with lawmakers from both 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution was already certain of approval today when  
Vilsack read a letter written by an Iowa farmer to his family 
shortly before killing himself. The farmer, who Vilsack did not 
identify, was distraught over financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so tired of fighting this game because it's a losing  
battle,'' Vilsack read from the letter, his voice choking.

<HEADLINE> Reno: Money Needed To Stop Recidivism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday suggested  
providing courts with more resources to keep defendants from 
committing new crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	If a former inmate has no job and no high school diploma,  
``Guess what? They're going to be doing it again,'' the attorney 
general told members of the American Bar Association, the nation's 
largest lawyers' group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's give our courts, our judges what it takes to do justice,  
what it takes to solve the human problems that bring the cases 
before them,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes no sense to send somebody to prison for an armed  
robbery and have them come out in four years ... without the 
problem being addressed,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	``No wonder people don't have confidence in the system,'' the  
attorney general said. ``Unless we bring them back to our 
communities with a chance of success, the criminal justice system 
is going to fail again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general noted the success of drug courts during her  
tenure as a Miami prosecutor, a concept now being used in many 
cities. Such courts focus on giving defendants treatment and 
incentives to not repeat their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar courts could be created to concentrate on domestic  
violence or child abuse and neglect cases, she said. She also 
suggested the use of ``re-entry courts'' for inmates being 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno acknowledged that some people may question the cost of such  
programs. ``How do we afford what we have now, with people 
recycling through the system again and again and again?'' she 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``When failure finally occurs it is the criminal justice system  
that takes the blame,'' she told the lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 57; Nasdaq Falls 61 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks extended their losses today as investors  
remained unsettled by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates at least once more this year. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 57.94 at 10,649.76. The blue-chip index was down more than 100 
points for much of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also off. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 21.62 at 1,276.18, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was down 61.57 at 2,457.41. With today's loss, the S&AMP;P 500 is 
10 percent below its July 16 record close, and the Nasdaq is 14 
percent off the record set the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street typically defines a drop of 10 percent from a market  
high as a correction. The Dow has held up slightly better as 
investors gravitate toward large, well-established names, but has 
dropped 5.4 percent from its record high. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of higher interest rates has kept the market on  
edge for the past two weeks. Hoping to keep inflation from creeping 
into the booming U.S. economy, the Fed is widely expected to raise 
short-term interest rates when its policy-making Federal Open 
Market Committee meets Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates typically hurt stocks by cutting into  
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent sessions, market players have begun to debate whether  
the Fed will raise rates in October as well, traders said. 
Increases in August and October would be the second and third of 
1999, undoing the three rate cuts imposed late last year as the Fed 
sought to keep the U.S. economy from being caught up in financial 
crises spreading through Asia, Russia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market always goes to extremes of fear and greed, and  
right now, fear is at an extreme,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief 
market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the pressure on stocks, the threat of Fed action has  
also pushed long-term interest rates to the highest levels in 
almost two years. Today, the 30-year Treasury bond yielded 6.24 
percent, a level last seen in November 1997, compared to 6.23 
percent late Monday. The high yields on bonds are presenting an 
attractive, less volatile alternative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks, which are highly sensitive to  
interest-rate fluctuations, were mostly lower today. J.P. Morgan 
fell 4 7/16 to 120 1/2, contributing most to the Dow's decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent was one of the steepest decliners in the S&AMP;P 500, losing  
1 15/16 to 61 11/16 after agreeing to buy International Network 
Services Inc. for about $3.7 billion. Shares of INS rose 2 13/16 to 
50 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent's deal strengthens its competitive position against Cisco  
Systems, analysts said, and helped drag Cisco shares down 13/16 to 
59. Cisco was expected to report earnings after the close of 
trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	The market slump created a hostile environment for initial  
public offerings today. Shares of HotJobs.com, an online job-search 
firm, were priced at 8 and by midafternoon were trading at 7 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 4-to-1 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 677.80 million 
shares in midafternoon, ahead of Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 7.50 at 602.96, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 11.83 at 766.04. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.76 to 419.13.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Earnings Rise 21 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's  
largest retailer, reported a 21 percent increase in second-quarter 
earnings despite being hindered by a large court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter was $1.25 billion, or 28 cents per  
share, compared with $1.03 billion or 23 cents per share in the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarter, which ended July 31, included a charge for a  
litigation settlement of approximately 3 cents per share. Without 
the charge, Wal-Mart's profits would have increased 35 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart announced in May that it had settled litigation with a  
Mexican grocery store chain. A jury in San Antonio had awarded 
Valores Corp. of Monterrey, Mexico, $624 million after concluding 
that Wal-Mart broke an agreement with the company. Wal-Mart and 
Valores settled for what Wal-Mart said was less than the jury 
award. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 15 percent to $38.47 billion from $33.52 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The company's Wal-Mart Stores segment, including Supercenters,  
had a pre-tax operating profit of $2.151 billion, compared to 
$1.787 billion for the same quarter last year, a 20 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sam's Club segment recorded operating profit for the quarter  
of $190 million, an increase of 10 percent compared to the $173 
million for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The international segment had a profit of $112 million for the  
most recent quarter compared with $124 million for the same quarter 
in the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
	As of July 31, the company had 1835 Wal-Mart stores, 622  
Supercenters, and 453 Sam's Club wholesale stores in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Internationally, Wal-Mart operated 13 stores in Argentina, 14 in  
Brazil, 155 in Canada, 95 in Germany, 433 in Mexico, 15 in Puerto 
Rico, and 229 in the United Kingdom. The company has six stores in 
China and five in South Korea under joint venture agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart has more than 1 million employees, including 815,000 in  
the United States and 220,000 internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the first six months of the fiscal year increased  
27 percent to $2.36 billion or 53 cents per share, compared with 
$1.86 billion or 42 cents per share, for the same period last 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Wal-Mart rose $2.68 3/4 to $42.87 1/2 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Soybean Futures Boosted by Drought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures rose to their highest levels  
since early May on the Chicago Board of Trade Tuesday as Midwest 
drought conditions lingered. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also gained. On other markets, unleaded gasoline  
futures fell sharply, while natural gas rose. Pork futures also 
rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for soybean futures climbed above $5 a bushel and corn  
futures also rose sharply amid reports of deteriorating crops, 
particularly in Illinois and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainfall of less than .15-inch fell in areas of northern  
Illinois and Indiana Monday, while the rest of the Midwest also 
remained fairly dry. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers are expected to move through the Midwest late this week,  
leading to slight increase in soil moisture and some improvement in 
crop conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts did not expect the scattered rainfall, which was to  
be accompanied by warmer temperatures, to be enough to revive 
moisture-starved corn and soybean crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also were responding to a U.S. Agriculture Department  
report released late Monday in which soybean crop ratings 
nationwide deteriorated last week -- from 57 percent to 54 percent 
in good to excellent condition. 
</P>
<P>
	More significantly, in Illinois -- the second-largest growing  
state behind Iowa -- only 48 percent of the crop was in good to 
excellent condition, while 17 percent in the crop was in poor to 
very poor condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn for December delivery rose 4 3/4 cents to $2.40 3/4 cents a  
bushel; November soybeans rose 5 1/2 cents to $4.93 1/2 cents a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gasoline futures fell sharply on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid expectations U.S. inventories are on the 
rise as the peak demand season begins to wane, said Tim Evans, 
senior energy analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, natural gas continued to gain on forecasts calling for  
a return of above-normal temperatures in key heating and cooling 
regions. Hotter temperatures force utilities to power up turbines 
to meet demand from consumers using air conditioners and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants were expecting the American Gas Association  
this week to report that inventories are now in a year-over-year 
deficit because of the recent heat wave in the Northeast and 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	September crude oil futures rose 3 cents to $21.30 a barrel;  
September heating oil fell .11 cent to 55.10 cents a gallon; 
September unleaded gasoline fell 1.01 cents to 65.03 cents a 
gallon; September natural gas rose 2.7 cents to $2.748 per 1,000 
cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, pork bellies continued their climb on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, in part because of U.S. pork donations to 
Russia announced earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	February pork bellies rose 2.58 cents to 58.45 cents a pounds;  
October lean hogs rose 1.12 cents to 46.77 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Graphics To Cut 3,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Silicon Graphics Inc. shares plunged  
more than 20 percent Tuesday after the struggling company said it 
will cut up to 3,000 jobs and spin off its Cray supercomputer 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	SGI said the cuts and reorganization -- the company's third in  
three years -- will help it focus on selling software and computers 
related to the Internet, and exploit the explosive growth of the 
medium. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Nordan, an analyst from Forrester Research in Cambridge,  
Mass., said the changes make ``a lot of sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``SGI's financial turnaround has been under way for about a year  
now, but I didn't think they had done enough to really come back,'' 
said Nordan. ``I was very encouraged by the latest changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But investors didn't seem convinced, pushing shares down more  
than 21 percent, or $3.50, to $12.56 1/4 in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	SGI, known for generating graphics in movies like Jurassic Park,  
bought Cray Research Inc. in 1996 for $740 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its acquisition by SGI, Cray's supercomputers competed  
with SGI's own powerful systems in a limited market including large 
scientific institutions and the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year SGI reorganized, and divided Cray off into an  
easy-to-sell subsidiary. Today's move further breaks Cray into a 
separate unit. While announcing no buyers, the company will pursue 
discussions ``with potential partners to assume the operation of 
this business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, SGI said it will rely on a partner to develop  
Intel-based workstations and create a business unit focused 
entirely on Internet systems that work with SGI computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Belluzzo, SGI's chairman and chief executive, said the  
company will lay off between 1,000 to 1,500 employees. Another 
1,500 employees will be reassigned to partnerships or small 
companies breaking off from SGI. 
</P>
<P>
	SGI has struggled in recent years against stiff competition by  
workstation makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM and Sun 
Microsystems Inc. It also has been hurt by less costly workstations 
and high-end personal computers using Intel chips and Microsoft's 
Windows NT operating software. 
</P>
<P>
	``The SGI that emerges from these alliances will be somewhat  
smaller than it is today, but it will be designed to focus on the 
technologies and markets where we add the most value, to respond 
more quickly to emerging trends and opportunities, and to put 
increased resources into serving our major customers,'' Belluzzo 
said.

<HEADLINE> Shatner's Wife Found Dead in Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The wife of ``Star Trek'' actor William  
Shatner was found dead in the swimming pool of their home, an 
apparent drowning that authorities said they were treating as an 
accident. The distraught Shatner said she ``meant everything to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nerine Shatner, 40, was pronounced dead at the scene late  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner arrived home at about 10:15 p.m. and found her at the  
bottom of the pool, police Lt. Adam Bercovici said. Shatner dialed 
911, pulled his wife out of the pool and administered CPR, but his 
efforts to revive her and similar efforts by emergency personnel 
were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was scheduled to determine the exact cause of death,  
but foul play was not a factor, Bercovici said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was home alone for a short period of time and accidentally  
drowned while swimming in the family pool,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I arrived home and I found my wife at the bottom of the  
pool,'' Shatner said today outside his hillside home in the 
affluent Studio City neighborhood. ``My beautiful wife is dead. She 
meant everything to me. Her laughter, her tears and her joy will 
remain with me the rest of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner, 68, appeared composed as he began speaking, but grew  
emotional and quickly went back inside his house. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple were married in November 1997. It was the third  
marriage for Shatner. His bride, then Nerine Kidd, was a former 
model. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an account of the wedding in People magazine, he  
vowed to her: ``I pledge allegiance to you, Nerine, my queen.'' 
Referring to the ring he placed on her finger, he quipped, ``When 
it is dark and there is trouble, you need but wave that bauble and 
there will be light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner is best known as Capt. James T. Kirk on the science  
fiction television show ``Star Trek.'' He also appeared in several 
``Star Trek'' movies, the 1980s television police drama ``T.J. 
Hooker'' and the reality-based show ``Rescue 911.'' In addition, he 
has turned out a series of science fiction books. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star Trek'' cast also had reason to mourn in June, when  
DeForest Kelley, who portrayed the cantankerous and compassionate 
Dr. McCoy, died after a lengthy illness at the age of 79.

<HEADLINE> Sports Leaders Urge Minority Owners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Minorities have made inroads into professional  
sports leadership, but must ascend to the highest levels for true 
change to occur, three sports industry leaders said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, led by National League president Leonard Coleman,  
discussed professional sports as a pathway to power during the 
National Urban League's annual conference in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Also speaking were Michael Huyghue, senior vice president for  
football operations with the Jacksonville Jaguars, and Carl Poston, 
a Houston-based sports agent who represents several star athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been 52 years since Jackie Robinson broke in (to  
baseball) in 1947, and we're on the edge of a new millennium,'' 
said Coleman, the highest ranking black official of a major 
professional league. ``In baseball, have we made progress? The 
answer is yes. Have we made enough progress? The answer is an 
emphatic, `No.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that in the past decade, the number of front-office jobs  
in professional baseball held by minorities has risen from 2 
percent to 21 percent, Coleman pointed out that only one black -- 
Bob Watson of the New York Yankees -- has held the position of 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Huyghue noted the disparity of minority athletes to leaders in  
pro football, where there are no minority owners and only three 
black coaches even though 70 percent of the league's players are 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am optimistic that in years to come, as I look around the  
NFL meeting rooms I sit in, I won't be the only dark face in the 
room,'' Huyghue said. 
</P>
<P>
	Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig was scheduled to  
speak but was unable to attend, citing scheduling conflicts, Urban 
League spokeswoman Leslie Dunbar said.

<HEADLINE> Five Shot at L.A. Jewish Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man with a high-powered gun burst into a  
Jewish community center Tuesday and sprayed the lobby with 20 to 30 
shots, wounding five people, including three boys attending day 
camp, and then walked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Police with dogs searched street-by-street in the surrounding  
suburban neighborhood for the suspect, described as a bald, white 
man around 40 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive was not known. ``Every possibility, including if it's  
a hate crime, we'll look into it,'' said Officer Guillermo Campos. 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously injured was a 5-year-old boy who was shot in  
the stomach and leg and underwent surgery. He was in critical but 
stable condition. Two 6-year-old boys, a 16-year-old girl and a 
68-year-old woman who worked at the center were in stable 
condition, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence was the latest in a series of shootings at  
workplaces and schools, and as the search for the gunman continued, 
President Clinton and others spoke out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by  
gun violence,'' Clinton said in Washington. ``It calls on all of us 
not only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their 
families, but intensify our resolve to make America a safer 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen children were in the center when the gunman  
burst into the North Valley Jewish Community Center and began 
spraying the lobby with bullets about 10:50 a.m., said Capt. Steve 
Ruda of the Los Angeles Fire Department. He fired up to 30 shots 
before walking down a hallway and out of the building, Ruda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruda said he believed the shooter used a 9mm Uzi. Police Chief  
Bernard Parks however, would only identify the gun as a 
high-powered weapon with a large magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing said by the suspect before the shooting,''  
Parks said. ``It was indiscriminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the shooting, officers raced to a spot nearby  
where a woman reported that a man resembling the suspect's 
description carjacked her Toyota, leaving a red-and-white van 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers searched the van, which had Washington state plates,  
and found a large amount of ammunition and possibly some 
bulletproof vests, but no weapons, said police Cmdr. Dave Kalish. 
</P>
<P>
	While SWAT teams deployed around the center and news and police  
helicopters buzzed overhead, about 20 small children were led 
unhurt from the building hand in hand and taken to a Jewish temple 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents rushed to the center and jammed against police lines  
trying to find out if their children were all right. Some parents 
wept and hugged one another. One man was handcuffed by officers 
after slipping under yellow police tape, but he was later released. 
Authorities used a fire department loudspeaker to announce the 
whereabouts of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to cry when I saw him,'' said Karen Macofsky, who was  
reunited with her 11-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. ``But I 
held back and just hugged him tightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Macalas prayed and recited psalms as he rushed to check  
on his children, ages 2 and 3. ``My feeling about it is it's 
another case of someone acting out in rage,'' he said. ``I don't 
want to believe this is an act of anti-Semitism here in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were searching for the gunman throughout the  
neighborhood of mostly single-family homes in the San Fernando 
Valley suburbs 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said  
about 20 older children from the Jewish center were touring the 
Wiesenthal center's Museum of Tolerance at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic that the 20 children were here learning about  
man's inhumanity to man, when their own day camp became a target of 
such hatred,'' Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program director at the North Valley center told Hier that  
most of the children had been playing outside when the gunman 
stormed in, Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The community center provides nursery programs, child care and  
camp activities. It has a large main building, a smaller houselike 
structure, a pool and tennis courts.

<HEADLINE> Computer Hacker Fined $4,125 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A computer hacker accused of a  
multimillion-dollar crime wave in cyberspace has been ordered to 
pay restitution to his victims -- without relying on the only way he 
knows how to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Mitnick, the only computer hacker to make the FBI's 10  
Most Wanted list, must pay $4,125 in ``token'' restitution to 
various companies and keep his hands off anything computer-related. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of an earlier plea agreement, U.S. District Judge  
Mariana Pfaelzer also sentenced Mitnick to three years and 10 
months in prison. With credit for time served, he will be eligible 
for release in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfaelzer told the 36-year-old Mitnick in strong terms Monday  
that she expected him to pay the restitution, though she doubted he 
will be able to earn more than minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just so we have an understanding, Mr. Mitnick, this is a token  
restitution order and you will be required to pay it. Do you 
understand?'' the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I understand it,'' answered Mitnick.  
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick was one of the FBI's Most Wanted fugitives when he was  
arrested in 1995 in North Carolina after a hacking spree that 
attracted worldwide attention from fellow hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	His victims included such companies as Motorola, Novell, Nokia  
and Sun Microsystems, and the University of Southern California. He 
was accused of breaking into a North American Air Defense Command 
computer, although the allegation was never proven. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick admitted in March to federal accusations he broke into  
the computers of several high-tech companies, stole software and 
installed programs that caused millions of dollars in damage. He 
pleaded guilty to five felony counts as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had asked that Mitnick be ordered to pay $1.5  
million, claiming his notoriety and skills will eventually allow 
him to earn money through book, film or TV contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Donald Randolph proposed his client be committed  
to a halfway house or rehabilitation center because of Mitnick's 
``obsessive behavior.'' The judge responded coldly, ``I am not 
going to take that recommendation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his incarceration and while on parole, Mitnick is  
prohibited from having access to what can be used for Internet 
access -- including computers, software, hardware, cellular 
telephones and televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also prohibited from working as a consultant to any firms  
with access to computers, and may not obtain access codes, 
encryption data or any altered telephone equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	At Monday's hearing, young computer aficionados crowded the  
courtroom to show their support. 
</P>
<P>
	A 17-year-old, who would only identify himself by his computer  
call sign ``Whippet,'' said he believed Mitnick was wrongfully 
locked up. He said he understood Mitnick's motivation as a hacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like an adventure,'' he said. ``You're just  
exploring. It's nothing malicious. It's like playing a sport, 
pushing yourself as far as you can go.''

<HEADLINE> Israel-Syria Direct Talks Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy urged  
Syria on Tuesday to come forward to the negotiating table, saying 
the time is ripe for making peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy was in Jordan looking for King Abdullah II's help in  
jump-starting negotiations with Syria. Abdullah, whose country 
signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, has been working to help 
revive Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations that broke off in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah has been passing on peace messages between Israeli  
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian President Hafez Assad. He has 
even proposed Jordan as a venue for the negotiations, Arab 
diplomats said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-running conflict between Syria and Israel hinges on the  
Golan Heights. Syria demands that Israel return the strategic 
plateau, which it captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy, speaking after his four-hour visit to Jordan, urged Assad  
to participate in direct talks instead of working through 
mediators. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy also said Israel is committed to implementing the Wye River  
accord with the Palestinians. The deal reached last fall includes 
Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stress that we are committed to the implementation of Wye  
and we expect the other side to implement its side of the agreement 
because each side is dependent on the other,'' Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's aides say he has asked the Palestinians to meet some of  
their security obligations -- such as confiscating illegal weapons 
and shrinking their police force -- before the first phase of troop 
withdrawal begins in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul-Illah Khatib said other issues  
he and Levy discussed included easing Israeli barriers on trade 
with the West Bank, the fate of 17 Jordanian prisoners in Israel 
and sharing scarce water resources in a region battered by drought.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Appears at WWF Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- The signs in the crowd read ``Ventura for  
Prez'' and ``The People's Governor,'' but Jesse Ventura wasn't at a 
political forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to his pro wrestling roots, Minnesota's governor  
ducked out of the National Governors' Association meeting to appear 
at a televised World Wrestling Federation event promoting his 
appearance later this month as a guest referee. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have called on Jesse Ventura 'cause I'm the only one to  
deliver law and order,'' said Ventura, who took a flight from St. 
Louis, the site of the governors' gathering, to Chicago on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura will be a guest referee at the Aug. 22 match between  
federation champion Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing in the ring with Triple H and WWF commissioner Shawn  
Michaels, Ventura spoke in a menacing voice reminiscent of his 
wrestling days. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not Minnesota. This is my world,'' Triple H told the  
governor in what appeared to be a well-rehearsed scene that 
included Ventura stepping in to break up a shoving match between 
Michaels and Triple H. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this is, is politics,'' Ventura said, as the crowd of  
more than 20,000 screamed ``Jesse, Jesse, Jesse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who came to see Ventura was Rosemont taxi driver  
Jamal Alawaiyed, 42, who said he liked Ventura as a wrestler and 
thinks he will be a good governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's from the people,'' Alawaiyed said. ``People make too much  
that he was a wrestler. Reagan was an actor and people voted for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has said he will donate to charity the $100,000 fee he  
is getting from the WWF to referee. He also has said the event will 
not demean his position as governor, likening it to former NBA star 
Bill Bradley, a Democratic presidential candidate, returning to 
basketball to referee a game.

<HEADLINE> Psychologist Testifies in Ga. Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A state-appointed psychologist testified  
Tuesday that a teen-ager accused of opening fire at his high school 
told him he didn't intend to kill anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to cause a big panic,'' James Edwards said  
15-year-old T.J. Solomon told him during an interview May 26, six 
days after the shooting which left six teens wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards said Solomon told him: ``I didn't want to hurt or kill  
anyone. I wasn't really aiming at anybody. I aimed at objects, not 
people -- the wall, the floor, the cinderblock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony came in the second day of a hearing to determine  
whether Solomon should be tried as an adult or kept in the juvenile 
system. Defense attorneys, who called Edwards to testify, contend 
Solomon should be committed to a mental institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon faces 21 charges, including aggravated assault and  
weapons violations. If convicted in Superior Court, he faces a 
sentence of up to life in prison. The maximum juvenile sentence is 
60 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing continues Wednesday afternoon, with closing  
arguments and perhaps a ruling from Judge William Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense psychologist Eddy Regnier testified that Solomon is  
severely depressed with psychotic tendencies. But after being asked 
directly by Schneider, Regnier said that if Solomon continued with 
medication, he could not be committed. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, a victim of the May 20 shooting testified that  
she believes Solomon should be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he gets off as a juvenile he could be out in a few months,  
and he doesn't need to be out,'' said Stephanie Laster, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Laster, the final prosecution witness, was the most  
severely injured of the six victims in the shooting at the school 
in Conyers, 20 miles east of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	She underwent two operations -- the second after her wounds  
became infected -- and was in the hospital for 12 days. Fragments of 
a bullet remain lodged in her hip bone and doctors aren't sure 
whether her ovaries have been damaged, she said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Issues Peacekeeper Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- For the first time, the United Nations  
laid out rules Tuesday regarding the conduct of U.N. peacekeepers, 
stating they must abide by the same international humanitarian laws 
that govern soldiers' actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued an executive order to  
coincide with Thursday's commemoration of the 50th anniversary of 
the Geneva Conventions, which governs the regulations for 
international combat. 
</P>
<P>
	The order essentially puts on paper the principles U.N. force  
commanders have used for five decades -- that the landmark treaty's 
rules for combatants apply to U.N. peacekeepers involved in active 
fighting. They too must protect civilians, give humane treatment to 
prisoners, restrict their use of weapons and face prosecution in 
their homelands if they violate any of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. document gained momentum in the early 1990s, when U.N.  
peacekeepers in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia were increasingly drawn 
into conflicts in which they not only acted in self-defense but 
used force to do their jobs -- sometimes excessively. 
</P>
<P>
	During the U.N. mission in Somalia, for example, a handful of  
peacekeepers from Canada, Italy and Belgium were accused of 
committing atrocities against Somalis, including dangling a boy 
over an open fire and force-feeding pork to a Muslim Somali boy 
accused of stealing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to reaffirm on the 50th anniversary of the  
Geneva Conventions that the U.N. itself and U.N. soldiers are 
subject to the same rules as everyone else,'' said Reed Brody, 
advocacy director of Human Rights Watch in New York, who welcomed 
Annan's order. 
</P>
<P>
	As an international organization and not a state, the United  
Nations cannot sign onto the Geneva Conventions, making Annan's 
order the binding substitute. 
</P>
<P>
	The order only covers U.N. military operations and Security  
Council-authorized enforcement missions in which the United Nations 
commands the force, a senior U.N. official told reporters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't apply, for example, to the Security Council-endorsed  
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo because NATO -- not the United 
Nations -- commands the military personnel, the official said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The official acknowledged the United Nations had no way to  
compel national courts to prosecute the cases, but said the future 
International Criminal Court might have jurisdiction over 
peacekeepers who commit war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Nordic and Latin American countries voiced philosophical  
problems with the document because it essentially equates U.N. 
peacekeepers with warriors in terms of their mutual rules of 
engagement, the U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a cover letter, Annan acknowledged the controversy but said  
the order's ``promulgation and dissemination in times of peace will 
diminish the risk of violation in times of war.''

<HEADLINE> Bank of America To Lend $3 billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Bank of America announced Tuesday it will fund an  
unprecedented $3 billion mortgage program for low- to 
moderate-income borrowers that promises no down payment, no 
application fee and no closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The national program will be overseen by Boston-based  
Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America, led by self-described 
``urban terrorist'' Bruce Marks, who has a track record of getting 
loan commitments from banks after flagrantly accusing them of 
discriminatory lending practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``As cynical as I am that all bankers are evil, this is the  
exception to the rule,'' said Marks. 
</P>
<P>
	The friendly agreement, which the 44-year-old Marks estimates  
will affect 100,000 borrowers nationally, is a watershed for the 
community activist. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Marks and Bank of America say the bank voluntarily decided  
to make the mortgage commitment because it's good business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not charity,'' said Robert Johnston, senior vice  
president for Bank of America's community development bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of cash transactions in the inner city,'' he  
said. ``We see a real value in lending in the inner city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, before NationsBank was acquired by Bank of America, it  
decided to lend $500 million in mortgages through Neighborhood 
Assistance Corp. over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighborhood Assistance, which now has 20 offices nationwide,  
originated the loans with low-income first-time homeowners who were 
often distrustful of banks. The organization helped navigate the 
borrower through the confusing mortgage process and, most 
important, offered post-ownership assistance -- while NationsBank 
made money, said Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always felt that Community Reinvestment Act lending was  
good business for banks,'' said Robert Garsson, spokesman for the 
federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. ``We've 
encouraged them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marks calls the program the biggest ever -- and a tremendous  
opportunity for working people who might not have the savings who 
need to buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a history of having to do whatever it takes to get  
lenders to the table,'' said Marks. ``Now we have lenders say, 
`This works.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America's home mortgage product will be available

<HEADLINE> Swimmer Makes Comeback in 50-Meter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- After a year away from competition, Amy Van  
Dyken resumed her medal-filled career Tuesday by winning the 
50-meter freestyle on the final day of the National Swimming 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	And with Van Dyken cheering him on from the deck, Gary Hall Jr.  
completed his own comeback in the men's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Dyken, 26, finished the sprint in 25.13 seconds at the  
University of Minnesota Aquatic Center to earn her fourth national 
title. The Lone Tree, Colo., native hadn't competed in a national 
meet since the spring of 1998 after undergoing shoulder surgery. 
Van Dyken will resume her training regimen and continue 
rehabilitating her shoulder in lieu of traveling to Sydney, 
Australia for the Pan Pacific Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, a three-time medalist in the 1996 Olympics, finished the  
50 in 22.13 to earn his fourth national championship. Hall, 24, was 
diagnosed with diabetes in March, missing the spring nationals, and 
was bedridden with the flu just five days ago. His time was fast 
enough to qualify for the Pan Pacific Games, but he wasn't sure 
whether he'd go. 
</P>
<P>
	Other titlists included Brooke Bennett, who won the women's  
1,500 freestyle in 16:14.77; Kristine Quance-Julian, who earned her 
10th national championship in the women's 200-meter individual 
medley (2:16.06); Tom Wilkens, who won the men's 200 IM in 2:02.03; 
and Chad Carvin, who won his 15th national title in the men's 
1,500-meter freestyle in 15:22.85.

<HEADLINE> Catfish Hunter Suffers Head Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Baseball Hall of Famer Jim ``Catfish''  
Hunter was unconscious and in critical condition in a 
neuro-intensive care unit after falling and hitting his head, a 
hospital spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, 53, who suffers from amyothropic lateral sclerosis -- an  
irreversible deterioration of the muscles -- fell Sunday while 
negotiating cement steps outside his home in Hertford, a friend 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just need everybody to keep him in your prayers,'' Hunter's  
wife, Helen, said Tuesday. ``We need everybody's prayers right now, 
and we need them strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was taken to a hospital in Edenton and transferred early  
Monday to Pitt County Memorial Hospital, which serves the East 
Carolina University medical school. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was unconscious and on a ventilator Tuesday, said  
hospital spokesman Doug Boyd. His condition was downgraded to 
critical from serious Monday, when he was awake, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's family was at the hospital with their minister, Boyd  
said. ``The family is very private right now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Childhood friend Charles Woodard said Hunter fell around 5:30  
p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was outside seeing off a friend and was going back up the  
steps to his house when his feet got tangled,'' said Woodard, who 
owns Woodard's Pharmacy. ``He just fell backward and hit his 
head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former major league pitcher was diagnosed in September with  
ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, a neurological disease that 
interferes with the signals the brain sends to the muscles. Over 
time, the muscles degenerate. The cause is unknown, and there is no 
cure. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter pitched for 15 years, winning 224 games, including a  
perfect game. He received five World Series rings while playing for 
the Oakland Athletics and New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd said Hunter hasn't undergone surgery since he was admitted  
to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The specialists up there are trying to support him as best  
they can,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, residents of Hunter's hometown turned out for a ceremony  
to honor him and kick off a foundation to aid people with ALS.

	Gunman Wounds Two at Jewish Center  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A gunman wounded five people, including a  
child, at a Jewish community center today. Dozens of police 
officers searched the complex for the shooter. Police described the 
gunman only as a male Hispanic. The shooting took place at the 
North Valley Jewish Community Center in the Granada Hills area of 
the San Fernando Valley shortly after the 10:50 a.m. PDT. A group 
of children were seen being led away on a nearby sidewalk. The 
center provides nursery programs, child care and camp activities.

	Dutch Gov't Legalizes Mercy Killing  
</P>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The Netherlands as soon as next  
year could become the first country to legalize mercy killing under 
a plan that would formalize practices already widely accepted and 
used. The Dutch government published plans today to legalize 
euthanasia under strict guidelines. Doctors judged not to have 
adhered to the guidelines would still face prosecution and a 
maximum 12-year jail term. The plans, which are expected to gain 
parliamentary approval next year, would allow children as young as 
12 to demand and receive euthanasia. Guidelines include making sure 
all other medical options are exhausted and a second opinion be 
sought.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- William Shatner's wife was found dead in  
their swimming pool, an apparent drowning that authorities said 
they were treating as an accident. The distraught ``Star Trek'' 
star said she ``meant everything to me.'' Shatner said he found his 
wife, Nerine, 40, at the bottom of a swimming pool when he returned 
home last night. Shatner said he dialed 911, pulled his wife out of 
the pool and administered CPR, but his efforts to revive her and 
similar efforts by emergency personnel were unsuccessful.

	250 Bodies Exhumed in Bosnia

<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Forensic experts,  
reconstructing a 1995 massacre in the Bosnian enclave of 
Srebrenica, have finished exhuming about 250 bodies from a mass 
grave, U.N. officials said today. Srebrenica was a Muslim enclave 
in northeast Bosnia. The United Nations declared it a ``safe 
heaven'' but did nothing to prevent Bosnian Serb forces from 
overrunning it in July 1995. The enclave's brutal fall left over 
7,000 Muslim men missing. The men are believed to have been 
systematically executed. Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and 
his war-time general Ratko Mladic were indicted for war crimes but 
are at large.

	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Suspected railroad killer Angel Maturino  
Resendiz has been indicted in the murder of a University of 
Kentucky student, and now faces charges in seven slayings. Fayette 
County prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty for 
Resendiz, who was indicted in the 1997 slaying of Christopher 
Maier, 21, on railroad tracks near the Kentucky campus. Authorities 
have linked the rail-riding Mexican drifter, who went by the alias 
Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, to a total of nine slayings.

director said today. The projected $166 million campaign will 
target the millions of people the agency historically has trouble 
counting, such as blacks, Hispanics and immigrants, Census Bureau 
Director Kenneth Prewitt said. Half the money will be used for ads 
in Spanish and other foreign languages. The bureau expects to get 
back about 61 percent of the census questionnaires that it plans to 
mail out next year. Enumerators will then be sent out into the 
streets to find those who did not return the forms.

<HEADLINE> Smith To Go With Taxpayers Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire today  
announced he would run for president as the candidate of the U.S. 
Taxpayers Party, urging conservatives to ``come home'' to their 
core beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith quit the Republican Party on July 13, saying it had  
abandoned its conservative platform on key issues such as abortion 
and gun control. At the time, sources close to his campaign said 
they expected him to run as the Taxpayers Party's candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If conservatives believe in the right to life, the Second  
Amendment, a strong constitutional government going to our 
constitutional rights, I believe I'm your person,'' he said in a 
telephone news conference this morning. ``Come home conservatives, 
and Bob Smith will be the next president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Party Chairman William Shearer said he expected Smith to win the  
party's nomination at its convention next month. Smith also wants 
the party to change its name to the Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there isn't any question he will get the nomination  
overwhelmingly,'' Shearer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who consistently drew little support in early Republican  
presidential polls, even in his home state, said he hoped to unite 
other disaffected conservatives in his independent run for the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a serious, serious endeavor by me. I intend to unite  
the conservative movement and (the other parties) are scared to 
death of it. This is going to be a grassroots effort that is going 
to take from the Democrats and the Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Taxpayers Party's platform calls for repealing the federal  
income tax, abolishing welfare and appointing judges who 
``acknowledge the legal personhood of the unborn child.'' It also 
says education cannot be separated from religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
	The founder of the 7-year-old party, Howard Phillips, appeared  
on the ballot in 39 states in 1996, but drew only 180,000 votes. 
Phillips and other party officials have said he was a placeholder 
for the party, which had hoped to attract a candidate with a higher 
profile in national politics. Smith will be taking on that role.

<HEADLINE> 4 Retailers Settle Sweatshop Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Four prominent retailers will pay for  
independent monitoring of Saipan's garment industry as part of a 
settlement of a federal class-action lawsuit brought to prevent 
worker abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Nordstrom Inc., J. Crew Group Inc., Cutter &AMP; Buck Inc. and  
Gymboree Corp. agreed to the oversight of their contractors with 
factories in the U.S. territory in an effort to comply with 
American labor laws and international human rights treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to destroy the garment industry in Saipan, but it  
should not come at the price of indentured servitude,'' plaintiffs' 
attorney William Lerach said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder still must approve the  
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Three lawsuits filed Jan. 13 described approximately 32  
contractors in Saipan as ``America's worst sweatshop'' where there 
were beatings, forced abortions, vermin-infested quarters, barbed 
wire and armed guards. Employees worked 12 hours a day, seven days 
a week, the suits claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Abuses in Saipan, a 13-mile-long Western Pacific island in the  
Northern Marianas, had been documented previously, but the lawsuits 
were the first legal attempt to hold U.S. retailers accountable for 
alleged mistreatment of workers by subcontractors under the federal 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing made in the Saipan factories are stamped with ``Made in  
the USA'' tags, making it appear it was made in compliance with 
U.S. labor laws, the suits alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the settlement call for the companies to establish a  
$1.25 million fund to finance the independent monitoring program, 
provide money to the workers, create a public education campaign 
and pay attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Nordstrom co-president Erik Nordstrom called the deal ``a  
positive step toward our goal of ensuring that the goods we 
contract to manufacture in Saipan are made in compliance with 
law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Cutter &AMP; Buck chairman Harvey Jones said his company already  
closely monitors its Saipan contractors, and called the firm's 
decision to settle ``a business decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statements released by J. Crew and Gymboree stressed the  
companies have not admitted wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys also filed a letter of agreement in principle to  
settle with Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., 
Donna Karan International Inc. and Chadwick's of Boston Ltd., who 
were to be named as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles on Monday, attorneys for the lawsuit's 13  
remaining defendants argued the case should be shifted to Saipan 
for jurisdictional reasons. No ruling was made. 
</P>
<P>
	A related federal suit filed in Saipan targeting overtime pay  
was dismissed by a judge on Friday, Lerach said. A third suit, 
filed at state court in San Francisco against 18 retailers, will 
also be settled, he said.

<HEADLINE> Drought Is Dangerous for Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW LISBON, N.J. (AP) -- From his 7-by-7-foot perch overlooking  
the piney wilderness, Sean Morgart can spot trouble 10 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgart, who works for the New Jersey Forest Fire Service,  
spends his days atop a 100-foot tower in the heart of the state's 
million-acre Pinelands region, looking for smoke. When he sees a 
column rising from the trees, the first thing he notices is the 
color. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it comes up in a dark cloud with a lot of turmoil in the  
plume, you know you're in trouble,'' he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	And Morgart has been seeing a lot more trouble this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	While the drought of 1999 has devastated Eastern farms --  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman on Tuesday made farmers in New 
Jersey and parts of New York and Pennsylvania eligible for 
emergency loans -- the dry spell also is taking a severe toll in 
woodlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest fires are easier to ignite, burn hotter once they get  
started and are harder to extinguish. Three times as many wildfires 
as normal have been reported in New Jersey this year, and other 
states are facing similar threats. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Massachusetts, 5,000 acres have burned since April; in a  
typical year, 3,000 acres burn. 
</P>
<P>
	--New Hampshire officials have counted more than 1,245 wildfires  
this spring and summer, compared with 550 in a normal year. 
</P>
<P>
	--West Virginia has recorded more than 100 forest fires this  
summer, instead of the usual three or four. And autumn -- when dry, 
fallen leaves pose the biggest danger of fire -- is still ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Even places that have escaped major forest fires have had small  
underground fires that burn into the forest floor, where root 
systems are starved for water. Firefighters must continually check 
back on blazes that appear to have been extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
	``They follow the root systems and sometimes burn horizontally  
under the ground for days -- sometimes weeks -- before they resurface 
again,'' said Jim Downie, a forest ranger with the Maine Department 
of Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires can start with burning cigarette butts thrown from  
automobiles, lightning strikes, campfires, arson -- even tall grass 
ignited by an automobile's overheated catalytic converter. 
</P>
<P>
	While few of this summer's fires have caused significant  
property damage and no deaths have been reported, they are 
decimating trees and shrubs that -- in some places -- will never 
recover, according to botanist Bruce Stein of The Nature 
Conservancy, an Arlington, Va.-based group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem in an extreme drought is that you can have fires  
that burn hotter than normal,'' Stein said. ``Where the forest 
might be adapted for low-intensity fires, a hotter-than-average 
fire can be more destructive than normal fires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey and other states have imposed drought emergency  
restrictions, including a ban on outdoor fires. They hope that's 
enough, especially come fall, when the danger increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so dry, anything can light a fire,'' Morgart said. ``The  
only thing left to do is to close the woods entirely.''

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Lowers Earnings Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. said today it expects  
fourth-quarter earnings to be 10 percent lower than a year ago due 
to a drop in sales and to expenses associated with its CalComp 
Technology subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contractor said that for all of 1998 diluted  
earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, will rise between 
2 percent and 4 percent, below current analysts' estimates for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial results for the quarter and full year will be released  
the week of Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed blamed the lower earnings outlook on a drop in sales  
stemming from a lull in commercial space activities, delayed space 
launches and delayed C-130J deliveries from 1998 into 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also noted that total fourth-quarter pretax charges  
for CalComp are expected to range from about $150 million to $200 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it said its outlook for free cash flow for the year is  
above analysts' expectations of $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are redoubling our efforts to aggressively reduce our cost  
base, improve margins, and increase free cash flow ...,'' Vance 
Coffman, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter diluted earnings per share will be 10 percent  
lower than the $1.79 per share earned a year ago, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lockheed was optimistic about 1999. It said it expects  
diluted earnings per share to resume a low double-digit growth rate 
for next year, with estimated annual sales growth in the mid-single 
digits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This outlook incorporates the short-term negative effect of  
substantial investments in our high growth businesses such as 
telecommunications, launch vehicles, and information and automation 
services,'' said Coffman. ``We fully anticipate these investments 
to generate significant sales and earnings growth in the future, 
with commensurate growth in shareholder value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed said it expected that over the five-year period,  
1999-2003, it will achieve mid-single digit annual sales growth, 
overall margin improvement, low double-digit annual earnings per 
share growth, and between $8 billion and $9 billion of free cash 
flow for the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Employing more than 160,000 people worldwide, Lockheed Martin  
had 1997 sales surpassing $28 billion.

<HEADLINE> Court: Vets Not Assured Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A federal appeals court has dismissed a  
lawsuit by a veterans group that accused the government of breaking 
its promise of lifetime health care benefits for those with 20 
years of military service. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals dismissed the lawsuit Monday, saying  
retirees do not have the absolute right to medical and dental care, 
but they may be given the service subject to availability. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left with the Justice Department seeking comment was  
not returned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9,000-member Coalition of Retired Military Veterans can ask  
the Court of Appeals to reconsider, appeal to the Supreme Court or 
resubmit the lawsuit, said chairman Jim Gunn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not asking for anything except what we earned,'' Gunn  
said. ``We're not freeloaders. We just want what we were told we 
had when we signed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gunn, a 68-year-old Korean War veteran who won a Purple Heart,  
said numerous military and Coast Guard recruitment brochures 
promised lifetime health care and dental benefits to personnel who 
serve at least 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the promises were inducements to sign up.  
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, retirees have had their access to free care at  
military hospitals trimmed by budget cuts and base closings. 
Retirees are urged to join an HMO-like system with an annual 
premium. They drop out of the program once they reach 65 and are 
eligible for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	In siding with the Justice Department, the appeals court said  
military regulations never provided for unconditional lifetime free 
medical care or authorized recruiters to promise care as an 
inducement to joining or staying in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the decision to provide medical care to military  
retirees should be up to Congress and the president, not the 
courts.

<HEADLINE> IEA Foresees Tighter Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Economic recovery in Asia and meager growth in  
world oil supplies are likely to cause the petroleum market to 
tighten, although revised estimates of global inventories have 
eased fears of an impending shortage, according to a closely 
watched industry survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Energy Agency said in a report released  
Tuesday that an unexpected increase of 54 million barrels in 
estimates of May oil inventories in the world's wealthiest 
countries offset much of the drawdown in stocks during the year's 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	If correct, the revision weakens the argument the agency made  
last month that the world faces an oil shortage this winter that 
could be its worst in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised figures also could undermine the logic for the  
current strength in oil prices, which continued to rise in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris-based IEA is part of the Organization for Economic  
Cooperation and Development, a group of the world's most developed 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The IEA report warned against overreaction to the inventory  
revisions, saying they might be readjusted downward somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even so, the picture painted by the data is of a market still  
in transition from last year's massive glut to what looks to be a 
much tighter market next year,'' the study said. ``That tighter 
market may be farther down the road than had been perceived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said U.S. authorities recently added 19.5 million barrels to  
the country's inventories in a recalculation of May figures. 
European stocks were revised due to unexpected increases in 
inventories in Germany and some smaller countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the IEA forecast that a gathering economic recovery  
among countries in East Asia, combined with a sluggish growth in 
oil output by non-OPEC producers, still will cause global demand to 
exceed supply by 1.4 million barrels per day in the third quarter 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap is expected to widen to 2.87 million barrels a day in  
the fourth quarter and 3.51 million barrels a day in the first 
quarter of the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said members of the Organization of Petroleum  
Exporting Countries boosted production by 190,000 barrels per day 
in July but still achieved a 91 percent compliance rate with 
cutbacks they agreed upon in March. OPEC's revised compliance rate 
for June was 87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price for widely traded Brent crude has surged on OPEC's  
discipline in limiting output, rising 8 percent in July alone, the 
IEA noted. Brent was trading Tuesday at $20.26 per barrel on the 
spot market, more than $8 per barrel higher than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	West Texas Intermediate crude climbed 3 percent last month and  
was trading Monday at $21.28 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry analysts suggest that prices may have peaked and  
could reverse course. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that the oil price is out of line with the  
fundamentals. It's only a matter of time before there's some 
downward correction,'' said Charlie Sharp, an analyst with the 
London-based brokerage T. Hoare Canaccord. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC's biggest producer, Saudi Arabia, has said it wants Brent  
prices to stay within a range of $18 to $20 per barrel. If oil 
prices rise beyond their current levels, some OPEC members may be 
tempted to exceed production quotas to maximize their earnings. But 
gains would prove short-lived, as more abundant oil would depress 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher prices also would make it possible for non-OPEC suppliers  
with higher production costs to begin pumping crude of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone seriously believes we're in for $20 per  
barrel next year,'' said Alan Sinclair, an analyst at Charterhouse 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair called the current price ``a spike'' and predicted that  
Brent would drift back down toward $16 per barrel, based on its 
level in previous years.

<HEADLINE> 15 Hostages Freed in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Former junta soldiers freed their  
remaining prisoners today, ending a five-day hostage crisis, Sierra 
Leone's information minister said. 
</P>
<P>
	Julius Spencer said at news conference that the rogue rebels had  
freed 15 West African intervention force soldiers, a U.N. military 
observer and some 200 civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the hostages have been released,'' Spencer said. ``The  
hostage drama is over in Sierra Leone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His account was confirmed by Brig. Gen. Subhash Joshi, the  
United Nation's chief military observer in Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
	At United Nations headquarters in New York, U.N. spokesman Fred  
Eckhard said most of the 200 civilians released were children. 
</P>
<P>
	The freed hostages were headed to Freetown and had radioed from  
a government-controlled checkpoint, Spencer and Joshi said. 
</P>
<P>
	A former junta official returned to his ex-colleagues' camp  
Monday night to negotiate the release of hostages. The kidnapping 
highlighted divisions among Sierra Leone's rebels, who fought an 
8-year civil war for control of the West African nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Idriss Kamara returned to the forest outside  
Freetown, the former junta soldiers freed four U.N. military 
observers and a Sierra Leonean journalist Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	About 35 people were taken hostage Wednesday, sparking a crisis  
that has jeopardized Sierra Leone's fragile peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamara was captured by his former junta colleagues Friday after  
he tried to negotiate a hostage release. He was freed Sunday 
morning with five U.N. drivers, but returned that night to help 
negotiate the release of 13 more hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	``They treated us fine,'' Chernor Bangura, a cameraman for  
Sierra Leone state television, said in a telephone interview. ``We 
were given one meal a day and tea in the morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The junta, led by Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, governed Sierra  
Leone for 10 months beginning in June 1997, ending when the 
military regime was ousted by the West African intervention force. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidnappings took place during what was to have been a  
handover of some 150 civilians abducted by gunmen during Sierra 
Leone's civil war. But after freeing a few hostages last week, the 
ex-junta soldiers instead seized the group that had come to receive 
the prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon Rogers, the rebels' war council chairman, today lashed  
out at the kidnappings, saying the rebels ``vehemently condemn the 
abduction incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The abduction incident will not derail the peace process,''  
said Rogers, who lead a small delegation that met with President 
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. 
</P>
<P>
	Kabbah, reaching out to men who were his sworn enemies a few  
months ago, said he ``commended the efforts'' by rebel leader Foday 
Sankoh, former junta leader Koroma and Liberian President Charles 
Taylor to secure the hostages' release. 
</P>
<P>
	Freed hostages say as many as 2,000 disenchanted members of the  
former junta may be living in the jungle hideaway where the 
prisoners were held. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Embassy official, meanwhile, said a team of staffers from  
the House Appropriations Committee and the International Relations 
Committee today flew to Sierra Leone's interior accompanied by U.S. 
Ambassador Joe Melrose. The nature of the trip to Kenema, a 
pro-government town not far from a key rebel base, was not 
immediately clear.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Unsure on Underwood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Coach Dennis Green believes in second  
chances, just maybe not for Dimitrius Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-round draft pick who went AWOL after his first pro  
practice on Aug. 2 decided after a 75-minute phone conversation 
with Reggie White that he wanted to try to balance faith and 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood flew to Minneapolis Tuesday and was met by Minnesota  
Vikings scout Jeff Robinson and team chaplain Keith Johnson, who 
planned to accompany the 22-year-old rookie back to training camp 
to meet with Green, who will decide his fate. 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference scheduled for Tuesday night at the Vikings  
headquarters in Eden Prairie was postponed until Wednesday because 
``one of the parties is arriving late,'' team spokesman Bob Hagan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagan declined to say if that party was Underwood's agent, Craig  
Domann, who was traveling Tuesday and didn't immediately return a 
phone message. 
</P>
<P>
	Green insisted Underwood's strange case and its salary cap  
ramifications won't alter the organization's risk-taking 
philosophy, a principle that reaped huge rewards in wide receiver 
Randy Moss last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't second-guess yourself,'' Green said. ``We have  
always been involved in second chances. That's part of our way we 
do business. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we're not going to change how we do business and how we  
look at things because of one time. We believe in what we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't necessarily mean the welcome mat is out for  
Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've not said what we would do with Dimitrius Underwood if he  
were to come back, and I'm not going to say it now,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, the 29th pick in the NFL draft out of Michigan State,  
where he missed his senior season with an ankle injury, left the 
Vikings without explanation one day after signing a five-year, $5.3 
million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	He hitched an 80-mile ride to the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport  
and apologetically told his agent the next day that he'd had to 
tend to a family crisis and was on his way back to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	But he didn't return, didn't call anybody, and his whereabouts  
were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter from the Star Tribune of Minneapolis finally tracked  
him down over the weekend in a Philadelphia hotel lobby, where 
Underwood, with $6 to his name, said he'd been torn between his 
faith in God and a career in professional football. 
</P>
<P>
	After speaking at length with White, a minister and the NFL's  
career sacks leader who retired from the Green Bay Packers this 
winter, Underwood said he'd decided to return to the Vikings and 
ask for Green's forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	But Underwood didn't return to camp Monday night or for  
Tuesday's practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Green was in no mood to talk about Underwood during his morning  
media session, saying he had no update. When a reporter tried to 
ask again about the perplexing pass rusher, Green snapped: ``Come 
on. I just answered the question. I'm not interested in anything 
else on Dimitrius.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White told The Associated Press that, while he preferred to keep  
his conversation with Underwood private, he felt the troubled 
rookie needed to get in touch with Green ``and explain what he was 
going through because one thing he's done is left Denny hanging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White said he understands the trepidations both men must have  
about a reunion, but whatever Green decides regarding Underwood's 
playing status, ``it's a legitimate decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could talk to Dimitrius again, I'd tell him, `Call Denny.  
Have a long talk with him and assure him this won't happen again.' 
Say, `I'm ready to play and ready to use my talent to help the team 
win and, in the process of that, find out who I really am,''' White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And should he return to the Vikings, White added that Underwood  
should seek spiritual guidance from teammates Randall Cunningham 
and Cris Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Vikings began exploring ways to part company with  
Underwood, weighing the financial risk and resulting litigation and 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood received a partially deferred signing bonus of  
$1,725,000. He got about $543,000 after taxes, but most of that was 
frozen indefinitely in his Milwaukee bank after his disappearance.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Expects To Cut More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco PLC will cut 4,500 more jobs this year  
than originally planned, even though its second-quarter operating 
income rose by 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company laid off 12,500 people by the end of July and said  
it expects to trim its work force by an additional 2,000 by the end 
of the year, chief executive John Browne told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined reductions mark an increase from the company's  
original plan, outlined in February, to cut 10,000 jobs this year. 
The planned cuts would leave BP Amoco with 82,500 employees by the 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	A company official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
many of the remaining cuts would come in downstream operations like 
refining and chemicals, which have suffered pinched profit margins 
due to higher prices they must pay for oil. The official refused to 
name the countries where the remaining cuts would be made. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco also said today its operating profit rose to $1.23  
billion in the second quarter, compared to last year's level of 
$1.08 billion. Operating income in its line of business, 
exploration and production led the way, surging 54 percent over the 
year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, formed by British Petroleum PLC's purchase last  
year of Chicago-based Amoco Corp., has realized the financial 
benefits of its merger sooner than anticipated, chief executive 
John Browne said. It expects to save $2 billion per year as a 
result of the union. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco shares rose 1,234 pence ($19.74) in late trading, up  
0.9 percent from Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvement in the company's upstream sector stemmed largely  
from higher oil prices, which boosted profits. Average oil prices 
during the three months ending June 30 were $14.49 per barrel, 
against $12.13 during the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco is currently in the process of absorbing Atlantic  
Richfield Corp. and is expected to approve the takeover in 
September.

<HEADLINE> Tupperware Begins Online Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Tupperware, which for decades relied  
solely on face-to-face sales at parties, on Tuesday began selling 
its housewares over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The move online is the latest innovation for the company in its  
efforts to get Tupperware containers into the hands of its 
customers following a year of declining sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupperware, which had $1.1 billion in sales last year, announced  
in May that it would sell merchandise on the Home Shopping Network 
during television specials. 
</P>
<P>
	And last Christmas, the company began selling Tupperware  
products at shopping mall kiosks. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupperware officials emphasized that the new ventures will  
supplement, not replace, the traditional Tupperware parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our party-plan platform remains our core selling method,''  
said Betty Palm, president of Tupperware U.S. ``The Internet, our 
mall kiosk program and the new venture with the Home Shopping 
Network are part of our ... strategy to attract more customers to 
our brand and direct new leads to our sales force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, located at www.tupperware.com, was designed to  
appeal to Tupperware's predominantly female customers by including 
a personal recipe database, recipe exchange e-mail capabilities and 
home economics advice, said Susan Hight, manager of Internet 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want women to feel as though they are browsing through a  
favorite magazine, with updated regular features and service they 
can come back to often,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Smith To Go With Taxpayers Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Four weeks after he left the Republican  
Party, U.S. Sen. Bob Smith found a new home Tuesday with the U.S. 
Taxpayers Party, and urged fellow conservatives to join him. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith quit the Republican Party on July 13, saying it had  
abandoned its conservative platform on key issues such as abortion 
and gun control. Instead, the senator from New Hampshire plans to 
run for president as the candidate of the U.S. Taxpayers Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``If conservatives believe in the right to life, the Second  
Amendment, a strong constitutional government going to our 
constitutional rights, I believe I'm your person,'' he said in a 
telephone news conference Tuesday morning. ``Come home 
conservatives, and Bob Smith will be the next president of the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Party Chairman William Shearer said he expected Smith to win the  
party's nomination at its convention next month. Smith also wants 
the party to change its name to the Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there isn't any question he will get the nomination  
overwhelmingly,'' Shearer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who consistently drew little support in early Republican  
presidential polls, even in his home state, said he hoped to unite 
other disaffected conservatives in his independent run for the 
presidency. He predicted he will attract voters from diverse groups 
such as veterans, pro-life Catholic Democrats and workers who've 
lost their jobs because of overseas trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had reportedly considered seeking the Reform nomination,  
but said his philosophy more closely matches the Taxpayers Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taxpayers Party's platform calls for repealing the federal  
income tax, abolishing welfare and appointing judges who 
``acknowledge the legal personhood of the unborn child.'' It also 
says education cannot be separated from religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
	The founder of the 7-year-old party, Howard Phillips, appeared  
on the ballot in 39 states in 1996, but drew only 180,000 votes. 
Phillips and other party officials have said he was a placeholder 
for the party, which had hoped to attract a candidate with more of 
a national profile. Smith will try to fill that role.

<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Online auction company eBay Inc. has  
hired Gateway Inc.'s chief information officer to be its new 
technology executive and help end a series of debilitating computer 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Maynard Webb, 43, will lead eBay's other recently hired  
technology executives: chief technology officer Mark Ryan, 
previously of IBM, and chief information officer Bob Quinn, 
formerly of Sun Microsystems. 
</P>
<P>
	At Gateway, Webb worked on expanding the e-commerce operations  
of the nation's No. 2 computer maker. As eBay Technologies 
president, Webb will report directly to eBay CEO Meg Whitman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident that he possesses the vision and hands-on  
experience to help ensure eBay's site stability moving forward and 
to help scale eBay's system for the future,'' Whitman said in 
announcing his appointment on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay's site went down again Sunday for nearly three hours when  
credit card processing failed. The site crashed for nearly 10 hours 
Friday and for nearly 24 consecutive hours in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock rose slightly in early trading Tuesday after  
falling more than 14 percent Friday and Monday.

<P>
	Blue-collar Earl, timid Elliott and Eddie the swinger inhabit  
``Void Cafe'' a virtual reality game that allows players to learn 
about interactions among people from diverse backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	By manipulating movements of the characters, players learn their  
likes, dislikes and attitudes toward one another. Direct them to 
activities they like, and the characters become joyous. Rub them 
the wrong way, and they just might storm off the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at computer games they're all adventure or  
fighting games: Can I shoot him before he shoots me?'' said Bruce 
Blumberg, an assistant professor of media arts at Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology who directed development of ``Void Cafe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We build worlds and put characters in them. We're interested  
in characters who are empathetic, who are surprised when things 
happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, backed in part by a consortium of companies that  
includes Mattel Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., was on 
display in the emerging technologies collection at Siggraphics 99, 
a conference showcasing the latest developments in computer 
graphics and interactive methods. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual conference, which continues through Thursday, was  
expected to attract more than 50,000 people to see exhibits from 
325 companies and research institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans shelled out $1.8 billion for computer games during  
1998, according to the Interactive Digital Software Association, 
the lobbying group for the computer and video games industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of computer game violence has grown in recent months,  
particularly with the revelation that the teen-agers who carried 
out the Columbine High School massacre frequently played ``Doom,'' 
a game in which the player wins by killing larger numbers of 
onscreen characters. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of smart characters, said Blumberg, is that they can  
teach players to learn about and adjust to people who are 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``Void Cafe'' begins with Earl, Eddie and Elliott each sitting  
alone in a diner. Forks stuck into plastic dinner rolls act as 
wireless joysticks that players use to make the characters move to 
music. As a shy and reluctant Elliott begins to dance, Earl scowls. 
Eddie covers his eyes, expecting disaster. If the player finds 
movements that Elliott likes, Elliott begins to enjoy music and 
dances well. Earl and Eddie begin to respond with smiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The players remember their experiences. Make a character angry  
or embarrassed, and they will response with reluctance or could 
refuse to play next time around. 
</P>
<P>
	The game is the first step toward more complex interactions.  
</P>
<P>
	Companies supporting the project believe such games have  
commercial potential, said Blumberg. Researchers, for example, 
could program a virtual Bugs Bunny who would remember the players 
and interact with them based on previous experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Ideally, humans would learn, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``What we're interested in doing is have it become more of a  
social experience with virtual characters,'' said Bill Tomlinson, 
an MIT graduate student who worked on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Blumberg and his colleagues, the goal is not to create a  
best-selling game, but to use the research and development process 
as a means of studying the nature of intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intelligence is a tangle of motivation and learning,'' he  
said. ``The only way to build intelligent systems is to put those 
factors in and see what develops.''

<HEADLINE> Weinhauer Out as Bucks GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Bucks, big losers in the NBA's  
free agent derby last week, announced Tuesday night they will not 
renew the contract of general manager Bob Weinhauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinhauer's contract was due to expire Aug. 20. He was named the  
team's general manager two years ago, and he has presided over a 
tremendous overhaul in the team's roster and coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the guidance of first-year coach George Karl, the Bucks  
returned to the playoffs last season for the first time since 1991 
and appeared to be a team on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	But last week Milwaukee lost free agents Michael Curry and Dell  
Curry to the Detroit Pistons and Toronto Raptors, respectively, 
undermining the team's previously solid roster. In addition, Karl, 
who was hired last August, has taken added responsibility for 
roster and personnel decisions over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinhauer, a career coach who was vice president of basketball  
operations with the Houston Rockets for two years, replaced Mike 
Dunleavy as general manager of the Bucks in June 1997 after a year 
as an assistant to coach Chris Ford, who was fired before last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am gratified to have had the opportunity to play a part in  
returning the Bucks to playoff basketball,'' Weinhauer said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate the effort and results Bob provided to us during  
his three years here, particularly the last two seasons as general 
manager,'' Bucks owner and president Herb Kohl said. ``Bob gave us 
direction and progress at a critical time and played a key role in 
our improvement. We wish him well in whatever he decides to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Weinhauer's two seasons as general manager, the Bucks had  
a record of 64-68. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinhauer, who coached Penn to the Final Four in 1979, may not  
have seen the change coming. He spoke last week of several possible 
trades he was contemplating and expressed hope for the team's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	The team signed backup point guard Haywoode Workman to a  
one-year contract on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Super Size Doesn't Mean Super Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Shoppers who believe they always get a  
better deal when they buy a bigger size may be getting fooled. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from Purdue University presented a study Tuesday  
that found consumers often don't bother to compare per-ounce or 
per-unit prices -- and they may pay more because of it. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because of a retailing practice called ``surcharging,''  
where larger packages cost more per unit than smaller packages of 
the same product, said James Binkley, a professor of agricultural 
economics at Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Binkley and study co-author John Bejnarowicz, a Purdue graduate  
student and executive for AC Nielsen Research, studied canned tuna 
prices and found the larger the cans, the more expensive the tuna. 
They concentrated their study on tuna because it consistently has 
surcharges and the product sizes are easy to compare. 
</P>
<P>
	To illustrate their findings, Bejnarowicz bought tuna at a local  
Kroger supermarket: the 6-ounce can cost 89 cents; the 12-ounce can 
was $2.19 -- 41 cents more than two 6-ounce cans. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers say surcharges also often are found on toilet  
paper, coffee, dish detergent and ketchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Mullen, a spokesman for StarKist Seafood in Newport,  
Ky., said the company provides a recommended retail price, but the 
actual price generally is left to individual supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 6-ounce cans of tuna are often used as ``loss leaders''  
-- items grocers are willing to lose money on to get a customer into 
the store to buy other products. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the practice of StarKist to surcharge our product,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross Thomas, a spokesman for Cincinnati-based Kroger Co., said  
the 6-ounce can of tuna is the most popular promotional size and 
manufacturers tend to discount the price. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers used price data compiled by Selling Areas  
Marketing Inc. in 54 major metropolitan areas. They studied the 
52-week price average of three brands that share 90 percent of the 
tuna market: StarKist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was presented at the American Agricultural Economics  
Association annual meeting in Nashville.

<HEADLINE> Jets To Give Lucas a Chance at QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- -- Two seasons ago, Jets coach Bill  
Parcells gambled on turning special-teams ace Ray Lucas into an NFL 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday at Green Bay, Parcells will see if his investment is  
working out. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said Tuesday that Lucas will receive a majority of the  
snaps when the Jets open their preseason schedule against the 
Packers. Starter Vinny Testaverde will begin the game, but won't 
play beyond the early part of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a good athlete,'' said Parcells, who signed Lucas  
for New England as an undrafted free agent from Rutgers in 1996. 
Lucas played quarterback in college, but has emerged as a 
special-teams star as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he wants to win games. I think he has no fear. I think  
he's an outstanding competitor. But this has been quite a long 
project to try to turn him into a professional quarterback. This is 
his time now. He knows it. We're going to see progress, or we're 
going to have to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas, who turned 27 last week, was played at receiver and  
special teams during his one season at New England, competing in 
the postseason and Super Bowl that year. Once with the Jets, 
however, Parcells tinkered with switching Lucas to defense before 
settling on a move back to quarterback, utilizing the 6-3, 
214-pound speedster as a running threat behind center in occasional 
short-yardage situations. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Lucas is battling another former Patriot, Scott  
Zolak, for a backup role to Testaverde. Former New England punter 
Tom Tupa, who like Zolak can be a backup quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've come from being a free agent to the practice squad to a  
defensive back to a wide receiver to just special teams, back to 
wide receiver to getting in and running the quarterback draw for 
positive yards,'' Lucas said. ``The next thing you know, I'm still 
playing special teams and last year I played eight snaps at 
quarterback. Now I'm here competing for the backup job to Vinny 
Testaverde. It's unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roller coaster ride may come to a quick halt, however, if  
Lucas fares poorly this summer, particularly against Green Bay. He 
is 4-of-7 passing over the past two seasons for 56 yards and one 
interception. He has rushed for 88 yards on 13 attempts. In an 
intrasquad scrimmage on Saturday, Lucas looked solid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty pleased with him,'' Parcells said, ``but doing a  
good job out there (on the practice field) and doing a good job in 
Green Bay is another thing. It's a hostile environment and I think 
this is a good place to let him try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas already feels the pressure.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be sick about four or five times,'' he said. ``When I was  
at wide receiver, I'd be so excited before the game, I'd get 
physically sick.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Tax Bill Helps Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From railroads to arrowhead makers to huge  
multinational companies, the $792 billion tax cut package pushed 
through Congress by Republicans has help for businesses large and 
small. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly $72 billion of the total cuts over 10 years would  
directly benefit business, and many stand a good chance of 
eventually becoming law even if President Clinton vetoes this 
version of the bill as he has promised. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you've gotten into the bill, you can go back up to the  
Hill and say, 'This is noncontroversial because it's been passed by 
either the House or Senate,''' said Evan Liddiard, a partner at the 
KPMG accounting firm's national tax office. ``You've gotten a foot 
in the water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the breaks are big and complicated, such as a $24  
billion change in the arcane world of international taxes to allow 
U.S.-based companies a new global way of calculating credits for 
interest expenses incurred while operating in a foreign country. 
General Motors Co. led the lobbying effort for that measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are simple and much smaller: A provision with negligible  
cost inserted by Rep. Dave Camp, a Republican whose Michigan 
district is prime hunting territory, would allow makers of 
specialty big-game arrowheads to pay a lower excise tax because 
they would no longer be defined as ``essential components'' of 
standard arrows. 
</P>
<P>
	For business lobbyists, the changes merely rectify unfair or  
onerous portions of the tax code, even if they primarily benefit 
single industries or just one company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It redresses many inequities of the current tax law that  
needlessly restrict small business growth, stability and job 
creation,'' said Nelson Litterst of the National Federation of 
Independent Business. 
</P>
<P>
	But even some Republicans recoiled at the numerous provisions  
aimed at specific interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, and this bill is no exception, we have ... put tax  
loopholes for special interests ahead of tax relief for working 
families,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who nonetheless voted 
for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheer size of the tax cut, which would be the largest since  
1981, ensured that lobbyists stood a good chance of getting their 
provisions included. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroads and inland waterway barge companies, for example,  
objected to laws forcing them to continue paying a 
4.3-cent-a-gallon fuel excise tax to help reduce the federal budget 
deficit -- a deficit that no longer exists. Excise taxes, they 
argued, are normally earmarked for a specific purpose, and this tax 
no longer had one. 
</P>
<P>
	The money, GOP sponsors said in a letter to colleagues, could be  
used by the companies themselves to ``improve our nation's railways 
and reduce transportation and shipping costs for agriculture and 
businesses.'' The tax would be repealed by the Republican bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, a coalition of defense contractors led by Lockheed  
Martin successfully won passage of a provision allowing them to 
fully deduct from U.S. taxes their earnings from foreign sales. 
That item, costing $1.1 billion, is intended, like many others in 
the international tax section of the bill, to help U.S. firms 
compete against European rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were designed to put American countries on a more equal  
footing,'' said Martin Regalia, chief economist at the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce. ``They do have the option to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other items were aimed at struggling industries, such as  
independent crude oil producers who would gain the ability to 
deduct five-year net past losses on a single year's income tax 
return. That change, costing $246 million, is similar to one made 
for farmers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still more provisions appeared tailored to specific companies.  
Enron Corp., for example, obtained an exemption from U.S. income 
taxes for oil and gas pumped through a pipeline that begins and 
ends in two countries but moves through a third. The exemption, 
costing $126 million and also affecting electricity, would be for 
what runs through that third country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enron could run a pipeline through a third country and not  
have that income taxed in the U.S.,'' the company said in a ``tax 
issues briefing'' document for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the spectrum, one $30 million break would  
repeal the 10 percent excise tax imposed on fishing tackle boxes 
but not on similar ``utility'' boxes often sold as cheaper 
substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	This item was supported by the Illinois congressional  
delegation, led by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, on behalf of the 
Plano Molding Co. of Plano, Ill. Company officials say they've lost 
anglers' business to the utility boxes since the tax was imposed in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think the purpose of the tax is to put us out of  
business, and that's what is happening,'' said George Mannina, a 
Washington lawyer for Plano. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Hastert's influence, Mannina said that fellow Illinois  
Republican Rep. Jerry Weller, a member of the tax-writing Ways and 
Means Committee, actually took the lead and that Plano officials 
didn't invoke the speaker's name in making their pitch to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought our substance was so strong that we didn't need the  
political oomph,'' Mannina said.

<HEADLINE> Stevenson Begins Tuneup for US Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Alexandra Stevenson doesn't scare  
easily, whether she's playing the semifinals at Wimbledon or being 
interviewed by Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson's surprising run on the grass in England created a  
buzz about the 18-year-old tennis star that is still following her 
as she plays the Acura Classic, her first U.S. tournament since 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	She faced Walters for a ``20-20'' interview last month, where  
the topic of her father, Hall of Fame basketball player Julius 
Erving, came up. He admitted during Wimbledon that Stevenson is his 
daughter. He has supported her financially, but hasn't seen her 
since she was 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sat down with Barbara and I said, `You know you always make  
everyone cry after 45 minutes, and you're not going to make me 
cry,''' Stevenson said. ``She started laughing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson said her mother, Samantha, became teary-eyed during  
the interview, which annoyed the teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters asked Stevenson if she had heard of retired Gen. Norman  
Schwarzkopf, who's been interviewed by Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think so,'' Stevenson replied.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, he cried on national television,'' Walters told her.  
``Do you think generals cry?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson said no.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, they do and he cried, so nothing's wrong with crying,''  
Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``OK, but I'm not going to cry,'' Stevenson said.  
</P>
<P>
	She showed the same aplomb Monday in talking about her future in  
pro tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, ranked 41st in the world, plays her first-round match  
tonight against 26th-ranked Anke Huber of Germany. The winner faces 
top-seeded Lindsay Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to go out and be tough every match. They're going to be  
gunning for me and I'm going to be gunning for them,'' she said. 
``I have a lot of work ahead of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson insists her life hasn't changed since her splash at  
Wimbledon. She still has the same friends and lives in the same 
apartment with her mother in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest difference is that she's recognized more, including  
being spotted at dinner Sunday by ``this average Joe guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The man told Stevenson he had never watched women's tennis until  
seeing her at Wimbledon, and now he's coming to watch her tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very happy, that made my night,'' she said. ``This is  
good for women's tennis, by the way. We need a sponsor, so maybe 
this will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She'll have another admirer in the crowd at Manhattan Country  
Club. He's 24-year-old Collin Smith, a beach volleyball player she 
met at the recent Pan American Games in Canada, where Stevenson won 
a bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best part of the Pan Am Games was beach volleyball. I met  
two guys there,'' she said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson and Smith had a dinner date scheduled Monday night. He  
planned to watch her play tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a nice person,'' Smith said. ``She's a great athlete and  
it's really cool to hang out with someone who also does what you 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson said she isn't worried about being labeled a flash in  
the pan if she doesn't make an impact at the U.S. Open, the year's 
final Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just the beginning,'' she said. ``I have a lot of  
years.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Courts Face Vacancy Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Federal courts are experiencing a ``mounting  
vacancy crisis'' because Senate politics has slowed the 
confirmation of judicial nominees, President Clinton told the 
nation's largest lawyers' group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We simply cannot afford to allow political considerations to  
keep our courts vacant and to keep justice waiting,'' the president 
told the American Bar Association at its annual meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the slow process of confirming judicial nominees  
was thwarting the administration of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate confirmation process ``can be an unnecessarily long  
and grueling process that I believe serves neither the judiciary 
nor the nation,'' he said. ``Despite the high qualifications of my 
nominees, there is a mounting vacancy crisis in the courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst effects of the slowdown are making themselves felt  
across our country,'' the president said. ``Exploding civil and 
criminal court dockets affect the lives of tens of thousands of 
Americans. They strain our justice system to the breaking point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton thanked Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch,  
R-Utah, for working with him to break a nomination logjam after the 
1996 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, only 11 of the 61 federal judges Clinton has  
nominated have been confirmed by the Senate, and the slowdown was 
blamed in part on a standoff between Hatch and the administration 
over the senator's wish to see former aide Ted Stewart appointed to 
the bench in Utah. Clinton nominated Stewart last month. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Hatch sent a letter to Clinton saying the Judiciary  
Committee had been acting on judicial nominations ``in a balanced 
and thorough manner.'' However, he contended the president had not 
sent nominations and background material on the nominees to the 
committee as quickly as he might have. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said the Senate's ``solemn responsibilities ... require  
that this committee review thoroughly the records of each nominee 
to ensure that he, or she, is capable and qualified to serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative Free Congress Foundation today said the  
confirmation of Clinton judicial nominees has proceeded at 
approximately the same pace as the confirmation of nominees by 
President Reagan. Clinton ``has absolutely nothing to complain 
about,'' said Thomas Jipping of the foundation's judicial selection 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton touted the diversity of his judicial nominees, saying  
nearly half of them had been minorities or women. Two of his recent 
nominees would be the first black judges on the 4th and 9th Circuit 
federal appeals courts. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would again ask the Senate to confirm Bill Lann  
Lee, the Justice Department's acting civil rights chief. Lee has 
faced stiff opposition from GOP senators over the issue of 
affirmation action. 
</P>
<P>
	After the president's speech, ABA President Philip Anderson told  
reporters, ``We are going into an election year and we can't afford 
to have ... our judicial system compromised by that many vacancies 
left unfilled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not fair to the system of justice, it's not fair to the  
litigants, it's not fair to the judges who are still there,'' 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA plays a role in the judicial nominating process. The  
organization's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary 
evaluates and reports on the professional qualifications of people 
being considered by the president for nomination to federal 
judgeships. The committee rates prospective judicial nominees as 
``well qualified,'' ``qualified'' or ``not qualified.''

<HEADLINE> PGA Player Shun Ryder Cup Pay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- No Ryder Cup pay. No Ryder Cup boycott. And  
after a one-hour meeting Tuesday afternoon among 16 top American 
players and Ryder Cup officials, there appears to be no problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked enough to know that everyone is on the same page,''  
said Mark O'Meara, who triggered the pay-for-play issue last year 
when he raised questions about how much the PGA of America rakes in 
from the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	What emerged from the meeting was a pledge from the PGA of  
America to look into the channeling some of its net profit to 
charities of the players' choice. More importantly, players and PGA 
officials agreed that whatever controversy had been brewing over 
the past several months was now behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be talking to the players about the charitable  
contributions and what we can do that lets everybody feel good 
about our support of the game,'' said Jim Awtrey, chief executive 
officer of the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players right now are focused on the Ryder Cup, winning  
the Ryder Cup, and there is no issue between the PGA of American 
and players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't always the case.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara first raised questions about Ryder Cup money a year ago,  
when he complained about the corporate functions required during 
the matches and the amount of money made from them. Tiger Woods and 
David Duval also joined the fray, and Duval had the strongest 
comments of all. 
</P>
<P>
	The September issue of Golf Digest reported that the PGA of  
America would pull in $63 million in gross revenue from next 
month's matches at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., with a net 
profit of $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same issue, Duval said that the Ryder Cup was  
``overcooked, but it's probably going to stay that way until 
players choose not to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the players, they're not going to have a Ryder Cup,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of a boycott -- Duval later said that's not what he  
meant -- threatened to divide a United States team that has lost 
five of the past seven Ryder Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't get money every time we turn around,'' said Fred  
Couples, who has played on more Ryder Cup teams than any other 
active American. 
</P>
<P>
	Love earlier said whatever controversy existed had been blown  
out of proportion by the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keep asking questions, you're going to get a various bunch of  
answers,'' Love said. ``If you let it die, it will die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just two hours before the meeting, Woods was resolute in his  
belief that players should be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to see us receive whatever the amount is -- 200,  
300, 400, 500,000 dollars, whatever it is -- and I think we should 
be able to keep the money and do whatever we see fit,'' Woods said. 
``Personally, I would donate all of it to charity. But I think it's 
up to the other's person's discretion what they would do with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the money that's being made, I think that we should  
have a say in where it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to comment after the meeting, Woods said only that ``it  
went great. We had a wonderful time. I need to go play, boys,'' and 
then headed off to the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said before the meeting that he wanted a situation similar  
to the Presidents Cup, in which players received $100,000 to donate 
to a charity of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the PGA of America does a lot of good stuff. I  
grew up in it,'' said Duval, whose father was a club pro in 
Jacksonville, Fla., and now plays the Senior PGA Tour. ``I think we 
should get money to take back to our community. And if people see a 
problem with that, I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would not play on a Ryder Cup team if that wasn't  
the case, Duval declined to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty premature,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The meeting at Medinah Country Club, where the PGA Championship  
starts Thursday, included Awtrey, the 16 players, U.S. captain Ben 
Crenshaw and PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every single player who attended this meeting made it clear  
that they had no interest or desire or request to be compensated 
for playing in the Ryder Cup,'' Finchem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Awtrey took the occasion to explain exactly  
what the PGA of America does with its profit from the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Ryder Cup Outreach Program, $12.5 million is earmarked  
for programs designed to help the game grow, such as The First Tee, 
a learning center in Port St. Lucie, Fla., and education programs 
for PGA club professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players understand where it's going,'' Awtrey said. ``It's not  
a matter of anything the PGA is not doing correctly. They would 
like to be involved and have influence in some of the things we do, 
and we're committed to doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Awtrey said details were not discussed in the meeting, and he  
said another meeting wasn't immediately scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players are satisfied that we're going to take a look at  
all this, and then we'll see in the next few weeks at what we can 
do and how soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, the players walked out of the clubhouse and none got  
into specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is on the same page,'' Lehman said. ``There will not  
be compensation to players under any circumstance. The PGA of 
America heard what the players had to say about having a voice. The 
players want what's close to their hearts to be heard as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of a boycott was, is and and always will be ...  
ridiculous.''

<HEADLINE> Chile Derides Spain on Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attempts by Spanish authorities to try former  
Chilean President Augusto Pinochet for alleged human rights 
violations amount to ``foreign intervention'' and cannot be 
accepted by Chile, Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel Valdes said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think that foreign intervention, even if it is well  
intentioned, will help solve the problem,'' Valdes told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes, here for consultations with U.S. officials, said Chile  
is very much in favor of an international judicial system that 
prosecutes crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we are not prepared to accept a decision by one court and  
one country by itself to take measures and pretend to subordinate 
our own courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested by British authorities last October on  
orders of Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon. Spanish efforts to 
extradite Pinochet are before the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes said the Spanish action ignores legal processes in Chile  
to deal with what he admitted was a difficult past. As an example, 
he noted that Pinochet is facing 28 cases in Chilean courts. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin expressed sympathy  
Monday for Chile as it attempts to cope with the problem 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is committed to the principles of  
accountability and justice, and to supporting Chile as it wrestles 
with the difficult problem of how to balance the need for justice 
with the requirement of reconciliation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes' meetings with U.S. officials were dominated by trade  
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking with reporters on Monday, Valdes said Chile is giving  
up on becoming a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
and is instead seeking a bilateral trade agreement with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``NAFTA is in the past,'' Valdes said after a meeting with  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mexico joined with the United States and Canada in 1994,  
an invitation was extended to Chile to become NAFTA's fourth 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan failed because of congressional opposition to creating  
new trade agreements or enlarging the scope of existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Influenced by labor union opposition, Congress has refused to  
grant President Clinton the ``fast track'' authority he needs to 
negotiate free trade agreements with Chile and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes said he informed Albright of Chile's decision to invite  
the United States to begin a review process ``leading to the 
initiation of a negotiation beyond the subject of fast track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the NAFTA option dead, Valdes said though a translator,  
``what interests us is a bilateral economic relationship between 
Chile and the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While spurned on its NAFTA bid, Chile has since become an  
associate member of Mercosur, a South American free trade grouping 
led by Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

<HEADLINE>  Driver Runs Over Israelis; 12 Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NACHSHON JUNCTION, Israel (AP) -- A Palestinian on a suicide  
mission twice rammed his car into hitchhiking Israeli soldiers 
during today's morning rush hour, injuring 12 before being shot to 
death by troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old assailant, Akram Al Qam from the West Bank town  
of Bethlehem, called his mother early today and told her he was 
going to carry out a suicide attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me, 'I am at a junction and I see a lot of  
soldiers,''' said Al Qam's mother, Fadwa. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her son had no ties to the Islamic militant group  
Hamas, but in the past week had been reading a book about the Hamas 
chief bombmaker, Yehiyeh Ayyash, who was assassinated in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Al Qam said that after her son called, her husband and  
another son went to stop him. They came too late and instead were 
asked to identify the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak called the attack  
``cowardly,'' but he said it would strengthen Israel's resolve to 
cooperate with Palestinian security services to fight terrorism. 
Barak's hard-line predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, routinely 
accused Palestinian security of not doing enough to prevent 
attacks. Israel's new moderate leader did not make such 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian Authority criticized those who opened fire on  
the driver, saying they acted too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack occurred at Nachshon Junction, a major intersection  
30 miles west of Jerusalem. Al Qam's red Fiat with yellow Israeli 
license plates struck two soldiers near a hitchhiking post as they 
were about to cross the street. The car sped away and a police 
helicopter was called in to chase it. 
</P>
<P>
	After about 10 minutes, the driver made a U-turn, returned and  
plowed into the soldiers again, said army spokesman Lt. Col. Sharon 
Grinker. Paramedics said one soldier suffered serious injuries and 
the others were slightly hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	One witness, Reuven Gvirts, was riding his bicycle nearby at the  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the car hit the soldiers again, including some who were  
already on the ground,'' said Gvirts, 47. The car dragged some of 
the injured and then crashed into a flatbed truck, Gvirts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Local police official Shimon Sharvit said police and soldiers  
opened fire on the Fiat when it approached the second time. Sharvit 
said the driver was killed before his car hit the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Police searched the car for explosives, but found none.  
</P>
<P>
	Several times before, Palestinian militants have driven cars  
into Israelis at hitchhiking posts or bus stops. Iron barriers have 
been set up at some intersections to prevent such attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Militants in the past have carried out bombings and shootings in  
Israel in hopes of wrecking interim peace agreements between Israel 
and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's attack came at a time of dispute between Israel and the  
Palestinians over the implementation of the Wye River 
land-for-security agreement. Relations between the sides are 
strained, but both have said there is no deadlock.

<HEADLINE> MLS Commissioner Learning the Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Admitting he will draw snickers for his lack of  
soccer knowledge, new Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber 
said Tuesday that learning about the sport is one of five things on 
his short-term ``to do'' list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you guys will laugh at this, but I need to spend as  
much time as I can getting as broad an understanding of the soccer 
world so that I can be confident with the game and lead it in this 
country appropriately,'' Garber said on MLS' weekly telephone news 
conference with reporters. ``I need to be as comfortable with this 
game so I can lead it comfortably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garber, who replaced Doug Logan a week ago in the 3 1/2-year-old  
league's second major management shakeup in less than six months, 
came to MLS from the National Football League, where he rose 
through the ranks of its marketing and international divisions. His 
most recent responsibilities were NFL Europe and exhibition games 
outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Garber, 41, acknowledged last week at his introductory press  
conference that he knew little of soccer, but said he arrives with 
vast sports business experience, including selling American 
football to an uninformed public in Europe, Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Garber said other major objectives included getting investors to  
operate the league-run teams in Tampa, Florida, and Dallas; working 
with its domestic television partners ABC-ESPN and the 
Spanish-language Univision to better promote the league; spending 
time with reporters to better learn their wants and needs; and 
working with strategic sponsors to get them to commit to the league 
in broader aspects. 
</P>
<P>
	MLS owners said Logan was replaced because the league needed to  
be doing better in attendance and television ratings.

	Edmonds also was the first black presidential speechwriter in  
history, serving Clinton from 1995 to 1997. He succeeds Michael 
Waldman, who resigned as speechwriting director to work for Harvard 
University's Institute of Politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terry Edmonds has already served my administration with great  
distinction,'' Clinton said. ``I am looking forward to the 
invaluable contribution he will make in this new role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little overwhelmed because it is historic,'' Edmonds  
said Tuesday. ``I don't really like to think of myself as the first 
African-American this or that. I'm a professional just like 
everybody else. But I think it shows this president chooses people 
because of their abilities and not their color.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of Morgan State University, Edmonds currently is  
associate commissioner for external affairs at the Social Security 
Administration. He and Harvard Law professor Christopher Edley 
authored the draft assessment of race relations from which Clinton 
is compiling his own report on race. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Edmonds was a speechwriter for Health and Human  
Services Secretary Donna Shalala, communications director for the 
Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies and press secretary 
for former Rep. Kweisi Mfume, now director of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Edmonds served as a senior speechwriter for Clinton's  
re-election campaign.

<HEADLINE> 3 Newsmagazines Help CBS Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tiger Woods and David Duval couldn't quite match  
the appeal of Mike Wallace and Dan Rather. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS won an easy prime-time ratings victory last week, with three  
newsmagazines in the top 10. It was the first time CBS had the 
three top-rated newsmagazines since ``60 Minutes II'' premiered in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-rated ``60 Minutes,'' its junior edition and ``48 Hours''  
each outranked ABC's prime-time showdown of golfers Wood and Duval. 
The unusual match was the 17th-rated program of the week, with ABC 
estimating more than 20 million people saw at least part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had a 6.7 rating and 13 share, Nielsen Media  
Research said Tuesday. NBC was second with a 5.8 rating and 11 
share, ABC had a 5.4 rating and 10 share and Fox had a 4.0 rating 
and 8 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours of prime-time rock 'n' roll didn't go over well on  
Fox. Its ``Best of Woodstock '99'' special finished in 84th place 
for the week, with only 4.9 million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.3 rating and 4  
share, UPN had a 1.6 rating and 3 share and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
2. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news ratings race  
for the second straight week with a 7.0 rating and 16 share. The 
``NBC Nightly News'' had a 6.8 rating and 16 share, and the ``CBS 
Evening News'' was at 5.7 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Aug. 2-8, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 9.6; ``Frasier'' special, NBC, 
9.4; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 8.8; ``Friends,'' NBC, 8.8; ``CBS Sunday 
Movie: Stolen Women, Captured Hearts,'' CBS, 8.7; ``Just Shoot Me'' 
special, NBC, 8.5; ``CBS Wednesday Movie: Undue Influence, Part 
Two,'' CBS, 8.4; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 8.1; ``60 Minutes 
II,'' CBS, 7.9; ``48 Hours-Monday,'' CBS, 7.7.

<HEADLINE> Lott Gets Around Limits on Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From tobacco companies to high-tech investors,  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is raising money in chunks much 
larger than the strict limits imposed by Watergate-era federal 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mississippi Republican collected the money legally by  
setting up a state political committee in Virginia, which imposes 
no limits on the size or source of donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Other congressional leaders also are raising huge contributions  
from corporations and wealthy individuals through nonfederal 
entities, which allow them to get around the campaign finance laws 
that ban corporate donations and limit individuals to $2,000 per 
candidate, $1,000 for the primary and $1,000 for the general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	The national political parties have exploited similar loopholes  
for state politics to raise six-figure donations from wealthy 
individuals, labor unions and companies. The contributions are 
known as ``soft money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott set up his political committee in Richmond, Va., on Oct. 9,  
1997, and has reported a total of $197,373 in donations so far, 
including $10,000 apiece from R.J. Reynolds and U.S. Tobacco last 
year while the Senate was debating proposed increases in the 
cigarette taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	His Democratic counterpart, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,  
reported contributions of $10,000 apiece from Northwest Airlines 
and American Airlines. Congress is debating legislation to renew 
Federal Aviation Administration programs. Overall, Daschle, who 
began his political action committee earlier this year, raised 
$274,491 in soft money through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	At least a dozen lawmakers are raising money outside federal  
limits, including House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas; and Rep. 
Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., chairman of the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The explosion in leadership PACs that take soft money is  
further evidence of the need to pass campaign finance reform,'' 
said Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., a lead sponsor of legislation to 
ban such donations. ``If the Congress does nothing, more and more 
members are going to establish PACs that raise soft money, much of 
it in undisclosed, unlimited amounts from corporations and 
individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the contributions have nothing to do with his  
positions on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm prepared to vote for or against tobacco or any other area  
when I think it is in the people's best interest and I've proven 
that time and time again,'' Lott said. ``There is so much going on 
in Congress and I am involved in so many issues ... I could almost 
not accept a contribution from anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he set up his committee in Virginia because that's where  
his federal PAC is based as well. ``I'm up there in Northern 
Virginia,'' he said. ``I don't think either one of my PACs are in 
actually set up in Jackson, Miss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott has spent $188,130 so far from his Virginia PAC, including  
$30,000 to the Foundation for a Responsible Government, a group 
affiliated with the centrist Republican Leadership Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott also gave $5,000 to the Committee for a Strong and  
Effective NRA, a group led by some National Rifle Association board 
members. The April contribution came two months before he spoke at 
an NRA conference in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee is addition to Lott's own campaign committee that  
collects donations for his Senate re-election, and a separate 
federal political action committee he controls. Those entities are 
bound by the federal contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
	But his Virginia committee boasts numerous donations that Lott  
otherwise would have been forbidden to collect under federal 
control. For example, venture capitalist L. John Doerr gave $20,000 
-- 10 times more than he could give to Lott's re-election campaign. 
Doerr is a founder of a group that represents the high-technology 
industry, which has had a host of business before Congress from Y2K 
legislation to Internet taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle's political director, Michael Meehan, said the senator  
does not accept soft money donations greater than $10,000 and is 
raising the money to help elect Democrats on the state and local 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Daschle's committed to electing Democrats to the  
Senate and the House and encouraging the next wave of potential 
Senate and House candidates,'' he said. ``One way to do that is to 
financially support them.''

<HEADLINE> Powell Pushes Volunteerism Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- While some would prefer seeing him on the road  
to the White House, Retired Gen. Colin Powell is busy campaigning 
for the welfare of children. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before the nation's governors in St. Louis, Powell said  
children must know that ``we care about them with all our heart and 
soul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For two years, Powell has headed a campaign called ``America's  
Promise: The Alliance for Youth.'' The campaign has contributed 
more than $295 million to 10 million disadvantaged children 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell compared the problems of children to the threats he once  
faced on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
	``The enemies they face in our society are every bit as real,  
every bit as dangerous, every bit as destructive. Every child has 
to be made a child of promise,'' he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance seeks to make sure children have an ongoing  
relationship with a caring adult, a safe learning environment from 
which to develop a marketable skill and an opportunity to give back 
through community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The volunteer service should be required, Powell said, despite  
arguments by some that a law mandating such service would be 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was growing up, they made me do algebra against my  
will,'' he said. ``I see nothing wrong with service to community 
being part of a high school education curriculum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to his speech, Powell told The Associated Press he  
wouldn't run for president or vice president in 2000, but he isn't 
ruling out serving in the Cabinet if the next president asks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a president comes to you and says, `Would you do this for  
me? Would you do this for the nation?' you have to stop and take it 
under consideration. I would do it for any president. But I'm not 
looking for a job,'' Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell would likely be on a short list for a key Cabinet post if  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush were elected, Bush associates said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colin Powell is an icon. He's a walking statue,'' said Gov.  
Frank Keating, R-Okla. ``People admire him and respect him. I hope 
that he could be the next secretary of state in a George Bush 
administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota said he personally won't run for  
president in 2000, but he would gladly run for vice president on a 
Reform Party ticket headed by Powell. 
</P>
<P>
	To make Monday's presentation, Powell didn't attend the 50th  
anniversary celebration of his former position as chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff. Six of the 14 men who have served as joint 
chiefs chairmen joined President Clinton at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell is best known for serving as joint chiefs chairman during  
the Gulf War. His brief flirtation with a presidential run in 1996 
attracted interest across party lines.

<HEADLINE> GM Brass Defend Co.'s Market Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp.'s top executives Tuesday  
defended the No. 1 automaker's failure to move its U.S. market 
share back above 30 percent since strikes last summer virtually 
shut down its North American production for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not intending to shrink the company,'' Chairman Jack  
Smith said at a news conference to announce GM's new electronic 
commerce initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's share of the U.S. market through July was 29.3 percent,  
compared with 29.9 percent for the first seven months of 1998. 
July's share was only 28 percent. GM's goal is to get more than 30 
percent of the market this year, a goal that appears increasingly 
unlikely to be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said GM was working hard to increase its share, but that  
``the market's so strong it's impossible to produce more 
vehicles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. market is headed toward a record year of around 16.7  
million cars and light trucks, well ahead of the nearly 16.1 
million new vehicles sold in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	GM President G. Richard Wagoner Jr.said he was optimistic about  
the company's fortunes in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the underlying trends are good,'' he said. ``Retail  
share continues to go up month by month. The reaction to our new 
products is good. So I feel like the fundamentals are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also said he does not plan to retire soon, and declined to  
say if there was a retirement date set in his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	GM announced last week that it had signed an agreement with  
Daewoo Group of Korea to begin exploring joint automaking ventures. 
But Smith said a deal would not come soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of work to do there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> PGA Adds Events to 2000 Schedule  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- The PGA Tour is adding two new events to  
the 2000 schedule and bumping the B.C. Open to the same week of the 
British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pennsylvania Classic, the brainchild of Arnold Palmer, will  
make its debut Sept. 14-17. The location has not been determined, 
although Laurel Valley Country Club near Palmer's home course in 
Latrobe has been mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of the Pennyslvania Classic was made possible when  
the tour ended its relationship with the CVS Charity Classic at 
Pleasant Valley Country Club in Sutton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always focused on places we don't play,'' commissioner  
Tim Finchem said Tuesday. ``Pennsylvania is on top of the list. We 
haven't wrapped up the details, but we think it's going to be a 
great event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other addition will be the Tampa Bay Classic, which will be  
played opposite The Presidents Cup the third week of October. It 
will take place at the Westin Innisbrook Resort, site of the former 
mixed team JCPenney Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Penney is pulling its sponsorship of the mixed team event after  
this year, deciding instead to support an LPGA Tour event. The 
Tampa Bay Classic will be held every other year, giving players who 
don't make the Presidents Cup team a place to play for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the B.C. Open agreed to move from the second week in  
September to the middle of July and will play opposite the British 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to help us any, but it's not going to hurt us,  
either,'' tournament director Mike Norman said. ``Everybody thinks 
that because we're playing opposite the British Open that it's the 
end of the tournament, the sky is going to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we going to lose some players? Absolutely,'' he said.  
``But that's not going to make or break the B.C. Open. There's so 
much parity out there right now that the purist coming to watch 
golf is going to see good golf, regardless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some tournaments are swapping places on the schedule. The Buick  
Classic at Westchester Country Club in New York, which was played 
the week after the U.S. Open this year, returns to its traditional 
spot the week before the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest change is the International, which traditionally has  
been sandwiched around the PGA Championship and the World Series of 
Golf so that it can attract a strong international field. 
</P>
<P>
	But the PGA Championship and the new NEC Invitational, the World  
Golf Championship for Ryder and Presidents Cup players, will be 
back-to-back next year. Because the British Open is being played 
one week later (July 20-23), the International is scheduled two 
weeks before the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some real questions about what's best for them on that  
date,'' Finchem said. ``The British Open moved a week, and somebody 
had to move. They're slated to be two weeks before the PGA 
Championship, and they're not sure that's not a better date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament directory Larry Thiel was out of the office and could  
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 schedule gives the PGA Tour 49 official events,  
starting with the Mercedes Championship in Hawaii and ending with 
the Stroke Play Championship in Spain. Five weeks will have two 
tournaments because of the WGC events, the Presidents Cup and the 
British Open.

<HEADLINE> One in Four Employees Angry at Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As she headed home from her job as an  
administrative assistant at a bank, the stress and anger lingering 
from Ariella Winograd's workday apparently showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did my boss call you? Can you read my face?'' Ms. Winograd  
said when asked Monday about anger in the workplace. ``I definitely 
have office rage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She's not alone.  
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 25 percent of respondents to a 1996 Gallup nationwide  
telephone survey of 1,000 adults age 18 or older who were employed 
full- or part-time indicated that they were ``generally at least 
somewhat angry at work,'' according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	Authors of the study say the statistic may help explain recent  
outbursts of workplace violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an environment where you think people are satisfied with  
their jobs, there is a sort of undercurrent of anger and resentment 
aimed at the workplace that could potentially lead to the kinds of 
explosions of rage we have seen,'' said Donald Gibson, a professor 
at the Yale University School of Management and a co-author the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, ``The Experience of Anger at Work: Lessons from the  
Chronically Angry,'' is scheduled to be presented Wednesday at the 
annual meeting of the Academy of Management in Chicago. It was 
sponsored by Marlin Co., a Connecticut-based management consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say workplace rage was a factor in the July 29  
shooting spree in which Mark O. Barton killed nine people and 
injured 12 others in two Atlanta office buildings where he worked 
as a day trader. A week later, Alan Eugene Miller killed three 
people at two Pelham, Ala., companies where he had worked, 
prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the headlines, homicides at work are declining. There  
were 856 work-related murders in 1997, a 7 percent drop from 1996 
that mirrors the fall in violent crime nationwide during this 
economic boom, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, the most common cause of workplace anger  
-- cited by 11 percent of those questioned -- was the actions of 
supervisors or managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine percent said co-workers, others not being productive and  
tight deadlines or a heavy workload were to blame. Others cited 
dealing with the public and being treated badly as reasons for 
their anger. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a lot of downsizing. A lot of companies are  
leaner and meaner, and many of the workers who are left feel 
overworked and underappreciated,'' Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Winograd said her workplace peeves include condescending  
superiors and managers who do much of their business on the golf 
course, leaving the real work to assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Gordon, a computer consultant from Waukegan, said that to a  
certain degree, he can relate to the anger that led to acts of 
workplace violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wonder, `What would it take?' and then you think, `Jeez,  
could I do anything like that?''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson said most of the effects of workplace anger are subtle.  
They include a hostile work environment and the tendency to do the 
minimum amount of work to get by, resulting in a drop in 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Suppressed workplace anger has also been linked to health  
complaints, such as anxiety, depression, high blood pressure and 
heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson said managers need to communicate more with their workers  
in order to nip anger in the bud before it affects productivity or 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to keep exploring, `Am I as a manager taking actions  
that are causing anger?' and `How is that affecting my company?''' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Told: Shed Arrogance, Weight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Japanese umpire who suspended himself for  
blowing a call has some advice for his American counterparts: Don't 
be so arrogant. And lose some weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Toshiyuki Tanaka, an umpire for 35 years, respects the pride  
that major league umps have in their work but believes they have 
overstepped their bounds in their current labor dispute with Major 
League Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``They aren't humble. They don't realize that there are plenty  
of guys out there who can do their job,'' the 59-year-old Tanaka 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bid to force an early start to negotiating a new contract,  
major league umpires announced last month that they would quit en 
masse on Sept. 2. That plan collapsed after major league baseball 
accepted 22 of the resignations and hired 25 new umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``Handing in resignations -- that's exactly what the league  
wants,'' Tanaka said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to shedding their arrogance, Tanaka suggests U.S.  
umpires lose some weight as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't move. They're too fat,'' said Tanaka, a muscular  
6-foot-tall man who jogs daily and has little flab, weighing 210 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nation where harmony is valued over conflict, the attitude  
of Japanese umpires like Tanaka stands in stark contrast to the 
American men in blue. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese umpires patiently endure insults from managers that  
major league umps would never tolerate. They wouldn't dare to call 
strikes with the trademark howl of their American cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with their assertive U.S. counterparts, Japanese  
umpires are almost apologetic. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanaka's fateful decision came during a game between the Yomiuri  
Giants and the league-leading Chunichi Dragons on July 22. 
</P>
<P>
	In the bottom of the eighth, Giants slugger Domingo Martinez hit  
a fly ball to right. Dragons outfielder Kazuki Inoue ran in to make 
the catch, his glove touching the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanaka, at first base, thought the ball popped out of Inoue's  
glove onto the grass before he scooped it up, and he awarded 
Martinez a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Pandemonium broke out, with Inoue and Dragons manager Seinichi  
Hoshino protesting vigorously. Even usually reserved TV announcers 
questioned the call, which was replayed over and over in slow 
motion to viewers at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanaka did not reverse his call on the spot, and the Dragons  
went on to win, 11-2. But when he later reviewed a videotape of the 
play, the truth was clear, and he voluntarily sat out for three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``An umpire's job is about confidence. But being humble and  
doing your best everyday are just as important to improve your 
skills,'' Tanaka said. ``There's no progress if you can't doubt 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of humility hasn't won Japanese umpires much respect.  
Batters and catchers here routinely curse what they think is a 
wrongly called strike. At least several times each season, players 
and managers rush out of the dugout to hurl shouts in the umpire's 
face, sometimes pushing him. 
</P>
<P>
	The only American to work as an umpire in Japan on a  
professional level, Mike DiMuro, lasted only a few months in 1997, 
quitting in disgust after being poked in the chest by a batter over 
a strike call. He is one of the minor league umpires who has been 
hired as a replacement in the labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	While Japanese umpires have to put up with abuse, fans and  
players complain that bad calls are on the increase. The 
high-profile Central League, where Tanaka works, even planned a 
special meeting this week to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel a need to uplift umpires' skills because of a series  
of troubles over calls,'' league spokesman Hideo Okoshi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanaka doesn't expect his misjudged call to undermine his  
authority over players. But he is prepared to lose his job at the 
end of the season, and he has already lost a great deal of sleep 
over it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really a thankless job. There's relief when one day  
goes by, but then you have to worry about the next day,'' he said. 
``It's impossible to hit a home run as an umpire.''

<HEADLINE> Shooting Scene Disturbingly Familiar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For a few brief moments, 4-year-old Gabrielle  
Fougner's summer day camp became a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard booming,'' said Gabrielle, dressed in blue shorts and  
a yellow T-shirt, after she was joined by her parents at the North 
Valley Jewish Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabrielle was inside the suburban center when a gunman sprayed  
the building with bullets, wounding three children, a teen-ager and 
an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	For her parents, the news was good. She was unhurt.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we first came, she told us a bad man came in and was  
shooting,'' said Brian Fougner, 39, from Valencia, north of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear about stuff in the news. Could this happen to me or  
could this happen to my children? Out here is exact proof, yes, it 
could,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene outside the center in the suburban San Fernando Valley  
was disturbingly familiar: frightened parents huddled nervously 
behind yellow police tape, waiting to find out if their children 
survived a gunman's rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Police cars, ambulances and fire trucks invaded the  
neighborhood's narrow street. More than a dozen helicopters and 
airplanes from TV stations and law enforcement agencies 
crisscrossed overhead. Reporters waited across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Good news was shouted from parent to parent across the neatly  
cropped yards of the normally quiet, middle-class neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's OK! He's OK!'' one mother yelled when she learned the  
fate of her son. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Macofsky, 41, said she drove to the center in a panic  
after learning of the shooting. As it turned out, her son Michael, 
11, was away, touring the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles with 
other older children when the shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to cry when I saw him,'' she said. ``But I held back  
and just hugged him tightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The older children weren't told of the shooting until they  
boarded buses to leave the museum, said Michael. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told us someone with a gun was shooting people,'' he  
said. ``Some kids were sad. Others were scared and wondered if he 
was still inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-two youngsters not hurt held hands as they were  
shepherded single-file into a nearby temple where they were guarded 
by police. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all very calm and very wide eyed as you can imagine,''  
said Fire Department Capt. Steve Ruda.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Key Stock Index Rises / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's key stock index rose Tuesday following a  
government announcement that Japanese machinery orders were higher 
than expected in June. The dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 11.64 points,  
or 0.07 percent, to close at 17,202.09. On Monday, the average 
closed up 106.21 points, or 0.62 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.88 yen in late-afternoon trading, down  
0.28 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 115.20 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices opened slightly lower as many  
investors held off buying in the absence of market-moving news. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market may have been a little weak after retreating from  
yesterday's gains. Overall though, there is no good reason to sell 
shares or to buy them,'' said Yoshiyuki Higashi, manager of 
investment information at Taiheiyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending much of the day in negative territory, the Nikkei  
bounced back in the afternoon after the announcement of a 
better-than-expected figure for June machinery orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency said machinery orders to Japanese  
makers were up 6.3 percent from May. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 0.28 points, or 0.02 percent, to 1,424.25. 
The TOPIX closed up 3.85 points, or 0.27 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's main section was estimated at 354.94  
million shares, up from 323.16 million shares Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar barely budged against the yen as  
market participants saw little reason to push it in either 
direction. Trading was subdued as many market participants took 
time off during Japan's summer holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese banks bought some dollars for yen in the morning, but  
Japanese life insurers later sold the U.S. currency, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.30 yen, up from  
123.03 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.8900 percent from Monday's finish of 1.8450 percent, 
driving its price down to 99.23 yen from 99.61 yen.

<HEADLINE> Mid-Night Sleeping Pill Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sleeping pills always left school teacher Sharon  
Borntrager feeling hung over. Going without them kept her sleep to 
less than two hours a night -- no way to prepare for the elementary 
school students she had to face each morning. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Glendale, Ohio woman averaged more than five hours sleep  
a night when she took part in a 15-month test of an experimental 
prescription drug called Sonata. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helped me sleep so I would have the stamina I needed,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonata, made by American Home Products and expected to win U.S.  
approval later this year, has a key advantage over existing 
sleeping pills: Insomniacs can take Sonata in the middle of the 
night without worries about feeling groggy in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sleep experts say the pill is a significant improvement because  
of the new flexibility it gives people who have trouble sacking 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an advantage,'' said Richard Gelula, executive  
director of the National Sleep Foundation in Washington, D.C. ``You 
can take a pill when you travel on a long plane trip and be able to 
safely drive yourself home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borntrager, 52, now retired, said she had no ill effects from  
Sonata. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonata may reduce the fears some people have about becoming  
dependent because they wouldn't be tempted to take it every 
evening, just in case they might have trouble sleeping, experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonata's effects last just four hours, so people can take it at  
3 a.m. even if they plan to get up at 7 a.m. Other pills last eight 
hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Food and Drug Administration approves, the drug's  
instructions will say it can be taken at bedtime, or well into the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is one of five that American Home Products hopes to  
introduce in the next year. These drugs are pivotal for the 
company, which has seen earnings lag rivals, and faces a rash of 
lawsuits over the safety of its fen-phen diet drug and Norplant 
contraceptive. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonata, which is named after a piece of classical music written  
for a small group of instruments, was approved in Europe this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	It would challenge Ambien, the nation's most widely prescribed  
sleeping pill that controls 80 percent of the market. Ambien, sold 
by Monsanto, had $480 million in 1998 sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect Sonata to eventually achieve annual sales of  
about $560 million. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the U.S. population has insomnia at least  
periodically, and 10 percent of Americans have chronic insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sleep experts who've studied Sonata say that after the drug  
wears off in the body, a person's normal sleep pattern will usually 
take over so they won't automatically wake up after four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a leap in the ability to tailor treatment of insomnia  
to the patient,'' said Dr. Martin Scharf, director of the Tri-State 
Sleep Disorder Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, which participated in 
tests of Sonata. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common side effects with Sonata are headache and  
dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonata's price hasn't been set yet. Ambien has an average  
wholesale price of $1.65 to $2.14 per pill, depending on dosage. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Product officials hope Sonata does to insomnia  
what Prozac did to depression: Bring the condition out of the 
closet.

<HEADLINE> Glitz Winning in Iowa Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- If a few lessons from a world champion bass  
fisherman or skeet shooter aren't enough, turn to the politicians 
motorcycling through the streets and then stroll over to listen to 
crooner Vic Damone and pianist Roger Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all happening, appropriately enough, under giant circus  
tents. Glitz and politics, it seems, have collided in the Iowa 
Straw Poll and glitz has taken an early lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has taken on a life of its own,'' sighed Sara Miller,  
Finance Director of the Iowa Republican Party and an organizer of 
Saturday's doings. 
</P>
<P>
	Straw polls have been a staple of Iowa politics for the better  
part of 25 years, but none have approached this year's edition. 
There isn't a bus to be had anywhere in the state, and the same 
thing holds true for golf carts. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't even think about renting a tent.  
</P>
<P>
	``The party rental places are pretty well cleaned out,'' Miller  
said. Caterers will make out about as well as Republicans, who will 
collect $25 for every vote cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine contenders for the Republican presidential nomination are  
headed for Ames, and most are throwing lavish parties for backers, 
organizing legions of buses to truck backers into town for the day 
and fighting for attention from the 600 or so journalists signed up 
to chronicle the event. That's three times the number of reporters 
who accompanied the president and first lady to Africa in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa event picked up additional steam when Texas Gov. George  
W. Bush, the overwhelming front-runner, said he'd not only compete 
but play to win. ``The Bush people really raised the bar on this 
thing,'' said Bob Haus, an organizer for publisher Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	With that, things spun happily out of control.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been hyped to the point where you'd think the election  
was this Saturday,'' said former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	You can't throw a party without some entertainment, and the Iowa  
State Center at Iowa State University will be as much concert as 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander is bringing in country  
star Crystal Gayle to croon for backers munching on barbecue. 
``We've got baby back ribs,'' said aide David Kochel. Pork, of 
course. There's this hog industry crisis going on. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch promises the Osmond Brothers, Williams and  
Damone in a concert clearly designed with baby boomers in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is leaning toward the athletic, with a touch of salsa, a  
natural for a candidate courting Hispanics. Former pro football 
star Roger Staubach and pro basketball star Sean Elliot will be on 
hand, but the big local draw is retired University of Iowa football 
coach Hayden Fry, a very popular transplanted Texan. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to be outdone, Hatch is bringing in Karl ``the Mailman''  
Malone. 
</P>
<P>
	A string of salsa bands will enliven the Bush tent. Politicians  
will be heading for the Bush tent in a motorcycle parade headed by 
Colorado Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ames is a mid-sized college town of 47,000 with all the usual  
amenities, but forget about renting a hotel room there. Folks are 
being shipped 30 miles away to Des Moines to find a room. 
</P>
<P>
	Some resources are getting strained. The various campaigns  
really have rented all the available buses in Iowa, and there are 
no golf carts available because the 300 or so volunteers will be 
buzzing around the grounds on their electric wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	The best guess is about 15,000 activists will be on hand, and  
there'll be plenty of politicos mingling with the entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole aide Monte Shaw insisted that they're playing things  
low-key. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not bringing in any quote, unquote stars,'' he said.  
``We've got real people showing up to help a real candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the candidates are being tight-lipped about their  
spending, but it's huge. Rumor has it Bush has leased more than 100 
buses and the phone banks in most of the campaigns have been 
humming for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	There is time for perspective, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Just down the road in Des Moines, the Iowa State Fair opens this  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking a million people and 400 acres and 15,000  
vehicles,'' said marketing director Kathie Swift. ``I think it 
would be somewhat bigger than those concerns, not to demean those 
concerns.''

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Expects To Cut More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco PLC boosted its quarterly operating  
profit by 14 percent and announced plans to cut 4,500 more jobs 
this year than originally expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profit rose to $1.23 billion in the second quarter,  
compared with last year's $1.08 billion, the company said Tuesday. 
BP Amoco's main line of business, exploration and production, led 
the way with a 54-percent improvement in operating profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, formed by British Petroleum PLC's purchase last  
year of Chicago-based Amoco Corp., is in the process of absorbing 
Atlantic Richfield Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	It has realized the financial benefits of its merger sooner than  
anticipated, chief executive John Browne said, and expects to save 
$2 billion per year as a result of the union. 
</P>
<P>
	``Additional restructuring benefits have been identified and  
will continue to flow through to results in the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its cost-cutting efforts, the company plans to reduce  
its work force by 14,500 people by the end of the year. It already 
made most of the cuts -- 12,500 -- by the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
	``So the bulk has already happened, mostly in the U.S.,'' Browne  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announced reductions mark an increase from the company's  
original plan, outlined in February, to cut 10,000 jobs this year. 
The latest cuts will leave BP Amoco with 82,500 jobs by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	A company official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
many of the remaining cuts would come in downstream operations such 
as refining and petrochemicals, which have suffered pinched profit 
margins due to higher prices they must pay for oil. The official 
would not name the countries where the remaining cuts would be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvement in profits in the company's upstream sector  
stemmed largely from higher oil prices. Average oil prices during 
the three months ending June 30 were $14.49 per barrel, against 
$12.13 during the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Browne warned that downstream margins, including  
refining and petrochemicals, would remain weak in months to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Worsening market conditions caused a 29 percent drop in  
quarterly operating profit for refining operations. Increased 
output and cost-cutting efforts helped boost operating profit for 
chemicals by 18 percent, but chemical margins will remain weak in 
the short term, the company said, due partly to higher oil prices 
and excess capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco shares edged up 0.2 percent in London to close at 1,225  
British pence, or $19.60, a share. On the New York Stock Exchange, 
the company's U.S. shares were down 62 1/2 cents at $117.62 1/2 in late 
trading Tuesday.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil, Germany Bid for World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Brazil brought a squad of soccer  
heroes, and Germany hosted a beer fest at FIFA headquarters as the 
two countries made their bids to host the 2006 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil and Germany were the last of five countries to make their  
pitches on Tuesday for the 2006 World Cup, the most coveted soccer 
event on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Also presenting to the FIFA were South Africa, England and  
Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	After Monday's presentations by South Africa, accessorized by a  
chanting, dancing Zulu warrior, and England, who flew in singing 
school children, Brazil pumped up its campaign with a squad of 
football heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to revive a fading bid, Brazil recruited superstar  
Ronaldo, as well as football legends Dunga, Zico and Carlos Alberto 
Torres. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, meanwhile, hosted a beer fest, complete with pretzels,  
white sausage and a Bavarian accordion band on the FIFA 
headquarters' lakeside terrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, fighting off negative publicity from football legend  
Pele's recent criticism of the bid, dismissed the former-player's 
disapproval, dispelling speculation it would harm the nation's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the bid is bigger than Pele,'' said Torres, who was on  
the winning squad with Pele at the World Cup in Mexico in 1970. 
``I've known Pele for the past 40 years and I'm sure he will join 
us when he gets to know how serious we are with this project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With South America last hosting the event in 1978, the  
Brazilians felt it would be unfair for Africa to get the next World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It needs to go where it is most loved,'' added Torres. ``If  
you had a first basketball World Cup, it would absolutely have to 
go to the United States. It only makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil also insisted it had gained full governmental backing.  
</P>
<P>
	The German delegation, led by former football great Franz  
Beckenbauer, underlined its organizational skills, modern 
facilities and technical superiority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody still has a chance,'' said Beckenbauer, the captain  
of the 1974 German team that won the World Cup title at home and 
coach of the 1990 side that captured the title in Italy. ``Our job 
is now to convince everybody that Germany is the best place for the 
World Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, South Africa made en emotional appeal to host the  
continent's first World Cup, evoking the nation's troubled, 
turbulent past. The nation insists it has the necessary 
infrastructure to host a World Cup, and spent considerable time 
addressing the issue of safety and security. 
</P>
<P>
	The English, who are hoping to host a World Cup for the first  
time in 40 years, jetted in a 135-strong corps for a half-hour 
presentation and press interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco made its third bid in an attempt to become the first  
African nation to host the World Cup. It has been speculated, 
however, that it may pull out of the running following King 
Hassan's death. 
</P>
<P>
	With FIFA President Blatter repeatedly expressing his wish for  
the 2006 World Cup to go to the African continent for the first 
time, South Africa is being considered the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-member Executive Committee will make its final vote on  
the 2006 host in July 2000.

	``I think the bid is bigger than Pele,'' said Torres, who was on  
the winning squad with Pele at the World Cup in Mexico in 1970. 
``I've known Pele for the past 40 years and I'm sure he will join 
us when he gets to know how serious we are with this project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With South America last hosting the event in 1978, the  
Brazilians felt it would be unfair for Africa to get the next World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It needs to go where it is most loved,'' added Torres. ``If  
you had a first basketball World Cup, it would absolutely have to 
go to the United States. It only makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil also insisted it had gained full governmental backing.  
</P>
<P>
	The German delegation, led by former football great Franz  
Beckenbauer, underlined its organizational skills, modern 
facilities and technical superiority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody still has a chance,'' said Beckenbauer, the captain  
of the 1974 German team that won the World Cup title at home and 
coach of the 1990 side that captured the title in Italy. ``Our job 
is now to convince everybody that Germany is the best place for the 
World Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, South Africa made en emotional appeal to host the  
continent's first World Cup, evoking the nation's troubled, 
turbulent past. The nation insists it has the necessary 
infrastructure to host a World Cup, and spent considerable time 
addressing the issue of safety and security. 
</P>
<P>
	The English, who are hoping to host a World Cup for the first  
time in 40 years, jetted in a 135-strong corps for a half-hour 
presentation and press interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco made its third bid in an attempt to become the first  
African nation to host the World Cup. It has been speculated, 
however, that it may pull out of the running following King 
Hassan's death. 
</P>
<P>
	With FIFA President Blatter repeatedly expressing his wish for  
the 2006 World Cup to go to the African continent for the first 
time, South Africa is being considered the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-member Executive Committee will make its final vote on  
the 2006 host in July 2000.

<HEADLINE> Appalachian Poverty Focus at Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRIFFITHSVILLE, W.Va. (AP) -- After the Rev. Joe Hacala was  
ordained as a Jesuit priest in 1975, his first assignment was in a 
poverty-stricken corner of southern West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember the house where we lived in Griffithsville that  
fall -- no running water and no heat,'' Hacala said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardships were a fact of life for many residents, and things  
aren't much different today, said Hacala, now an assistant 
secretary of the U.S. Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Hacala is organizing a follow-up conference to a  
four-day tour last month by President Clinton through poor areas of 
the country. Clinton called for public and private investment in 
areas that have been left out of the nation's booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government cannot do this alone, but business cannot be  
expected to go it alone,'' Clinton said then. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference -- which convenes Thursday in Ashland, Ky., and  
wraps up Friday in Huntington, W.Va. -- will include HUD Secretary 
Andrew Cuomo as well as the secretaries of transportation, labor 
and agriculture, and the governors of West Virginia and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Hacala said educating others about poverty-stricken areas of  
Appalachia is the conference's main goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get people to realize that at the turn of the  
millennium, in the wealthiest nation on earth, there are people who 
still don't have safe drinking water,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an economy that is daily setting new records, and now  
we need to figure out how to help those people who don't sit around 
waiting for the closing bell to ring on Wall Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His concerns are echoed by Amy Glasmeier, a professor of  
geography and regional planning at Pennsylvania State University 
and a John Whisman scholar to the Appalachian Regional Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until people have the right to clean water, the right to sewer  
systems, the right to garbage pickup -- rights that are taken for 
granted all over the country -- you will have a situation where ... 
people have a low opinion of themselves, where they think that no 
one cares,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Appalachian region has experienced a long history of  
government attempts to combat poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	By some accounts, it started with Eleanor Roosevelt's  
``subsistence homesteading'' idea of 1933, an attempt to relieve 
the worst of the poverty created by the Depression. But the laws to 
carry out the concept of worker-owned factories and communities 
were ruled unconstitutional before the communities became 
self-supporting, and the plan died. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, Lyndon Johnson tried to develop the ideas  
articulated by John F. Kennedy as a ``war on poverty,'' including 
the development of the Appalachian Regional Commission and the 
Volunteers in Service to America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost as though, every 30 years or so, people look over  
their shoulders and realize that somehow we still are not right 
there behind them,'' said John David, a professor of social science 
at the West Virginia University Institute of Technology in 
Montgomery.

<HEADLINE> Army Temporarily Grounding Copters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army announced is temporarily grounding  
its entire fleet of CH-47 Chinook transport helicopters after a 
crack was found in a transmission gear in one being used by the 
British Royal Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fleet is grounded,'' Army spokeswoman Nancy Ray said  
Monday. ``It's a precautionary measure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said that 466 helicopters in the Army fleet were involved in  
the temporary grounding. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an overhaul, the Royal Air Force discovered a cracked gear.  
That gear has been traced diligently,'' Ray said. She said Boeing 
was working with the Army Aviation Center to see whether the 
problem affected any of the Army Chinooks. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-rotored Chinook helicopter is the military's medium  
tactical heavy-lift transport. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Ministry of Defense also has grounded its fleet of  
Royal Air Force Chinooks pending safety checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing Co., which manufactures the helicopter at its  
Philadelphia plant, also requested the suspension of flights by 
about 20 operators around the world to allow inspection of their 
transmissions, said company spokesman Jack Satterfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's subsidiary, Boeing Precision Gear in Chicago,  
manufactured the type of gear used in the aircraft, Satterfield 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the models should be suspending flight operations pending  
a check of records to determine if the aircraft contained gears 
from the suspect production lines,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army has the largest fleet of Chinooks. Between 300 to 400  
Chinooks are used in other countries, including Australia, 
Argentina, Spain, Italy, Greece, Morocco, Egypt, Taiwan and Japan, 
Satterfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	First built in 1961, the Chinook earned a reputation in Vietnam  
as a workhorse. But there were at least 10 crashes of military 
Chinooks in the United States between 1985 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Its ability to carry up to 50 people made it a favorite of the  
North Sea oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1986, a Chinook carrying oil workers crashed off the  
Shetland Islands in Scotland, killing 45 men when its rotors 
collided after gearbox modifications.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Graphics To Cut 3,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Silicon Graphics Inc., a struggling  
maker of high-end computers, disclosed plans today to cut up to 
3,000 workers, or one-third of its work force, and spin off its 
Cray Research supercomputer unit to try to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
	SGI said the moves would help it focus on selling software and  
computers related to the Internet, and exploit the explosive growth 
of the medium. But investors didn't seem convinced. The company's 
stock was down 12 percent in early afternoon trading, dropping 
$1.93 3/4 at $14.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	SGI, known for generating graphics in movies like Jurassic Park,  
bought Cray Research Inc. in 1996 for $740 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its acquisition by SGI, Cray's supercomputers competed  
with SGI's own powerful systems in a limited market including large 
scientific institutions and the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year SGI reorganized, and divided Cray off into an  
easy-to-sell subsidiary. Today's move further breaks Cray into a 
separate unit. While announcing no buyers, the company will pursue 
discussions ``with potential partners to assume the operation of 
this business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a lot of sense to spin out Cray because it's very  
difficult for SGI to create two high-end platforms that compete 
with each other in sales,'' said Matthew Nordan, an analyst at 
Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, SGI said it will rely on a partner to develop  
Intel-based workstations and create a business unit focused 
entirely on Internet systems that work with SGI computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Belluzzo, SGI's chairman and chief executive, said the  
company will lay off between 1,000 to 1,500 employees. Another 
1,500 employees will be reassigned to partnerships or small 
companies breaking off from SGI. 
</P>
<P>
	SGI has struggled in recent years against stiff competition by  
workstation makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM and Sun 
Microsystems Inc. It also has been hurt by less costly workstations 
and high-end personal computers using Intel chips and Microsoft's 
Windows NT operating software. 
</P>
<P>
	It is SGI's third major restructuring in three years.  
</P>
<P>
	``The SGI that emerges from these alliances will be somewhat  
smaller than it is today, but it will be designed to focus on the 
technologies and markets where we add the most value, to respond 
more quickly to emerging trends and opportunities, and to put 
increased resources into serving our major customers,'' Belluzzo 
said.

<HEADLINE> The Veto Versus the Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the Senate Republican leader called the  
$792 billion, 10-year GOP tax cut bill fantastic, he meant 
wonderful. Not the dictionary definition, which is unreal or 
imaginary. 
</P>
<P>
	For a hypothetical tax cut financed with a theoretical surplus,  
passed by one vote, with a veto guaranteed, the dictionary version 
will do. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is going nowhere,'' said Sen. John McCain, a tax  
relief advocate and a Republican presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said repeatedly that he will veto the  
bill, a prospect that led the Republican Congress to put it on hold 
until they reconvene after Labor Day. That way, after they send it 
to the White House and it's vetoed, they'll be in town to argue. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who proposed about $250 billion in tax breaks, says the  
Republicans want to cut too much. He says the GOP bill would lead 
to higher interest rates, cuts in vital programs, and a return to 
budget deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say Clinton wants to keep surplus tax revenues in  
Washington so bureaucrats can decide how to spend it. They say they 
want it returned to the taxpayers to spend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressing that case back home, GOP leaders say that once the  
American people understand the bill, they will demand that Clinton 
sign it. But public opinion polls don't rank tax cuts as a high 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	In prior budget disputes, Clinton has won by blaming Congress.  
</P>
<P>
	Unfairly, said Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader. But  
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got a fantastic bill here,'' Lott said after the  
Senate passed the tax cut, 50 to 49, Thursday night. The House had 
passed it 221 to 206. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the certainty that the bill can't become law over a  
Clinton veto might have helped Republicans hold the votes to pass 
it, since that made it easier to persuade skeptics to go along. 
</P>
<P>
	So they've got their bill, he's got his veto, and the argument  
goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he's not precluding a compromise, and is determined  
to try to reach an agreement with the Republicans on taxes. The 
White House is offering to negotiate on middle income tax rate 
cuts, but less than one-third of what the Republicans passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the GOP version offered any bonanza to most taxpayers.  
It would cut each tax bracket by 1 percentage point, beginning with 
a half-point cut at the lowest taxable income level in 2001. It 
also would reduce the so-called marriage penalty on two-income 
couples, lower capital gains tax rates, and gradually cut 
inheritance taxes to zero in 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than $6 billion of the Republicans' $792 billion in cuts  
would take effect next year. Only 20 percent of the reductions 
would be effective before 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax cuts are supposed to come out of a surplus projected at  
$1 trillion over 10 years. This would not tap nearly $2 trillion in 
estimated Social Security surpluses over the decade, which are 
supposed to be off limits, except in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency appropriations don't have to be offset by cuts or  
revenues to cover the cost. So Congress has taken to lumping more 
spending into its periodic emergency money bills -- including the 
$4.5 billion cost of the 2000 census. 
</P>
<P>
	That eases the squeeze of another budget stricture, the spending  
ceilings imposed by the 1997 budget deal between Clinton and 
Congress. The surplus projections assume those caps will be 
enforced, which would mean sharp reductions in effective rates of 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	By Democratic accounting, if current federal spending is  
increased only by the projected rate of inflation over the next 10 
years, instead of $1 trillion, the surplus outside Social Security 
would be $46 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	So the rival projections pile up. All fodder for the political  
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got a fantastic bill here, and I think it's time  
that we discuss the fact with the American people,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	They are. As Clinton is arguing his reasons for a veto.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Divide Over Nixon Remains Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YORBA LINDA, Calif. (AP) -- Pandy Byrd sat in a dimly lit room at  
the Richard Nixon Library &AMP; Birthplace surveying the life-size 
black-and-white photograph of a fallen man waving farewell to his 
presidency and the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five years to the day Nixon resigned, the image in the  
library's permanent exhibit brought back Mrs. Byrd's childhood 
memories of her parents watching coverage of the Watergate scandal 
that transfixed the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did happen and it shouldn't have happened,'' Mrs. Byrd, 35,  
said as she sat on a bench with one her two boys. ``I hope that my 
children would come away with the understanding that the end does 
not justify the means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the rhetoric has eased since Aug. 9, 1973, visitors to  
the library on Monday had strong opinions about a man who has 
inspired both fierce loyalty and contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very, very wrong,'' said Bob Teston, 60, who, like Mrs.  
Byrd, is from Yorba Linda. ``I hated to see him resign. I had voted 
for him. But it was for the good of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teston said he would tell the 2-year-old grandson he cradled in  
his arms when he was old enough to understand that Nixon ``was a 
good president who made mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Leung, 51, of New York City remains a Nixon admirer,  
crediting him for opening China and attributing his downfall to 
``crazy left-wingers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a Vietnam veteran and he did a lot of things to try to  
protect us in Vietnam,'' he said. ``I think people forget that he 
made one mistake and he did so much for the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing to visit the library on the anniversary of the  
resignation was a ``curious coincidence'' for the Rev. Leo 
Constantino, 64, of Wheaton, Ill., a Vietnam War opponent who 
protested against Nixon and voted for candidate George McGovern. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must look at his presidency in a balanced and fair  
manner,'' Constantino said. ``But we must never forget that he 
caused a crisis in the republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Nixon supporters, his resignation was viewed as an  
honorable act. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of everything that's going on I think the darkest day  
in American politics was the day the Senate acquitted Bill Clinton 
of lying under oath,'' said Patricia Fortier, 43, of Buena Park. 
``President Nixon had the dignity to resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leung said the resignation was for the good of the country.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's more than you could say about the man who holds the  
current position,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The library did not mark the day with a special exhibit.  
Executive Director John Taylor said that was unnecessary because 
the museum is full of references to Watergate and the final days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a time of reflection,'' he said. ``Neither is it a time  
of celebration nor a time of breast-beating.''

<HEADLINE> Miss Sally: A Show Within a Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You won't find it on Nickelodeon. It's no  
Children's Television Workshop presentation. ``Miss Sally's 
Schoolyard'' is a kiddie show, but the only televisions that 
receive it are inside the walls of Oswald Penitentiary -- on the HBO 
prison drama ``Oz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gathered around a TV set in Cell Block 5, Miss Sally's jail  
house devotees watch with a passion that has little to do with her 
goody-goody manner or the goofy skits with her puppet pals. What 
makes them prisoners of ``Miss Sally's Schoolyard'' is something 
else: Miss Sally's very large chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddly enough, they seem more aware of it than Miss Sally is. She  
jumps and bounces with the fidgety abandon of a 5-year-old. Nothing 
about the figure she cuts seems to strike her as excessive. No 
wonder she captivates the prisoners. No wonder she also brings some 
comic relief to the otherwise ferocious ``Oz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, for television, she represents a first. On ``The  
Simpsons,'' the cartoon siblings Bart and Lisa watch ``Itchy and 
Scratchy'' cartoons. But ``Miss Sally's Schoolyard,'' however 
little of it ``Oz'' viewers ever get to see, surely qualifies as 
TV's first live-action series-within-a-series: Miss Sally always 
stays behind the glass. 
</P>
<P>
	This earns a certain distinction for Whitney Allen, the  
24-year-old actress who plays Miss Sally. In her wordless and 
uncredited role, Allen stars in a TV series you have to watch 
another TV series in order to glimpse. As Miss Sally, she is not 
once but twice removed from real life. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, playing Miss Sally wasn't all that complicated.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew what I was supposed to be,'' says Allen, summing it up:  
``Good body, sweet face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behold Miss Sally as a Girl Scout, cheerleader or Swedish  
milkmaid. The leering prisoners certainly do. ``Miss Sally's 
Schoolyard'' may be aimed at little children. But among her 
unintended audience of lifers, Miss Sally isn't kid stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	On this week's ``Oz'' (premiering Wednesday at 10 p.m. EDT),  
Miss Sally looks fetching in a nurse's uniform as she farcically 
attends to poor, sick puppet Nooter. The other puppet, Pecky, is 
the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that you can hear any of it -- nor, by choice, do the  
inmates. The TVs are audible only through headphones, which are 
clearly unrequired for savoring Miss Sally's, er, effervescence. 
</P>
<P>
	But here's the best part of the joke that Miss Sally embodies:  
contemplating who the joke is on. Is it Miss Sally, the unwitting 
lust object for a pack of murderers and rapists? Or is it those 
inmate-admirers, in the grip of a woman who mocks their deprivation 
with every jiggle -- yet will never even know they exist? 
</P>
<P>
	Or is the joke on you, the ``Oz'' viewer? As it turns out, Miss  
Sally is padded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess my own body was good enough at the audition, but with  
the costumes they chose, it just wasn't the `dream bust' they 
wanted,'' Allen says, amused by the vagaries of show biz. ``They 
wanted something out of control! I had these things that look like 
chicken cutlets in my bra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sally was born not only out of naughtiness, but expedience.  
In its first two seasons, the inmates of ``Oz'' watched actual 
shows. But buying rights to use TV clips is complex and costly, 
according to ``Oz'' creator Tom Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, we said, `Let's make up our own show,''' he  
explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Fontana knew this interior series would have to be something  
prisoners would want to watch. He considered a mock soap opera. Or 
maybe a ``Jerry Springer''-like talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I recalled when I was a kid and I watched `Kukla, Fran  
and Ollie': a woman with two puppets. We decided to do a show like 
that. Except our woman would have enormous breasts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her co-star puppets were designed and suggestively christened.  
Pecky emerged as a little man who pays visual homage to Kukla. 
Nooter looks like a bespectacled, toothless version of the dragon 
Ollie. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a call went out for the Fran.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the girls we saw were too Playboy-esque, too  
Vegas-y,'' says casting director Alexa Fogel. ``We needed someone 
playful, with a sense of humor, and voluptuous. But wholesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, a lovely girl-next-door type with a flair for comedy,  
filled the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Wilmette, Ill., she had moved to Manhattan three  
years earlier, where she promptly won a role in ``Forbidden 
Broadway,'' a long-running revue that spoofs New York theater. She 
also did a guest shot on ``Spin City,'' as a former girlfriend of 
star Michael J. Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	But now she was a regular -- sort of -- in a critically acclaimed  
series that, in its previous seasons, she had watched and loved. 
</P>
<P>
	Last January, weeks before ``Oz'' resumed production, she  
reported for the ``Miss Sally'' shoot. They had just one day to 
tape segments for all eight of this season's ``Oz'' episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really fun,'' Allen says. ``I just told myself, `This  
is a character who has no idea what she looks like. She is a 
complete innocent.' And that's what you laugh at. That, and the 
perverted, awful things those guys say about Miss Sally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Allen tunes in ``Oz'' each week, she finally gets to hear  
them. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> America West Plans Dog Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- For a 7-month-old, Tim held up pretty well his  
first time on an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	He slept most of the trip and was only a tiny bit scared when  
the big jet flew through some turbulence during the three-hour 
round trip from Phoenix to Las Vegas and back. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim was no ordinary passenger. He's a seeing-eye dog.  
</P>
<P>
	Tim's excursion last month was to officially launch America West  
Airlines' ``Puppies In Flight'' program designed to familiarize 
young guide dogs with air travel in preparation for future trips 
with their visually impaired human partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry Luginbill, a spokeswoman for the Tempe, Ariz.-based  
carrier, said the idea came from a volunteer who works with guide 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no formal element to prepare guide dogs for air  
travel so at her suggestion, we started a program for it,'' 
Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
	America West's partner in the program is Guide Dogs for the  
Blind Inc. The San Rafael, Calif.-based company trains dogs from 
the time they are 8 weeks old until they're about 18 months and 
then pairs them with blind people, free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Lawson, a Chandler woman who heads the Phoenix-area's Guide  
Dog chapter and is Tim's trainer, praised the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives a young dog a good idea of what it's like to be in an  
airport and on a plane so it's not scary to them,'' she said. 
``Usually the first time a guide dog is on a plane is when they're 
flying home from our California training site with their new owner. 
That's a terrible time for them to take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After taking a monthly class with Lawson's group, America West's  
flight attendants voluntarily serve as training flight escorts for 
the guide dogs on their days off. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending upon seat availability, the dogs are usually put near  
a window seat in the cabin section and must sit at the escort's 
feet, Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim, a 75-pound golden retriever who served as the first puppy  
in flight passed with flying colors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did great,'' said Luginbill. ``He was a little concerned  
with some bumpy air coming in. After we landed, he was sure happy 
to be reunited with Pat.''

	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay's Wade Boggs, who last  
weekend became the 23rd player to reach 3,000 hits, made his second 
career appearance as a relief pitcher Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Devil Rays losing 16-1 to the Baltimore Orioles, Boggs  
entered the game to a standing ovation with two outs in the eighth 
inning.

<HEADLINE> Machine Tool Spending Falls in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Spending on machine tools in June fell 2 percent  
from the previous month, but was down 30 percent from June 1998, 
according to an industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies spent an estimated $472 million for machine tools in  
June, compared with a revised $480 million in May, the Association 
for Manufacturing Technology said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, sales were $2.6 billion, down 41  
percent from the first half of 1998. At the same time, exports fell 
by 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competition in the U.S. market continues to be tough, as U.S.  
builders face diminished machine tool consumption together with 
increased market pressures from Asian producers,'' said AMT 
president Don F. Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts consider demand for machine tools a reliable indicator  
of the strength of the manufacturing sector and the overall 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics are compiled from figures submitted by companies  
participating in the U.S. Machine Tool Consumption report.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- A glitch in MCI WorldCom Inc.'s data transmission  
network has partially disabled thousands of automated teller 
machines and restricted market trading of corn, soybeans and other 
financial futures. The problem at the No. 2 U.S. long-distance 
carrier began late last week during a system upgrade and has 
disrupted high-speed data service for nearly 30 percent of MCI's 
global data network customers, a spokeswoman said. MCI was

<HEADLINE> 1921 Tulsa Race Riot Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- A commission investigating the destruction  
of Tulsa's black business district in 1921 has given the go-ahead 
for archaeologists to dig in a search for mass graves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tulsa Race Riot Commission approved a plan Monday to  
excavate samples of artifacts or remains from a spot in a downtown 
cemetery where witnesses and tests indicate possible burial sites. 
The city also must approve any excavation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Psychologically there's some finality to finding remains and  
saying, `Yes, this really happened,''' commission chairman Bob 
Blackburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is trying to unravel the mystery of one of the  
nation's worst incidents of racial violence. In January, it must 
make a recommendation to lawmakers on whether reparations are owed. 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of mass graves is just one disputed issue. The  
panel is still working to assess blame and determine how law 
enforcement officials played a role in the attack that is now 
believed to have claimed as many as 300 lives, mostly blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The city acknowledged the riot's anniversary for the first time  
in 1996. State Rep. Don Ross, whose legislation led to the 
commission's creation in 1997, said the group had yet to hear why a 
``conspiracy of silence'' had prevented full disclosure until now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business community, the political community and the media  
conspired to keep quiet,'' he said. ``It is significant, I think, 
that the cover-up is exposed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, survivors of the riot simply listened as historian  
Scott Ellsworth described how the incident began on May 31, 1921. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting, Ellsworth said, started when a white lynch mob  
clashed with a group of black World War I veterans who had come to 
the courthouse offering to protect the mob's intended target -- a 
black man being held for the assault of a white woman. The woman 
later declined to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``A struggle ensues, a shot goes off and the race riot is on,''  
said Ellsworth, who has written a book on the riot. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 60 known survivors were invited to testify Monday but  
the five who came had videotaped their statements and chose not to 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellsworth described how as many as 10,000 white men and boys  
gathered at for an attack on the black community the morning after 
the riot began. Police officers and the local unit of the National 
Guard also joined in the burning of 35 blocks of the once-thriving 
black business district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivor George Monroe nodded as Ellsworth related his story of  
hiding under a bed as a white rioter set the home on fire. The man 
stepped on the 5-year-old's fingers and Monroe's sister stifled his 
cry with her hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellsworth spoke of whites attacking with machine guns, burning a  
black church erroneously thought to hold an arsenal and of 
airplanes that fired down on those who fled. 
</P>
<P>
	His testimony stunned 90-year-old Joyce Walker Hill, who heard  
for the first time the extent of the attack by white mobs that 
forced her family to flee their home. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I knew is that we were in it,'' said the Kansas City,  
Kan., woman, who was 11 when whites torched her black neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hope Franklin, head of President Clinton's national  
advisory board on race, was just 6 when word of the riot arrived at 
his home in Rentiesville. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew from my mother's countenance that the news was not  
good,'' Franklin told the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin's father, a lawyer, lost everything except the clothes  
he was wearing. He later helped defeat a city ordinance that 
hampered efforts by blacks to rebuild.

<HEADLINE> Shatner's Wife Accidentally Drowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor William Shatner's wife drowned in their  
pool while home alone, and police said Tuesday the death was 
accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	Former model Nerine Shatner, 40, and the ``Star Trek'' star had  
been married less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``My beautiful wife is dead,'' Shatner, 68, said tearfully when  
he briefly stepped out of his gated hillside estate in the affluent 
Studio City neighborhood. ``She meant everything to me. Her 
laughter, her tears and her joy will remain with me the rest of my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner had filed for divorce Oct. 21, 11 months after the  
couple wed, citing irreconcilable differences. Papers filed in Los 
Angeles County Superior Court said the Shatners had separated Oct. 
14. 
</P>
<P>
	The office of Leonard Machtinger, Shatner's attorney, referred  
questions about the divorce filing to the actor's manager Larry 
Thompson, who did not immediately return a phone call seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner told police he came home about 9:30 p.m. Monday and  
found his wife at the bottom of the deep end of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Shatner dove into the pool, dragged his wife out of the  
pool and called 911 and was advised by paramedics to perform CPR,'' 
police Lt. Adam Bercovici said. 
</P>
<P>
	When paramedics arrived ``she was beyond our help,'' Fire  
Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was scheduled for Wednesday. However, Detective Mike  
Coffey said there was no evidence of foul play, and that an 
investigation showed Mrs. Shatner had drowned accidentally in the 
short time she was home alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shatners were married in November 1997. It was his third  
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an account of the wedding in People magazine, he  
vowed to her: ``I pledge allegiance to you, Nerine, my queen.'' 
Referring to the ring he placed on her finger, he said, ``When it 
is dark and there is trouble, you need but wave that bauble and 
there will be light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shatner, best known as Capt. James T. Kirk on the 1960s science  
fiction show ``Star Trek'' and the ``Star Trek'' movies, has also 
starred in the TV police drama ``T.J. Hooker'' and hosted ``Rescue 
911.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also has written a series of science fiction books.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Earnings Rise 21 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's  
largest retailer, reported a 21 percent increase in second-quarter 
earnings despite being hindered by a large court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter was $1.25 billion, or 28 cents per  
share, compared with $1.03 billion or 23 cents per share in the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarter, which ended July 31, included a charge for a  
litigation settlement of approximately 3 cents per share. Without 
the charge, Wal-Mart's profits would have increased 35 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart announced in May that it had settled litigation with a  
Mexican grocery store chain. A jury in San Antonio had awarded 
Valores Corp. of Monterrey, Mexico, $624 million after concluding 
that Wal-Mart broke an agreement with the company. Wal-Mart and 
Valores settled for what Wal-Mart said was less than the jury 
award. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 15 percent to $38.47 billion from $33.52 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The company's Wal-Mart Stores segment, including Supercenters,  
had a pre-tax operating profit of $2.151 billion, compared to 
$1.787 billion for the same quarter last year, a 20 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sam's Club segment recorded operating profit for the quarter  
of $190 million, an increase of 10 percent compared to the $173 
million for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The international segment had a profit of $112 million for the  
most recent quarter compared with $124 million for the same quarter 
in the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
	As of July 31, the company had 1835 Wal-Mart stores, 622  
Supercenters, and 453 Sam's Club wholesale stores in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Internationally, Wal-Mart operated 13 stores in Argentina, 14 in  
Brazil, 155 in Canada, 95 in Germany, 433 in Mexico, 15 in Puerto 
Rico, and 229 in the United Kingdom. The company has six stores in 
China and five in South Korea under joint venture agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart has more than 1 million employees, including 815,000 in  
the United States and 220,000 internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the first six months of the fiscal year increased  
27 percent to $2.36 billion or 53 cents per share, compared with 
$1.86 billion or 42 cents per share, for the same period last 
fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Bears Prowl in Eastern Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bears left hungry by withered berry bushes are roaming into  
campgrounds and back yards from New Jersey to Maine, plundering 
knapsacks and bird feeders to survive their season of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the drought isn't all bad news for creatures of the wild,  
nor of the deep. West Virginia's wild turkeys and ruffled grouse 
are flourishing after years of wet weather. And in Maryland's 
Chesapeake Bay, biologists say oysters and anchovies could thrive 
thanks to higher saline levels. 
</P>
<P>
	All along the food chain, animals are feeling the effects of  
unmercifully dry months, scrounging, dying or thriving in high 
numbers as the sun beats down. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, ``wildlife handle it a lot better than people do,''  
said Roy Grimes of Kentucky's Department of Fish and Wildlife 
Resources. Elk and wild turkeys have adapted well, while fish died 
en masse when heat reduced the oxygen supply in the Kentucky River. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York's Adirondack Mountains, officials say the drought --  
combined with a bear population boom -- have made bear raids a 
nightly occurrence in backpacking camps this season. Desperation 
has made the state's 6,000 to 8,000 bears increasingly adept at 
swatting down food strung high in trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers have resorted to firing rubber bullets at them from  
shotguns, biologist Lou Berchielli said. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been 1,200 bear complaints this year in neighboring  
New Jersey, after fewer than 900 in all of 1998, officials say. 
Maine has also noticed a slight increase in complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	But elsewhere in the East, an increase in less threatening  
creatures is a welcomed change. 
</P>
<P>
	The abnormally arid climate has been perfect for a comeback of  
wild turkeys and grouse in West Virginia, where three years of rain 
and damp killed half their young. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early to say if this is a banner year, but it's  
certainly way above last year and above the last three years,'' 
said Curtis Taylor, a wildlife biologist with the state's Division 
of Natural Resources. Other animals, including deer, are emerging 
from the West Virginia woods in search of water and food. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything green they can find, they are going to eat,'' said  
Don Phares, a DNR project manager. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chesapeake Bay, higher salinity due to less fresh water could  
lead to a boost in oyster reproduction -- or a spike in disease 
among them. Scientists won't know until fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The salinity shift affects others in the bay's ecosystem. It's a  
boon to anchovies, since a lower salt level indirectly reduces the 
numbers of their predator, the jellyfish. And more anchovies means 
more food for the bigger fish that eat them, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet fish have other worries. Blooms of oxygen-robbing algae in  
tributaries this season have caused large fish kills in the 
Pocomoke, Magothy and Patapsco rivers. State biologists say the 
drought is probably a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	While Eastern campers shoo away bears, they're swatting fewer  
mosquitoes. The stagnant pools in which the insects breed have gone 
dry, said Ed Reed, a New York state wildlife biologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've only seen two or three mosquitoes all summer,'' said John  
Zellner, caretaker at the Forked Lake campground in the central 
Adirondacks. 
</P>
<P>
	But bloodthirsty deer flies are worse than usual, breeding in  
the mud flats exposed by receding ponds and streams, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Connecticut, officials say drought has reduced the population  
of most of the state's 45 mosquito species. In a recent survey, 
only 50 mosquitoes were caught in a trap, compared to 250 during 
the same week last year. But ferocious salt marsh mosquitoes are 
flourishing along the state's coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``One night, my husband killed 53 mosquitoes in our kitchen and  
den.'' said Joan Rosa, who lives in the shoreline community of 
Guilford. ``I am having a nervous breakdown.''

<HEADLINE> Reports: Ford To Buy Mazda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will buy a parts-making subsidiary  
of Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. by the end of September, local news 
reports said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to acquiring Mazda's Naldec Corp., Ford is also  
considering capital tie-ups with about 10 other Japanese parts 
makers, the Nihon Keizai business daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	Naldec was formed in 1987 as a 50-50 joint venture between Mazda  
and NEC Corp. The company makes and sells electronic components for 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda will buy all of NEC's shares in the unit and then sell  
them along with its own stake to Ford parts unit Visteon Automotive 
Systems, the Nihon Keizai report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase is expected to total several million dollars, the  
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda and Ford officials in Japan could not be reached  
Wednesday, as the two companies were closed for summer holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiroshima-based Mazda is 33.4 percent owned by Detroit-based  
Ford, the world's second-largest automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest deal follows the sale of Mazda's credit arm to Ford,  
announced earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Hopeful Eyes Gouging Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In the city that gave the Olympics its  
worst ethics scandal, one of the leading candidates for mayor says 
he wants to raise taxes ``shamelessly high'' to take advantage of 
visitors to the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Bradley, one of 13 people running for the job that also  
carries the title of official Olympic host, said in a recent debate 
that there was nothing wrong with gouging the hundreds of thousands 
of people who will come to the city for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hotel transient room tax has to be jacked up as high as we  
can possibly do it,'' the Democrat said. ``We have to raise the car 
rental tax as high as we can possibly do it -- even shamelessly high 
-- to generate revenue. ... We have to look at opportunities like 
that to just screw them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers are concerned that they might be stuck with paying off  
any debts remaining from the Salt Lake Games' $1.34 billion budget, 
which is supposed to be privately financed. But Bradley's opponents 
bristled at his comments, saying it sent the wrong message to 
potential visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a place to come and get fleeced,'' candidate Dave  
Jones said. ``I felt it was insensitive. I thought it was a very 
poor message to send to the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former county commissioner who lost the governor's  
race to Republican Mike Leavitt in 1996, said he wished he had more 
time to phrase his impromptu response at the debate. But he stood 
behind his comment and said he was the only candidate with the guts 
to take a commonsense stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a mean-spirited idea. It's not a bad idea. It is a  
good idea that saves money for the citizens of Salt Lake,'' he 
said. ``All I'm looking for are ways that the city's not left 
holding the bag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said minor increases, such as a $10 rise in room taxes,  
won't keep visitors from attending the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that the deal-killer for you?'' Bradley said. ``Heavens no.  
You'll pay it, and you'll probably pay it and say, `Boy, at least 
it's not as expensive as Barcelona was.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is considered among the four leading contenders for the  
city's top job. The two biggest vote-getters in October's primary 
will face off in the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-term Mayor Deedee Corradini, a Democrat, announced last year  
that she would not seek re-election. Her announcement came at the 
height of the scandal over the million-dollar program run by Salt 
Lake bidders to win the votes of International Olympic Committee 
members. Ms. Corradini has not been implicated.

<HEADLINE> Crops Push Corn, Soybeans Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures climbed above $5 a bushel for the  
first time since early May, while corn futures also rose sharply 
Tuesday, as crop conditions continued to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade have rallied  
sharply in the past few sessions as a drought takes its toll on 
Midwest crops, particularly in Illinois and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department reported late Monday that  
soybean crop ratings nationwide deteriorated last week, from 57 
percent to 54 percent in good to excellent condition. 
</P>
<P>
	That was slightly above analyst expectations for a 2  
percentage-point decline in conditions. More significantly, in 
Illinois -- the second-largest growing state behind Iowa -- only 48 
percent of the crop was in good to excellent condition, while 17 
percent in the crop was in poor to very poor condition. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a sharp deterioration from a week earlier and showed  
that even the hardy soybean crop can suffer under extreme 
conditions. Projections of record production likely will be revised 
downward. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn crop conditions also fell 3 percentage points, the  
government reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors do not expect the situation to improve this week,  
because only scattered rainfall is expected along with warmer 
temperatures. Some investors said that would not be enough to 
replenish and revive corn and soybean plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1/4 cent to $2.96 3/4 cents a  
bushel; December corn rose 4 3/4 cents to $2.40 3/4 cents a bushel; 
December oats prices remained unchanged; November soybeans rose 5 1/2 
cents to $4.93 1/2 cents a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and pork bellies futures were mostly higher on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while feeder cattle were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .50 cent to 65.47 cents per pound;  
October feeder cattle rose .07 cent to 76.92 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs rose 1.12 cents to 46.77 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies rose 2.58 cents to 58.45 cents a pounds.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen Wednesday  
morning in thin trading. Tokyo share prices rose moderately after a 
weak start. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.79 yen at late morning, down 0.09 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also marginally below its late New York 
level of 114.81 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 71.90  
points, or 0.42 percent, to 17,273.99 at the end of the morning 
session. On Tuesday, the average closed up 11.64 points, or 0.07 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar inched down after Japanese  
institutional investors adjusted positions in subdued trading amid 
Japan's summer holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 122.95 yen, down  
from 123.30 late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo stock market, prices opened moderately lower in  
already quiet trading as many participants retreated to the 
sidelines as Japan headed into the peak of the summer holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Tokyo market moved into positive territory by  
mid-morning as buying of futures bolstered sentiment among players, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 52.55 points  
to close at 10,655.15 on Tuesday. The technology-rich Nasdaq 
composite index also fell 28.87 points to 2,490.11. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 1.53 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,425.78. The 
TOPIX closed down 0.28 point, or 0.02 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.9100 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8950 percent, driving 
its price down to 99.06 yen from 99.19 yen.

<HEADLINE> Starr Says Lewinsky Was Immature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr says Monica  
Lewinsky was ``very immature'' and failed to understand the 
seriousness of her role in a scandal that ``cost the country 
terribly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed this morning on NBC's ``Today'' program, Starr also  
praised the career staff of the Justice Department, while pointedly 
refusing to say do the same for their boss, Attorney General Janet 
Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, who has spent five years investigating President Clinton  
and his wife, Hillary, lamented that his work was viewed as ``a 
match between two individuals'' -- himself and the president. Starr 
said he had acted professionally, but ``in the process of remaining 
silent, we allowed a sense to develop that there were other 
motivations at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked his thoughts about Ms. Lewinsky, whose sexual relationship  
with Clinton was at the heart of the investigation, Starr said, 
``She was very immature and I think failed to, in any way, 
appreciate the gravity of what she was doing, including, frankly, 
assisting in the process of putting our leader -- who has to accept 
his own responsibility -- in the most unfortunate situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to discussing Reno, Starr may have mastered the  
art of saying a lot without saying anything: 
</P>
<P>
	Question: ``Do you think that the attorney general has conducted  
herself properly during all this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Answer: ``I don't want to comment.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Some have said that she has protected the president.''  
</P>
<P>
	A: ``I don't want to comment. Let me say this, I believe that  
the career people at the Justice Department are honorable, decent 
people. We have a very, and have enjoyed a very good relationship 
with them over the past five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``So you won't say the same thing about the attorney  
general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A: ``I'm not going to comment.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``You leave the impression that you do not believe that she's  
been honorable and decent throughout this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A: ``I'm simply not going to comment.''

<HEADLINE> Shock 84, Sparks 59 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Detroit reserve Dominique Canty scored  
13 second-half points as the Shock beat the Los Angeles Sparks 
84-59 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Canty finished with 18 points, Jennifer Azzi added 15 and  
recently-acquired Wendy Palmer scored 15 and had 12 rebounds as 
Detroit won for just the second time in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit (12-14) led 42-26 at halftime and opened the second half  
with six unanswered points. The Sparks' 9-0 run cut the deficit to 
51-42 with 13:02 left, but the Shock put the game away with 11 
unanswered points for a 64-44 advantage with 9:11 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLisha Milton had 16 and La'Keshia Frett 12 for Los Angeles  
(17-8). The loss was the Sparks' worst of the season and the second 
in their last three games following a franchise-record tying 
six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles missed 14 of its first 15 shots and trailed 19-2  
6:28 into the game. Palmer, obtained in a July 29 trade with Utah, 
scored seven points during Detroit's 13-0 run which gave it the 
17-point advantage. A 6-0 spurt gave the Shock its biggest 
first-half lead, 29-9, 8:40 before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory moved the Shock two games ahead of Orlando (10-16)  
in the race for the Eastern Conference's final playoff berth. Both 
teams have six games remaining.

<HEADLINE> Cisco Systems' Revenues Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nowhere is the Internet gold rush more apparent  
-- and real -- than at Cisco Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Capping a stunning fiscal year in which revenues grew 43 percent  
and operating profits improved 35 percent, Cisco's fourth-quarter 
results showed that it continues to dominate the frenzied race to 
upgrade systems for Internet communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the three month period ended July 31 totaled $3.55  
billion, a 48 percent increase from last year's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., earned $727 million or 21  
cents per share, in the quarter, excluding one-time charges 
totaling $97 million for acquisition-related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year-ago period, Cisco posted an operating profit of $525  
million, or 16 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results edged most forecasts by industry analysts, which  
averaged 20 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some caution, however, on the part of Cisco executives  
regarding the uncertainty over whether concerns about the Year 2000 
computer bug would interrupt technology orders later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still don't know,'' said chief executive John Chambers.  
But, he added, ``We're more comfortable with Y2K than we were 
6-to-12 months ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Including all one-time factors, Cisco posted a net profit of  
$635 million, or 18 cents per share, in its fourth quarter, up from 
$493 million, or 15 cents a share a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco closed its fiscal year with revenue of $12.15 billion, up  
from $8.49 billion during the previous 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income totaled $2.55 billion, or 75 cents per share,  
for the fiscal year, an increase of 35 percent from the prior 
year's tally of $1.88 billion, or 58 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the fiscal year amounted to $2.10 billion, or 62  
cents per share. That compares with a net profit of $1.35 billion, 
or 42 cents per share, in the prior fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco again attributed its stellar results to the rapid growth  
of the Internet, including the race to bring high-speed, multimedia 
services to consumers over a single cable or phone wire. Revenues 
related to upgrading cable and phone systems for that purpose rose 
20 percent from the prior quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also pointed to the move away from traditional modes  
of voice and video communications, which are starting to be 
packaged in the format used to transmit data on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``By providing the systems that make the Internet work, Cisco is  
playing a major role in helping customers thrive in the explosive 
Internet economy,'' said Chambers. As a result, he boasted, Cisco 
is ``the fastest growing and most profitable company in the history 
of the computer industry.''

<HEADLINE> Giants Ink DE Strahan for $32M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Michael Strahan didn't mind sacrificing  
about $6 million in his signing bonus for a shorter deal -- and the 
biggest contract in New York Giants history. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Pro Bowl defensive end says the risk is worth it if  
it gets him back to the negotiating table at least one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather take that chance and see what I get negotiating a  
new contract instead of tying myself up for seven or eight years,'' 
Strahan, 27, said. ``I think I am young enough where I have enough 
confidence in my ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan, who led the NFL with 29 sacks the past two seasons,  
cashed in Monday, signing a four-year, $32 million contract. The 
deal, which includes a $12 million signing bonus, makes him the 
league's second-highest paid defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is a very modest guy,'' said Tony Agnone, Strahan's  
agent. ``He absolutely is the best defensive player in football, 
and they wanted to make him the highest-paid guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only Dallas cornerback Deion Sanders will make more than  
Strahan, averaging $10.3 million annually under terms of a complex 
contract. However, Sanders has to play more than 70 percent of the 
Cowboys' defensive plays to be No. 1, Agnone said. 
</P>
<P>
	If he doesn't, Strahan will be the highest paid.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, recovering from toe surgery, is not in the Cowboys'  
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely happy. They made a commitment to me and I think  
we made a commitment to each other,'' Strahan said after signing 
the contract between practices at the University at Albany. ``I am 
happy to be in New York. I love New York and never wanted to go 
anywhere in the first place. So I'm glad they were able to get an 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, Strahan will earn $400,000 in salary  
this year. He will get $4.6 million in 2000 and then $7 million and 
$8 million, respectively, in the last two years of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for a young man who grew up in Germany and who didn't  
play football until his senior year in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan's previous contract with the Giants would have expired  
after this year, and he warned the team during the offseason to get 
it done before this season started. 
</P>
<P>
	Agnone and Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi met several  
times in the last month, discussing both long- and short-term 
contracts, as well as ones with incentives, voidable years and 
other gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Their breakthrough meeting came last Wednesday at Giants  
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we realized was: `Let's not try to make everything so  
complicated and make things more simple,''' Agnone said. ``As we 
simplified things, we started realizing we could make this 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result was a three-page contract, unlike some of the 35-page  
ones Accorsi has seen recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get a contract any cleaner than this,'' Accorsi  
said. ``There isn't anything in it. There are five lines, each of 
the four years and the signing bonus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $8 million average salary also makes Strahan the  
highest-paid defensive linemen, moving ahead of Minnesota's John 
Randle, who averages $6.5 million under a deal he signed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now entering his seventh season, Strahan blossomed over the last  
two. He dominated up front and was selected to the Pro Bowl each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
                             *Falcons    	
</P>
<P>
	Running back Jamal Anderson, holding out of training camp in a  
bid for a new contract, planned to meet with the Falcons today at 
Furman University, coach Dan Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Reeves downplayed the possible meeting, it could signal a  
major break in the holdout that has kept Anderson off the practice 
field since training camp began July 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he is under contract for this season, Anderson accumulated  
$60,000 in fines -- $5,000 per day -- as of Monday. The running back, 
set to make $2.6 million in the final year of his current deal, has 
been seeking a new five-year contract with a signing bonus of at 
least $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, defensive end Chuck Smith returned to practice for the  
first time since spraining a toe during the first day of training 
camp on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	Edgerrin James arrived in Indianapolis with his agent Leigh  
Steinberg in hopes of coming to terms with the Colts. He was the 
fourth overall draft pick and is already figured as the starter at 
running back in place of Marshall Faulk, traded to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	However, team president Bill Polian said the two sides are not  
any closer to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The young man is holding out. They haven't made any movement  
off a ridiculous number, which is $11 million to sign for five 
years,'' Polian said. ``That's not acceptable, that's not do-able 
under any circumstances. They haven't made any movement off 
voidable years.''

	The promising season of Carolina rookie cornerback Tony Booth  
ended with a knee injury that will require surgery and at least six 
months of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Booth, a seventh-round draft choice who was getting rave reviews  
from coach George Seifert, injured his left knee during the team's 
morning practice. Tests showed a complete tear of both the anterior 
cruciate and medial collateral ligaments, Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting safety Mike Minter was knocked unconscious shortly  
before Booth's injury. Seifert said Minter likely would miss most 
of the exhibition season, but should be ready for the Sept. 12 
regular-season opener at New Orleans.

<HEADLINE> Report: Smits To Return Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Rik Smits, the starting center for the  
Indiana Pacers who considered retiring from the NBA because of 
chronic foot pain, has decided to return next season, a newspaper 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Smits, who said he was leaning toward retirement after losing to  
the New York Knicks in Game 6 of the 1999 Eastern Conference 
finals, told The Indianapolis Star that he will play for a 12th 
season because his feet haven't been hurting lately. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feet are feeling pretty good, and I did some thinking,''  
Smits said from his offseason home in Walton, N.Y. ``I'm going to 
give it a try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smits averaged 14.9 points last season, his lowest since  
1992-93. By season's end he said he had grown tired of coping with 
the foot pain that has dogged him for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time ever, I really didn't enjoy playing this  
season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smits, who played 49 games during last year's condensed  
50-game season, told the newspaper he felt obligated to fulfill the 
final year of his contract, which will pay him $12.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have that feeling now,'' he said. ``If I go back, I'm going  
back to play, not to watch other people play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Smits also said he would consider extending his  
term with the Pacers, depending on how things go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to say this is my last year, but who can say?'' he  
said. ``I'm just going to concentrate on this year for now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last two weeks, the 7-foot-4 center has been undergoing  
treatments with Boston orthopedic therapist Dan Dyrek. At least two 
more sessions with Dyrek have been planned to relieve any lingering 
pain in his size 21 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, they'll feel better than last year,'' Smits said.  
``I was really disappointed a lot of times last year. I lost my 
explosiveness and my balance and it was hard to be effective. 
Hopefully, I'll get that back this year.''

<HEADLINE> Investors Look Beyond S&AMP;P 500 Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Many investors not only want solid profits, they  
want them with a minimum of risk. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why they have turned to ``enhanced'' S&AMP;P 500 funds, or  
funds that try to outperform the well-known market index, while at 
the same time minimizing investors' risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Enhanced S&AMP;P 500 funds buy stock in companies outside the 500  
stocks that make up the index. The companies are selected through 
highly sophisticated computer programs that consider all of a 
company's important historical financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	Fund watchers familiar with enhanced funds say much of the  
analytical work is geared toward reducing the added risk brought on 
by tinkering with the traditional S&AMP;P model. 
</P>
<P>
	``The traditional S&AMP;P 500 index fund is only going to get you so  
far, and the mutual fund arena is kind of saturated with these 
things,'' said Chris Brown, an analyst with the Financial Research 
Corp. in Boston. ``The enhanced funds provide a different take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Given the steady growth of the S&AMP;P 500 index over the past  
decade, a mutual fund that outperforms the index by just one 
percent is an attractive proposition, Brown said. ``That's where 
returns will really start to compound themselves,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Take American Century's $5.5 billion Income &AMP; Growth Fund, for  
example, which tends to focus more on smaller companies whose 
stocks are undervalued along with small, but fast-growing 
companies. The fund still holds positions in such blue-chip giants 
as General Electric, Microsoft Inc. and Chase Manhanttan Bank. It 
is trailing the S&AMP;P 500 by 1.24 percent in 1999, and by 2.86 
percent over the past year, but it has outperformed the index by 
0.15 percent over the last three years, according to Morningstar. 
</P>
<P>
	John Schniedwind, a senior vice-president and portfolio manager  
at American Century, attributed the fund's recent lackluster 
performance to a dismal first quarter of 1999, when a handful of 
large-cap stocks did phenomenally well, a dynamic that drew 
attention and money away from virtually every other segment of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not for everyone,'' Schniedwind said. ``We're primarily  
for investors looking for an opportunity to take on additional risk 
relative to the S&AMP;P 500, but with the opportunity of outperforming 
that benchmark index.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schniedwind said the Income &AMP; Growth fund is geared toward  
longer-term investors who have the patience and the stomach to ride 
out volatile swings in the market. ``Somebody should be in this for 
at least three to five years, probably longer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer generated models used to select the stocks that go  
into enhanced funds tend to tweak the portfolios ``just enough so 
that there will be a little more growth'' than standard S&AMP;P 500 
indexes, said Art Bonnel, portfolio manager of U.S. Global's Bonnel 
Growth Fund. ``It takes a lot of work to beat the S&AMP;P 500, but it 
can be done,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	One disadvantage to investing in enhanced S&AMP;P 500 index funds is  
that the turnover rates of stocks held in an enhanced portfolio are 
higher than those of traditionally stable S&AMP;P 500 index funds. S&AMP;P 
index funds simply mirror an established list of companies, so no 
tinkering is required. Enhanced funds, however, are trying to beat 
the S&AMP;P 500 by dabbling here and there. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased frequency of buying and selling means capital  
gains distributions are higher for investors of enhanced funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Cooley, a senior analyst at Morningstar, explained that,  
while many enhanced S&AMP;P 500 funds have equaled or outperformed the 
gains of the benchmark index in recent years, investors frequently 
find that their cash gains don't quite measure up because of the 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating expenses also tend to be cheaper for traditional S&AMP;P  
500 index funds since they don't need much active management and 
because their size allows for the costs to be spread out among 
thousands of investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Other enhanced S&AMP;P 500 funds include U.S. Global's All American  
Fund, Vanguard's Growth &AMP; Income Fund and Phoenix Income &AMP; Growth 
Fund.

<HEADLINE> Contamination Checks at Nuke Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said today  
the government is looking into whether workers at federal nuclear 
facilities, in addition to one in Paducah, Ky., may have been 
exposed to dangerous radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at other plants, at Oak Ridge (Tenn.), to see  
whether this might have happened,'' Richardson said in an interview 
on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe right now that the situation needs a full airing,  
that Congress needs to look into it,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at the Energy Department uranium-enrichment plant in  
Paducah will be subjects of a medical review following charges that 
thousands of employees were unwittingly exposed to plutonium and 
other highly radioactive metals. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson ordered the study after a newspaper reported that the  
Paducah case differed from other nuclear contamination incidents 
because workers there did not know they were handling plutonium. 
Instead, they thought they were dealing only with much less-potent 
uranium, which they were enriching for commercial nuclear fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inexcusable if the government concealed information,  
along with the contractors, that in the '50s and '60s and '70s 
these workers might have been exposed to plutonium,'' Richardson 
said. ``If that is the case ... and we are investigating, these 
individuals need to be treated and compensated, the government has 
to apologize.''

<HEADLINE> Lucent To Buy INS for $3.7 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Lucent Technologies Inc. is expanding  
its presence in the growing field of designing and consulting on 
high-speed data networks by acquiring International Network 
Services Inc. for about $3.6 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent, a leading maker of telecommunications equipment, plans  
to combine INS with its NetCare unit, which designs and sets up 
data networks, to create a 5,500-person division led by INS chief 
executive officer and president John Drew. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lucent now faces the challenge of retaining INS's 2,200  
employees -- and recruiters are already calling, an analyst said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lucent made a huge coup in the market, because INS, frankly,  
was thought to be unattainable,'' said Ellen Carney, a principal 
analyst at Dataquest. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``INS brings an extremely perishable aspect -- the  
intellectual capital of their people. It's sort of like of sushi in 
the refrigerator. It's nice while it lasts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent chairman Rich McGinn said the merger, to be completed by  
the end of the year, ``will offer customers the industry's deepest 
portfolio of network planning, design, integration, maintenance and 
management solutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the nation's largest independent network consulting  
providers, INS earned $25.4 million in the fiscal year ended June 
30 on sales of $315 million. Its customers include more than 50 of 
the Fortune 100 companies, and one-third of the Fortune 1000, 
including AT&AMP;T Corp., MCI WorldCom Inc. and Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lucent deal will have an impact on rival Cisco Systems, a  
leading maker of networking equipment, which owns between 7 percent 
and 8 percent of INS, and also has an executive on INS' board. 
Cisco vice president Charles Giancarlo will remain on the board 
until it ceases to exist when the deal closes, INS spokesman Jeff 
Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco Systems will get a good return on its INS investment and  
has enough service relationships in place to keep from being badly 
hurt by the Lucent acquisition, Carney said, ``But their ego took a 
bit of a bruise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco spokesman Doug Wills said the deal would not hurt because  
Cisco works with hundreds of consulting firms and systems 
integrators. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news for INS employees is that Cisco and KPMG are  
hiring,'' Wills said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., on Monday announced it would  
invest $1 billion in KPMG LLP to aid the accounting and consulting 
firm's expansion onto the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Lucent dropped 3 percent, or $2, to $61.62 1/2 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange, decreasing the deal's value from 
its original $3.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	INS was up 6 percent, or $3, to $50.43 3/4 in trading on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on Rate Hike Fears / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell slightly Tuesday, pushing  
long-term yields to a new 21-month high, as worries over additional 
interest rate increases and a rush of new bonds to the market cut 
demand for U.S. government securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/16  
point, or $1.87 1/2 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 6.24 percent from 6.23 percent -- 
reaching a level last seen on Nov. 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The government bond market continued to be under pressure  
because of $22 billion in new 10-year notes and 30-year bonds that 
the Treasury is scheduled to auction Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government sold $15 billion in five-year Treasury notes on  
Tuesday at the highest auction yield since August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional $1 billion in corporate supply is also weighing on  
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Many traders expect the market to continue to trade poorly  
overall amid mounting expectations that Federal Reserve 
policy-makers will raise rates when they meet Aug. 24 and on fears 
that there will be one more rate increase before the year ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed raised rates on June 30, nudging a key interest rate up  
by a quarter-point, the first increase in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warned last month that the central  
bank would be on the lookout for any signs of inflation and would 
move quickly to stanch such tendencies in the U.S. economy, which 
has shown surprisingly strong signs of growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, several economic reports have suggested that labor  
costs may be rising for employers, a key signal to interest policy 
makers that inflation could be on the horizon. Signs of inflation 
hurt the value of bonds, which pay a fixed rate of interest. A rate 
increase would also erode the value of bonds already in 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a regional Federal Reserve Bank president with a vote  
on interest-rate policy, Robert McTeer Jr. of Dallas, told the 
Greater Dallas Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday that strong economic 
growth isn't necessarily inflationary, especially if it's fueled by 
gains in technology and productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged to down 1/32 point, and intermediate maturities were 
down as much as 3/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.94 percent as the  
discount rose 0.02 percentage point from Monday's auction to 4.81 
percent. Six-month yields were 5.13 percent, as the discount rose 
0.01 percentage point from the weekly auction to 4.93 percent. 
One-year yields were 5.20 percent as the discount rose by 0.01 
percentage point from late Monday to 4.95 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged from late Monday at 4.94 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 7/32 to 115 1/8. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.72 percent from 5.71 percent late Monday.

<HEADLINE> Race-Based Busing Request Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A request by a group of white parents to end  
race-based busing in the city's schools by next month was denied 
Tuesday by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston School Committee already voted last month to end  
racial assignments for the school year beginning September 2000, 
but four white families said that wasn't soon enough. The parents 
said their children were being denied their first choice of schools 
because of racial considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a hearing last week, they asked U.S. District Court Judge  
Nancy Gertner for a preliminary injunction to revise the busing 
policy by the start of classes on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	The injunction would have affected children entering  
kindergarten and first-grade, as well as transfer students and 
those on waiting lists for their top school choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Gertner said Monday the injunction would inflict ``substantial  
disruption'' on the school assignment plan. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials had said there was simply no time to implement  
it in a matter of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the outgoing Boston plan, children are assigned to schools  
based on several factors: race; the proximity of the child's home 
to the school; whether he or she has any siblings there; and the 
results of a yearly school choice lottery. Under the new plan, 
effective in September 2000, race will no longer be considered. 
</P>
<P>
	The outgoing policy emerged out of a federal desegregation court  
order 25 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Carnie Wilson Surgery Airs on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Singer and former talk show host Carnie Wilson  
gave an unusual performance Tuesday -- a live broadcast via the 
Internet of her gastric bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, the 31-year-old daughter of Beach Boy Brian Wilson, said  
prior to the surgery she was ``morbidly obese'' and the procedure 
provided a permanent solution to weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so obese to the fact that I could die. That's really what  
it is. I could have a massive heart attack,'' she said in a 
videotaped interview provided on the Website 
www.adoctorinyourhouse.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery was performed at Alvarado Hospital Medical Center by  
a team of doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people who tried to see the surgery weren't successful  
because the Internet server couldn't handle the demand, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. The Website features celebrities and their health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's stomach was reduced to a small pouch and attached to  
the small intestine. As a result, Wilson won't be able to eat as 
much food and food will leave the body before it is fully digested. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients usually lose about 80 percent of their excess body  
weight within a year and maintain that weight, said Dr. Wesley 
Clark, one of Wilson's surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, part of the now-defunct Wilson Phillips trio, said she  
has battled weight problems since childhood, craving sugar to the 
point of sneaking into the kitchen to eat powered cake mix.

<HEADLINE> N.Y.'s Lazio Suspends Senate Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Bowing to Gov. George Pataki's wishes, Rick  
Lazio will suspend his plans for a U.S. Senate campaign as New York 
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani weighs the race, several Republicans 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Lazio  
will not completely withdraw from the Senate competition, keeping 
his options open in case the mayor does not run for the seat being 
vacated next year by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment Tuesday from Lazio and his aides  
refused to confirm the plans. The congressman plans to make his 
announcement at a news conference Wednesday morning in Bay Shore on 
Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Pataki asked Lazio to defer the Senate candidacy  
announcement the Long Island congressman had planned to make next 
week. The Republican governor said Giuliani had earned the right to 
the GOP Senate nomination and he urged the mayor to quickly declare 
his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki has had frosty relations with Giuliani since 1994 when  
the mayor crossed party lines to endorse then-Democratic Gov. Mario 
Cuomo in the governor's race won by Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate race could pit Giuliani against first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton, who is pondering a bid as the Democratic candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki's plea to Lazio was designed to avoid a potentially  
bitter GOP primary. The governor had been under pressure from some 
national and New York GOP leaders to use his muscle to keep Lazio 
out of the race on the grounds that Giuliani would be a stronger 
Republican candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment Tuesday from Pataki, who is  
vacationing in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who was still on her summerlong listening tour  
Tuesday in Queens, brushed aside concerns about a united GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try not to think about issues I have no control over. What  
the other party does is strictly their business,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While both Mrs. Clinton and the mayor have formed Senate  
exploratory committees and are raising money for their possible 
Senate bids, neither has formally announced their candidacies.

<HEADLINE> 13 Die in Labor Van Crash in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FIVE POINTS, Calif. (AP) -- Dora Portillo was one of the lucky  
ones. So was her mom. After a long night of picking and sorting 
tomatoes, they caught their own ride back to Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Portillo's father, Juan Avila, was among the 15 people who  
piled into a 1983 Dodge Ram after working the same shift. He never 
made it home. 
</P>
<P>
	The van slammed into a tractor-trailer before dawn Monday,  
killing all but two of the passengers. It split in half across its 
front grill and buckled upon impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told my mom, `You go ahead and go with them, so you can  
rest and go to sleep,''' said Ms. Portillo, 26, sobbing as she 
explained how there was not enough room in her friend's car for 
both her parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened shortly after 5 a.m., just southeast of  
this tiny town in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley. The truck 
driver was turning his rig around on a two-lane road after parking 
on the shoulder to sleep, said California Highway Patrol Officer 
Eric Erickson. The rig's two trailers were empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The van was going at least 55 mph, and ``couldn't avoid hitting  
the tractor-trailer,'' Erickson said. ``Their brakes locked up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The skid marks were 50 to 80 feet long, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver, Adrian Erazo, 44, was not injured.  
</P>
<P>
	The van's driver, whose identity wasn't released, was among  
those killed. He didn't have a license and had had his driving 
privileges revoked because of several violations, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, from Fresno, had been cited for not wearing a  
seatbelt, not having a license, and was once arrested for drunken 
driving. Erickson said there was no conviction for the DUI, but it 
wasn't clear why. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the injured survivors, Lucia Gonzalez, was in critical  
condition with internal bleeding after surgery Monday, hospital 
officials said. The other, Gilberto Piedra Navarrete, 42, was in 
stable condition with two broken legs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican government agency Notimex said the Mexican consulate  
in Fresno confirmed that the 13 dead farmworkers were Mexicans. No 
one was available at the consulate Monday afternoon for further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In central California's agricultural heartland, farm workers  
often have no alternative to traveling in crowded vans -- a problem 
that has contributed to a disproportionate traffic death rate among 
Hispanics in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 10 men and five women in the van were sitting  
without seat belts on two carpeted benches, said CHP Officer Brian 
Yokley. 
</P>
<P>
	It's illegal in California to have anyone ride without proper  
seats and seat belts, but certified farm vehicles are excluded from 
the law. The van -- owned by Ms. Portillo's grandfather, Jose Lopez 
Rosas -- received its last annual certification in 1997, but had not 
been certified since, the highway patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something has to change because every time you see these you  
don't have one death, you have multiple deaths,'' said Yolanda 
Cervantes, who organizes an annual driver safety awareness program 
in nearby Mendota. ``I've seen too many.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The highway patrol has a team of six officers dubbed ``Los  
Centinales'' -- or ``the Sentinels'' -- who focus exclusively on 
vehicles overcrowded with farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
	They have spent the past three summers patrolling before dawn,  
stopping trucks and vans of farm workers to check whether the 
vehicles are complying with state codes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stop those vehicles that are obviously overloaded ... the  
back end is sagged down because of the weight of the people,'' said 
Sgt. Jorge Chaidez, who runs the unit out of the highway patrol's 
office in Fresno. ``I've seen up to 22 people in a small van.''

<HEADLINE> NASA Finds Tree-Shaped Frost on Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Peering down through stormy Martian skies, a  
NASA spacecraft has found tree-like shapes dotting the red planet's 
south pole. But what appears to be rolling hills covered with 
vegetation are most likely sand dunes topped with melting frost, 
scientists said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest images from the $250 million Mars Global Surveyor  
that has been mapping the planet since March offer new insight into 
the weather there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since this whole area is at about minus 150 degrees Celsius,  
these are clearly not plants growing up out of the frost, but 
something else is happening,'' said Mike Malin, who is responsible 
for the camera aboard the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the scientists thought the tree shapes and other,  
circular formations might have been caused by small gas pockets 
exploding under sand dunes. 
</P>
<P>
	But their latest theory is that the dark shapes are patches of  
exposed sand standing out among the frost-covered dunes. As spring 
warms southern Mars, the frost turns directly to gas. Wind then 
blows the frost and sand into patterns that resemble trees when 
viewed from space. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the monstrous sand dunes observed by the missions to Mars  
in the 1970s, the new images show smaller dunes, much like those 
found in the Mojave Desert. Detailed close-ups of the dunes look 
like a Japanese stone garden, with precise, wind-blown patterns 
etched into the dust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our view of the red planet has been of something stuck in the  
freezer for millions of years, but looking at the new pictures 
shows us a dynamic and active planet,'' said Michael Meyer of 
NASA's Office of Space Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Martian frost consists of frozen carbon dioxide. But  
when the temperature rises, the carbon dioxide flashes into a gas 
too quickly to be observed, Malin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The frost appears at night, when Surveyor can't watch, so  
whether it forms on the ground or falls as snow from the atmosphere 
is still a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other NASA spacecraft will arrive at Mars later this year.  
The Mars Climate Orbiter will reach Mars in September and will make 
more detailed weather observations. In December, the Mars Polar 
Lander will arrive and dispatch two smaller probes to search for 
water below the surface. The Polar Lander will then touch down at 
the south pole to study the soil. NASA plans to announce the 
landing site on Aug. 25.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon To Give Spielberg an Award </HEADLINE>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) - Filmmaker Steven Spielberg will be given the  
Pentagon's public service award Wednesday, primarily for his movie 
``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen feels the film helped increase  
national ``understanding of the contribution that our military has

	``It's for encouraging a national dialogue about World War II,''  
Bacon said. ``It opened up, I think, a dialogue about what happened 
in the Normandy invasion and in World War II generally.''

<HEADLINE> Jazz Official Takes Job in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Scott Layden has spent 11 seasons as the  
brains behind the Utah Jazz's personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	By his own admission, it's time to mature.  
</P>
<P>
	Layden on Tuesday resigned as Utah's vice president for  
basketball operations, leaving the NBA's smallest market for its 
largest as he joined the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes as a really tough decision to move on, but it just  
feels like the right thing to do,'' Layden, 41, said. ``I need to 
move on and grow up a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layden declined to discuss his new job in detail, but he was  
expected to be introduced today in New York as the Knicks' general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden's departure leaves the Jazz in a lurch as they try to  
re-sign free agent Shandon Anderson. Also pending are talks with 
free agents John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek, and both are expected 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah general manager Tim Howells said the Jazz have no list of  
potential successors for Layden, nor a deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no time line, but it's something we will be working on  
with a great sense of urgency,'' said Howells, who will take over 
negotiations with Anderson's agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz owner Larry Miller, who usually cries at his team's news  
conferences, wasted no time welling up over Layden, whom he called 
``the Jazz's secret weapon'' of the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a personal, selfish standpoint and from a standpoint of  
wearing my hat as owner of the Jazz, I wish we weren't here today 
talking about this,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden said the deciding factor was his family's enthusiasm for  
living in New York. He and his wife, Marsha, are supporters of the 
arts, and Layden lived in New York through his teen years. 
</P>
<P>
	The boyish-faced Layden also said he's eager to prove himself in  
a way he could not in Utah, where he lived in the shadow of his 
father, former coach Frank Layden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've really felt like I've been on the coattails of some  
brilliant people -- coaches, players, owners and the people who work 
in this organization,'' said Layden, who spent 18 years with the 
Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports indicated Layden could be paid about $1.5 million  
in New York, four times his Utah salary. He wouldn't talk about 
money, but denied it was the reason he's leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was all about money, I would have moved on long ago,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Utah's vice president of basketball operations, Layden  
developed a reputation as a skilled evaluator of talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Utah's recent second-round draft selections, Bryon  
Russell and Anderson, helped the team's runs to the NBA Finals in 
1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But Layden also has had trouble making trades, and his signing  
of center Greg Ostertag to a six-year, $39 million contract was 
widely ridiculed around the league. 
</P>
<P>
	There might have been more reasons for Layden to leave than  
stay. For one, the Jazz's aging trio of stars Karl Malone, Stockton 
and Hornacek are each over 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Salt Lake's clean-cut -- some would say boring --  
image. Layden engineered deals in recent years for players like 
Rony Seikaly and Derek Harper, but neither would report. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden denied those factors contributed to his decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``By no means was that the case. This whole thing came up fast  
and it was an opportunity I felt I couldn't pass up,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Racial Prank Prompts NASCAR Firing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It was a joke that went too far.  
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR driving stars Terry Labonte and Derrike Cope fired two  
employees for a racial prank in which one of the workers wore a 
sheet over his head like a Klansman and confronted a black 
colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses characterized the July 8 episode at the New Hampshire  
International Speedway as an attempt at a joke by the two white 
motorcoach drivers. The motorcoaches are used to transport cars and 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just needs to be understood that there is a line that  
cannot be crossed, joking or otherwise,'' said Kevin Triplett, 
NASCAR's director of operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the two motorcoach drivers were not employed by NASCAR,  
the most the sanctioning body could do was suspend their licenses. 
That means the two men cannot enter any area of a track over which 
NASCAR has jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR did not announce the suspensions until its investigation  
was complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte and Cope said the two motorcoach drivers had confronted  
a coachman for another NASCAR driver, Jeremy Mayfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Cope's driver was identified by team and NASCAR sources as Mike  
``Grumpy'' Culberson, and Labonte's as Ray Labbe. Spokesmen for the 
teams said neither former coachman planned any comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The black coachman, David Scott, also would not comment,  
according to a spokesman for Mayfield's team. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the two men wore the sheet over his head, and the other  
accompanied him when they confronted Scott three days before the 
Jiffy Lube 300, according to NASCAR and team sources who spoke on 
condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behavior like this simply cannot be tolerated in today's  
society,'' Cope said. ``This was an example of grievous behavior 
that I do not condone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 Daytona 500 champion called it ``an ignorant act'' that  
left him no recourse but dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``These actions are deplorable and will not be tolerated,'' said  
Labonte, a two-time Winston Cup champion. ``When this situation was 
brought to my attention, the employee was released immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach drivers are employed by most of the circuit's top racers  
who stay at the tracks during events. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR said it would not stand for any racial discrimination.  
</P>
<P>
	``Harassment of any type -- racial, religious, whatever, will not  
be tolerated in any form,'' Triplett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Auto racing is a predominantly white sport, and NASCAR's top  
division has had just one full-time black driver in its history, 
and only a sprinkling of black crew members. Few blacks are seen 
among the vast audiences at race tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Aware of that image, NASCAR has been working to create minority  
interest. Former basketball great Julius Erving and former football 
star Joe Washington have formed a team, while former Olympic 
champion Jackie Joyner Kersee recently announced she is planning to 
be part of a new team. 
</P>
<P>
	The only black driver to reach NASCAR's top level was the late  
Wendell Scott, who got his lone career victory in 1963. His son, 
Franklin, criticized the sport as being exclusionary during his 
father's posthumous induction earlier this year into the 
International Motorsports Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	One driver who has spoken out about the racial makeup of auto  
racing is Frank Kimmel, reigning champion of the second-tier ARCA 
racing circuit, which is not affiliated with NASCAR. He has had 
some black crew members who have talked openly about the difficulty 
of being minorities in auto racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't like to admit it, but it is a redneck sport,'' Kimmel  
said.

<HEADLINE> Nixon's Secret Tapes To Go On Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hear Richard M. Nixon pound his fist and bark  
orders to his White House staff. Replay the famous ``smoking gun'' 
conversation about Watergate that led to his resignation 25 years 
ago. Listen as Nixon says he wants to be sure the next IRS 
commissioner ``will go after our enemies and not go after our 
friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in January, 264 hours of Nixon's once-secret White  
House tapes go on sale from the National Archives. Details are 
still being finalized. Prices for cassettes have not yet been set, 
although archives officials say the government will not profit from 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be like listening to today's top-quality compact discs.  
These are scratchy, hard-to-hear recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the public has to understand is that we're talking about  
recording devices that were not exactly state-of-the-art,'' Karl 
Weissenbach, director of the Nixon Presidential Materials Project 
at the National Archives, said Monday. ``People didn't always speak 
loudly and clearly. They get up and walk around the room. An 
individual could be 10 to 15 feet from where a microphone was 
located.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon's baritone voice is easily identified. So is the deep  
timbre of the voice of Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security 
adviser and secretary of state. The voices of other players in the 
Nixon White House are harder to discern. 
</P>
<P>
	The archives has a total of 3,700 hours of Nixon tapes. But the  
public will only be able to buy copies of 264 hours of ``abuse of 
government power'' tapes that contain conversations about the 
break-in and bugging of the Democratic National Committee 
headquarters in the Watergate complex in Washington on Memorial Day 
weekend in 1972, the subsequent cover-up and wrongdoing by the 
president or his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Making copies of the tapes was an issue in 1992 when historian  
Stanley Kutler and Public Citizen, an advocacy group, sued the 
archives, saying the Nixon tapes weren't being released fast 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Nixon intervened in the suit, and in 1993, they got  
a court order banning any further release of tapes until all 
personal and private conversations were returned to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	In a compromise reached in 1996, the parties agreed that if all  
the tapes were not opened by January 2000, the archives could make 
copies of the abuse of government power sections for public 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	John Taylor, director of the Richard Nixon Library &AMP; Birthplace  
Foundation in Yorba Linda, Calif., said he thinks the recordings 
should only be projected against the backdrop of the Vietnam War 
and released only within the context of the war and other events of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``History will only have the complete story of the  
Vietnam-Watergate era when it has seen all the tapes in the context 
and in the light of the documentary record,'' Taylor said. ``I do 
not believe history will fully understand Watergate ... until it 
comes to terms with the fact that that was a wartime administration 
and that Richard Nixon was a wartime commander in chief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the most popular snippets of tape:  
</P>
<P>
	-- A March 21, 1973 conversation between Nixon and John Dean,  
counsel to the president, who remarks that the Watergate affair had 
become a ``cancer'' on the presidency. ``We have a cancer -- within 
-- close to the presidency, that's growing,'' Dean tells Nixon. 
``It's growing daily. It's compounding, it grows geometrically 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- A June 30, 1971 recording when Nixon is heard telling his  
chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, and others to arrange a break-in at 
the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, to obtain 
Vietnam War files. ``I want them just to break in and take it out. 
Do you understand?'' Nixon tells Haldeman. ``You're to break into 
the place, rifle the files and bring them in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- A May 13, 1971 recording where Nixon talks about a prospective  
IRS commissioner. ``I want to be sure that he is a ruthless son of 
a bitch, that he will do what he is told, that every income tax 
return I want to see, I see,'' he said. ``That he will go after our 
enemies and not go after our friends. It's as simple as that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- The ``smoking gun'' conversation on June 23, 1972 -- just six  
days after the Watergate burglary. That exchange with Haldeman 
revealed that the president was interested in using the CIA to 
derail the FBI's Watergate investigation and led to his resignation 
on Aug. 9, 1974.

<HEADLINE> Russians Drive Out Islamic Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces today drove Islamic  
rebels out of two villages, and surrounded the militants in two 
others in the turbulent Caucasus Mountains, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian troops and the rebels have been skirmishing for four  
days in the southern republic of Dagestan, and the Russians 
appeared to be gaining the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians cleared the militants from two villages in the  
southwest Tsumadinsky district and had encircled the rebels in two 
villages in the Botlikh region, according to Dagestan officials. 
The fighting was relatively light, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation in Dagestan has changed and is controllable  
now,'' Anatoly Kvashnin, the chief of the army's general staff, was 
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, acting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin estimated it  
would take two weeks to end the standoff, according to the 
ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining rebels will not be allowed to retreat across the  
border to Chechnya, said Dagestan's Interior Minister Omar 
Magomedov. They must either surrender or face renewed attacks, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dagestani government said four Russian pilots were killed  
today when their helicopters were shot down over Botlkikh. Four 
rebels and two Russian soldiers were killed Monday, and both sides 
suffered a number of wounded, according to Dagestan television and 
the Interior Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian troops said the rebels shot at Russian helicopters  
Monday, including one carrying Kvashnin. He was unhurt and the 
aircraft was only slightly damaged, according to Dagestan 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been amassing forces in the region, and the troops  
have far more firepower than the rebels, who seized the villages on 
Saturday after marching across the border from the breakaway 
territory of Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	After the disastrous 1994-6 war in Chechnya, Russia appears wary  
of igniting a larger conflict. Still, Russia military and political 
leaders have insisted that the rebel forces must be crushed. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen's motives are not entirely clear, but they appear to  
be members of the Wahhabi Islamic movement seeking independence for 
Russia's mostly Islamic republics in the Caucasus Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen from Chechnya appear to have received some support  
from local Dagestan residents, though many villagers fled for 
Dagestan's capital Makhachkala. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslim leaders in Dagestan appeared to disagree over the  
standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	An unrecognized council of Muslim leaders, or Shura, gathered in  
Botlikh on Tuesday and declared an independent Muslim state of 
Dagestan governed by Islamic rule. The council called on all 
Dagestani Muslims to ``fight until all the infidels are ousted from 
the Muslim territory,'' according to a statement it sent to news 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a far more powerful council of Muslim leaders, the  
Muslim Board of Dagestan, condemned the gunmen as extremists who 
are misusing Islam. It said Dagestan would not break away from 
Russia and that the Shura decision should hold no sway over 
Dagestani Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict in Dagestan is linked to the ongoing tension in  
Chechnya, which has had de facto independence since Russian troops 
withdrew three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has placed security forces along Chechnya's borders to  
try to fence it off, but warlords and criminal gangs roam the area 
and often venture into neighboring regions such as Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of the size of the militant force in Dagestan vary  
widely, though the Russian military puts the number at between 300 
and 600. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Russian forces was also unclear. They include  
troops from several federal and local agencies and at least 500 
volunteers recruited by Dagestani security forces, Dagestani 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of refugees in Makhachkala, Dagestan's capital, has  
reached 4,000, said Mayor Said Amirov. Dagestan's government was 
setting up refugee camps at resorts and summer camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagestan's government opposes the Wahhabis and has shown no sign  
of splitting from Moscow, largely because its weak economy is 
heavily dependent on federal funding.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NFL Player Back in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Carlton Haselrig, whose once-promising NFL  
career was cut short by substance abuse, was imprisoned on charges 
of creating a ruckus at a credit union and arguing with police. 
</P>
<P>
	Haselrig, who played for the Buffalo Destroyers of the Arena  
Football League this year, was arrested Monday at a magistrate's 
office in Johnstown and taken to the Cambria County Prison. He was 
at the office for a preliminary hearing on the misdemeanor 
disorderly conduct charges. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Delfon Chatman, 24, of Johnstown were accused of ignoring  
orders to stop arguing with police at the credit union on June 16. 
It was not immediately clear when the two men would have their next 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Haselrig played for the Pittsburgh Steelers and  
New York Jets and appeared to be on the verge of NFL stardom when 
his life began its downward spiral. In 1995, the NFL suspended him 
for violating its substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been through six stays in rehab centers and twice  
disappeared from NFL teams -- including in 1994 when he was found in 
a budget motel 20 minutes from Three Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1994, he was caught driving his sport utility  
vehicle down the concrete steps of a Pittsburgh seminary. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, his house was auctioned for back taxes; his wife sought a  
protection-from-abuse order; and Haselrig was shot in the leg by a 
man who claimed self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	He was jailed for nearly a year after a third drunken driving  
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Denbrock, who coaches offensive and defensive linemen for  
the Destroyers, said he was saddened to learn that Haselrig was 
back in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the bright spots in our season,'' Denbrock said.

<HEADLINE> Bank of America To Lend $3 billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Many of the nation's banks have had to be  
embarrassed by activists or coerced by federal regulators into 
complying with the Community Reinvestment Act, aimed at fighting 
discrimination by mortgage lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an unusual announcement, Bank of America has announced it  
voluntarily decided to fund an unprecedented $3 billion mortgage 
program for low- to moderate-income borrowers that promises no down 
payment, no application fee and no closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, announced Tuesday, is expected to assist about  
100,000 borrowers nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be overseen by Boston-based Neighborhood Assistance  
Corp. of America, led by self-described ``urban terrorist'' Bruce 
Marks. Marks has a track record of getting loan commitments from 
banks after accusing them of discriminatory lending practices, but 
he said the Bank of America agreement was voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	``As cynical as I am that all bankers are evil, this is the  
exception,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-income and first-time home buyers could begin accessing the  
program in about a dozen cities Tuesday. Neighborhood Assistance 
Corp. originates the loans, then helps the borrowers through the 
mortgage process and offers post-ownership assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an investment for the bank as well, said Robert Johnston,  
senior vice president for Bank of America's community development 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not charity,'' Johnston said. ``There are a lot of cash  
transactions in the inner city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, before NationsBank was acquired by Bank of America,  
NationsBank agreed to lend $500 million in mortgages over five 
years through Neighborhood Assistance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Garsson, spokesman for the federal Office of the  
Comptroller of the Currency, said the programs were examples of the 
Community Reinvestment Act at work. 
</P>
<P>
	The act, started by the Carter administration, directs banks to  
make investments to meet the credit needs of all the communities 
where they collect deposits, particularly in minority, poor and 
working-class neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America's home mortgage program started Tuesday in  
Atlanta, Baltimore, Buffalo, N.Y., Charlotte, Jacksonville, Fla., 
Los Angeles, Memphis, Tenn., Washington, D.C., Dallas-Fort Worth, 
Houston, Oakland, Calif., Sacramento, Calif., San Antonio and 
Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Within the next 12 months, the program will be made available in  
New York City, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Albuquerque, N. M., San Diego 
and Little Rock, Ark.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears Pharmaceutical Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union antitrust regulators  
have approved a merger between pharmaceutical firms Hoechst AG of 
Germany and Rhone-Poulenc SA of France after the companies agreed 
to divest certain businesses in which they might gain an unfairly 
dominant position. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies agreed to spin off activities in chemicals and  
animal health and to surrender licenses on a number of products 
where an overlap risked creating an anticompetitive advantage, the 
European Commission said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commitments submitted by the companies are able to remove  
the competition concerns generated by the operation,'' said a 
statement from the EU executive body. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc announced in December they would merge  
to create an international pharmaceutical giant named Aventis that 
will have annual sales of around $20 billion, spanning 
pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals and animal health products. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have agreed to spin off their industrial chemical  
subsidiaries and the animal health company Hoechst Roussel 
Veterinaer GmbH. Hoechst intends to demerge its industrial chemical 
assets into a new group called Celanese AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhone-Poulenc will also sell or share licenses for about half a  
dozen products where they risked gaining an unfairly dominant 
position, particularly in the French market. The products range 
from an antibiotic used to treat throat infections to insecticides 
to kill cockroaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders from the two companies approved the merger last  
month. The merger is set to be completed by November.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Umpires Withdraw Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The umpires' union withdrew its lawsuit against  
baseball Tuesday, leaving the National Labor Relations Board as the 
last hope for 22 umps who want their jobs back. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came just before the American and National leagues were  
to file a motion to dismiss the case. The leagues, claiming the 
suit was frivolous, had planned to ask for legal sanctions against 
the umpires' union and its lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires filed the case July 26 in federal court in Philadelphia,  
hoping to get a restraining order blocking baseball from accepting 
their resignations, effective Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of their claims appeared to be covered by either NLRB  
proceedings or the binding arbitration clause in their labor 
contract, and U.S. District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig denied the 
request for a restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
	After retaining outside labor lawyers, umpires filed an unfair  
labor practice charge last week against the AL and NL. The NLRB is 
not expected to rule on the case until next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that they've all rescinded, they don't need a declaratory  
judgment action on that issue,'' union head Richie Phillips said, 
explaining why the suit was withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires say they may file another suit in federal court next  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issues are far different today,'' Phillips said, ``and if  
we go back to Judge Ludwig, it will be with an action pertaining to 
the conduct of baseball in terminating the umpires -- not only their 
pervasive pattern of unfair labor practices leading up to July 14, 
but their discriminatory and arbitrary behavior in the 
terminations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires, fearful baseball would lock them out after their labor  
contract expires Dec. 31, announced July 14 that they would quit en 
masse to try to force an early start to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strategy backfired when 27 of the 68 umpires either  
refused to resign or withdrew their resignations. Baseball then 
hired 25 new umpires from the minors and accepted 22 resignations, 
effective Sept. 2.

<HEADLINE> Jon Kitna Is Seahawks' QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHENEY, Wash. (AP) -- Warren Moon and John Friesz are gone. All  
the pressure is on Jon Kitna now. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitna, who has six career starts in the NFL, will be the  
starting quarterback of the Seattle Seahawks this season under new 
coach Mike Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the quarterback of this team,'' Holmgren said Tuesday.  
``I'll put the pressure on him and he'll put a lot of pressure on 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren had Brett Favre at Green Bay and the quarterback led  
the Packers to two Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Kitna is no Favre, but he showed enough  
potential for Holmgren, who got the Seahawks' job in January, to 
release Moon and Friesz. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren traded for Glenn Foley and drafted Brock Huard from the  
University of Washington, but Kitna is Holmgren's top passer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing the right things and that's a huge step,'' Holmgren  
said after practice Tuesday morning at the Seahawks' training camp. 
``He's grasping the offense pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kitna should improve with experience. His confidence has grown  
with Holmgren, who has helped developed Favre, Steve Young, Mark 
Brunell, Ty Detmer and Doug Pederson into starting NFL 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kitna already disagrees with Holmgren on one topic.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you feel pressure,'' he said. ``I think pressure  
comes when you didn't prepare yourself. As long as you're prepared, 
I don't think you start feeling much pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson decided to get a good look  
at Kitna and started him the final five games last season. Seattle 
won three of the five and Kitna was named AFC Offensive Player of 
the Week after a 298-yard passing performance against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitna got a chance to play in the NFL because Erickson decided  
to go see his nephew play a game for Central Washington, then in 
the NAIA. Kitna caught his eye. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks signed Kitna as an undrafted free agent in April  
1996 and then sent him to play a season in Europe in the World 
League for Barcelona. Kitna became the MVP in the World Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he got to play in three games for the Seahawks,  
including one start. Last season, he passed for 1,177 yards with 
seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson got fired at the end of the Seahawks' disappointing 8-8  
season. In four years, he never got the team above a .500 record. 
But at least he left Holmgren with a promising young quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a totally new situation for me,'' Kitna said.  
``Hopefully, it'll (the coaching change) improve us a lot. 
Hopefully, it'll improve us three or four or five games so we can 
makes the playoffs.''

<HEADLINE> Rehnquist Lobbies Congress for Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proposed funding for federal courts is too low  
and if not increased will seriously hamper court operations, Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist is telling leaders of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to principal members of the House and Senate,  
Rehnquist portrayed the $4.1 billion sought for federal courts in 
fiscal year 2000 as a bare-bones request. He said levels initially 
approved are ``less than is required to furnish the services the 
judiciary provided this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted to cut $280 million from the federal  
judiciary's request for the fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1. The 
House version cut $180 million from the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of both houses will meet in conference after Labor Day  
to reconcile the differing proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, in a letter dated Aug. 9, called the Senate proposal  
``unjustified and impractical'' and said the House version ``also 
would have a noticeable adverse impact on court operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, the top-ranking federal judge, called the $4.1  
billion request ``a minimal budget proposal for salaries and 
expenses,'' one that for a second consecutive year would provide no 
additional court staff despite growing workloads. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, the courts do not control their workload but  
rather must respond to filings created in large part by Congress' 
expansion of the federal courts' jurisdiction,'' Rehnquist wrote. 
``I therefore urge you to provide the necessary funding for the 
judiciary for FY 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was sent to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, House Speaker Dennis Hastert and House 
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt. A copy was made public by the 
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, along with a list of 
possible ramifications under the heading ``catastrophic funding 
scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The list said the Senate funding bill would compromise public  
safety by requiring a cut in the number of officers supervising 
released felons, likely would require a 10-day furlough of all 
court employees except judges, would leave unfinanced ``critical 
court security enhancements'' and would provide enough money to pay 
court-appointed lawyers for only part of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In one respect, the House bill would be worse: it would reduce  
funding for court security systems by $6 million below the level 
proposed by the Senate, the chief justice said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Administrative Office release noted that the proposed $4.1  
billion federal court budget would amount to less than two-tenths 
of one percent of the total federal budget.

<HEADLINE> Court: Vets Not Assured Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A federal appeals court has dismissed a  
lawsuit by a veterans group that said the government broke its 
promise of lifetime health care benefits for those with 20 years of 
military service. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals dismissed the lawsuit Monday, saying  
retirees do not have the absolute right to medical and dental care, 
but they may be given the service subject to availability. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left with the Justice Department seeking comment was  
not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9,000-member Coalition of Retired Military Veterans can ask  
the Court of Appeals to reconsider, appeal to the Supreme Court or 
resubmit the lawsuit, said chairman Jim Gunn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not asking for anything except what we earned,'' Gunn  
said. ``We're not freeloaders. We just want what we were told we 
had when we signed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gunn, a 68-year-old Korean War veteran who won a Purple Heart,  
said numerous military and Coast Guard recruitment brochures 
promised lifetime health care and dental benefits to personnel who 
serve at least 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the promises were inducements to sign up.  
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, retirees have had their access to free care at  
military hospitals trimmed by budget cuts and base closings. 
Retirees are urged to join an HMO-like system with an annual 
premium. They drop out of the program once they reach 65 and are 
eligible for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	In siding with the Justice Department, the appeals court said  
military regulations never provided for unconditional lifetime free 
medical care or authorized recruiters to promise care as an 
inducement to joining or staying in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the decision to provide medical care to military  
retirees should be up to Congress and the president, not the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
	A district judge had dismissed the lawsuit in 1997.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Expects To Cut More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco PLC will cut 4,500 more jobs this year  
than originally planned, even though its second-quarter operating 
income rose by 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company laid off 12,500 people by the end of July and said  
it expects to trim its work force by an additional 2,000 by the end 
of the year, chief executive John Browne told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined reductions mark an increase from the company's  
original plan, outlined in February, to cut 10,000 jobs this year. 
The planned cuts would leave BP Amoco with 82,500 employees by the 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	A company official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
many of the remaining cuts would come in downstream operations like 
refining and chemicals, which have suffered pinched profit margins 
due to higher prices they must pay for oil. The official refused to 
name the countries where the remaining cuts would be made. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco also said today its operating profit rose to $1.23  
billion in the second quarter, compared to last year's level of 
$1.08 billion. Operating income in its line of business, 
exploration and production led the way, surging 54 percent over the 
year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, formed by British Petroleum PLC's purchase last  
year of Chicago-based Amoco Corp., has realized the financial 
benefits of its merger sooner than anticipated, chief executive 
John Browne said. It expects to save $2 billion per year as a 
result of the union. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco shares rose 1,234 pence ($19.74) in late trading, up  
0.9 percent from Monday's close.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Black Sports Execs Decried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The ``old-boy network'' still is exists in  
sports, National League president Len Coleman said Tuesday in 
explaining why blacks and Hispanics have not gained more management 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old-boy network has outlived its usefulness,'' said  
Coleman, the highest ranking black official of a major professional 
league. ``But it's still entrenched. And one of the cultural things 
we've got to break down ... is that old boy network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said there had been progress in baseball, though not  
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been 52 years since Jackie Robinson broke in in 1947, and  
we're on the edge of a new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``In baseball, have we made progress? The answer is yes. Have we  
made enough progress? The answer is an emphatic, `No.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Huyghue, senior vice president for football operations  
with the Jacksonville Jaguars, and Carl Poston, a Houston-based 
sports agent joined Coleman in a panel discussion at the National 
Urban League conference. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past decade, the number of front-office jobs in  
professional baseball held by minorities has risen from 2 percent 
to 21 percent, Coleman said. But he added that only one black -- Bob 
Watson of the New York Yankees -- has held the position of general 
manager. He no longer has that job. 
</P>
<P>
	Huyghue noted that while 70 percent of NFL players are  
minorities, there are no minority owners and only three black 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am optimistic that in years to come, as I look around the  
NFL meeting rooms I sit in, I won't be the only dark face in the 
room,'' Huyghue said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lauds Bicyclist Armstrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton offered the nation's  
congratulations Tuesday to Lance Armstrong, who recovered from 
cancer to win the grueling Tour de France, the world's most 
prestigious bicycle race. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong posed for photographs in the Oval Office with the  
president, then appeared with Vice President Al Gore in the 
Roosevelt Room in a ceremony to honor cancer survivors and call 
attention to successes of cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Armstrong dashed off autographs for a dozen or so  
bicycle messengers who clustered around the new bicycle hero as he 
arrived for a speech at the National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking questions in the club's crowded auditorium, Armstrong  
told an enthusiastic audience the hardest day physically on the 
tour was its first leg over the steep grades and sizzling heat of 
the Pyrenees Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentally, he said, the toughest 24 hours came when he was  
accused -- falsely, he insists -- of taking drugs to enhance his 
strength and endurance after his cancer battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said that after a lifetime of good health -- ``not even  
a broken bone'' -- and years of successful competition, his cancer 
became a supreme endurance test. His testicular cancer invaded his 
bones and brain and was fought with aggressive chemotherapy and 
three operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The attitude of a cancer survivor like himself, he said, is,  
``You've been to hell and back, and you want a vacation for the 
rest of your life. But nobody gives you that. You have to go on 
because you are living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said for him ``going on'' means continuing the work of  
building and expanding the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which he 
founded to promote cancer research and to help cancer victims and 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he intends to compete in the next Tour de France in 2001  
and will keep in training until then. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you show up at the Tour de France overweight or out of  
shape,'' he said, ``it doesn't make any difference (what kind of 
bike) you're riding -- you won't win.''

<HEADLINE> Lightning Kills College Pitcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOMASVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- A Valdosta State student was struck by  
lightning and killed while pitching a hometown baseball game 
Sunday, as his college teammates celebrated a victory in the 
National Baseball Congress World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Jackson, 22, was hit about 5 p.m. as he stood on the  
pitcher's mound at the Brookwood School in Thomasville, Thomas 
County Emergency Management Agency officials said. He died about an 
hour later at Archbold Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Jackson's college teammates learned of his death while  
celebrating an early victory in the National Baseball Congress 
World Series in Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander was 13-8 during his three seasons at Valdosta  
State, making nine starts in 1999 and posting a 7.05 ERA with 46 
strikeouts. He struck out 140 batters in 167 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	His death also affected New York Mets reliever Billy Taylor, who  
had tutored Jackson for 13 years. Taylor was unavailable for 
comment Monday night after the Dodgers defeated the Mets 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers cut short their celebration of the victory series  
after learning of Jackson's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson had been playing a men's over-40 summer baseball league  
in his hometown to regain arm strength after surgery earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ben was one of our best friends and we are all pretty  
distraught over here,'' teammate Jarrett Bridges told The Valdosta 
Daily Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridges said the players would most likely not be able to make  
it back from Kansas in time for Jackson's funeral Tuesday because 
of the long drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a tragedy,'' Valdosta State athletic director Herb  
Reinhard said. ``Ben was a tremendous example of what we want our 
student-athletes to be and a wonderful role model for young 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson had recently returned from a mission to Latin and South  
America as a member of Athletes in Action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ben was a shining star in every way. He was a solid standout  
majoring in business and an integral part of our baseball team,'' 
Valdosta State coach Tommy Thomas said. ``If you didn't like Ben 
Jackson, you had to find out what was wrong with you.''

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Leaf Hopes To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Although the medical prognosis suggests  
otherwise, injured quarterback Ryan Leaf said Tuesday he hopes to 
return to play for the San Diego Chargers by mid-season. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, the second overall pick in the 1998 draft, was back at the  
Chargers' UC San Diego training camp for a second day as he 
recovers from the shoulder injury that was expected to sideline him 
for perhaps the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope because I'm younger and maybe will heal a little  
faster, maybe by Week 8 or Week 9,'' Leaf, 23, said. ``There's a 
possibility that I can be back out there and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, who lost his starting job last season because of  
disappointing play, rejoined the Chargers on Monday without wearing 
the sling that had been necessary since he underwent surgery two 
weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	His return coincided with the club resuming practice following a  
week in Australia that culminated with a 20-17 loss to the Denver 
Broncos in the exhibition opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm going to play this year, it's important that I push,''  
Leaf said. ``But I don't want to push it too bad to the point that 
I hurt it again when I get back out there. It's important that we 
be aggressive but be smart with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As evidence of his rehabilitation, Leaf wore an ice pack on his  
right shoulder during Tuesday's lunch break. During practice, he 
was restricted to observing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out here for practice so that I can get all of the mental  
repetitions as well,'' Leaf said. ``The only thing that I won't get 
is physical reps but those will come in time. It's been tough 
sitting out. I had trouble watching the game, honestly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chargers coach Mike Riley praised Leaf for wanting to defy the  
medical predictions, which had said it would take him three to four 
months for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys need to have that kind of attitude going through rehab,''  
Riley said. ``There have been a lot of surprises in medical 
history, I think, of doctors thinking one thing and players coming 
back through hard work and doing things a little quicker. So it's 
great to have that spirit and attitude. It takes a lot of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf threw two touchdown passes and was intercepted 15 times  
last season in 10 games, nine starts, as the Chargers finished 5-11 
and in last place in the AFC West. Jim Harbaugh and Erik Kramer, 
both acquired during the offseason, played two series each at 
quarterback to open the game against the Broncos. Riley indicated 
both will likely go three series in Thursday's game at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy that the game's coming so soon,'' Harbaugh said.  
``For me, in particular, I only played two series the last game and 
didn't even get hit once. So it's nice to have a game so soon. I 
feel we still have a lot of learning and work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers had a ragged practice Tuesday, apparently dealing  
with the effects of jet lag from their long trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little sloppy,'' Harbaugh said. ``There were mental  
errors. But we can't use any excuses. I just know we have to come 
back with a better practice (Wednesday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The club placed guard Ben Bordelon (shoulder) and defensive end  
Israel Ifeanyichukwu (knee) on the reserve-injured list.

<HEADLINE> Starr To End Probe Before 2000 Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Independent counsel Kenneth Starr says he plans  
to wrap up his Whitewater investigation before the 2000 New York 
Senate election in which first lady Hillary Clinton is a likely 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to move forward very, very rapidly,'' Starr told  
reporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in Atlanta to give his annual review of Supreme Court  
decisions to members of the Institute for Judicial Administration, 
a group affiliated with New York University that promotes judicial 
education and research and predictability in the law's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr made clear that his final report, which would be turned in  
to the panel of federal appeals judges who appointed him in August 
1994, would not draw any conclusions about conduct and would simply 
lay out the evidence gathered by grand juries and his 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress did not want a final report to be an avenue for  
alleging that one or more individuals had engaged in criminal 
conduct,'' Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would anticipate that the final report will come at the  
earliest practicable moment. It would need to be a comprehensive 
final report that is factually straightforward, that does not 
engage in characterization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not give a possible date for the final report. But when  
asked whether he plans to finish before the 2000 election, Starr 
replied, ``The answer is yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton also was in Atlanta to address the American  
Bar Association, but his and Starr's appearances were separated by 
several blocks and several hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was careful to note for his fellow lawyers that his wife  
once headed the ABC's Commission on Women in the Legal Profession 
as well as the Legal Services Corp., a federally funded program 
providing legal aid to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	ABA President Phil Anderson is an old friend of Clinton's from  
Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I'm here is that I got beat for governor in 1980  
and I was the youngest former governor in the history of America,'' 
Clinton said. ``I had extremely limited career prospects and Phil 
Anderson was the only guy in Arkansas that offered me a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's either a great prognosticator or a good gambler,''  
Clinton added.

<HEADLINE> Robertson Derides Assassination Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Christian Coalition President Pat  
Robertson said assassinating rogue world leaders would be more 
practical than U.S. policy that bans such killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson made his comments Monday on the ``700 Club,'' a  
nationally syndicated television show on his Christian Broadcasting 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it sounds somewhat Machiavellian and evil,'' Robertson  
said. ``But isn't it better to do something like that, to take out 
(Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic, to take out (Iraqi 
President) Saddam Hussein, rather than to spend billions of dollars 
on a war that harms innocent civilians and destroys the 
infrastructure of a country?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which  
monitors the ``700 Club,'' disclosed the comments in a news release 
criticizing Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my Bible, Jesus never said anything about assassinating  
heads of state,'' said Barry Lynn, the group's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the CBN did not respond Tuesday to requests for  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Raptors Re-Sign Michael Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Raptors re-signed center Michael  
Stewart to a six-year, $24 million contract Tuesday, leaving the 
team with about $6 million in salary cap room to offer to Charles 
Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 Stewart joined the Raptors in January as a free  
agent after spending his rookie season in Sacramento. He averaged 
only 9.4 minutes per game with Toronto and scored just 61 points in 
42 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``After losing John Wallace to the Knicks, we had to step up to  
secure our talented young big players,'' Toronto general manager 
Glen Grunwald said. ``Michael is an important part of our team's 
young nucleus and strengthens our presence up front along with 
Kevin Willis and the addition of Antonio Davis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raptors have offered $6 million a year to Oakley, who was  
asking for $8 million. Toronto has been discussing numerous 
sign-and-trade deals involving Oakley, with the Los Angeles Lakers 
and Indiana Pacers believed to be the leading contenders to acquire 
the 35-year-old forward.

<HEADLINE> Chile Derides Spain on Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attempts by Spanish authorities to try former  
Chilean President Augusto Pinochet for alleged human rights 
violations amount to ``foreign intervention'' and cannot be 
accepted by Chile, Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel Valdes said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think that foreign intervention, even if it is well  
intentioned, will help solve the problem,'' Valdes told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes, here for consultations with U.S. officials, said Chile  
is very much in favor of an international judicial system that 
prosecutes crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we are not prepared to accept a decision by one court and  
one country by itself to take measures and pretend to subordinate 
our own courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested by British authorities last October on  
orders of Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon. Spanish efforts to 
extradite Pinochet are before the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes said the Spanish action ignores legal processes in Chile  
to deal with what he admitted was a difficult past. As an example, 
he noted that Pinochet is facing 28 cases in Chilean courts. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin expressed sympathy  
Monday for Chile as it attempts to cope with the problem 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is committed to the principles of  
accountability and justice, and to supporting Chile as it wrestles 
with the difficult problem of how to balance the need for justice 
with the requirement of reconciliation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes' meetings with U.S. officials were dominated by trade  
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking with reporters on Monday, Valdes said Chile is giving  
up on becoming a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
and is instead seeking a bilateral trade agreement with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``NAFTA is in the past,'' Valdes said after a meeting with  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mexico joined with the United States and Canada in 1994,  
an invitation was extended to Chile to become NAFTA's fourth 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan failed because of congressional opposition to creating  
new trade agreements or enlarging the scope of existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Influenced by labor union opposition, Congress has refused to  
grant President Clinton the ``fast track'' authority he needs to 
negotiate free trade agreements with Chile and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes said he informed Albright of Chile's decision to invite  
the United States to begin a review process ``leading to the 
initiation of a negotiation beyond the subject of fast track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the NAFTA option dead, Valdes said though a translator,  
``what interests us is a bilateral economic relationship between 
Chile and the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While spurned on its NAFTA bid, Chile has since become an  
associate member of Mercosur, a South American free trade grouping 
led by Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

	Gunman on Run After L.A. Shooting  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Police SWAT teams are surrounding a hotel  
Tuesday night where authorities found a car believed to have been 
carjacked by the suspect in a shooting at a Jewish community center 
that wounded five people. The motive of the gunman, described as a 
balding white man in his 40s, is unknown, police said. The most 
seriously injured in the shooting was a 5-year-old boy who was shot 
in the stomach and leg and lost 30 percent of his blood. He was in 
critical condition after six hours of surgery and his prognosis for 
recovery was fair, his surgeon said.

	Baby AIDS Cases Plummet With Drug  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The number of babies who got AIDS from their  
mothers dropped by two-thirds between 1992 and 1997, largely 
because of prenatal treatment with the drug AZT, a study has found. 
An expert not involved in the study said it suggests the 
possibility of virtually eliminating mother-to-child HIV 
transmission in the United States, an idea that was almost 
unimaginable a few years ago. The number of babies who developed 
AIDS after being infected with HIV before or during birth peaked at 
907 in 1992, then declined 67 percent over the next five years, to 
297 in 1997, the researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of the 
American Medical Association.

	250 Bodies Exhumed in Bosnia  
</P>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Forensic experts,  
reconstructing a 1995 massacre in the Bosnian enclave of 
Srebrenica, have finished exhuming about 250 bodies from a mass 
grave, U.N. officials said Tuesday. United Nations spokeswoman 
Kelly Moore said the bodies will be taken to a morgue, where they 
will be photographed, catalogued and analyzed. Srebrenica was a 
Muslim enclave in northeast Bosnia. The United Nations declared it 
a ``safe heaven'' but did nothing to prevent Bosnian Serb forces 
from overrunning it in July 1995. The enclave's brutal fall left 
over 7,000 Muslim men missing. The men are believed to have been 
systematically executed. So far, some 2,000 bodies have been found.

Ramnicu Valcea, a city of 100,000 about 100 miles northwest of 
Bucharest, the eclipse will be seen for two minutes and 23 seconds 
-- the longest anywhere on Earth. The eclipse will actually start in 
southern England at 11:10 a.m. (6:10 a.m. EDT). The moon's shadow 
will then sweep eastward across northern France, Germany, Austria 
and Yugoslavia and Hungary before reaching Romania. Bulgaria is 
next followed by Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and India before 
dying in the Bay of Bengal.

baseball Tuesday, leaving the National Labor Relations Board as the 
last hope for 22 umps who want their jobs back. The move came just 
before the American and National leagues were to file a motion to 
dismiss the case. The leagues, claiming the suit was frivolous, had 
planned to ask for legal sanctions against the umpires' union and 
its lawyers. Umpires filed the case July 26 in federal court in 
Philadelphia, hoping to get a restraining order blocking baseball 
from accepting their resignations, effective Sept. 2.

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Anderson Hit by Line Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Brian Anderson left  
Tuesday's game against the Chicago Cubs in the second inning when 
he was hit in the left arm by a line drive off the bat of Henry 
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson had little time to react to the hard-hit ball, which  
appeared to strike him on the left arm above the elbow. His glove 
fell off and Anderson never tried for the ball, which landed near 
the mound, but instead held his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who was relieved by Erik Sabel, allowed one run and  
three hits in one-plus innings. It was his 14 start and 22nd 
appearance this year.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Hire Berry As Asst. Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Bill Berry, an assistant coach with the Houston  
Rockets during their two NBA championships, was hired Tuesday for 
the same position with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, 57, fills one of the positions opened when assistant  
coaches Tex Winter and Frank Hamblen followed former Bulls coach 
Phil Jackson to the Los Angeles Lakers over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls spokesman Tim Hallam said the team has no immediate plans  
to hire a second assistant coach. He declined to release the terms 
of Berry's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very happy to be able to get an outstanding, experienced  
coach with a tremendous basketball mind in Bill Berry,'' Bulls 
coach Tim Floyd said Tuesday. ``He has all the qualities we've been 
looking for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before his eight seasons with the Rockets, Berry was an  
assistant coach and scout for the Sacramento Kings from 1989-91. 
His college coaching experience includes 10 years as head coach at 
San Jose State, two years as an assistant at Michigan State and 
five as an assistant at California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel this organization is headed in the right direction,''  
Berry said. ``They have a plan, a purpose, and I'm excited to be 
teaming up with an already excellent coaching staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's late son Ricky played for his father at San Jose State  
and later with the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls won the the NBA championship six times in the 1990s  
but slipped near the bottom of the league when Jackson quit, 
Michael Jordan retired and Scottie Pippen was traded. Role players 
such as Dennis Rodman, Luc Longley and Steve Kerr also left. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who signed with the in June, was replaced by Floyd.

<HEADLINE> Woods Searching for Second Major  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- When Tigermania reached its height, Tiger  
Woods could make news with the color of shirt he wore. 
</P>
<P>
	His clothes, his shoes, the head cover for his driver, even his  
caddie -- no bit of information on sports' latest obsession was too 
trivial. His days of heading to a local course for a quick round 
were over, unless that course had tight security. Forget about 
trying to go out for dinner or a show. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a lot to handle, especially for a kid who wasn't even 21.  
</P>
<P>
	``Stanford, even with all of its wonderful classes, didn't have  
this kind of media class being offered,'' he said, looking around 
at a crowd of reporters. ``I had to learn on the go, on the fly. 
And I've made my share of mistakes, but I also did the right 
things, too. I learned from both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which is why Woods doesn't get annoyed when he's asked yet again  
about winning his second major. When he blew through Augusta in 
1997, winning the Masters by 12 strokes, it seemed like it would be 
a matter of months before he won another major. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it's been almost 2 1/2 years. Ten majors have come and  
gone without his name being engraved on another trophy. This week's 
81st PGA Championship at Medinah Country Club is chance No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can do is keep giving myself chances and I've come close  
a couple of times this year,'' said Woods, who had an outside shot 
at the Masters entering the final round, tied for third in the U.S. 
Open and tied for seventh in the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't win every time you're in the hunt. You'd like to,  
but it just doesn't happen that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's still searching for his second major, Woods' game  
has never been better. No, not even in 1997. Since tying for 
seventh in the Byron Nelson in May, he's won three tournaments, 
including a European PGA event. 
</P>
<P>
	His victory in the Western Open last month was his third in four  
tournaments. He leads the PGA in top-three finishes this year with 
six. He dropped to No. 2 in the world this week only because of a 
quirk in the way the rankings are figured. 
</P>
<P>
	Even last year, when he struggled to adjust to changes he made  
in his swing, he held the No. 1 ranking and led the tour with 13 
top-10 finishes despite winning ``only'' one PGA Tour event. 
</P>
<P>
	``My game has improved so much,'' he said. ``Every shot in my  
bag has gotten better, and that's just because of maturity and more 
experience and a lot more practice. Hopefully two, five, 10 years 
down the road from now, I can say I'm a better player than I am 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asking Woods if he can top Jack Nicklaus, who won 18 majors,  
isn't fair, Greg Norman said. The competition when Nicklaus played 
wasn't as deep as it now, when an unknown like Paul Lawrie can win 
the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in the sport wasn't as intense in Nicklaus' prime,  
either. Sure, he drew crowds, but not like the thousands who broke 
through the security ropes to follow Woods up the 18th fairway at 
the 1997 Motorola. Reporters from all over the world didn't cover 
the tournaments he played. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy for us to sit here and say, `Yeah, it's just another  
golf tournament.' You can wrap yourself in a cocoon and say, `I'm 
not going to read the paper.' But it builds up,'' Norman said. 
``Any young individual coming out nowadays has to be an extremely, 
extremely talented individual and have the ability to deal with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods readily admits he wasn't always able to do that. There  
really wasn't anyone on the tour he could ask for advice, either, 
because other golfers couldn't understand what he experienced in 
1997. Few athletes could. 
</P>
<P>
	The only person who'd gone through anything similar was Michael  
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He helped me a lot in '97. He'd had his own run-ins with the  
media and the fans and learned from his mistakes, and he was able 
to share those mistakes with me,'' he said. ``It's nice to have a 
sounding board like that.''

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Limits Pepper Spray Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Eight Coast Guardsmen who used pepper spray and  
water hoses on Cuban refugees trying to swim to shore were cleared, 
and the Guard has revised its policy on such methods, Rear Admiral 
Thad Allen said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	No disciplinary action will be taken against the eight Guardsmen  
involved in the June 29 incident. The eight, who had been 
temporarily removed from law enforcement duty, will be reinstated, 
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of pepper spray and fire hoses on the Cuban refugees was  
inappropriate, but Coast Guardsmen were not at fault and acted 
under a flawed policy, Allen said, announcing the results of a 
monthlong investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current immigration policy, foreigners who reach U.S.  
shores are allowed to seek asylum, but those intercepted at sea are 
returned to their homeland or another country. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of pepper spray will now be restricted to when there is a  
clear threat to the safety of officers or the refugees. Guardsmen 
also will not be allowed to use water hoses directly against 
people, but may still use them to disable engines, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Live television broadcasts of the confrontation between Coast  
Guardsmen and six Cubans trying to make it to land in Surfside 
prompted widespread protests by Cuban Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation determined that the Cubans repeatedly  
threatened Coast Guard personnel and threatened to harm or kill 
themselves. Those threats were not visible or audible on media 
coverage, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	News footage showed Guardsmen blasting the refugees with a hose  
as they stood in their 14-foot rowboat about 150 yards from shore. 
Several Guardsmen swarmed them as they jumped overboard and swam 
toward land. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the swimmers was doused with pepper spray. Two reached  
the beach and four were plucked from the water and detained aboard 
a Coast Guard cutter. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for a prominent Cuban exile group expressed  
disappointment with the Coast Guard report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that any of us who saw the incident on TV could  
have seen that whatever they (Cubans) were doing posed a threat to 
the Coast Guard,'' said Ninoska Perez of the Miami-based Cuban 
American National Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Plans Low Emissions Sedan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Nissan North America Inc. said Tuesday that it is  
seeking final approval for a gasoline-powered 2000-model vehicle 
that meets California's super ultra low emission rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle has a 1.8 liter engine and is a version of the new  
Sentra compact sedan, Nissan said. The automaker said it will be 
unveiled at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The low-pollution Sentra is expected to emit about 25 percent of  
the unburned hydrocarbons and 10 percent of the nitrogen oxides of 
the cleanest gasoline-powered car now sold in California, Nissan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan also said the new vehicle will eliminate all emissions  
from evaporation of raw hydrocarbon gasoline vapors from the fuel 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``A person will be able to drive this new 2000 model Sentra with  
the 1.8 liter engine 10 miles to work, return home and have the 
vehicle emit less than a typical new car parked in a driveway all 
day with its engine shut off,'' said Robert Strassburger, Nissan 
North America's director for government and technical affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Production is set to begin in February, Nissan said.  
</P>
<P>
	The company said full details about the engine technology would  
be released once the California Air Resources Board gives it final 
certification.

<HEADLINE> Competition Fierce for Favre Backup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- If Brett Favre starts the Green Bay  
Packers' first eight games this season, he will pass Ron Jaworski 
and become the most durable quarterback in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre has started 109 straight games, a streak that doesn't even  
include 14 straight playoff starts. His backup last season, Doug 
Pederson, threw 24 passes all year and went to Philadelphia as a 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Being Favre's backup during the 1990s has been one of the most  
pressure-free jobs in football, but the three quarterbacks 
competing for two spots on the Packers' roster want the chance 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just an honor to work behind one of the greatest that's  
ever played the game,'' said Matt Hasselbeck, who spent last year 
on the Packers' practice squad and turned down a chance to sign 
with Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran Rick Mirer and rookie Aaron Brooks are the other  
competitors for the jobs. The Packers stand a good chance of losing 
one of the three, but offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis said both 
backup spots are wide open as the team enters its exhibition 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each one of those guys has pluses and minuses, but all three  
are more than qualified to make this team,'' Lewis said. ``It's not 
going to be an easy decision, but it's going to be decided in our 
preseason games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer is the only candidate with NFL experience. The former  
Seattle and Chicago underachiever signed with Green Bay near the 
end of last season's training camp and spent the year as the 
Packers' No. 3 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's finally hit a level of comfort where he's able to go out  
and play and not think as much,'' quarterbacks coach Mike McCarthy 
said. ``This is his first full year in the offense, so he's had a 
chance to really learn it and apply it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer looked solid in the Packers' intrasquad scrimmage last  
Saturday, completing 8-of-11 passes for 81 yards, but he has 
struggled at times during training camp drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting there with the offense, and I think my  
conditioning is good,'' said Mirer, who didn't play a down last 
year. ``This is a great situation for quarterbacks with a guy like 
Sherm calling the plays. I just want to be a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Mirer has the best credentials of the three, he also makes  
more money than Brooks and Hasselbeck, and Mirer's contract calls 
for a sharp increase in pay next season. With Favre still in the 
prime of his career, Mirer is unlikely to be in Green Bay beyond 
this season and could be valuable trade bait. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why the Packers would like to hang on to both Hasselbeck  
and Brooks. Lewis and McCarthy feel that both have the potential to 
be starters in the league with the right seasoning and coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback most certain to make the roster is Brooks, the  
Packers' fourth-round draft pick who was a two-year starter at 
Virginia. With his cannon of an arm and underrated field smarts, 
Green Bay's coaches have been amazed by their good fortune in 
selecting him. 
</P>
<P>
	He has even been compared to Don Majkowski, who came to the  
Packers from Virginia and impressed coaches immediately -- just like 
Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis smiled when asked to compare Brooks with the five  
quarterbacks selected during the first 12 picks of the last draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be better than a couple of those guys,'' said Lewis,  
who helped turn late draft picks Mark Brunell and Ty Detmer into 
quality quarterbacks. ``There's going to be some Hall-of-Famers in 
that group. ... but Aaron's going to be better. He's that good. 
He's going to have a great career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The longest shot in the group is Hasselbeck, a Boston College  
star who spent last season learning the Packers' offense on the 
practice squad. He has shown promise during training camp, and 
completed both passes he threw in the intrasquad scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark has really learned how to direct the team, and that's a  
great thing to see in a young quarterback,'' Lewis said. ``He looks 
very confident out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ideally, the Packers would like to make Mirer the main backup  
and put either Brooks or Hasselbeck on the practice squad. But both 
young quarterbacks have been so impressive that other teams would 
almost certainly pick up one of them with an offer of a full-time 
roster spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers are particularly concerned about losing the  
potential of Brooks, which means they may ask Hasselbeck to spend 
another year inactive. When asked if he would be open to that 
strategy, Hasselbeck was noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think I have a really good shot to make this team,''  
he said. ``I had an opportunity to leave last year (when the Bears 
offered him their No. 3 roster spot), but I wanted to be here, and 
the team wanted me here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auditions for the jobs begin Saturday, when the Packers play  
host to the New York Jets. Coach Ray Rhodes said Favre will start 
the game but play only briefly, and all three potential backups 
will get ample opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of curious to see what happens myself,'' Rhodes said.

<HEADLINE> Browns Consider Starting QB Couch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- After just one performance to rave national  
reviews, the Tim Couch Show may be ready to open in Cleveland for 
an extended run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns wanted to bring their prized rookie quarterback along  
slowly in his first NFL season, allowing Couch to develop behind 
starter Ty Detmer before making him the No. 1 QB. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was their future, the Browns insisted.  
</P>
<P>
	But following Couch's stellar debut Monday night as the Browns  
returned to the NFL with a 20-17 overtime exhibition victory over 
Dallas, that future could be in two hours, two days or two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there is a hype,'' said Browns coach Chris Palmer,  
who indicated Couch's ascension could be closer than anyone, 
including Palmer, anticipated. ``To say it's going to happen at the 
end of training camp, I don't know whether I could say that. It 
could happen two weeks from now or it could happen at the end of 
the season. I will say this, I'm very pleased with what he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first pro game, Couch showed why the Browns drafted him  
No. 1 overall and gave him a seven-year, $59 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing Detmer early in the second quarter, Couch threw an  
incomplete pass on his first attempt before connecting on 10 
straight passes -- one a 24-yard TD to rookie wideout Kevin Johnson, 
a combination Cleveland fans hope to see hook up many times in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he was finished, Couch had completed 11 of 17 passes  
for 137 yards with one interception, rushed twice for 14 yards and 
convinced millions of TV viewers they were watching something 
special. 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, some of Couch's work came against Dallas' second- and  
third-unit defenses. But he showed poise in the pocket, took a 
couple of big hits and showed quickness escaping pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the knocks on Couch, who skipped his senior season at  
Kentucky, was a lack of speed. The other was arm strength, but with 
a few deep balls, Couch showed he has all the arm he needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer didn't get to bed following his first NFL game as a coach  
until after 3 a.m. He was up again at 5, but before leaving for 
work, he caught a graphic on ESPN which showed how Couch fared in 
his first game compared to Jeff George, Drew Bledsoe and Peyton 
Manning -- other No. 1 picks -- in their pro debuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were not as good as his,'' Palmer said of Couch. ``But  
it's just part of the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer began noticing a big difference in Couch last week during  
training camp. He saw a more polished player, one becoming 
comfortable with the pro offense and more confident in his ability 
as a passer and leader. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, Palmer said Couch's teammates picked up on the  
same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one of the things that Tim did last night was that  
other players took notice,'' Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer was particularly impressed with Couch's ability to run  
the offense no matter the line of scrimmage or down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased with the way Couch managed the game,'' Palmer  
said. ``I expected Ty to get us in to the right situations. I 
didn't know if Tim, under the lights, would be able to do that. He 
took a timeout and didn't let the clock run out. That shows 
tremendous awareness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer doesn't want a quarterback controversy to hinder the  
Browns this season. He says when the moment comes that Couch is 
ready to become an NFL starter, it will be evident to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media is trying to set a date,'' he said. ``Generally, our  
feeling was if we had him up and running by the middle of the 
season, management and everybody involved with the program would be 
very happy. But I'm not sure he isn't on a faster track than 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Infamous Nevada Brothel Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSTANG, Nev. (AP) -- The government took charge and the working  
girls took off, some of them leaving the Mustang Ranch in BMWs and 
Cadillacs. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than two decades of trying to padlock the infamous  
brothel, the government seized it Monday, ending one of the more 
colorful -- and criminal -- chapters of Nevada history. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid a crush of curious onlookers, the cooks, custodians,  
cashiers and prostitutes left the pink stucco ranch with their 
boxes, suitcases and bouquets of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see why it closed. It's not necessary. It's  
ridiculous,'' said a prostitute who identified herself only as 
Dawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The property was handed over at 5 p.m., but the corporation that  
owns the brothel ceased business at 10:30 a.m. after the last bank 
deposit, said U.S. Customs Agent Ron Meseberg. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't say how much business the brothel did over the  
weekend, but added, ``They did quite well in the last week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 104-room bordello, located on a sprawling 440-acre ranch  
just east of Reno, first made headlines in 1955, when it was opened 
by Joe Conforte during a time when prostitution was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971, the Mustang Ranch became the state's first legal  
brothel and led to the movement that resulted in legalized 
prostitution in 12 of Nevada's 17 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government long has contended that Conforte paid off  
local officials and skirted taxes. Guilty verdicts against the 
brothel's parent companies and manager in a federal fraud and 
racketeering trial last month ended the government's crusade to 
close it. 
</P>
<P>
	James Collie, chief Internal Revenue Service investigator for  
the southwestern United States, said the government intended to 
keep it closed until a court determines if there are valid claims 
against the property. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no intention of the government to operate it as a  
brothel,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conforte declared bankruptcy in 1990, and the IRS auctioned the  
ranch off to recover some of the $13 million in back taxes it said 
he owed. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Perry, the only bidder, bought it for $1.49 million on  
behalf of Mustang Properties Inc., and the bordello reopened in 
1992. Conforte was on the lam from tax authorities at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contended at trial that Mustang Properties was  
simply a front set up by Conforte to continue profiting from the $5 
million-a-year brothel. Witnessed testified that he remained on 
retainer as a $10,000-a-month consultant and that 10 times that 
amount was siphoned from the brothel to South America, where 
Conforte is believed to be living. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Monday's spectators was Mike Avent from Baltimore, who  
stopped by with his wife after a family reunion to see the ``death 
of the Mustang Ranch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad it's going away,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Hof expects the closing of Nevada's best-known brothel to  
boost business at his Moonlight Bunnyranch, a 15-minute drive from 
the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to take over where the Mustang left off, except in  
a classy manner,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One prostitute at the Moonlight Bunnyranch, who formerly worked  
at the Mustang, said she can't imagine what her former coworkers 
are going to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd probably just go be a waitress somewhere,'' said the  
woman, who gave her name as Jesi. ``I wouldn't go work at any other 
house. Been there and done that.''

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Expects To Cut More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco PLC will cut 4,500 more jobs this year  
than originally planned, even though its second-quarter operating 
income rose by 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company laid off 12,500 people by the end of July and said  
it expects to trim its work force by an additional 2,000 by the end 
of the year, chief executive John Browne told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined reductions mark an increase from the company's  
original plan, outlined in February, to cut 10,000 jobs this year. 
The planned cuts would leave BP Amoco with 82,500 employees by the 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	A company official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
many of the remaining cuts would come in downstream operations like 
refining and chemicals, which have suffered pinched profit margins 
due to higher prices they must pay for oil. The official refused to 
name the countries where the remaining cuts would be made. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco also said today its operating profit rose to $1.23  
billion in the second quarter, compared to last year's level of 
$1.08 billion. Operating income in its line of business, 
exploration and production led the way, surging 54 percent over the 
year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, formed by British Petroleum PLC's purchase last  
year of Chicago-based Amoco Corp., has realized the financial 
benefits of its merger sooner than anticipated, chief executive 
John Browne said. It expects to save $2 billion per year as a 
result of the union. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco shares rose 1,234 pence ($19.74) in late trading, up  
0.9 percent from Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvement in the company's upstream sector stemmed largely  
from higher oil prices, which boosted profits. Average oil prices 
during the three months ending June 30 were $14.49 per barrel, 
against $12.13 during the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco is currently in the process of absorbing Atlantic  
Richfield Corp. and is expected to approve the takeover in 
September.

<HEADLINE> Dell, Motorola Embrace Linux System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dell Computers and Motorola Inc. on Monday joined a growing list  
of companies moving to embrace the Linux computer operating system, 
upping the ante in a challenge to Microsoft's dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell said it plans in the next few months to offer clients  
buying its popular Dimension desktop PCs and Inspiron notebook 
computer line the option of choosing the Linux operating system 
over Windows 95, 98 or NT. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola's Computer Group announced it will work with  
Linux-based platforms to develop an array of products embedded in 
smaller computing devices such as the Palm personal digital 
assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves represent the first significant show of faith in Linux  
from vendors who serve the consumer market, said Amy Wohl, an 
independent consultant with Wohl &AMP; Associates, which tracks the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly ups the ante,'' Wohl said. ``It's a sign that  
mainstream vendors think there is a market for Linux. They don't do 
this for fun, they do this because they have customers saying 'We 
would buy this if you have it,' which makes for a greater challenge 
against Windows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements came as the second-ever LinuxWorld conference  
opened in San Jose, Calif., drawing dozens of vendors who were 
expected to throw their support toward the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Users praise the system's flexibility and propensity not to  
crash. But it often requires people to memorize and type in 
commands, similar to the DOS software that preceded Windows -- 
daunting to everyday users. And the number of Linux-compatible 
software applications, while growing, pales against the number of 
applications available for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Linux is emerging as a threat to Microsoft in the  
lucrative consumer marketplace and has attracted such investors as 
Intel Corp., the biggest computer chip-maker, because it is free 
and is based on a so-called open-source platform that allows anyone 
to work to improve the software code. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux's basic operating system also is much smaller than Windows  
NT and other Unix competitors. That is attractive because it means 
there is less of a power drain on smaller computing devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it remains unclear just how much consumers might be  
willing to embrace alternatives to Windows, particularly with PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell spokesman Tad Druart said customers who buy high-end  
systems have expressed interest in buying computers with Linux 
operating systems, driving the company's decision to offer the 
option. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that we expect to make this widely available to the  
masses,'' Druart said from Dell's Round Rock, Texas, headquarters. 
``It's for those customers who have an interest in using Linux and 
want to do so on a Dell Dimension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat Inc. -- a fast-growing seller of Linux software -- this  
week is expected to offer its shares to the public. Analysts say 
the interest will be another test of Linux's staying power.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Calif. Man Kills 4, Kidnaps Ex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMEAD, Calif. (AP) -- A woman was found alive today after  
being kidnapped from a house where four people were killed and two 
others were wounded, allegedly by the woman's ex-boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-boyfriend apparently was upset at the failure of their  
relationship, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old woman was found early today after being  
released, and she was taken to a hospital for examination, Los 
Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Margarita Velazquez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were still looking for Evelio Rivera Zacarias, 42,  
who had fled with the woman Monday in a pickup, Deputy Carrie 
Stuart said 
</P>
<P>
	Officials did not immediately say how or where the woman was  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting happened about 8:30 p.m. Monday in a home in  
Rosemead, northeast of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard multiple gunshots, about four, and then two minutes  
later another four or five more,'' said David Miranda, who lives 
next door. ``It was not a drive-by. Someone was emptying their 
gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the victims' names were released but the woman's current  
boyfriend was among the dead, Stuart said. A woman and a boy were 
taken to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center but their conditions 
were not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera's ex-girlfriend and her current boyfriend were visiting  
the current boyfriend's relatives when Rivera showed up, Stuart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspect ... walked inside and began shooting just pretty  
much randomly,'' Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera and the woman had two children together but broke up two  
years ago, Stuart said. It was unclear if the children were among 
the victims.

<HEADLINE> Former Football Star Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Former Southern Mississippi football  
player Chris Buckhalter was sentenced to 20 years in prison after 
pleading guilty to a reduced charge of manslaughter in a 1997 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckhalter, 26, avoided a possible death penalty with his plea  
before the start of his capital murder trial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckhalter and three others were accused in the April 24, 1997,  
killing of Jason ``Puddin'' Langley, 22, and the shooting of 
Leonard McInnis at a Jackson apartment complex. McInnis was shot 
several times in the chest but recovered from the wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckhalter, a four-year letterman at Southern Miss from 1992-95,  
surrendered in January 1998 after eluding authorities for nine 
months. He pleaded innocent last year but told Circuit Judge L. 
Breland Hilburn he was changing his plea in his own best interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were dealing with a capital murder charge, and you know  
what that can yield,'' Buckhalter's lawyer, Johnnie Walls Jr., 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to manslaughter, Buckhalter pleaded guilty to one  
count of aggravated assault. A 20-year sentence on that charge will 
run concurrent with the manslaughter penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant district attorney Bobby DeLaughter said the Langley  
family agreed to the plea. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the other three suspects, Anthony Sanders, accidentally  
shot himself to death while fleeing police in 1997. The other two 
unnamed suspects remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his success on the field, Buckhalter had a troubled  
career at Southern Miss in Hattiesburg. He later was on the 
Philadelphia Eagles practice squad from 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	On the field for Southern Miss, Buckhalter had 1,533 career  
rushing yards, and led the Eagles in rushing in both 1994 and 1995. 
But in the 1999 Southern Miss football media guide released earlier 
this month, references to Buckhalter and those accomplishments were 
erased. 
</P>
<P>
	His name was even removed from the list of lettermen in the 1999  
edition of the media guide. Buckhalter's name had appeared in the 
1998 book and those before it. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckhalter was dismissed from the team and suspended from the  
university in spring 1993 after being charged with aggravated 
assault. The arrest stemmed from a fight during a dance on the 
campus. He spent five days in jail, and later was reinstated to the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckhalter was arrested on felony marijuana and cocaine  
possession charges in July 1995. Both charges were dropped, but he 
was still suspended from the team for two games. Even after missing 
the first two games, he was the team's leading rusher for the 
second straight season.

<HEADLINE>  Five Shot at L.A. Jewish Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man with a high-powered gun burst into a  
Jewish community center Tuesday and sprayed the lobby with 20 to 30 
shots, wounding five people, including three boys attending day 
camp, and then walked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Police failed to find the suspect -- a balding white man about 40  
years old -- in a street-by-street search near the center, but late 
in the day officers found a green Toyota Corolla taken in a nearby 
carjacking that was under investigation for a possible connection. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive for the attack was not known. ``Every possibility,  
including if it's a hate crime, we'll look into it,'' said Officer 
Guillermo Campos. 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously injured was a 5-year-old boy who was shot in  
the stomach and leg and underwent surgery. He was in critical but 
stable condition. Two 6-year-old boys, a 16-year-old girl and a 
68-year-old woman who worked at the center were in stable 
condition, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity said the injured  
woman, a receptionist, burst into her room with a wounded arm. The 
teacher said she gathered up her students, who joined hands and 
evacuated from the building. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence was the latest in a series of shootings at  
workplaces and schools, and as the search for the gunman continued, 
President Clinton and others spoke out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by  
gun violence,'' Clinton said in Washington. ``It calls on all of us 
not only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their 
families, but intensify our resolve to make America a safer 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis said he was forming a task force of state  
agencies to advise churches, child care centers and other 
operations that care for children on how to upgrade their security 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen children were in the center when the gunman  
burst into the North Valley Jewish Community Center and began 
spraying the lobby with bullets about 10:50 a.m., said Capt. Steve 
Ruda of the Los Angeles Fire Department. He fired up to 30 shots 
before walking down a hallway and out of the building, Ruda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruda said he believed the shooter used a 9mm Uzi. Police Chief  
Bernard Parks however, would only identify the gun as a 
high-powered weapon with a large magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing said by the suspect before the shooting,''  
Parks said. ``It was indiscriminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the shooting, officers raced to a spot nearby  
where a woman reported that a man resembling the suspect's 
description carjacked her Toyota, leaving a red-and-white van 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers searched the van, which had Washington state plates,  
and found a large amount of ammunition, bulletproof vests and 
devices that may be smoke grenades, but no weapons, said police 
Cmdr. Dave Kalish. Contents of the van included metal boxes packed 
with ammunition, magazines for an assault rifle, a booklet titled 
Ranger Handbook and freeze-dried food. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalish said it wasn't certain the carjacker and gunman were the  
same person. When officers found the Toyota in a hotel parking lot 
a few miles from the community, a SWAT team was summoned to the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	The van was bought Saturday from the Tacoma (Wash.) Kar Korner,  
said the manager of the lot, who refused to be identified. He said 
police had ordered him not to give out any information on the 
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	While SWAT teams were swarming around the community center and  
news and police helicopters buzzed overhead, about 20 small 
children were led unhurt from the building hand in hand and taken 
to a Jewish temple nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents rushed to the center and jammed against police lines  
trying to find out if their children were all right. Some parents 
wept and hugged one another. One man was handcuffed by officers 
after slipping under yellow police tape, but he was later released. 
Authorities used a fire department loudspeaker to announce the 
whereabouts of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to cry when I saw him,'' said Karen Macofsky, who was  
reunited with her 11-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. ``But I 
held back and just hugged him tightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Macalas prayed and recited psalms as he rushed to check  
on his children, ages 2 and 3. ``My feeling about it is it's 
another case of someone acting out in rage,'' he said. ``I don't 
want to believe this is an act of anti-Semitism here in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were searching for the gunman throughout the  
neighborhood of mostly single-family homes in the San Fernando 
Valley suburbs 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said  
about 20 older children from the Jewish center were touring the 
Wiesenthal center's Museum of Tolerance at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic that the 20 children were here learning about  
man's inhumanity to man, when their own day camp became a target of 
such hatred,'' Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program director at the North Valley center told Hier that  
most of the children had been playing outside when the gunman 
stormed in, Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The community center provides nursery programs, child care and  
camp activities. It has a large main building, a smaller houselike 
structure, a pool and tennis courts.

<HEADLINE> Voters May Decide Internet Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A group led by a Boston venture capitalist has  
proposed a November 2000 ballot question that puts Massachusetts in 
the forefront of a national debate over who gets access to 
high-speed Internet networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The question, if passed, would force cable companies to open  
their high-speed Internet access systems to competitors, including 
Internet service providers such as America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies, led by MediaOne Group Inc., which AT&AMP;T has  
purchased, have so far refused to provide that access. They say 
they've spent billions of dollars on fiberoptics networks and 
should decide who uses them. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Christopher Grace, a former official with the Boston  
Redevelopment Authority, believes the government should give 
Internet providers access to the faster systems so they can compete 
with the cable services. The Internet providers argue cable 
companies should be treated like telephone companies and be 
required to open their networks to local competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable company systems are up to 50 times faster than the  
standard telephone lines used by most Internet providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Florida and Oregon have already mandated cable  
companies to provide ``open access,'' and have been challenged in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The question will be put to Massachusetts voters if Attorney  
General Thomas Reilly decides the state constitution allows voters 
to decide the issue. Then, Grace and his supporters would have to 
collect 57,100 signatures to forward the question to the 
Legislature. If the Legislature fails to pass the measure, they 
will have to collect another 9,517 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace, who has sold a business to America Online, said the  
company is not behind his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are trying to do is open up the service piece so  
innovation can flourish, so there is competition for customers and 
service and price competition as well,'' Grace told The Boston 
Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Wolf, a Washington attorney who leads a group called  
Hands Off The Internet, whose membership includes AT&AMP;T, said 
companies lobbying for ``open access'' are ``just trying to 
free-ride on the infrastructure that was paid for by others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that people who subscribe to Internet cable services  
can switch to Internet providers like America Online whenever they 
want. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Morris, a vice president for government affairs at AT&AMP;T,  
told the Boston Herald he doubts the state will decide the open 
access question because it's ultimately a federal issue.

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury Investigating Lockheed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal grand jury is investigating  
possible sales kickbacks by a unit of aerospace giant Lockheed 
Martin Corp., the company told federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  
Lockheed said it received a federal subpoena on July 15 seeking 
documents relating to the 1990 sales of radar systems by its New 
Hampshire-based Sanders unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia Beaman and Lockheed refused to  
elaborate on the disclosure Monday. But the Los Angeles Times, 
quoting an anonymous source, reported today that the grand jury is 
seeking information involving sales that may have begun before 
Lockheed purchased Sanders in 1986 and continued long past 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal, which also reported the probe, said  
investigators are focused on the Lockheed unit's efforts to land 
military contracts from Taiwan. It involves alleged improper 
payments to consultant Richard Hei, who was accused of receiving 
millions of dollars in illegal commissions from two other large 
U.S. contractors, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Whitney, spokesman for Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed Martin,  
said company officials ``do not believe we have violated any laws 
or regulations and we continue to cooperate fully with the U.S. 
Attorney's office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hei was a consultant with ties to Taiwan's military and  
government officials and he also worked for units of Litton and 
former Teledyne Inc. Those companies previously pleaded guilty to 
criminal charges stemming from improper payments to Hei and 
admitted trying to hide the payments from federal auditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Journal sources said the current federal grand jury probe of the  
Lockheed unit is an offshoot of those earlier investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury subpoena sought documents relating to the 1990  
international sale of area defense radar systems by the predecessor 
of Lockheed Martin Sanders and the compensation of an international 
sales consultant in connection with that sale, Lockheed said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal source said the focus is on a $44.5 million radar  
contract Sanders won from Taiwan to detect low-flying aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin Sanders Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of  
Lockheed Martin, is the result of the January 1990 merger of 
Lockheed Electronics Co. and Sanders Associates Inc. Sanders is no 
longer in the radar business.

<HEADLINE> Study: Rudeness at Work on the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Rude behavior is on the rise in the workplace and  
men are the ones to blame, a new study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Although men and women are targets of disrespect and rudeness in  
equal numbers, researchers say men instigate the rudeness 70 
percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to make organizations aware of this,'' said study  
co-author Christine M. Pearson, a management professor at the 
University of North Carolina business school. ``You can calculate 
the costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve percent of the people who experience rude behavior quit  
their jobs to avoid the perpetrator, the researchers found. 
Fifty-two percent reported losing work time worrying and 22 percent 
deliberately decreased their work effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, ``Workplace Incivility: The Target's Eye View,'' was  
presented Tuesday at the Academy of Management's annual convention. 
The authors interviewed and surveyed 1,400 workers and generated a 
list of suggestions to improve the workplace culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of those interviewed, 78 percent, said incivility  
has worsened in the past 10 years. The authors also found that rude 
people are three times more likely to be in higher positions than 
their targets. 
</P>
<P>
	And, men are the worst offenders, Pearson said. They are seven  
times more likely be rude or insensitive to underlings than to 
superiors. Women are equally rude to superiors and subordinates, 
the researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
	Fay Taylor, 49, a marketing director in Chicago, said she is not  
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``Men are more like bulls in a china shop when they are trying  
to get a job done,'' Taylor said. ``Women tend to couch things more 
carefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she added, ``If a woman is going to be rude, she's going to  
be rude. She'll butt in at the highest levels and the lowest 
levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another study, to be presented to the convention Wednesday,  
found that nearly 25 percent of respondents were ``generally at 
least somewhat angry at work.'' The 1996 Gallup telephone survey 
questioned 1,000 adults age 18 or older who work full- or 
part-time. 
</P>
<P>
	Authors of the study say the statistic may help explain recent  
outbursts of workplace violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an environment where you think people are satisfied with  
their jobs, there is a sort of undercurrent of anger and resentment 
aimed at the workplace that could potentially lead to the kinds of 
explosions of rage we have seen,'' said Donald Gibson, a professor 
at the Yale University School of Management and a co-author the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say workplace rage was a factor in the July 29  
shooting spree in which Mark O. Barton killed nine people and 
injured 12 others in two Atlanta office buildings where he worked 
as a day trader. A week later, Alan Eugene Miller killed three 
people at two Pelham, Ala., companies where he had worked, 
prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was sponsored by Marlin Co., a Connecticut-based  
management consulting firm.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal grand jury is investigating whether  
Lockheed Martin Corp. paid kickbacks to win contracts for the sale 
of military radar systems to Taiwan, the largest U.S. defense 
contractor disclosed in documents filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Lockheed deals also were under scrutiny, a source familiar  
with the investigation told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation centers on payments made to Richard Hei, a  
former Taiwanese air force officer and arms consultant who helped 
secure contracts for radar sold by Lockheed Martin Sanders, a 
wholly owned subsidiary, in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Tuesday, Lockheed denied wrongdoing and  
said it was cooperating with investigators. A spokesman declined to 
comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the U.S. Attorney's Office would not comment on  
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury also is looking at other Lockheed sales for  
possible wrongdoing, the source said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for material involving any number of sales which  
may or may not have violated the law. We have evidence pointing to 
at least one sale,'' the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense industry has become more careful about the use of  
foreign intermediaries since bribery scandals of the late 1980s and 
early 1990s, when overseas sales were booming and oversight was 
less stringent, said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck 
Investment Partners, an investment bank that focuses on aerospace 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a little bit of a flashback,'' he said. ``A decade ago  
I think it was more a case of companies not wanting to know what 
was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an SEC filing Monday, Lockheed disclosed the investigation  
was under way, but provided few details about the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The document said Lockheed received a subpoena on July 15 for  
records ``relating to the 1990 international sale of area defense 
radar systems by the predecessor of Lockheed Martin Sanders and the 
compensation of an international sales consultant in connection 
with that sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin shares were little changed Tuesday, edging up 6 1/4  
cents to $35.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe isn't the first involving Hei, who set up a small  
consulting firm after leaving the air force and was hired by 
several big U.S. defense firms to help broker sales of military 
equipment to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Litton Industries Inc. agreed to pay $18.5 million to  
settle a criminal investigation of Taiwan sales involving payments 
to Hei. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the former Teledyne Inc. pleaded guilty to federal  
fraud charges alleging that it paid Hei $3.2 million in illegal 
commissions between 1986 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire-based Sanders is no longer in the radar business.  
The company still manufactures other types of electronic warfare 
equipment for the U.S. military and foreign governments as well as 
electronics for commercial space ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, previously known as Sanders Associates Inc., was  
acquired by the former Lockheed Corp. in January 1990. It became a 
part of Lockheed Martin when Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta 
Corp. in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury's investigation is similar to the earlier probes  
involving Hei, but originated independently of them, the source 
said. While other Lockheed deals are being looked at, no other 
companies are involved in this probe, the source said.

<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- A plaque honoring D. Wayne Lukas  
now hangs on the wall at the National Racing Museum's Hall of Fame. 
That doesn't mean he's going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel even better about the next eight to 10 years than I do  
about the last 10 years,'' Lukas said Monday. ``We're putting 
together an even stronger group, and some serious things are going 
to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has conditioned more champions than any other thoroughbred  
trainer, won a record 13 Breeders Cup races and amassed more than 
$200 million in career purse earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	And it took more than just luck to get him there.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe in the luck factor,'' Lukas said. ``If you  
have to depend on luck in this game, you're gonna get beat a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also inducted Monday were jockey Russell Baze and thoroughbred  
racehorses Exceller, Miesque and Gun Bow. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of Lukas' achievements is long enough to line a  
racetrack. Highlights include receiving the Eclipse Award as the 
nation's top trainer four times, winning the Belmont Stakes three 
times and winning 12 Triple Crown races. His most recent Triple 
Crown victories came this year, when Charismatic won the Derby and 
the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has led the nation in earnings 14 of the last 16 years,  
and his 1998 mark of $17.8 million is a record that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
	With the ceremony spotlight centered squarely on him, Lukas, 63,  
chose to share the glory with a half-dozen assistants who gathered 
around him onstage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those records would never have happened without these guys,''  
Lukas said, his voice quivering. ``You guys have propped me up, 
carried me. And I know I wasn't easy to work for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tradeout here, and I got the best in the trade --  
just like I do every time I trade (horses) with you guys,'' he 
said, grinning at the other trainers in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	His assistants joked about Lukas' short temper and  
``expletive-laced tirades,'' but they were heavy in their praise. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many things have changed in our industry because of Wayne  
Lukas,'' former Lukas assistant Mark Hennig said. ``So many 
trainers never run multiple divisions, and he's shown us the 
reality that any race is just one flight away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with his success, Lukas said it ``hasn't always been blue  
skies and clear sailing in my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been solidly criticized by certain people in the industry  
and the media who don't always agree with what we do. But I make no 
apologies for what we've tried to do,'' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 25-year career, Baze has ridden 6,662 winners and earned  
more than $94.5 million in purses. He has also been the only rider 
to record 400 or more wins in each of the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past four years, Baze has been awarded the Isaac Murphy  
Award, presented by the National Turf Writers Association to the 
jockey with the highest winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I have been able to set those numbers that I have  
for the last couple of years is because I've been able to go out 
every day and do it,'' Baze said. ``I've been blessed that I 
haven't been injured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exceller, who raced from 1975 to 1979, came from 22 lengths back  
to beat two Triple Crown winners in the 1 1/2-mile Jockey Club Gold 
Cup in 1978. Exceller won by a nose over Triple Crown winner 
Seattle Slew and Affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Miesque, who was based in Europe for her entire racing career,  
made two starts in the United States, won two Grade I races, and 
was voted two Eclipse Awards. She also won a total of eight Group I 
races in France and England. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun Bow raised eyebrows in 1964 when he defeated Kelso by 12  
lengths at the Brooklyn Handicap. That autumn, they split in two 
dramatic duels in the Aqueduct and Woodward Stakes.

<HEADLINE>  Five Shot at L.A. Jewish Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man with a high-powered gun burst into a  
Jewish community center Tuesday and sprayed the lobby with 20 to 30 
shots, wounding five people, including three boys attending day 
camp, and then walked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Police failed to find the suspect -- a balding white man about 40  
years old -- in a street-by-street search near the center, but late 
in the day officers found a green Toyota Corolla taken in a nearby 
carjacking that was under investigation for a possible connection. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive for the attack was not known. ``Every possibility,  
including if it's a hate crime, we'll look into it,'' said Officer 
Guillermo Campos. 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously injured was a 5-year-old boy who was shot in  
the stomach and leg and underwent surgery. He was in critical but 
stable condition. Two 6-year-old boys, a 16-year-old girl and a 
68-year-old woman who worked at the center were in stable 
condition, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity said the injured  
woman, a receptionist, burst into her room with a wounded arm. The 
teacher said she gathered up her students, who joined hands and 
evacuated from the building. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence was the latest in a series of shootings at  
workplaces and schools, and as the search for the gunman continued, 
President Clinton and others spoke out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by  
gun violence,'' Clinton said in Washington. ``It calls on all of us 
not only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their 
families, but intensify our resolve to make America a safer 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis said he was forming a task force of state  
agencies to advise churches, child care centers and other 
operations that care for children on how to upgrade their security 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen children were in the center when the gunman  
burst into the North Valley Jewish Community Center and began 
spraying the lobby with bullets about 10:50 a.m., said Capt. Steve 
Ruda of the Los Angeles Fire Department. He fired up to 30 shots 
before walking down a hallway and out of the building, Ruda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruda said he believed the shooter used a 9mm Uzi. Police Chief  
Bernard Parks however, would only identify the gun as a 
high-powered weapon with a large magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing said by the suspect before the shooting,''  
Parks said. ``It was indiscriminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the shooting, officers raced to a spot nearby  
where a woman reported that a man resembling the suspect's 
description carjacked her Toyota, leaving a red-and-white van 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers searched the van, which had Washington state plates,  
and found a large amount of ammunition, bulletproof vests and 
devices that may be smoke grenades, but no weapons, said police 
Cmdr. Dave Kalish. Contents of the van included metal boxes packed 
with ammunition, magazines for an assault rifle, a booklet titled 
Ranger Handbook and freeze-dried food. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalish said it wasn't certain the carjacker and gunman were the  
same person. When officers found the Toyota in a hotel parking lot 
a few miles from the community, a SWAT team was summoned to the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	The van was bought Saturday from the Tacoma (Wash.) Kar Korner,  
said the manager of the lot, who refused to be identified. He said 
police had ordered him not to give out any information on the 
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	While SWAT teams were swarming around the community center and  
news and police helicopters buzzed overhead, about 20 small 
children were led unhurt from the building hand in hand and taken 
to a Jewish temple nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents rushed to the center and jammed against police lines  
trying to find out if their children were all right. Some parents 
wept and hugged one another. One man was handcuffed by officers 
after slipping under yellow police tape, but he was later released. 
Authorities used a fire department loudspeaker to announce the 
whereabouts of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to cry when I saw him,'' said Karen Macofsky, who was  
reunited with her 11-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. ``But I 
held back and just hugged him tightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Macalas prayed and recited psalms as he rushed to check  
on his children, ages 2 and 3. ``My feeling about it is it's 
another case of someone acting out in rage,'' he said. ``I don't 
want to believe this is an act of anti-Semitism here in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were searching for the gunman throughout the  
neighborhood of mostly single-family homes in the San Fernando 
Valley suburbs 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said  
about 20 older children from the Jewish center were touring the 
Wiesenthal center's Museum of Tolerance at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic that the 20 children were here learning about  
man's inhumanity to man, when their own day camp became a target of 
such hatred,'' Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program director at the North Valley center told Hier that  
most of the children had been playing outside when the gunman 
stormed in, Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The community center provides nursery programs, child care and  
camp activities. It has a large main building, a smaller houselike 
structure, a pool and tennis courts.

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Pay for Indian Suit Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge ordered the government Tuesday  
to pay more than $600,000 for failing to produce documents promptly 
in a lawsuit concerning the trouble-plagued Indian trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said the payment is to cover  
``all expenses and reasonable attorney fees'' incurred by Indian 
plaintiffs because of government delay and misconduct in not 
providing records that detail trust fund mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth said that he was dismayed that taxpayers ``will be  
forced to pay for the misconduct of their government's officials 
and attorneys.'' He said in his 45-page opinion he wished he could 
hold individual government attorneys liable but is precluded from 
doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	The order does not address the merits of the class-action  
lawsuit brought by the Indians, who demand the court take over the 
trouble-plagued trust fund, overhaul its error-filled accounting 
system and make restitutions to Indians who lost money. 
</P>
<P>
	The award of fees stems from a two-year period in which lawyers  
for the Indians were blocked repeatedly from obtaining documents on 
individual Indian accounts. The legal fees and other expenses, 
totaling $624,643.50 to be awarded to seven attorneys, cover from 
November, 1996, to January this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is gratifying that the judge is holding the government  
accountable,'' said Jim McCarthy, spokesman for the Indians. ``The 
Department of Interior's tactics of delay and denial and cover-up 
against American Indians will no longer be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is a reasonable decision,'' said Interior  
Department spokesman Tim Ahearn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department was ordered in late 1996 to turn over  
statements, checks and other documents concerning trust-fund 
accounts held by five Indians who are lead plaintiffs in the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers and officials ``almost immediately disobeyed  
(the order) and successfully covered up their disobedience through 
semantics and strained, unilateral, self-serving interpretations of 
their own duties,'' wrote Lamberth in assessing the legal fees, 
</P>
<P>
	In late February, Lamberth found Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt and then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in contempt 
because they failed to produce documents sought by the Indians in 
connection with the suit. He accused Interior officials of 
foot-dragging and making ``outright false statements'' to keep from 
turning over the records. 
</P>
<P>
	The government argued that many records involving more than  
300,000 Indian accounts were missing, others were stored 
haphazardly including some in a warehouse that for a time had been 
infected by virus-carrying rodents. Many of the records still have 
not been found, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government admits it cannot accurately document the $550  
million fund that belongs to individual Indians from land holdings, 
royalty payments and other assets dating back generations. Another 
$2.5 billion in the fund belongs to Indian tribes but is not part 
of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians had sought more than $2.3 million in reimbursements  
for legal fees and expenses, but Lamberth denied some fees as well 
as about $1.2 million paid to an accounting firm to try to assess 
how much money should be in the trust accounts by using a sampling 
of accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The court-ordered payments totaled $329,237 to Dennis Gingold  
and $19,312 to Thaddeus Holt, both banking attorneys hired by the 
Indians; $252,147 to five attorneys working for the Native American 
Rights Fund, which is financing the lawsuit; and $23,948 for 
various expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Lamberth has received final arguments in the suit and  
could rule this month.

<HEADLINE> United To Loosen Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELK GROVE VILLAGE, Ill. (AP) -- Following the example of other  
major air carriers, United Airlines announced Tuesday that it is 
eliminating many of the restrictions on its frequent flier program. 
</P>
<P>
	The suburban Chicago-based airline said its Mileage Plus program  
members' frequent flier miles will last indefinitely as long as 
passengers use their accounts every 36 months. That means the 37 
million people enrolled in the program may not ever see mileage 
expire as long as they continue to accrue or use points. 
</P>
<P>
	United said it will also reinstate 1998 expired miles to members  
who register and take either two paid domestic round trips or one 
paid international round trip on flights operated by United, United 
Shuttle or United Express. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year was the first year that Mileage Plus members' frequent  
flier miles were subject to expiration, said United spokesman 
Graham Atkinson. Members who had at least 20,000 miles, however, 
were able to roll their miles over into 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep their accounts active in the future, members can accrue  
miles by using services affiliated with the program, such as credit 
card purchases, long distance phone calls, car rentals, hotel stays 
and cruises. 
</P>
<P>
	United's decision follows American Airline's similar  
announcement earlier this month. Northwest Airlines eased its 
restrictions in January, and Delta Air Lines had dropped most of 
its expiration requirements three years ago.

<HEADLINE> How Do I Get My Own Web Site? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: Many online services give subscribers a free page on a shared  
Web site with a shared domain name. But how can I get a 
personalized domain name for my own Web site? 

</P>
<P>
	A: Registering a domain name with an address ending in ``.com,  
``.net'' and ``.org'' is relatively simple and inexpensive. The 
hard part is finding a domain name that's not taken. 
</P>
<P>
	There are already more than 5 million domain names ending with  
those three tags, and the total could double within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In theory, since a domain name can be up to 22 characters long,  
there are 80 billion possible combinations of letters and numbers 
that can be registered under ``.com'' or any other suffix. But most 
of the simplest names are long gone and most of the remaining 
variations would look like gibberish. 
</P>
<P>
	New suffixes like ``.web'' or ``.store'' have been proposed, but  
there's no sign they'll be adopted any time soon. So for most 
people, ``.com'' is still the most likely choice. 
</P>
<P>
	To find out if a domain name is still available, use the search  
engine provided by Internet services like Earthlink and Mindspring, 
or go directly to one of the companies authorized to register new 
names, including www.networksolutions.com and www.register.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Type in the desired name (i.e. ``www.yourname.com'') and the  
search engine will tell you if it's available. If it is, you'll be 
given an option to reserve the name and steered through a simple
