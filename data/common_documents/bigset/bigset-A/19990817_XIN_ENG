<HEADLINE> Way Cleared for Rafsanjani's Run for Majlis Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Majlis (parliament) on
Monday approved two more articles of a bill on amendments to the
Election Law, thus paving the way for former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani to run for the next Majlis speaker.
</P>
<P>
One of the articles approved by the Majlis exempts head of the
State Expediency Council from resigning before being a candidate
in parliamentary elections, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani is now head of the powerful council, which exerts
great influence in making laws and shaping the country's economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that except for the exemption, Majlis deputies
upheld the previous law that requires officials to resign from
their posts before being nominated to run for seats in the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Iran's next parliamentary elections will be held on February 18
next year.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that Rafsanjani is expected to replace Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the incumbent conservative speaker, to head the
270-member Majlis for a four-year term.
</P>
<P>
Among the 270 deputies in the current Majlis, 140 are believed
to be conservatives, 110 moderates, and the remaining are
middle-of-the-roaders.
</P>
<P>
Another article outlines general qualifications of
candidates. It requires candidates to be committed to Islam and
the Islamic system, of Iranian nationality, loyal to the
Constitution and the principle of vlayat-e faqih (religious rule).
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the Majlis approved six articles of a bill on
amendments to the Election Law, empowering the conservative
Council of Guardians to execise "expedient supervision on every
stage of the parliamentary elections."
</P>
<P>
It is regarded as a blow to President Mohammad Khatami's
moderate faction, which expects another victory in elections to
take over the Majlis, a bastion of the hardliners.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was swept to power two years ago in the presidential
election by a landslide victory over his rival, Nateq-Nouri.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Uganda Ties Not Affected by Clashes, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The fightings between Ugandan
and Rwandan troops in Kisangani in the north part of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo have not affected the relations
between the two countries, Rwandan government officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Rwandan Vice-President's Office said that
Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu was expected to meet his
Ugandan counterpart in Uganda to discuss the on-going fightings in
Kisangani and searching for ways of peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Bizimungu and Vice-President Major General Paul
Kagame, accompanied by Rwandan Minister in State House, Patrick
Mazimhaka, left Kigali Monday morning for Western Uganda to meet
Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, the Rwanda News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
''We hope that the leaders of both countries will realize the
S06076NBB157I0816QU03:0203:041174
problem and move towards resolving it peacefully,'' Rwandan army
spokesman, Major Emmanuel Ndahiro said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Rwanda government spokesman, Lt Col. Wilson
Rutayisire, told reporters that friendly relations between the two
countries have not been very much affected by the fighting between
the Ugandan People's Defense (UPDF) and the Rwandan Patriotic Army
(RPA).
</P>
<P>
Rutayisire glossed the picture of how discrepancies regarding
the interests of both allies in the war of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo developed and how the two countries had tried to
resolve them through consultations.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the dispute of leadership within the main rebel
group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy, with Uganda supporting
ousted Congolese leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba whom it wants no
matter what to be signatory to the July 10 Lusaka peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Rutayisire said that several meetings were held over the
leadership wrangle within the RCD, notably in Dar-Es-Salaam where
it was decided that only the new RCD leader Emile Ilunga should
sign.
</P>
<P>
A verification mission was set and was led by the Zambian State
House Minister, Eric Silwamba who had gone to Kisangani and could
not see neither Wamba, nor his forces. Wamba was in Kampala, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rutayisire charged that in a bid to hinder the verification
mission, Brigadier James Kazini, UPDF army chief -of-staff,
started setting road- blocks throughout the city controlled by
RCD-Goma rebels, and coerced the residents to gather at the
BAH276PAB230I16TEQL03:0403:042129
DPA283PAB230I16TEQL03:0403:042123
airport to cheer up Wamba who had made his mind and flown to
Kisangani to show that he holds some power in the city.
BAP404PAB230I16TEQL03:0403:042123
</P>
<P>
This resulted into the confrontation with the rebels, but RPA
stood by, Rutayisire explained. The problems worsened over the
week-end when Brigadier Kazini ordered troops to encircle RPA's
positions at the airport Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Intense fighting ensued and is still raging in the town, with
reports of UPDF withdrawing from positions it had grabbed from the
rebels a week ago.
</P>
<P>
''Problems were experienced, but leaders of both countries had
always met. Ugandans promised to redress the situation but nothing
was concretized, '' Rutayisire charged, saying that UPDF had
repeatedly provoked RPA but the latter had exercised restraint.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, UPDF troops have been reportedly encircled or
chased out of positions from where they had been leading attacks
on both Rwandan troops, and the RCD rebels. These positions
include Hotel Wagenia; Hotel Palm Beach, Congo Palace, and the
city bank.

<HEADLINE> Riyadh Content With OPEC Efforts in Propping up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Monday
expressed content with the joint efforts by the world's major oil
producers in shoring up oil prices.
</P>
<P>
During a weekly cabinet session in the Saudi western city of
Jeddah, Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz said the Gulf kingdom
was satisfied with the cooperation between the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC states in
slashing output.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members agreed last March to reduce their oil production
by about 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in order to put oil
prices back on track.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and exporter,
took the biggest production cut of 585,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
Since April 1, when the OPEC output cut agreement took effect,
oil prices in the world market have been rallying steadily.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, also first deputy prime minister, stressed at the
meeting that achieving and maintaining balanced oil prices was a
joint responsibility of both OPEC members and non-OPEC producers.
</P>
<P>
He asserted his country's keenness on overcoming the
disturbances in the oil market and achieving the needed balance
for the interests of both producers and consumers, said the Saudi
Press Agency monitored here.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Secretary to Review IRA Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam said on Monday that she will make a balanced
judgement in the next few days on whether the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) had broken its ceasefire with the killing of a
22-year-old Catholic man last month.
</P>
<P>
Her comments came as she met police and army chiefs at
Stormont, in the Northern Ireland capital Belfast, to get their
S02258PAB231I16TEQL03:0803:153639
assessment on the paramilitary ceasefires.
S04258PAB231I16TEQL03:0803:153639
</P>
<P>
Mowlam told reporters she would not hesitate to expel the IRA's
political wing, Sinn Fein, from the peace process if the guerrilla
group was found to have violated the truce. But any decision to
expel Sinn Fein would be based on hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said she had not come to any firm conclusion as to who
was responsible for recent violence, including the killing of
Belfast man Charles Bennett.
</P>
<P>
She also discussed with the police and army chiefs in Northern
Ireland on the weekend outbreaks of violence on the streets of
Belfast and Londonderry, the second largest city of the province.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam, who is due to meet Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin
McGuinness on Tuesday, warned that the continuing violence was
"unacceptable"
</P>
<P>
McGuinnes said earlier he believed that the IRA ceasefire was
intact. He accused pro-British unionists led by David Trimble, who
refused to share power with Sinn Fein until IRA disarms, of
conducting a "Cold War" against Irish nationalists.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein is due to hold an executive meeting this month to
decide whether to take part in a review of the peace process,
which is under the chairmanship of U.S. mediator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein says its 17.6 percent share of the vote in elections
held after the Good Friday Agreement -- effectively a mandate to
take part in institutions -- is being ignored.
</P>
<P>
The IRA said its leadership had not sanctioned an alleged
gun-running operation from the United States to Ireland and that
there had been no violation of its ceasefire with the killing of
Bennett -- though it did not deny the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Talks on implementing a Northern Irish peace deal signed in
April last year have been frozen until September as Protestant
politicians refused to share power with Catholic republicans in
the Sinn Fein party until its guerrilla ally, the IRA, disarms.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Officer Killed by Car Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A military officer of Lebanon's
anti-Israeli guerrilla group Hezbollah was killed Monday in his
booby-trapped car in south Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ali Hassan Deeb, 57, a father of five children, was killed
when his car was blown up in the Hilalieh area east of Sidon, the
country's southern coastal city, the group's statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the officer has been in the group since it was launched
in 1982 and has survived several assassination attempts.
</P>
<P>
There has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the
attack, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
But Hezbollah has accused Israel of being behind the killing,
saying the criminal act proves that Israel's new Prime Minister
Ehud Barak is of no difference from his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
The group reiterated its determination to continue its
resistance movement until all Lebanese land is liberated from
Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been in control of part of south Lebanon since 1978
and set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in 1985
with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
to oust Israeli troops out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges Uganda, Rwanda to Stop Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba called on here Monday Uganda and Rwanda to find a peaceful
solution to their fightings in the north part of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the appeal before leaving here for Maputo, the
capital of Mozambique, to attend the annual summit of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who was mandated by SADC to mediate a peaceful
solution to the war in the DRC, said that hostilities between
Uganda and Rwanda, which supports different factions of the DRC
rebels, will have a negative impact on the peace process of the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said he has always anticipated difficulties in bringing
last peace to the Congo but he is hopeful that all the
stakeholders in the DRC will find a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops clashed in the DRC rebel-held
Kisangani last Saturday and has escalated into street house to
house fighting in the third largest city of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Because of the power struggle within the rebel Congolese Rally
for Democracy (CRD) all the rebel groups fighting to topple DRC
President Laurent Kabil did not sign the ceasefire agreement,
which was signed on July 10 by the six warring countries involved
in the year-long war in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
CRD split into two factions in May this year -- one led by
Emile Ilunga and the other by Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
In May Ilunga ousted Wamba and was named by his supporters as
new leader of CRD. After the wrangle broke out Wamba moved from
Goma to Kisangani and has been insisting that he is still the
leader of the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Uganda backs Wamba while Rwanda backs Ilunga.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Almost 2.7 billion U.S.
dollars was invested in Silicon Valley companies by venture
capitalists in the second quarter this year, a record high.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Monday by U.S. accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), venture-backed investments in the
United States in the second quarter hit a record 7.67 billion
dollars, far exceeding the previous record of 4.31 billion in
first quarter of 1999. About 35 percent of the money went to
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report from the investment research firm VentureOne
estimated that venture capitalists invested a total of 6.8 billion
dollars in 661 transactions in the second quarter. VetureOne put
S02264PAB238I16TEQL03:2803:311836
the total venture-backed investments in the first half of this
S04264PAB238I16TEQL03:2803:311836
year at 11.4 billion dollars, while PwC had the figure around 12
billion dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Both firms confirmed that Internet-related companies received
3.8 billion dollars in the second quarter, about half of the total
investment. More than 600 Internet-related companies received
investments.
</P>
<P>
All the leading markets were leaders in technology investments.
PwC said that companies in biotechnology, communications, computer
and peripherals, electronics, environmental, medical devices,
semiconductors, software and information, plus Internet-based
companies in other industry categories, accounted for 90 percent
of all investments in second quarter.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba is optimistic that the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy
(CRD) would sign the Lusaka cease-fire agreement aimed at ending a
year-long conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Monday that the Zambian delegation led by
Presidential Affairs Minister Eric Silwamba had made head-way and
was at the verge of a break-through in convincing CRD to sign the
cease-fire agreement signed by all involved countries in Lusaka
last month.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the Lusaka international airport shortly
before departure for the Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC) heads of state summit in Maputo, Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, however, expressed worry at the recent clashes between
the two factions within CRD led by Emily Ilunga and ousted Dia
Wamba in the rebel held city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
He described it as a sad development but he expressed hope that
the situation would soon return normal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Silwamba arrived in DRC in an attempt to
persuade the divided rebel CRD to sign up to the Lusaka peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Silwamba held meetings with the CRD political
and military leaders separately in Goma and Kisangani of the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Ilunga's troops are based in Goma on the Rwanda border, while
Dai Wamba is based in Kisangani, a Ugandan stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The CRD, which now holds much of the eastern half of the
country, refused to sign the peace agreement because of a
leadership struggle between the two factions.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Journalist Arrested for Refusing to Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian opposition journalist
was arrested on Monday for refusing to pay a fine of 20,000
Egyptian pounds (5,900 U.S. dollars) imposed on him by a court
for allegedly libeling Egypt's deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Adel Hussein, a columnist for the Islamist Al-Shaab newspaper,
the fiery mouthpiece of the opposition Labor Party, refused to pay
the fine in protest against the sentence, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
Hussein will have to serve prison term, instead, to compensate
for the fine, the officials said. The length of a sentence has not
yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
The South Cairo Criminal Court on Saturday convicted Hussein
and three other Al-Shaab journalists of libeling Deputy Prime
Minister Youssef Wali in a series of articles and cartoons that
accused him of "treason" and "working as an agent for" Israel to
try to ruin Egypt's economy.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the same amount of fines, the other three
journalists were sentenced to two years in prison with hard labor,
the maximum allowed under a 1996 press law.
</P>
<P>
Wali, who is also the agricultural minister, has signed several
agreements with Israel for the supply of seed, fertilizers and
technology to arrest desertification.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaab is published by the Labor Party, which is allied to
the Muslim Brotherhood - Egypt's strongest Islamic movement - and
opposes peace with Israel.

MAPUTO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said in Maputo Monday that the Angolan government need
material and political support in its fighting against the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels led
by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said this at the Maputo international airport when he
was welcoming the heads of state or government of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) who were jetting in for their
19th summit Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that a possible military intervention in
the Angolan crisis depends on the discussion at the SADC summit,
hinting that the suggested military intervention will materialize
if the leaders decide that it is the best way to bring an end to
the 24-year war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"We need a clear position as far as all the countries are
concerned," the Mozambican president noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that military intervention in Angola is a delicate
issue, demanding great responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report form Angolan capital Luanda said the
Angolan government has made it clear that it will not ask fellow
SADC members for military assistance at the Maputo summit, quite
contrary to some expectations.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted Aldemiro Vaz da
Conceicao, spokesman for Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, as saying that Angola expects from other SADC members
"understanding for its internal problem and solidarity."
</P>
<P>
"The SADC should carry out the goals for which it was created,
which are to increase cooperation between the countries of the
region, politically and economically," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing in Maputo Sunday, South African Foreign
Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who also chairs the SADC Council
of Ministers, noted that Angola did not raise the possible
military intervention by its SADC neighbors at the two-day
ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The war in Angola since 1975 has been ravaging for both the
southern African country and the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has refused to negotiate with Savimbi,
chief of the rebel movement UNITA on the ground that he has
violated the UN-brokered 1994 Lusaka peace accord and has been
keen to take power by using arms.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda Still Allies Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister for
Defense Steven Kavuma said here Monday that Uganda and Rwanda are
still allies although their troops fought each other in Kisangani
city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in an interview with the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
</P>
<P>
"The small misunderstanding between the two countries would not
result in destruction of our relations. We are still allies," the
minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ugandan troops deployed in the DRC's third largest
city opened fire in self defense in the weekend clashes with
Rwandan soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In the report, a Rwandan government spokesman said that Uganda
should take the blame of souring bilateral relations because it is
the Uganda troops who started the fighting in which both sides
sustained injuries.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni met
Rwandan Vice President and Minister of Defense Paul Kagame in a
bid to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here hold that Uganda and Rwanda, traditional allies
in the region, began to have different views over the DRC issue
after the main rebel group the Congolese Rally for Democracy split
in May.
</P>
<P>
Kampala and Kigali are reportedly supporting the rival factions
of the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Uganda insists that Wamba dia Wamba, the RCD chairman, should
sign on the Lusaka cease-fire agreement on behalf of the whole
rebel group, a demand turned by the RCD faction based in Goma in
eastern DRC and backed by Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
They argued that Wamba dia Wamba was ousted and is no longer
the RCD chairman and therefore has no right to sign the pact.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and the United States have
signed a Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation in power
supply in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony held in capital Abuja
Saturday, Nigerian Minister of Power and Steel Bola Ige said that
Nigeria was currently on the path of achieving full re-engagement
of bilateral cooperation with the U.S., the New Nigerian
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of this memorandum is part of the restoration of
cooperation of the two countries," he said, adding although the
memorandum was for the power sector, the relationship would extend
to other sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, U.S. Secretary for Energy Bill Richardson
who was in Nigeria for a visit said that the U.S. would render
short-term assistance to Nigeria in energy technology, rural
electrification and privatization of the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Richardson whose visit was the first by an American cabinet
official since civil democracy was restored in Nigeria stressed
that "the Clinton administration feels that Nigeria is one of the
four countries in the world that require important American
attention in investment."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the actualization of the West Africa Gas
Pipeline, of which Nigeria is a key player, was seen as a break
project for the sub- region by the American government, adding
Washington was keen to ensure the success of the project as a
long-term solution to the energy needs of the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lagos State signed an 800-million-U.S. dollar
memorandum of understanding Saturday for electricity supply with

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' FM to Visit Oslo for Talks on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides will leave here for Oslo next week for talks with his
Norwegian counterpart Knut Volleback.
</P>
<P>
Developments on Cyprus issue and the initiative by the G-8
(seven most industrialized nations plus Russia) will be on the
agenda of the talks, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Monday
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on June 20 at the end of their annual
summit in Cologne, Germany, the leaders of the G-8 nations urged
the Greek and Turkish Cypriots to enter talks without setting any
pre-conditions and negotiate in good faith until a settlement is
reached.
</P>
<P>
Trade, financial and economic matters will also be discussed
between the Cypriot and Norwegian foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Kasoulides would outline Cyprus' views
on the person who would replace outgoing U.N. special
representative for Cyprus Dame Ann Hercus, who will leave her
post in September, if the Norwegian side raises the possibility of
the appointment of former Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Egeland.
</P>
<P>
Egeland was involved in U.S.-backed efforts to get Greek
and Turkish Cypriot businesmen together in Brussels, Oslo and
Istanbul in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Egeland is one of the names reportedly being discussed as
a possible successor to Hercus, along with other names of
prominent foreign personalities.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Oslo, Kasoulides will give a lecture
on Cyprus.

JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's economy grew slowly
in the first half of 1999, with its gross domestic product (GDP)
up by only 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of per capita GDP was negative at minus 1.9
percent, said data published on Monday by Israeli Central Bureau

Exports of goods and services rose in the first half year by 8
percent, while total imports (excluding defense imports) also
posted a sharp rise of 16 percent.
</P>

The slowdown in Israel's economy began after the former Likud
government assumed office three years ago and took a restrictive
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Since his victory in the May elections, Israel's new Prime
Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to make the economy recover in

LUANDA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Angola denied here Monday the
possible involvement of member countries of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) in its civil war, calling the
conflict "an internal issue".
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said the
government " has neither interest nor intention" of directly
involving SADC countries in Angolan conflict.
</P>

Angola longs for SADC's solidarity and its understanding of the

by countries in the region," said Aldemiro Vaz da Conceicao before
his visit to Maputo, capital of Mozambique, where the SADC summit
will be held Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government hopes that SADC will promote the
cooperation of countries of the region, for which the southern
African organization was founded, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman criticized "certain press" for publishing reports
which said that the Angolan government has the intention of
seeking SADC's involvement in Angolan civil war.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that wars in Angola and the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, situation in Lesotho and Namibia as well as the
democratic process in the region will be main issues to be

RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia is expected to support any decision by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to
increase production next year to meet the growing demand for
petroleum and to avert an acute rise in prices that may harm
the international economy and cause slackening of consumption.
</P>
<P>
According to Saudi sources, the kingdom, the world's biggest
petroleum producer, plays a key role in maintaining the reasonable
level of prices between 18 and 21 U.S. dollars per barrel, a level

"the absolutely unjustified action of the Uzbek Air Force" and
requested Tashkent to take immediate steps to avert similar

actions in the future. This incident runs counter to the existing

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Trade Down by 25% in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign trade in the
first six months of this year shrank by 25 percent from that of
the same period last year, the State Statistics Service said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign trade during the period was 46.7 billion U.S.
dollars, but if unorganized trade was included, the figure wold be
52 billion dollars, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
From January to June of this year, Russia exported 31.8 billion
dollars worth of goods, 11.7 percent less than for the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports during the period went down by 43.6 percent to reach
14.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
With the steeper drop in imports partly because of the
devaluation of the ruble, Russia's trade surplus surged to 16.2
billion dollars, up from the 9.6 billion dollars of the same
period last year, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Iraqi Civilians Killed in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Three civilians were killed and
nine others injured on Monday in U.S.-British warplanes' attacks
on civilian facilities in southern Iraq, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 15:10 (1110 GMT), eight
formations of U.S.-British warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti
bases violated southern Iraqi airspace over Basrah, Muthana, Misan
and Wasit provinces.
</P>
<P>
These warplanes bombed some civilian and service installations,
leading to the deaths of three civilians including a child and
the injuries of nine others, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the enemy planes
and repulsed them to their Saudi and Kuwaiti bases, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:30 (0630 GMT), 10 formations
of U.S. and British warplanes coming from Turkish airspace
violated northern Iraqi airspace over Neineva, Erbil and Dohuk
provinces and attacked some civilian and service facilities in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have made 11,523 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq, and have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian
facilities and military sites.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led
western allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed
aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.

MAPUTO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said in Maputo Monday that if requested, he is willing
to take the chair of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC).
</P>
<P>
Chissano, who is currently Vice-Chairman of the SADC, said that
 he had been approached by some of the 14 SADC members to take the
job, the Mozambican New Agency (AIM) reported.
</P>
<P>
But Chissano claimed that he did not know what the position of
all the other members was.
</P>
<P>
It was assumed that Chissano will at the Maputo summit
Wednesday take the post from his South African counterpart Thabo
Mbeki who replaced Nelson Mandela as the SADC chairman after the
June 2 election.
</P>
<P>
In response to the assumption, Chissano said that the SADC "is
not like the OAU (the Organization of the African Unity), where
the head of the host country automatically becomes the chairman."

<HEADLINE> UK Labor Urges Tories to "Slap Down" Thatcher on EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Labor Party and
the Liberal Democrats have issued an unprecedented joint challenge
to the Conservatives' stance over Europe after Margaret Thatcher
called for withdrawal from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released Sunday night, Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook and Menzies Campbell, foreign affairs spokesman for the
Liberal Democrats, urged John Maples, the shadow foreign
secretary, to "slap down" Thatcher's reported views.
</P>
<P>
They said there was no room at the top of British politics for
those who thought Britain should leave Europe.
</P>
<P>
Weekend reports said Thatcher, the Conservatives' prime
minister from 1979 to 1990 -- known as the Iron Lady -- was asked
at a dinner party whether she favored Britain pulling out of the
EU. "Of course I am. It has been an absolute disaster," she was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
She believed it is time for Britain to leave the EU because it
is becoming a federal superstate.
</P>
<P>
Her private comments have encouraged the rights of the party to
plan a conference showdown with William Hague, the Conservative
leader, in an attempt to further toughen the Tories' European
policy.
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's reported comments were contrary to Hague's carefully
constructed "In Europe But Not Run By Europe" policy.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Thatcher dismissed the joint statement on her views
on Europe, saying they should have "better things to do".
</P>
<P>
Downing Street said on Monday that the joint statement had been
issued because demands for the UK's withdrawal from the EU were
now extending to the Tory frontbench.

<HEADLINE> Malawi, Zambia to Attend Trade Exposition in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia will
hold a trade and investment exposition in Mbeya, Tanzania between
September 9 to 11, according to Malawi Chamber of Commerce and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Exley Silumbu, chief economist of the chamber of commerce, said
last week that the exposition has been organized jointly by the
Malawi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Tanzania Chamber of
Commerce Industry and Agriculture and the Zambia Associated
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Malawi News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the exposition is to promote formal trade
and investment among the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Already 20 local companies have expressed interest to
participate in the fair. However, further confirmation was being
awaited to ascertain the actual number of participation.
</P>
<P>
Malawian representatives had already gone to Mbeya to inspect
the place and discuss logistics with Tanzanian authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the program of the exposition, there will be a
symposium which will examine tariff and non tariff barriers to
VHK147NBB118I16TSQL00:0700:072037
trade in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the issues will be taken seriously by the

responsible authorities," said Silumbu.
</P>
<P>
The three countries had similar expositions before, which have

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Reiterates Committment to OAU Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia reiterated Monday
that it would commit itself to peace plan initiated by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) on the peaceful settlement of
the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said that Ethiopia was seeking
clarifications on the technical arrangements over the
implementation of the OAU framework agreement and modalities
designed to end Ethio-Eritrean border war that started in May
1998.
</P>
<P>
"The technical arrangements are the final and most crucial step
in ensuring that the tremendous efforts exerted by the OAU and
others to resolve the conflict can be both swiftly attained and
sustained," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia wants "to make sure that the implementation of the
technical arrangements will bring lasting and durable peace," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The technical arrangements were prepared in Algiers by a team
of experts from the OAU, the United Nations and the United States.
They are intended to facilitate the implementation of the plan to
resolve the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The arrangements are also expected to be carried out under the
leadership of the OAU and in close cooperation with the UN.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ethiopia submitted its request for clarifications on
OAU's technical arrangements meant to settle the Ethiopia-Eritrean
conflict in a letter to Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika,
current chairman of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
The OAU said that it would respond rapidly to "constructive"
queries posed by Ethiopia about technical aspects of the peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
The Ethio-Eritrean war, currently in a lull, has reportedly
claimed tens of thousands of lives and has displaced half a
million people.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Congo (K) Fighting Breaks Anti-Polio Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday said that weekend fighting in the Democratic
Republic of Congo violated a truce to enable millions of children
to be vaccinated against polio.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here through his spokesman, Annan said,
"It is unacceptable that this fighting is taking place during the
national immunization days, which were supposed to provide the
opportunity for some 10 million children to be immunized against
polio."
</P>
<P>
"This development violates a truce for the period of August 2
to 20 endorsed by all parties following a request made by the
secretary-general," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief "is very concerned about the clashes since the
last weekend in Kisangani, Democratic Republic of Congo, between
Congolese rebel factions, with reported involvement of troops from
Rwanda and Uganda," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He is particularly concerned lest these clashes further
complicate the ongoing regional and international efforts to bring
about a peaceful solution to the conflicts in the Great Lakes,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Six African countries involved in a year-long rebellion in
Congo (K) signed a ceasefire accord in Lusaka, the Zambian
capital, on July 10. But rivalry between two factions of the rebel
Congolese Rally for Democracy opposed to President Laurent Kabila
prevented them from signing the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Asks Arab League to Postpone FM Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has asked the Arab
League to postpone its next meeting of foreign ministers, which is
to be chaired by Iraq, league officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based league has already issued invitations to the
foreign ministers of its 22 members to attend the September 4-5
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is scheduled to chair the meeting under the Arab League's
rotational system.
</P>
<P>
But league officials said Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal
has asked Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid to
postpone the meeting until September 13.
</P>
<P>
Al-Faisal did not explain why his country asked for the
postponement after initially agreeing to the date, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia along with Kuwait, which was invaded by Iraq in
1990, have been strongly opposed to allowing Iraq back into the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The two countries once blocked Arab League proposals which
would have supported Iraq in its campaign to have the nine-year
United Nations economic sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the two countries, the league fell short on
two occasions this year of condemning U.S.-British air strikes
against Iraq and instead called on Baghdad to comply with the
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The league officials said the foreign ministers will find it
difficult to reschedule their bi-annual session as most of them
are planning to participate in meetings of the U.N. General
Assembly in New York a week later.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear if the kingdom is supported in its request by
its five allies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), but in the
M01-81NAB030i0816ql03:3803:381576
past they shew solidarity in their anti-Iraq policies.
</P>
<P>
If the Saudi foreign minister does not attend the meeting, his
GCC colleagues in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates may follow suit, instead sending low-level envoys to head
their delegations.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers meet in March and September each
year.

JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- S. Africa will officially
adopt a new national coat of arms on January 1, 2000, it is
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has agreed to allocate 16.73 million rand (2.7
million U.S. dollars) for a new design which will include a public
participation process, Arts and Culture Minister Ben Ngubane said
in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ngubane said public submissions would be "considered and
refined" by the state's heraldry council before submission to
cabinet for approval.
</P>
<P>
He said the present coat of arms, taken into use in 1910, was
largely made up of elements from the colonial era.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, it does not adequately reflect all of the people
and cultures of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
This new coat of arms will also be used on coins.
</P>
<P>
South Africa deserted the old national flag and anthem after

<P>
KHARTOUM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Sudan introduced a new
investment law under which priorities will be given to "strategic
investment projects" in areas such as infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The number of approved projects in the fields of iron, steel
and petroleum, the largest investment projects in the country, has hit
1,000, Sudanese Minister of International Cooperation and
Investment Abdullah Hassan Ahmed told reporters here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed said that his ministry is the only party responsible for
granting concessions and privileges to investors in the country,
noting that provincial rulers are authorized to offer concessions
to the projects in their respective provinces except for the ones
that involve a foreign party.
</P>
<P>
The new investment law offers necessary protection to
foreign investors, said the minister, highlighting the importance
of working out an investment chart to attract more investments in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"The door is open for investors to take part in the power and
road-building projects," said a senior official at the Ministry
of International Cooperation and Investment.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet in Poor Health But to Fight Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet's health is deteriorating but he is determined to fight
extradition to Spain on charges of human rights abuses, his
spokesman said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Robertson said the retired general was now suffering
from clinical depression as well as diabetes and heart problems
and that the 83-year-old man vehemently denied reports he accepted
responsibility for torture during his rule.
</P>
<P>
"There is no truth in suggesting Pinochet is to go to Spain," a
Reuters report quoted Robertson as saying.
</P>
<P>
Former media reports said that the retired general's lawyers
were studying a possible deal under which he would voluntarily go
to Spain.
</P>
<P>
"Senator Pinochet is not prepared to answer to Spanish
justice," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
He said an interview published in a leading Chilean daily on
Sunday, which claimed Pinochet had taken responsibility for human
rights abuses during his 1973-1990 regime, was "absolute
nonsense".
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who was house arrested in a London hospital last
October, currently lives in a hired mansion outside London.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge accused him of responsibility for the deaths
and disappearances of more than 3,000 people during his 17-year
rule and wanted to extradite him to Spain to face charges.
</P>
<P>
Extradition proceedings against Pinochet are due to start on
September 27.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues to Displace Afghans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between the
Taliban and the North Alliance forces over the weekend displaced
some 10,000 more Afghans from the Shamali valley into Kabul,
capital of Afghanistan, U.N. sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Another major influx of displaced people is expected over the
next few days," said Manoel de Almeida e Silva, deputy spokesman
for the U.N. Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
New arrivals reported that Taliban fighters forced people out
of their homes and told them to walk to Kabul, while intentionally
setting houses on fire, burning villages and crops to deter people
from moving back to the valley, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban fighters who control some 90 percent of the country,
has recently launched the summer offensive before the rainy season
begins.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan is considered one of the biggest sources of
refugees with 2.1 million Afghans reportedly displaced to Iran and
another 1.6 million moving to Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Quit More African Organizations: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 16 (Xinhua)-- Tanzanian Minister of
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Jakaya Kikwete,
said here Monday that his country intends to quit most of the
organizations it currently stays in, except the Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The purpose for Tanzania to do so is to cut down the costs of
membership fees, Kikwete told a press conference. "Tanzania is a
member of many organizations and in all these organizations there
is a question of paying membership fee and other contributions, so
it is wise to feasibly pull out whenever we can," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that time has come for Tanzania to seriously think on
how many organizations the country needs to remain as a member.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete did not mention the organizations Tanzania is
considering to pull out of, nor did he say how much money Tanzania
has spent on the membership fees of various organizations.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Tanzania has invested a lot in SADC and
thus it is better to remain in it because SADC is a more
successful organization in achieving its goals.
</P>
<P>
Recently the Minister of Industries and Commerce Iddi Simba
announced Tanzania's intention to pull out of the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa following a study on how much the
country can benefit from the organization.
</P>
<P>
His announcement was received with mixed feelings. While the
Tanzania Private Sector Foundation threw its weight behind the
intention, Zanzibar's Finance Minister Amina Salum Ally criticized
this idea.
</P>
<P>
Until now SADC has 470 projects worth 8.5 billion U.S. dollars,
70 percent of which came from cooperating partners of SADC and its
own members.
</P>
<P>
So far, SADC members have signed various treaties in the areas
of trade, communication, mining, tourism, transport, as well as
meteorology and diplomatic immunity, he said, adding that more
treaties are in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The 14-member SADC was founded on August 17, 1992 and Tanzania
will hold celebrations to commemorate its 19th anniversary Tuesday
in the capital Dar es Salaam.

<HEADLINE> E. African States Urged to Deal with Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Decision makers for the
telecommunications industry in east Africa have been challenged to
deal with the computer Y2K issue seriously.
</P>
<P>
The challenge was thrown by Jones Kilimbe, a Tanzanian
telecommunication official, when he was officiating an east
African meeting aimed at tackling the millenium bug.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is to address the Y2K problem in the
telecommunications in the region so as to improve the industry's
management.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also aims at giving customers in the region the
confidence that the telecommunication infrastructure and reforms
can support their business in spite of the Y2K threats.
</P>
<P>
Kilimbe was speaking on behalf of the state-owned Tanzania
Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL) managing director in Dar
es Salaam Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Not dealing with the Y2K issue seriously in one country could
as well affect other states. We have a duty to ensure that our
companies are Y2K compliant," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kilimbe said every company and organization that has looked
into the problem has found out that the Y2K issue is more
complicated, serious and more costly than originally thought.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the existing business relationships
across the world shows that the Y2K is a global problem requiring
regional co- operation although solutions have to be found at
home.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problems will have a devastating impact on all walks of
life that are directly or indirectly relying on software and
hardware, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Kilimbe further cautioned that a number of industries will be
affected including banking, air travel services, among others. He
cited areas to be affected by Y2K in telecommunications include
terminal equipment at customer premises like telephones, fax
machines and answer machines.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the impact on telecommunication network
components will affect tariff tables, call duration, exchange
systems, management software and date interchange between systems.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K East Africa Telecommunications Tripartite Meeting that
draws participants from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania will end
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped Foreigners Sound and Safe: Iranian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The four foreign tourists
kidnapped in Iran's southern province of Kerman along with their
Iranian guide are sound and safe, a provincial official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, the
official said that local law enforcement forces reported that
one of the kidnapped had called up a law enforcement center,
notifying them of their well being.
</P>
<P>
However, further communication could not be continued due to
the inability of the law enforcement personnel to speak a foreign
language, said Mohammad Ali Karimi, the provincial
politico-security official.
</P>
<P>
Three men and two women armed with automatic weapons abducted
the five hostages from a hotel in Kerman.
</P>
<P>
The three Spanish tourists, two of them priests, were
identified as Pedro Garcia, Joaquin Fernandez and Cosme Puerto,
and the Italian captive Mas simo Cattabriga.
</P>
<P>
"Necessary measures have been taken to get the release of
the foreigners and Iranian kidnapped," said Karimi.
</P>
<P>
He said the village elders in the area and the Sheh-Baksh
tribal chiefs were intervening for an early release of the
kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers are members of a Baluch tribe but the
Sheh-Baksh tribal chiefs are pious and loyal to the government.
</P>
<P>
"The kidnapping incident follows a successful operation last
week by the law enforcement forces in Kerman against drug
traffickers," said Karimi.

ABUJA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Monday left for Maputo, the Mozambican capital, to
attend the summit of the Southern African Development Community

<P>
The president, who was sworn in on May 29, after 15 years of
military rule, was invited to participate as a guest of the
summit which is scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.

The summit expected to be dominated by the crisis in Angola and
 the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Obasanjo is expected to
deliver an address on the need for peace and reconciliation on the
crisis-ridden continent.
</P>
<P>
His address would seek to expand on "peace and reconciliation,"
a major plank of his African foreign policy, which also dominated
his speech to the 35th OAU summit in the Algerian capital last
month, where he proposed to make the continent crisis-free by next
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Development
Program (UNDP), together with some European countries, has
provided 5 million U.S. dollars to create jobs and support
rehabilitation efforts in Cabra, a war-torn village in Kosovo, a
Serbian province, a UNDP news release said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The program is being launched this week with support from the
UNDP and the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is expected to expand quickly into other
villages and provide employment for 10,000 people. Jobs will be
created for unemployed youth, demobilized soldiers and others
affected by the war, in which the U.S.-led NATO unilaterally
staged 79-day air strikes against Yugoslavia without the
authorisation of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
While providing employment that is desperately needed by many
Kosovars, the project will also rehabilitate public
infrastructure, restore basic services, such as water and
electricity, and improve the local environment, the news release
said.
</P>
<P>
In Cabra, not a single home was left standing after the air
strikes, the news release said. So far, some 200 people have
returned with hopes of rebuilding their lives.

<HEADLINE> Joint Venture Started in Nigeria for Gas Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. oil giant Chevron Corporation
 Monday signed a joint venture agreement with partners including
Royal Dutch Shell and Nigeria's state gas firm for a West African
gas pipeline project, said Nigerian officials Monday.
</P>
<P>
Other shareholders in the project include the state gas
companies of Benin, Togo and Ghana, according to reports in the
west Africa's capital.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement for a 400 million U.S. dollars
pipeline project to supply Nigerian gas to regional neighbors
including Benin, Togo and Ghana was originally expected in
Cotonou, Benin last week, but was delayed due to a dispute on a
personnel appointment in the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
The project, designed to be completed by 2002, was aimed to
boost Nigeria's revenue and change the country's total reliance on
oil output.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria would take about 25 percent equity in the project,
which would not only reduce gas currently flared in its oil fields
but also foster regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline will initially ship about 120 million cubic feet
of Nigerian gas per day.

<HEADLINE> HK Plans to Create More Job Opportunities for Young People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) plans to create over 13,000 new job
opportunities for young graduates in the next six months, a local
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wong, secretary for Education and Manpower, told a press
briefing that the unemployment rate is continuing to be stabilized.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the provisional seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate in the last two months was 6.0 percent, and the provisional
underemployment rate was 2.9 percent, according to the latest
labor force statistics released Tuesday by the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
"There have been some encouraging signs of improvement in the
employment opportunities for our workers in the past few months,"
Wong said.
</P>
<P>
In July, the Local Employment Services of the Labor Department
secured 12,600 job vacancies, which represents a 12-percent
increase over the previous month. In the same period, over 4,000
people successfully found jobs through the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
Over 13,000 new job opportunities will be created by a number
of major infrastructural projects in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
In July, about 1,100 applications were approved under the
Special Finance Scheme for Small and Medium Enterprises,
benefiting almost 1,000 companies.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming few months, as there will be quite a large
number of young graduates leaving school for further education and
employment, we have decided to expand the capacity of the
government evening schools and our various vocational training
institutes to accommodate the graduates who wish to upgrade
themselves," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The Vocational Training Council (VTC), the Construction
Industry Training Authority, and the Clothing Industry Training
Authority will intensify their training efforts in the coming
school year both by increasing their training capacity as well as
by offering new courses that focus on the provision of
comprehensive training, Wong said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan, Rwandan Leaders Meeting on Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Talks between leaders of Ugandan
and Rwanda are still underway in a bid to resolve their
differences which led to the weekend clashes in Kisangani in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua
Tuesday afternoon in a telephone interview that Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan Vice-President and Minister of Defense
Paul Kagame are still trying to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know when the talks will end but up to now they are
still talking over the matter," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Army Commander Jeje Odongo and State Minister for
Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi are also attending the talks,
she added.
</P>
<P>
In a another report, the British Broadcasting Corporation said
although the two armed forces deployed in the Congo have agreed to
stop fighting, they are still firing at each other in Kisangani,
the third largest city in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere there is still tense and hostility between the
traditional allies remains, the report said, adding that a total
of over 60 civilians have died in the clashes since weekend.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have been backing rival factions of the
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), the main rebel group in the
Congo, after it split in May.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda supports Emile IIunga who is based in Goma close to
Rwandan border while Uganda throws its weight behind Ernest Wamba
dia Wamba who was ousted from the RCD leadership and is now
headquartered in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
The weekend clashes are widely believed to be an inevitable
outcome of the two countries' deepening differences over rebels'
strategies to be used to topple Congolese President Laurent
Kabila.

<HEADLINE> India to Pursue Minimum Nuclear Deterrence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- India shall pursue a doctrine
of credible minimum nuclear deterrence, a draft nuclear doctrine
released by the National Security Advisory Board said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra told reporters that
the draft has been submitted to the National Security Council and
thrown open for a public debate.
</P>
<P>
It was a consensus document of 27 board members and a decision
on it would be taken by the new government after the Lock Sabha
elections, he added.
</P>
<P>
The document said that the fundamental purpose of Indian
nuclear weapons is to deter the use and threat of use nuclear
weapons by any state or entity against India and its forces.
</P>
<P>
It indicated that India will not be the first to initiate a
nuclear strike but will respond with punitive retaliation should
deterrence fail.
</P>
<P>
India will not also resort to the use or threat of use of
nuclear weapons against states which do not possess nuclear
weapons, or are not aligned with nuclear weapon powers, it added.
</P>
<P>
It said that the doctrine envisages assured capability to shift
from peacetime deployment to fully employable forces in the
shortest possible time, and the ability to retaliate effectively
even in a case of significant degradation by hostile strikes.
</P>
<P>
The document also stressed that the country's nuclear weapons
shall be tightly controlled and released for use at the highest
political level.
</P>
<P>
The authority to release nuclear weapons for use resides in the
person of the prime minister of India, or the designated
successor(s), it added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if nuclear deterrence had worked in any manner in the
Kagil crisis, Mishra said, "Escalation of the conflict beyond a
certain situation was deterred by the fact that nuclear weapons
were on both sides of the border."
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, he said that "the no-first use doctrine
would still have remained valid."

BANGKOK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet approved
Tuesday the Defense Ministry's streamlining plan for the armed
forces which involve a considerable 17 percent reduction of
manpower in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In line with the government policy to develop Thai armed forces
as a "small and efficient" unit, the cabinet approved the Defense
Ministry's report on the Ministry Reform and Thai Armed Forces
Restructuring, said a news release from the Government House.
</P>
<P>
Under the report the Defense Ministry manpower, including the
three armed forces and the Supreme Command, will be reduced by
72,215 personnel, or around 17 percent of the more than 400,000
existing personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Command proposed to cut some 5,000 personnel by
2006, or 15 percent of its current manpower. The Navy offered to
reduce 17,845 personnel or 17.5 percent, while the Air Force
planned to cut down its personnel by 11,858, or 21.5 percent, by
2007.
</P>
<P>
The biggest manpower cut will be effected by the Army, which
offered to shed 37,512 personnel or 15 percent of its current
force. Under the Army's plan, the three Army Corps will not
recruit new personnel. One of the two special warfare divisions
will be disbanded.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Review Kosovo Legal Code to Conform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- In consultation with
local experts, the United Nations plans to review Kosovo's legal
code to bring it in line with international law, U.N. officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing in Pristina, Nadia Younes, spokeswoman for
the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), said
its head, Bernard Kouchner of France, had met with local judges
and prosecutors and invited them to establish a partnership with
the U.N. mission for the creation of new laws.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, a special advisory group, which included
19 Kosovar legal experts, was established to work in consultation
with UNMIK on refining both the criminal code and laws on
property, customs, social welfare and the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The group will review "the existing legal framework and the
laws applicable in Kosovo with a view to purging it of all
provisions which are inconsistent with the standards recognized in
Europe and the rest of the world," Younes said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kouchner told the meeting of judicial experts that one
of the main aims of the special advisory group would be to draft
laws to eliminate all elements of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, he said, had helped to establish a model for
UNMIK's overall effort to restore civil society and develop
democracy in Kosovo, adding that he also intended to follow the
same consultative procedure in all administrative areas, such as
health and education.
</P>
<P>
Under the Security Council Resolution 1244, which was adopted
on June 10, UNMIK is the supreme civilian administrative body in
Kosovo, a Yugoslav province, until an autonomous government was
elected for the province.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise Moderately in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Tuesday that consumer prices increased just 0.3 percent in July
even though gasoline prices rose sharply and airline fares picked
up at the fastest pace in six years.
</P>
<P>
The 0.3 percent increase in Consumer Price Index, the most
closely watched gauge of inflation, followed two straight months
in which prices remained unchanged, the Department reported.
</P>
<P>
July's inflation report was right in line with many analysts'
expectations and was expected to further ease inflation concerns
in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts and investors continue to believe that despite
the tame inflation reports the central bank will raise interest
rates next week for the second time this year, but they would only
be a quarter of one point.
</P>
<P>
Last month's increase in the CPI was the biggest since a 0.7
percent surge in April, the largest one-month gain in nine years.
That April increase had put the Fed on inflation alert and was
followed by a June 30 Fed increase in interest rates, the first in
two years.
</P>
<P>
The big jump in consumer prices in April resulted from a sharp
increase in gasoline and other energy prices, which shot up 6.1
percent. The overall price moderation in both May and June
reflected a partial retreat in that huge runup.
</P>
<P>
But in July, energy prices surged again, rising 2.1 percent.
That gain accounted for almost half the overall increase in
consumer prices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices, which had soared 15 percent in April, were up
4.3 percent in July and so far this year have climbed 30.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The rise in gasoline prices is coming after the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries cut production and global demand
began to pick up, reflecting economic recovery in many countries
damaged by the world financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, overall consumer prices are rising at an
annual rate of 2.4 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent increase
for all of 1998. This acceleration reflects the rebound in energy
costs, which were rising at a rate of 12.4 percent in the first
seven months of this year after dropping 8.8 percent for all of
1998.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, food prices rose just 0.2 percent in July,
after no change in June. A big 3 percent drop in fresh fruit
prices helped offset a 2.5 percent increase in vegetable prices in
July.
</P>
<P>
Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, prices were up
just 0.2 percent. And so far this year, this core rate of
inflation is rising just 1.7 percent, even better than last year's
2.4 percent rise. It has been this moderation that has led many
economists to argue that the Fed does not need to be worried that
inflation is getting out of control.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest price increases outside of food and energy
was in airline fares, which jumped 6.5 percent in July, the
largest increase since October 1992. Airline fares had fallen in
May and June.
</P>
<P>
Clothing prices, however, fell for the third straight month, a
big 0.9 percent drop in July that reflected heavy discounting.

<HEADLINE> CISM President Praises Organizing Work at Military World Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Cao Li
</P>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 17 (Xinhua) -- International Military Sports
Council (CISM President Colonel Gianni Gola highly praised the
organizing work at the Military World Games here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Not only the preparation was very good, but the organizing was
outstanding," Gola told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Gola said the sports facilities, accommodation and
transportation were all excellent, showing good co-operation
between Croatian Armed Forces, the organizing committee and the
civilian organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The message of friendship and peace have been sent from Zagreb
here," said the colonel.
</P>
<P>
"The success of these games is an important step forward after
the start of the major sports event in Rome four years ago," Gola
added.
</P>
<P>
Gola said he had thought during the August holiday period there
would not be many spectators at the competitions but the actual
attendance impressed him.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Josip Lucic, head of the organizing
committee, said it was estimated that 200,000 people watched the
games on the venues.
</P>
<P>
A score of CISM records have been broken here, including 15
from the athletics competition.
</P>
<P>
Gola said the United States has expressed its intention to host
the next games in 2003 but there has yet to be any final agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said several American cities, which have interest in bidding
for the Olympic Games in 2012, hope to test their capabilities by
hosting such a multi-sport event.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Better Cooperation With Portugal on Troop-stationing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China and Portugal have achieved
little substantive progress in the concrete arrangements for China
's stationing of troops in the future Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
"The Portuguese side still expects to make diplomatic contacts
with China and exchange views about the matters related to troop-
stationing in Macao," said Han Zhaokang, chief representative of
the Chinese side of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG).
</P>
<P>
Han made the statement in Macao on Tuesday following a meeting
with his Portuguese counterpart Santana Carlos.
</P>
<P>
In September of 1998, Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
announced in Beijing that China's Central Government would send a
certain number of troops to Macao after China resumes the exercise
of sovereignty over Macao on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
The decision met with enthusiastic favorable responses from the
local residents who believe that the troops would help maintain
fine social order and curb crimes.
</P>
<P>
"To make the issue (of concrete arrangements for troop-
stationing) resolved in time and in appropriate ways, the Chinese
side has exerted great efforts, shown full flexibility and given
reasonable suggestions since we put forward the issue inside the
Sino-Portuguese JLG last winter," Han Zhaokang said.
</P>
<P>
"If the two sides can proceed with consideration of the overall
situation of the relationship between the two countries and the
long-term benefits of Macao, the question can be resolved properly,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Portugal withdrew its troops from Macao in the mid-1970s.

<HEADLINE> 115,000 EU Laborers Quit Agricultural Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- About 115,000 full-time farm
workers left agricultural sector in European Union (EU) last year,
representing a slowed decline rate for the fifth year in a row
despite the long-term downward trend, said a EU report published
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU Statistical Office, Eurostat, said in a report that the
decrease of agricultural labor force represented a 1.7 percent
fall for the 15 EU member countries, a slowed decline rate as
compared with a five percent fall in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
The decreases of farm work in 1998 were recorded in 13 EU
members, ranging from 1.5 percent in Italy and Luxembourg to 4.1
percent in Germany. While Netherlands and Spain recorded 1.3
percent and 1.2 percent rises respectively.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the share of agricultural employment in total EU
employment will "almost certainly have fallen" from the 4.6
percent of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the continuing fall in labor, output rose by an
estimated 1.5 percent in total, reflecting further labor
productivity gains," the Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 fall encompasses an equivalent loss of some 130,000
family workers but a small rise in non-family labor volume. It "
seems to confirm a slow underlying structural shift towards hired
labor," it added.
</P>
<P>
The development reflected in the report are influenced largely
by those in Italy, Spain and France. The three countries account
for over half of all EU agricultural labor forces.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat also said the farm labor force is still on the
track of decline because the number of farms has fallen sharply,
leading to the loss of agricultural labor force, and technological
changes "have seen the substitution of manual labor with machinery
".
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, there might have been relatively brighter
economic prospects for the agricultural work force in other
sectors of the economy as personal expectations, environments and
requirements have changed," the report concluded.

HONG KONG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Taiwan-
based "Alliance for the Reunification of China" led by its
President Chyung-en Wu arrived here Tuesday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Delegation members held a meeting Tuesday afternoon with some
Hong Kong members of the China Council for the Promotion of
Peaceful Reunification.
</P>
<P>
Lo Man Tuen, an executive member of the China Council for the
Promotion of Peaceful Reunification, told the Taiwan visitors that
a peaceful reunification between both sides of the Taiwan Straits
is the common desire of the Chinese people both at home and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's economic development needs the huge market of the
mainland, and both sides are strongly supplementary each other in
economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on both sides of the Taiwan Straits to hold political
talks as soon as possible, and open the direct postal, commercial
and transport services across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
Lo also refuted Lee Teng-hui's "two-state" assertion, saying
that the Taiwan authorities should see clearly the situation and
return to the "one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Lo's speech, the Taiwan visitors said the peaceful
reunification is an irreversible historical trend, and expressed
their wish for deeper understanding between both sides of the
Taiwan Straits.

<HEADLINE> Russian Commander Sees Bigger Role for Strategic Nuke Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The commander of the Russian
Strategic Rocket Forces said Tuesday that Russia will put more
emphasis on nuclear deterrence as weak economy hinders the
development of the general army.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the army newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda, or
Red Star, Colonel-General Vladimir Yakovlev said at a time when
economic difficulty is hampering the development of general-
purpose forces, Russia pins great hope on its nuclear deterrence
forces, and especially their main component -- the combat-ready
strategic rocket forces.
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev said the role of Russia's strategic nuclear forces is
increasing in the present-day situation. "Today we have every
right to talk about extended nuclear deterrence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He listed two main priorities in the development and
maintenance of the country's strategic rocket forces: the work on
completing the development of and introducing mobile and fixed-
site "Topol-M" complexes, and the maximum prolongation of the
existing missile complexes' service life.
</P>
<P>
On prospects for the development of the space component of the
strategic rocket forces, he said that the rocket forces would have
"50 to 80 military and dual-purpose space vehicles."
</P>
<P>
He also said that "measures will be taken to create light
carrier rockets on the basis of the decommissioned 'RS-18'
missiles, and to upgrade the medium-class 'Soyuz-2' and heavy '
Proton-M' carrier rockets."

<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Leading officials and experts of
China's State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) denounced Lee
Teng-hui's separatist remarks here today, saying Lee's "two states
" assertion has infringed on China's state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>

have denied the "One China" principle universally acknowledged by
the international community, and has infringed upon China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>

Straits cooperation and relations, and will cause instability in
Taiwan and the Asian Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
They also vowed to firmly support the principles and policies
of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese Government on the
peaceful reunification of the motherland, and obey the orders of

<HEADLINE> G-15 Ministerial Meeting Opens In India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- India Tuesday asked developing
nations to reject attempts by industrialized countries to include
new issues in the ministerial conference of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), scheduled to be held towards the end of the
year in Seattle, the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Trade negotiations can not continue to be an exercise in which
we yield market access even as access obtained by us is thwarted
or undermined," Commerce Minister Ramakrishna Hegde said at the
two-day G-15 ministerial meeting which opened Tuesday in
Bangalore, 2,060 kilometers south of here.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), the Indian
official told the 55 delegates from 16 countries that development
dimension must be restored to its pristine position on the WIO
agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Our domestic constituencies and specially our industry and
trade are asking for a tangible flow back of benefits from
obligations already undertaken in the last round," Hegde told the
meeting, reminding the G-15 trade ministers of the daunting
situation they faced prior to the Seattle round in coming
November.
</P>
<P>
"As the potential of the Uruguay Round of Agreements still
remain to be realized, can we be legitimately asked to gear up to
shoulder further obligations," Hegde added, obviously referring to
the attempts by developed countries to initiate a fresh round of
trade talks at Seattle.
</P>
<P>
He urged the participants to discuss the new proposals
including social clauses and issues relating to environment, and
try to evolve a common ground on issues which could not be taken
on board at any cost and which needed further examination and
refinement.
</P>
<P>
Hegde alleged that WTO work program on new issues had so far
not thrown up any conclusions that would convince members about
the need to have multilateral regimes in these areas, saying
preparatory process at this stage must address concerns relating
to implementation of existing agreements.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the current G-15 chairman, asked developing countries
not to allow their differing interests to "obscure" their vision
during the forthcoming WTO ministerial meeting in which developed
nations were expected to attempt to erect non-trade barriers by
raising new issues.
</P>
<P>
"Coordinating our positions is of utmost importance at the
various stages of negotiations, starting from setting the
negotiation agenda until its final conclusion," Egyptian Trade
Minister Ahmed Goweily reportedly said at the inauguration
meeting.
</P>
<P>
G-15 came into being during the 9th Non-Aligned Summit in
Belgrade in September 1989, with the intention to create a
functional and compact group of developing countries that could
focus on South-South economic cooperation supported by political
engagement at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
With a combined gross domestic product of over 2 trillion U.S.
dollars and a trade turnover of 600 billion U.S. dollars, annual
export growth in these countries continued to linger around 4.3
percent.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Vehicle Sales Rise 76.3 Pct in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle sales in Thailand soared
76.3 percent in July to 16,841 compared to the same month last
year, a leading auto maker said in a statement here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But Toyota Motor Thailand Co. Ltd., which compiles official
vehicle statistics for Thailand, said sales in July declined some
15.4 percent compared to June's 19,900.
</P>
<P>
It said that the drop in sales from June was due to a rush to
buy vehicles before price goes up.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles sales for the first seven months of this year in
Thailand rose 28.2 percent to 102,350 units, said the statement.
The industry has set a sales target of 200,000 for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports of automobiles, motorcycles and parts
increased by over 40 percent in the first half of this year,
according to the statistics released by the Federation of Thai
Industries at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Thailand produced 133,288 units of
automobiles, an increase of 110 percent from the same period last
year.

<HEADLINE> PLA to Crush Any Separatist Attempts: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Army Daily, the
official organ of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA),
carries a commentator's article Wednesday, pledging to crush any
separatist attempts.
</P>
<P>
The article is focused on refuting Lee Teng-hui who recently
said that the island province has the "strength" to back his "two
states" remark.
</P>
<P>
The article says that Lee is playing with four cards and the so-
called "strength" card he has played most frequently, it says.
</P>
<P>
The article reveals that Taiwan has increased its purchase of
sophisticated weapons from the United States and other Western
nations. Taiwan's imports of arms totaled 11.31 billion U.S.
dollars-worth between 1994-98, ranking first in the world.
</P>
<P>
Lee has used the Taiwan people's money to modernize Taiwan's
army, which has made Lee bolder and strengthened his ambition to
split the motherland, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Lee's proteges have even said that Taiwan, if necessary, could
attack Hong Kong or Shanghai with missiles, it says.
</P>
<P>
Lee is wrong, the article stresses, saying that military
strength is an important factor, but morality and justice play the
decisive role.
</P>
<P>
The article continues by saying that dollars can buy weapons
but not morale. Man is the most important factor of all for an
army, it says.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese troops must have poor morale, as Lee's separatist
actions are against the will of the Chinese people as well as
international law, the daily says.
</P>
<P>
The article calls on Lee to give up his illusion and be clear
about the PLA's five-decade efforts for modernization, saying that
the PLA is willing to lose hundreds of troops but not a single
inch of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
The paper goes on to recall that more than five decades ago the
PLA defeated the eight million Kuomintang-led troops, with
outdated weaponry, and today the modernized PLA is fully ready,
confident and capable of crushing any attempts to split the
motherland.

<HEADLINE> Former Serf Eyes Gold at National Ethnic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Putting behind those days when he
was slaved by serf owner, Gesang Namje set his sight on a gold
medal at the Sixth National Ethnic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I am a sure shot at the horse walk gold medal," said the 60-
year-old Gesang Namje who did not hide his ambition though it is
his first time to compete in such event.
</P>
<P>
Gesang Namje, a crack horse racer since his youth, reeled off
the know-how when talking about the ethnic sport.
</P>
<P>
"The event has exact demand on the horses, and the racer is
supposed to understand the nature of horses. When racing, horses
should be graceful and steady in its gait to let the racers feel
comfortable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past such quality horses were only available to the
noble. When they felt uneasy on horseback, they would let out
their anger by whipping relentlessly the serf who trained horses,"
recalled Gesang Namje, who had raised and trained horses for serf
owners in his teens.
</P>
<P>
Gesang Namje handled the horse proficiently, exuding full
confidence and high spirits. He was excited about the chance to
attend such sports gala which draws about 31 ethnic minorities
from across the country.
</P>
<P>
"We former serfs used to be the 'live stock who can speak'. We
have no freedom, even if we could join in the horse racing. We are
no more than a laughing stock for the serf owners," said Gesang
Namje.
</P>
<P>
"They drank wine each day while we shed tears," he added.
</P>
<P>
His tone rose when he changed his topic to the National Ethnic
Games which is to open here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a completely different story now," he said. "We
came here not only to put up great performance, but also to
demonstrate the encouraging outlook of the Tibet Autonomous Region
and show off our spirits and morale."

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Refuses Negotiation With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos said here Tuesday that his government will not
negotiate with the UNITA rebels led by its Chairman Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos said this at the event marking the 19th birthday of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC), of which the
Angolan president was one of the founding fathers.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his government has always following the
U.N.-brokered 1994 Lusaka peace accord while Savimbi has violated
it by renewing the war.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace agreement should be the base of any new peace
initiative for Angola, dos Santos pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the possibility of talks with the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) at a time when the
rebels are not so strong as it was.
</P>
<P>
The president said that it is the obligation of his government
to defend its people against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Aldemiro Vaz da Conceicao, spokesman for dos Santos, said in
Luanda Monday that Angola expects from other SADC members
"understanding for its internal problem and solidarity."
</P>
<P>
"The SADC should carry out the goals for which it was created,
which are to increase cooperation between the countries of the
region, politically and economically," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano Tuesday called
for group efforts for peace and development in the region, urging
mutual trust and confidence among member states.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said Monday that the Angolan government needed
material and political support in its fighting against the UNITA
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman of the SADC noted that a possible military
intervention in the Angolan crisis depends on the discussion at
the SADC summit, hinting that the suggested military intervention
will materialize if the leaders decide that it is the best way to
bring an end to the 24- year war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"We need a clear position as far as all the countries are
concerned," the Mozambican president said.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing in Maputo Sunday, South African Foreign
Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who also chairs the SADC Council
of Ministers, noted that Angola did not raise the possible
military intervention by its SADC neighbors at the two-day
ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The war in Angola since 1975 has been ravaging for both the
southern African country and the region as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Cabinet Urged to Work Together With Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a meeting with Putin, who was confirmed on Monday by the
State Duma, or lower house of parliament, Yeltsin promised him a
degree of independence, but warned that he should not stray too
far from Kremlin policies.
</P>
<P>
"Let's not divide the presidential office and the cabinet,"
Yeltsin told Putin, the fifth prime minister named by Yeltsin in
17 months. "When they were divided, it didn't lead to any good."
</P>
<P>
"A prime minister could only lose, and that is natural,"
Yeltsin told Putin, in remarks broadcast on Russian television.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin gave no reason for the ouster of Putin's predecessor,
Sergei Stepashin, but Russian media have speculated Stepashin lost
his job for appearing too weak to defend the Kremlin's interests
in the run-up to the parliamentary and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"We shall work together, respecting each other and having
counsel on serious issues," he told Putin during a 25-minute
conversation in front of Russian journalists. "At the same time, I
'm allowing independence. It's not necessary to consult me on
small details."
</P>
<P>
Most of the ministers of the so-called power ministries would
retain their jobs except Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov,
who will be replaced by the former Acting Prosecutor General Yuri
Chaika.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has criticized Krasheninnikov for not being aggressive
enough in investigating the Communist Party's activities.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin re-appointed the foreign, defense, interior and
emergency ministers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian media quoted Kremlin sources as saying that
Yeltsin might appear in the government headquarters Thursday for
the first time in 14 months to chair the new cabinet's first
meeting in a sign of his intention to cooperate with the
government.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Slammed by Former Followers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- People across the country
continued to slam Falun Gong and its founder Li Hongzhi, further
exposing the harm the cult did to them and to society.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lan, head of Falun Gong's general station in southwest
China's Yunnan Province, said Falun Gong had inflicted a great
deal of harm on her and other practitioners.
</P>
<P>
"Those years, I did a lot of things that I deemed right.
Actually, I was playing the jackal to the tiger," she said, adding
that she felt very regretful for her past activities.
</P>
<P>
Wang realized the malicious fallacies of Falun Gong when the
truth about the illegal gatherings outside Zhongnanhai, the
compound that houses the central government, was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Now, she has cut all ties with the illegal organization and
advised former practitioners to quit as well. "It's the Party's
wise policy that has saved me and other Falun Gong followers," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Suying's family in the southwest China city of Chongqing
also felt grateful for the Party and the government's timely
decision on the issue of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Her husband picked up Falun Gong in 1997, hoping that it would
improve his health. He refused to see doctors or take any medicine,
but his health declined quickly and he was having difficulty
breathing.
</P>
<P>
"If my husband continued with Falun Gong and saw no doctors, he
would no longer be here," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
However, many other families were not so lucky as Liu's. The
latest figures from Yunnan Province show that over 30 people have
died as a direct result of practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
"Li Hongzhi is the real killer," said Wang Jianwei, whose
father died after practicing Falun Gong for about two years. "
There is no justice in the world if Li and his likes are not
punished," he said.

<HEADLINE> Professor Calls for Attention to Male Reproductive Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese professor has called
for attention to male reproductive health in Asian countries, in a
bid to improve the quality of Asian population, and develop new
contraceptive methods for males.
</P>
<P>
In an article carried in the latest issue of the Asian Journal
of Andrology, Wang Yifei, a professor with the reproductive health
and research department of the World Health Organization, pointed
out the importance of the participation and coordination of males
in improving reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
The journal, inaugurated in June by the Shanghai Institute of
Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, mainly
publishes articles on family planning and research into male-
related diseases.
</P>
<P>
The population problem will continue to be a major one for
Asian countries over the next few years. However, studies of
andrology lag far behind those on females, he said.
</P>
<P>
For example, among the 20 million couples in China who have
adopted contraceptive measures, the majority of users are women.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sex tourism and prostitution industries in some
Asian countries also threaten the reproductive health of their
people.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that eight million to 10 million men, women and
children in Southeast Asian countries will be affected by the AIDs
virus by the end of this century, accounting for 25 percent of the
world's total, according to the professor.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Team in Moscow for ABM, START III Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. delegation arrived here
Tuesday for the first round of expert consultations with Russia on
the Anti-Ballistic Missiles (ABM) treaty and the third stage of
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START III).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation led by John Holum, Under Secretary of State
for Arms Control and International Security Affairs, will start
consultations with the Russian side late Tuesday, the Interfax
news agency reported, quoting diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side is headed by Grigory Berdennikov, Director of
the Foreign Ministry Department for Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Such consultations were prompted by Washington's plans to
develop a national anti- ballistic defense system to allegedly
protect the U.S. against unfriendly regimes, which Moscow
considers to be a violation of the 1972 ABM treaty prohibiting the
deployment of such defensive systems, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
On START, the U.S. delegation will press the Russian State Duma,
or lower house of parliament, to approve START II, under which
both Russia and the United States would cut their nuclear arsenals
each to 3,000-3,500 warheads, before active work to draft the
START III treaty that would further cut the two sides' nuclear
stockpile to 2,000-2,500 warheads each.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. Congress having ratified the START II in 1996, the
State Duma's efforts to approve the treaty had been repeatedly
hampered by U.S. actions that Russian deputies considered hurting
Russian interests, such as the bombing of Iraq and especially the
air campaign against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Slammed by Former Followers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- People across the country
continued to slam Falun Gong and its founder Li Hongzhi, further
exposing the harm the cult did to them and to society.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lan, head of Falun Gong's general station in southwest
China's Yunnan Province, said Falun Gong had inflicted a great
deal of harm on her and other practitioners.
</P>
<P>
"Those years, I did a lot of things that I deemed right.
Actually, I was playing the jackal to the tiger," she said, adding
that she felt very regretful for her past activities.
</P>
<P>
Wang realized the malicious fallacies of Falun Gong when the
truth about the illegal gatherings outside Zhongnanhai, the
compound that houses the central government, was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Now, she has cut all ties with the illegal organization and
advised former practitioners to quit as well. "It's the Party's
wise policy that has saved me and other Falun Gong followers," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Suying's family in the southwest China city of Chongqing
also felt grateful for the Party and the government's timely
decision on the issue of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Her husband picked up Falun Gong in 1997, hoping that it would
improve his health. He refused to see doctors or take any medicine,
but his health declined quickly and he was having difficulty
breathing.
</P>
<P>
"If my husband continued with Falun Gong and saw no doctors, he
would no longer be here," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
However, many other families were not so lucky as Liu's. The
latest figures from Yunnan Province show that over 30 people have
died as a direct result of practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
"Li Hongzhi is the real killer," said Wang Jianwei, whose
father died after practicing Falun Gong for about two years. "
There is no justice in the world if Li and his likes are not
punished," he said.

<HEADLINE> Opposition on Offensives in Eastern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan opposition alliance
said Tuesday it had launched a series of attacks on Taliban forces
in eastern provinces in a bid to draw their troops away from the
capital Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Opposition spokesman Abdullah said some 80 Taliban soldiers
were killed in the attacks in eastern provinces of Kunar, Laghman
and Nangarhar near the Pakistan border, according to news reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
"One of the aims of these operations is to draw Taliban
soldiers away from Kabul front lines and to put more pressure on
the militia," Abdullah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, news from Kabul said that the Taliban have sent
reinforcements to the eastern provinces to quell the opposition
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have managed to push the Kabul front lines forward
to 50 kilometers north of the capital since they launched their
summer offensive against the opposition in late July.
</P>
<P>
Fighting was heavy Tuesday morning near Asadabad in central
Kunar while the Kabul front lines were quiet, some sources said.
</P>
<P>
Another opposition spokesman, General Sayed Husain Anwari,
Tuesday claimed that the opposition troops captured Pashud
district in Kunar overnight.
</P>
<P>
He said the districts of Daulatshah and Ali Shing in Laghman
and Khiva, Saukai and Darre Noor in Kunar had been captured by the
opposition forces on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban have rejected the claims, only admitting
the fall of Daulatshah district to the opposition.

<HEADLINE> A Wedding Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A bridegroom in Hangzhou in east
China's Zhejiang Province brought a law suit against a wedding-
photography studio for printing the English word "seduction" on
the photo of the newlyweds, the Beijing-based tabloid "Life Times"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The bridegroom, who was identified as Yu, "regarded the word as
indecent, and said it constituted an unbearable insult against the
woman he just married," the tabloid said.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, 1998, Yu and his fiancee had a set of wedding
photos taken in formal but artistic attire, and chose one of them
to be made into a crystalline picture.
</P>
<P>
On January 3 this year, their wedding day, friends and
relatives came to their bridal chamber for a visit, and some of
the guests began to whisper among themselves when they notice the
English word "seduction" printed on a corner of the picture.
</P>
<P>
The bridegroom didn't know English, but noticed the unusual
atmosphere. He asked questions, and was finally told that it meant
"to entice someone into unlawful sexual intercourse."
</P>
<P>
"This incident totally destroyed the happiness at their first
day of marriage, and plunged them into grave anguish," the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The couple finally filed a lawsuit in court on August 3,
demanding a public apology and 200,000 yuan (24,000 US dollars) in
compensation from the photo studio for damages to their reputation.
In addition, their picture must be remade, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, the studio, called "Dragon Photo," does not agree. A
manager name Zhang said that he went to a foreign bookstore to
consult a dictionary, and found that the word also means "charm"
and "attraction."
</P>
<P>
"It is a compliment to the bride, and by no means a slander,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The trial is pending.

<HEADLINE> Chissano Urges Greater Cooperation to End Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano on Tuesday urged African countries to promote cooperation
and unity to rid the region of civil wars and poverty.
</P>
<P>
Chissano, in a speech marking the 19th Anniversary of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), said regional
countries must strengthen cooperation and partnership for "mutual
profits" of peace, progress and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said that working with the spirit of solidarity, people in
the region can achieve the goal of making peace prevail in the
region where there will be no hatred, revenge or fear and where
confidence wins.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the 14-member community were gathering here to
show their commitment to peace and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said today was "a moment of joy and a moment of
reflection".
</P>
<P>
He said that without peace and stability, Africa cannot
achieve economic growth, social progress and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The president outlined several steps towards the achievement of
peace and wiping out of poverty which include:
</P>
<P>
-- Dialogue between parties concerned and unity among regional
states;
</P>
<P>
-- Mutual trust among regional states;
</P>
<P>
-- Transformation of natural resources into wealth that can be
used for all;
</P>
<P>
-- Fair distribution of wealth to ensure that no one will die
in hunger;
</P>
<P>
-- Equity between cities and countryside, and
</P>
<P>
-- Balanced development of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Angolan civil war, Chissano said military
intervention by SADC would need great consideration. This matter,
he said, will be discussed at the SADC summit on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Angolan situation was "complex" and a solution
entails the support of regional countries as well as the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said SADC was "looking for ways for lasting peace" in
the country, noting that he was sure it would not take long to end
the civil war there.
</P>
<P>
"We must condemn all forces of the region that use violence and
crimes as means of conquer power," he said without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed the urgent need to address the debt
issue, saying external debt remains an obstacle to development and
weakens the economies of the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
SADC countries annually devote 30 percent of their public
revenues to the servicing of external debt. He urged developed
countries to write off all debts owed by the poorest countries,
many of them in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has been offered partial cancellation of external
debt. Chissano said the same treatment should be given to other
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
But he noted "partial cancellation is no solution".

<HEADLINE> Australia's Peak Union Leader Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Bill Kelty, Secretary of
Australian Council of Trade Union (ACTU), Tuesday announced his
resignation from the body after 16 years in the post.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Kelty said he would resign on February 15 next
year as secretary of the ACTU, the country's peak union body
representing 2.3 million Australian workers and their families.
</P>
<P>
Described by the Labor Party as the most important trade union
official of the past 50 years, Kelty said the time was right for
him to leave.
</P>
<P>
"It has always been a privilege to work for workers and their
unions," he said in a surprise announcement at a union meeting in
the Victoria state.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement ahead of the release of a major report
on the future of unions on Friday.
</P>

PARIS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The French government has banned a

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Earns About 1b U.S. Dollars from Manpower Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh received 49,326.5
million taka (about 986.53 million U.S. dollars) as remittance by
exporting a total of 149,291 manpower during the last seven months
of this year, Labor and Manpower Minister M.A. Mannan said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The target of manpower export for the year is 245,000 and the
percentage of export during the seven-month period from January to
July against the target is 58.55, Mannan told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The country exported 36,388 manpower to Mideast countries like
Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Libya
against the target of 79,000 during the period, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the target would be fulfilled in the rest of the
months despite economic recession in Singapore and Malaysia," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government took the initiative to legalize the illegal
Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia, and achieved success in
legalizing 150,000 workers through bilateral discussion with
Malaysia in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's volume of manpower export has been increasing
each year since 1995, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics, the Mannan said Bangladesh exported 187,543
manpower in 1995 and 211,714 in 1996, and the number rose to 381,
077 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country's manpower export was 267,677 and the
remittance was 75,133.1 million taka (about 1,502.66 million
dollars), according to the minister.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Cuts Oil Lifting Licences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has pruned
crude oil lifting licences from 50 to 16 and firstly selected
South Africa and Kenya in the list of crude oil lifting
contractors to market the nation's crude oil under one-year
contracts.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in capital Abuja on Monday, Jackson
Gaius-Obaseki, managing director of Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC), said that his company had awarded contracts
to 16 companies to export equity crude with effect from October 1
this year, This Day newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 16 contractors will export a total of 865,000 barrels of
crude oil daily, out of which South Africa is allocated 55,000
barrels daily, both the National Oil Corporation of Kenya and the
Ghana National Petroleum Corporation respectively 30,000 barrels
daily.
</P>
<P>
Gaius-Obaseki said at the signing of the joint venture
agreement on the West African Gas Pipeline project that 10 of the
companies selected are reputable international trading companies,
three are refinery operators based in Africa and another three
are NNPC joint venture partners.
</P>
<P>
He explained that out of the 50 applications received by NNPC
to lift crude oil, 12 were actually reputable crude lifting
firms, but the rest were middlemen.
</P>
<P>
Last month, NNPC cancelled 41 existing crude contracts signed
before the inception of the President Olusegun Obasanjo's
administration, including deals with neighboring west African
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the managing director, NNPC's selection was based
on the new crude oil lifting guidelines which were released last
month.
</P>
<P>
Under the new guidelines, the companies have to be major
industry players with a minimum annual turnover of 100 million
U.S. dollars and a net worth of no less than 40 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Joins Luzhkov in Russian Major Political Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Tuesday formally announced an alliance with Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov in a move that would have major implications in
Russia's political landscape.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov and Primakov are seen as two of the strongest potential
candidates in next year's presidential poll, although neither has
formally announced plans to run.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov's Fatherland movement recently united with the "All
Russia" movement, a powerful bloc of regional governors, and
Primakov's addition will make the coalition even stronger.
</P>
<P>
Primakov was named chairman of the Coordinating Council of the
Fatherland-All Russia election union.
</P>
<P>
The alliance plans to campaign for parliamentary elections in
December, and a strong showing will help either Luzhkov or
Primakov in next year's presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin has tried to thwart the alliance, and former Prime
Minister Sergei Stepashin's reluctance to lead these efforts and
his weakness in dealing with Kremlin foes were seen as the reasons
behind his ouster on August 9.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- In a merger of 2.5 billion U.S.
dollars, Houston's Burlington Resources has swallowed up Calgary's
Poco Petroleum Ltd. to create one of the top four natural gas
producers in North America, Canadian media said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With the announcement of the merger Monday, Burling began to
assume Poco's debt of about 1.1 billion Canadian dollars (about
742 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 157 million Poco shares, each of which is valued about 16.
78 Canadian dollars (11.3 U.S. dollars), are put at an exchange of
one-quarter of Burlington share each, according to the media.
</P>
<P>
Poco's president Craig Stewart was quoted as saying that by
joining Burlington, the 20-year-old Calgary company would enjoy
added resources for its exploration programs in western Canada.
</P>
<P>
"In order to meet increasing need for natural gas in North
America, more wells will have to be drilled," he said, adding "
Burlington are committed to doing that."
</P>
<P>
Jointly the two companies held total reserves of 9.9 trillion
cubic feet at the end of last year, with combined gas production
capacity at 2.1 billion cubic feet per day, the media said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China Life Insurance Company (
China Life), the country's largest insurance firm in term of
turnover, reported remarkable business growth in the first half
this year, despite an adverse macroeconomic situation.
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the company show that its premium revenue
in the first six months stood at 30.33 billion yuan, which is up
20 percent over the same period of 1998, and accounts for 60
percent of the firm's target for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
He Jiesheng, the general manager of China Life, said at the
company's half-year working meeting that this achievement has been
made in the face of lukewarm domestic demand, strong competition,
and the seventh consecutive interest rate cut by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
To keep losses from these adverse factors at a minimum, she
said the company has strengthened its stimulative mechanism and
designed 13 new policies, as many old policies based on high
interest-rate expectations were banned by the government after the
seventh interest rate cut on June 10.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1999, the company separated itself from
the former China Insurance Group and adopted its current name. It
took the opportunity to launch a corporate image offensive,
stressing its role as the sole state-owned life insurer and the
number-one strongman in the sector in terms of premium revenue.
</P>
<P>
She pledged that the company will further improve its capacity
in the development of new policies, which will cater to the needs
of people from different regions and different income groups.
</P>
<P>
She added that the company will seek to expand investment
channels for its funds, which means it will use all legal channels
to ensure the safety and growth of those funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China's economy has grown to be
the seventh-largest in the world since the founding of New China
five decades ago.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) today, China's gross domestic product grew from
67.9 billion yuan in 1952 to 7,955.3 billion yuan in 1998. The
average annual growth rate of the economy was 7.7 percent in the
period, far higher than the world's average of around three
percent.
</P>
<P>
China's economy follows those of the United States, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain and Italy in size.
</P>
<P>
China now produces the largest crops of grains, meat, cotton,
peanuts, rape seed and fruits in the world, and the third-largest
crops of tea, soybean and sugar cane. It is also the world's
largest producer of steel, coal, cement, fertilizers and TV sets
in the world, and the second-largest producer of electricity,
cotton cloth and chemical fiber. Its outputs of sugar and crude
oil rank fourth and fifth, respectively, in the world.
</P>
<P>
The country's continuously improving industrial layout has
basically eliminated the bottlenecks in the economy over the past
five decades. In that period, China increased its output of
electricity 276 times, thus ending the history of electricity
shortage in the country. At the same time, the total length of
railway lines increased by 1.6 times to 57,600 km, and the total
length of highways increased 14.8 times, to 1.279 million km.
Meanwhile the country's telephone network has become the second-
largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five decades, China has fed 22 percent of the
world's population with only ten percent of the world's arable
land. In addition, it has doubled the per capita output of grain,
tripled the per capita output of cotton and boosted the per capita
output of oil-bearing crops 2.9 times. It has also increased its
per capita output of aquatic products 36.6 times and per capita
output of meat 7.7 times.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Says Guinea Provides Artillery Shielding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Liberia has accused Guinea of
supporting its rebels with artillery and said it would ask allies
to help defend its territory, according to reports reaching here
from Liberian capital Monrovia Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Defense Minister Daniel Chea said Monday in Monrovia
that west African countries should act quickly to prevent the
latest fighting in Liberia from spreading into a regional
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Chea said that artillery fire from Guinea was impeding
government troops'

efforts to dislodge rebels who attacked last week and seized
scores of hostages in the area.
</P>
<P>
He said fighting was continuing in Lofa County, a Liberian
territory bordering Guinea, where Liberian President Charles
Taylor had declared a state of emergency last week.
</P>
<P>
"As of this morning our people are engaged in dislodging the
dissident forces out of Voinjama," he said referring to the
region's main town.
</P>
<P>
Every time government troops make some progress they come under
 artillery fire from the direction of the Guinean border...It
can't be from anywhere else but Guinea," Chea said.
</P>
<P>
"Given the new situation...we're now considering other options
very, very seriously," he said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said earlier on Monday at a meeting in the capital that
Liberia was unable to defend itself because of a U.N. arms embargo
and would ask for troops from its allies.
</P>
<P>
"Under international law we have the right to defend our
territory but our hands are tied," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that Liberia will seek military assistance
from its friends...I am not talking about ordering arms and
ammunition...but I can assure you that we can ask for troops from
friendly countries because we are not armed," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
Recent conflicts between the two neighboring countries
intensified when rebels believed to be based in Guinea seized
several towns of Lofa County and about 100 hostages including six
European aid workers. The hostages were freed Saturday and
allowed to leave for Guinean capital, making it a similar drama
like the one in Sierra Leone earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Taylor ordered the borders with Guinea and Sierra Leone closed
last Wednesday and mobilized government forces for a counter
attack.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government said the rebels are loyalists of
Taylor's rival warlords during the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
Togo which holds the rotating presidency of the 16-nation
Economic Community of West African States began moves at the
weekend to seek a regional solution to the crisis. Officials
said an emergency regional summit was being considered.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA), insisted Tuesday that the IRA was
still operating a ceasefire -- a key condition for it to stay in
Northern Ireland's faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness issued his message
hours before his Tuesday meeting with Northern Ireland Secretary
Mo Mowlam, who would make an announcement on the state of the IRA
ceasefire in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
"The IRA has stated that its cessation remains in tact and I
believe them," McGuinness told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
He said the Unionists were raising questions about the solidity
of the IRA's ceasefire as a "device" to stall progress on
establishing a true peace in the province.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Mowlam met Northern Ireland's security chiefs and
listened to their advices on whether the IRA had broken its
ceasefire by the killing of a 22-year-old Catholic man last month.
</P>
<P>
The Unionist politicians have accused the IRA of murdering an
alleged informer Charles Bennett and have called for Sinn Fein to
be excluded from the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the IRA said its leadership had not sanctioned an alleged
gun-running operation from the United States to Ireland and that
there had been no violation of its ceasefire with the killing of
Bennett -- though it did not deny the shooting.
</P>
<P>
In IRA terms, "military operations" are attacks on London or
security forces, not punishment attacks or killing informers.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness accused unionists led by David Trimble, who have
refused to share power with Sinn Fein until the IRA disarms, of
conducting a "Cold War" with Irish nationalists.
</P>
<P>
Unionists say it is unfair to allow Sinn Fein into power
without the IRA handing in its guns first.

<HEADLINE> Laos Strives to Produce More Than 2 Million Tons of Paddy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Laos is aiming to produce
2,064,000 tons of paddy this year in order to achieve an annual
per-capita output of 400 kg of paddy, Lao official news agency KPL
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 1.6 million tons of paddy is expected from the monsoon
rice cultivation and 155,000 tons from upland rice cropping.
</P>
<P>
The just-completed harvest of the dry-season lowland rice crop
turned out 356,000 tons, 15 percent over the target.
</P>
<P>
To reach the paddy target, the Lao Ministry of
Agriculture-Forestry is paying attention to the provision of
improved rice seeds, fertilizer and pesticide for farmers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, provision of farm tools, investment in
construction and maintenance of irrigation facilities, and
installation of water pumps, are measures being undertaken for a
good yield.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 123,000 ha. of irrigated rice fields in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Feature: SADC Celebrates 19th Anniversary to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC), gearing up to face massive challenges lying
ahead, kicks off grand celebrations here Tuesday to mark its 19th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The capital was in a festive mood, with banners and national
flags of the 14 member countries hanging along streets and on top
of buildings.
</P>
<P>
presidents and kings have arrived to join a well-planned
carnival that includes a parade of school children, a running race
and a football match between Nigeria and Mozambique national
teams. a fireworks display will bring the celebrations to a
climax.
</P>
<P>
The event gives the whole country a holiday off. "I have never
seen people so happy for so many years," Dionisio Mondlawe, a
middle-aged Mozambikan man, said with a big smile.
</P>
<P>
"I hope SADC will attain its goals by bringing all the people
together in the region to ensure a better life for all," said the
man who works for a foreign company.
</P>
<P>
An organizer of the celebrations said the event was organized
to show the collective will, commitment and determination of the
group to work for peace and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"All the people in the region should be proud for the
achievements SADC has made since its founding and we have
confidence that SADC will achieve more in years to come," said the
organizer, who refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
SADC, originally known as the Southern African Development
Coordination (sadcc), was formed in Zambian capital Lusaka on
April 1, 1980, when nine founding member states adopted the Lusaka
Declaration -- Southern Africa: Towards Economic Liberation.
</P>
<P>
On August 17, 1992, the SADCC member states signed a treaty
establishing the Southern African Development Community, which
replaces the SADCC. the treaty places binding obligations on
member countries, with the aim of promoting integration toward a
fully developed common market.
</P>
<P>
The community offers world trade, industry and investment
opportunities in a regional market of 199 million people with a
gross domestic product of 176 billion U.S. dollars. the 14 members
are scheduled to begin tariff reduction from January 1, 2000
aiming to eventually achieve a SADC Free Trade Area within five
years.  Pushed by SADC, economic cooperation and trade
among member states are on full swing. Some member countries like
Mozambique have registered the fastest economic growth in the
African continent, drawing world attention to the region that had
been wrecked by civil wars.
</P>
<P>
In the past recent years, SADC has also played an active role
in mediating regional conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) and Angola. mediation has been gaining momentum since
South Africa and Zambia sent representatives to the DRC earlier
this month to help narrow difference between rival factions.
</P>
<P>
But despite the achievements the SADC boasts of, the group is
beset by a host of political obstacles, notably the prolonged
Angolan civil war and the grim prospects of peace in the DRC. the
recent fighting between government troops and secessionists in
Namibia's Caprivi strip also underlines the potential danger of
new eruption of large scale civil strifes.
</P>
<P>
In ushering in the new millennium, regional governments should
vow to change Africa's image as a continent of war, civil strife,
ethnic tension and genocide, said South African Foreign Minister
Nkosazana Zuma.
</P>
<P>
SADC also faces great difficulties in achieving its economic
goals. last year, the region recorded a positive growth of 1.7
percent, down on the 2.7 percent of 1997 and the four percent
recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Crop failures caused by floods and draughts resulted in food
shortages with a cereal deficit of 2.86 million tonnes for the
1999/20 market year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, sadc's free trade plans have suffered setbacks
following failure by negotiators to resolve difference on clothing
and textiles.
</P>
<P>
The differences are threatening to lead to a trade war between
the region's two leading economies and could further derail the
plan to remove tariffs in the region.
</P>
<P>
The challenges, however, did not dampen the festive mood.
"because of the difficulties, we are more determined to go ahead
and nothing can stop us," said a SADC official. "we are optimistic
that the new millennium will be Africa's renaissance."
</P>
<P>
The celebrations will be followed by a SADC summit which will
focus on political tension, civil strife, HIV/AIDS and poverty,
conference sources said.
</P>
<P>
The gathering is convened at a crucial time in SADC's history,
said Zuma.
</P>
<P>
As these countries entered the new millennium, the question was
whether they were collectively ready to face the massive
challlenges lying ahead, she said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Cabinet Not to Back President Ong's Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said Tuesday that his cabinet had unanimously decided
not to support the re-election of President Ong Teng Cheong
because of his health.
</P>
<P>
Goh told the Parliament that based on the president's medical
reports, "the Cabinet concluded that there was a strong likelihood
the president's health would affect the discharge of his official
duties in the next few years."
</P>
<P>
"For this reason alone, the Cabinet unanimously decided it
could not support the re-election of President Ong should he
decides to stand again," Goh said.
</P>
<P>
The health of the president was not merely a personal matter,
but a matter of state as it could affect the proper function of a
key institution in Singapore's political system, Goh said.
</P>
<P>
S. R. Nathan, a veteran civil servant and Chairman of the
Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies, is set to be
Singapore's second elected president designate by a walkover on
Wednesday after he was declared the sole eligible candidate by the
Presidential Elections Committee on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Schools to Have More, Better Teaching Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Primary and middle schools
across China will be equipped with more and better educational
instruments as part of the drive toward higher-quality education.
</P>
<P>
Linguistic labs, computer labs, and specialized classrooms for
other practical skills will be created in these schools, along
with libraries and facilities for music, the arts, and physical
education.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education has required localities to further
increase investment in educational technologies, and to guarantee
that the investment grows annually.
</P>
<P>
The bulk buying of educational equipment in areas where
conditions are ripe should be done by public bidding, in order to
set up a sound operational and monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry also has asked localities to map out plans for
modern educational technology outfitting and to strengthen
administration.
</P>
<P>
A large gap remains in the level of modern educational material
between large- and medium-sized cities and many rural areas in
China. Computers, the Internet, and multi-media education have
become standard components of school life for many primary and
middle school students in major cities such as Beijing and
Shanghai. Students in poorer areas, however, may still be doing
their homework bending over an earthen bed in the dim light of a
kerosene lamp.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 17 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed
and three others wounded Tuesday in south Lebanon during conflict
with Lebanese guerrillas, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The casualties occurred when an Israeli patrol were ambushed by
guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in
the Wadi Sluqi in the central sector of the Israeli occupied
border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said in a statement that its fighters had killed or
wounded all Israeli soldiers in the clash, but there has been no
immediate official confirmation about casualties from Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
The attack raised to 11 the number of Israeli soldiers killed
in south Lebanon since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
In another development in the day, a Lebanese fisherman was
wounded when Israeli gunship opened fire at his fishing boat off
the coast of Tyre, Lebanon's southern port city.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, the injured Lebanese was transported
to nearby hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a Lebanese army soldier and a member of the
pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) were also wounded during
conflicts between Hezbollah guerrillas and the militia overnight
in the Arab Salim village just outside of the occupied border
zone, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war to
oust Israeli occupation forces and its proxy SLA out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Filipinos in Japan Face Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- At least tens of thousands of
overstaying overseas Filipino workers now in various places in
Japan are threatened with a maximum of three year imprisonment
once they are caught by the Japanese immigration authorities, a
Philippine embassy official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The impending arrests were believed to be the result of the
Japan's parliament's passage last Friday of a bill that imposes a
maximum of three year imprisonment to all overstaying expatriates,
Philippine News Agency quoted Philippine Ambassador to Japan Romeo
Arguelles as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arguelles said the Philippine embassy is now trying to secure
the proper implementing guidelines on the said immigration law
which will possibly trigger a crackdown on the Filipinos in Japan.
</P>
<P>
At present, an estimated 40,000 overseas Filipinos are working
in Japan as entertainers doing manual jobs in various industries.
</P>
<P>
Records show that a number of these workers went to Japan on
tourist visas but they opted to stay to take advantage of Japan's
economic boom, prior to the onset of the financial crisis in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Many of the relatives of these overseas Filipinos have
expressed deep concerns as to the fate of their workers on whom
they have depended so much for their financial support for many
years now.

PARIS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The secretary general of the Force
Ouvriere (FO), Marc Blondel, slammed Tuesday the South Korean
company Daewoo for taking a French public aid fund estimated at
450 million francs (90 million U.S. dollars) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo, which established an electronics park in the eastern
province of Lorraine in France in 1994, will sell the park to the
U.S. Walid Alomar and Associations company to pay its debt.
</P>
<P>
Agency France-Presse (AFP) quoted Blondel as saying that Daewoo
has "used to the maximum the potentials of tax reduction" by the
French government while paying its French employees "the minimum
salary guaranteed."
</P>
<P>
He said that Daewoo's plan to close the electronics park, which
employs 1,700 people including 400 interns, is "a real catastrophe.
"
</P>
<P>
"We should have guarantees, because Europe is not going to
become a passage of premium for people who come and run away," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The FO leader also said that he hopes the friendship between
Europe and South Korea to be built "at the European level and
French level."
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the French government was forced to abandon a plan to
sell the civil electronics part of Thomson CSF defense group to
Daewoo under strong opposition from the unions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua)-- China will intensify its
crackdown on drug trafficking and continue its stern policy on
drug-related crimes, Jia Chunwang, minister of public security
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jia urged narcotics-control departments at all levels to work
harder to frighten and deter drug traffickers and enhance public
awareness and determination against narcotics.
</P>
<P>
He said border and coastal regions should strengthen their
inspection networks and improve their anti-smuggling equipment and
skills, while inland areas should strictly prevent the outflow of
certain chemicals that can easily be used as raw materials for
producing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse and drug trafficking are rampant in some regions,
the minister said, adding that "the small number of drug-rampant
regions have had a tremendously negative impact on the country."
He urged all departments to take resolute and effective measures
to solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
Jia, also director of the National Narcotics Control Commission,
disclosed that the commission has recently pledged to enhance its
supervision over 13 regions for their rampant drug trade.
</P>
<P>
Jia stressed that drug-control departments should devote more
energy to "dealing with major drug cases, criminal rings, and drug-
lords," while attaching the same importance to routine anti-drug
activities.

KAMPALA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni met Rwandan Vice-President and Minister of Defense Paul
Kagame at the Mweya Safari Lodge in western Uganda Monday evening
to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
Radio Uganda reported Tuesday morning that the two leaders
discussed the matter late into the evening, but did not reveal the
contents and outcome of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kagame was accompanied by his deputy chief of staff while
Museveni was accompanied by State Minister for Regional
Cooperation Amama Mbabazi, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports said here Tuesday that at least 50 civilians
were killed in the clashes between the two armed troops in
Kisangani, the third largest city in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC), over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Both sides accuse each other of inciting the clash, which is
the result of their deepening disparities over strategies in the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rwandan government spokesman Wilson Rutayisire was
blaming his Ugandan colleagues for the shoot-out, Uganda's State
Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma said the two neighbors are
still allies despite the small misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday appealed to
both parties to exercise restraint and try to help implement the
Lusaka agreement signed on July 10.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda, allies who have been backing rebels fighting
 Congolese President Laurent Kabila in their year-old rebellion,
chose to support different factions of the rebel group after it
split in May over strategies and tactics to topple the Kabila
administration.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the clashes were the latest hurdle to the
implementation of the Lusaka agreement and resolution of the
regional conflict. .
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD) split
into two factions in May this year -- one led by Emile Ilunga and
the other by Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
In May Ilunga ousted Wamba and was named by his supporters as
new leader of CRD. After the wrangle broke out Wamba moved from
Goma to Kisangani and has been insisting that he is still the
leader of the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Uganda backs Wamba while Rwanda backs Ilunga.

<HEADLINE> Brandy Imports Cause White Wine Surplus in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Winemakers who are stuck
with a surplus of white wine have blamed industry giants who
imported brandy to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The wine industry has an excess of 100,000 liters of white
wine, Cape Times newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wine farmers in the Western Cape said three big wine and brandy
 producers -- the KWV, Stellenbosch Farmers' Winery (SFW) and
Distillers Corporation -- held a monopoly in the brandy industry
in South Africa, and that was a huge contributing factor in the
current oversupply of white wine.
</P>
<P>
The farmers spoke to the paper on condition of anonymity
because they believed that the three producers would victimize
them by not buying their white wine.
</P>
<P>
KWV spokesman Henry Hopkins said the wine cooperative's market
research showed three years ago that a demand for brandy would
increase rapidly towards the end of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
SFW and Distillers ordered 2.28 million liters of matured
brandy, mainly from France, and the KWV imported 0.32 million
liters.
</P>
<P>
When the expected demand for brandy did not materialize, the
South African market was flooded with an excess of brandy.
</P>
<P>
According to the farmers, this meant that there was no demand
for white wine from the three producers, which use large
quantities of the wine in distilling brandy.
</P>
<P>
"This situation is dire for us because not only are we unable
to sell our white wine overseas, but we cannot sell it to KWV, SFW
or Distillers who normally buy from us."
</P>
<P>
The KWV said the declining demand for brandy was due to high
interest rates, which have led to a decrease in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
The wine farmers who spoke to the newspaper said the three
brandy producers should have made provision for a downward spiral
in the market.
</P>
<P>
They said stringent export rules make it difficult for them to
market wines overseas. To export one bottle of wine to Britain,
for instance, costs 14 rand (2.3 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
To import one bottle to South Africa costs as little as 25
cents (4.2 U. S. cents).
</P>
<P>
The farmers now blame the South African government for not
putting more regulations in place to protect them against the
imbalance.
</P>
<P>
The wine farmers agreed that the oversupply of white wine was
not a result only of excessive imports of brandy. They said the
South African wine industry reacted too slowly to a decline in
demand for white wine on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Experts blamed the problem on a growing preference in South
Africa's two biggest markets, Britain and the European continent,
for red wines.

<HEADLINE> China's Space Insurance on Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Space insurance has played a
significant role in expanding China's market share in the
international commercial satellite launching service, an
industrial source said here today.
</P>
<P>
The source from the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC)
said insurance has been part of the service package offered to
customers from the day when China started exploring the overseas
market.
</P>
<P>
However, the first overseas commercial satellite underwritten
by the company did not come until 1990, when China's Long March
rocket launched the Asiasat I for the Asiasat company based in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The source who declined to be named said China's space
insurance has undergone three stages since then.
</P>
<P>
The first stage went from the 1980s to early 1990s and was a
period of exploration. PICC was the sole player in the market
during this period.
</P>
<P>
In the second stage which lasted until 1997, the China Pacific
Insurance Company and Ping'an Insurance Company joined the
competition, but PICC still held 95 percent of the market share.
</P>
<P>
The third stage began in August 1997, when the China space
insurance pool, which was chaired by PICC and had eight other
Chinese property insurers as members, was set up according to an
instruction of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The pool was formed as a result of two consecutive failures
suffered by China's Long March rockets in launching the Intersat
708A and the Chinasat VII, which inevitably caused difficulties
for Chinese insurers to arrange reinsurance in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the pool, all the space insurance
policies have been jointly underwritten by the nine insurers.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, since 1990, Chinese insurers have
underwritten 27 commercial satellites launched by China, covering
all risks occurring during the transportation of rockets and
satellites, the launching process and on-track operation of the
satellites.
</P>
<P>
So far the insurers have paid over 200 million U.S. dollars for
liabilities occurred to five satellites, thus greatly reducing
losses caused to the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
For example, in October 1996, two months after the unsuccessful
launching of the Chinasat VII, the PICC paid 25.9 million dollars
to its owner, the China Satellite Telecommunications Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The source noted that with nearly 20 years of experiences and
a team of sophisticated professionals, China's space insurance has
come to the age of maturity and is now on the track for a even
brighter tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> China To Maintain Rational Energy Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China will pay equal attention
to the exploitation of energy resources and energy-saving measures
to ensure sustainable and rational energy development in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
According to Bai Chunrong, an official with the State Economic
and Trade Commission, the country's energy development will focus
on power, and be based on coal, along with the vigorous expansion
of petroleum, gas, and nuclear power, as well as other new and
renewable energy resources.
</P>
<P>
A group of energy-supply bases will come into being nationwide
in the 21st century, with the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi,
Heilongjiang and Guizhou, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region the
major coal suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The upper reaches of the Yellow River and the lower and middle
reaches of the Yangtze River will be bases for supplying
hydropower nationwide, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that onshore oilfields as well as offshore oilfields
will be fully developed to supply enough oil.
</P>
<P>
Along with the development of conventional energy resources,
China will still pay attention to the development of geothermal
energy, wind energy, solar energy, and tidal energy, in order to
optimize the structure of energy consumption, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts here estimate that at the beginning of the next century,
the total consumption of the country's non-renewable energy
resources will reach the equivalent of 1.38 billion tons of
standard coal.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Considering Measures to Curb Dud Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Central Bank is
contemplating new measures to curb the rise of dud or postdated
checks, the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fahim Mo'dad, the bank's vice governor, said in an interview
with the paper that the Finance Ministry was going to provide
stamps for promissory notes to encourage traders and merchants to
accept this form of payment.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Central Bank reported an 11.5 percent increase
in the number of dishonored checks, which between January and July
amounted to 663 million U.S. dollars. This means every month saw
94.7 million dollars worth of checks bounce.
</P>
<P>
Mo'dad attributed the rise in failed payments by check to
economic slowdown and the shortage of cash in the market.
</P>
<P>
"When there is a recession, the phenomenon of dud checks will
rise as a result," the banker said. But he did not think the
government's fiscal policy was responsible.
</P>
<P>
The promissory note would have a maturity period which would be
agreed upon between the issuer and the receiver, Mo'dad said.
</P>
<P>
If the issuer fails to honor his promise when the note becomes
due, his name will go onto a blacklist of the Central Bank and
will face harsh punishment, he added.

<HEADLINE> IMF Criticized for Failure on Poverty Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has been criticized for its failure on poverty alleviation
at the G8 meeting in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Jubilee 2000, a world-wide civic society debt cancellation
campaign front has said that the IMF has neither the capacity nor
the expertise to undertake poverty alleviation in the poorest
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jubilee 2000 coordinators in Zambia, the IMF
was given the task to be involved in poverty alleviation at the G8
meeting in Cologne held in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Tuesday quoted a statement released by
Jubilee 2000 at a meeting here as saying that the efforts shown by
the industrialized countries to salvage the poor countries'
external debt might not be fruitful through the current IMF
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) has nodded the sale of gold
reserves by both the IMF and Britain to raise money for the
external debt rescheduling program for least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
EU head of delegation in Zambia Jochem Krebs said the sale of
gold was well intended and that poor countries like Zambia should
be glad that the step was being undertaken to help implement IMF's
poverty alleviation program.
</P>
<P>
Krebs said African countries that were complaining of adverse
effects of the gold sale were "not very poor and were somewhere in
the middle in economic development."
</P>
<P>
Among the countries worst affected are South Africa and Ghana
who have protested to both the IMF and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Decree Sets Compensation Benchmark for Mental Suffering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
Guangdong Provincial People's Congress recently passed a decree
that sets a benchmark for consumers claiming compensation for
mental suffering.
</P>
<P>
According to the decree, a consumer can claim at least 50,000
yuan in compensation for mental suffering. The decree is the
latest legal move taken by Guangdong to safeguard consumers'
rights.
</P>
<P>
China enacted the Law of the People's Republic of China on
Protection of Consumers' Rights in 1994, which stipulates that
store managers must compensate consumers for mental suffering, but
the law does not go into detail as to the size of the compensation.
</P>
<P>
The newly adopted local decree stipulates that shop managers
who cause mental suffering to consumers by using force, insults,
fabrications, body searches, or in other ways injure the customer'
s human dignity and personal freedom, must be ordered to pay out
at least 50,000 yuan in compensation, in addition to making
apologies.

<P>
SHENZHEN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Overseas banks with permits to
do business in the Chinese yuan in Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province expect to expand their scope.

<P>
Only a stone's throw away from Tian'anmen Square, where gala
activities will be staged on and around October 1, the Grand Hotel
has greatly increased its prices for the National Day season.
</P>
<P>
"A top-floor suite with the best view of the entire square has
been booked for October 1-3 at the price of 3,000 U.S. dollars per
day, 10 times the usual charge," said Mr. Lu of the hotel's sales
department.

"Guests from both home and abroad began making room
reservations as early as a year ago, since we enjoy a prime
location," said Yu Tian of the hotel's public relations department.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the rooms of the century-old Beijing Hotel at the

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
incorporate the private sector into the Central Tender Board so as
to improve transparency and fairness in the tender system, Kenyan
Finance Minister Francis Masakhalia said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted Masakhalia as saying
that the tender board , which has been largely controled by
ministerial officials, will have the private sector as a check
against discipline and red tape.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Tender Board is already chaired by a person from
the private sector. The government also plans to adopt the same
measure to other boards, including the district tender boards,"
Masakhalia said.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the institutional arrangements further, clear
rules and regulations are under preparation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rules will entitle bidders to be briefed on the reasons why
they were unsuccessful in their bidding while the decisions of
the tender boards will be made public, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have been
pressing Kenya to recruit persons from the private sector into the
tendering system to avoid rigging or cheating.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Stresses Development of Local Economies(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
pointed out that the development of local economies based on their
actual conditions is crucial for the wholesome growth of the
national economy, during his August 12-16 inspection tour in
Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
"China's economy is undergoing a strategic restructuring, and
the reform of economic mechanisms is heading for a breakthrough.
Under such circumstances, Yunnan and other provinces and
autonomous regions must fully tap their potentials and develop
local economies with their own characteristics," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
In this light, Yunnan should take full advantage of its natural
resources through developing diversified planting and breeding
industries, as well as tourism, he said.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Yungui Plateau in southwest China, Yunnan enjoys
mild weather which creates a diversity of biological resources and
beautiful natural scenery. The '99 World Horticulture Exposition
is being held in the provincial capital of Kunming thanks to these
advantages.
</P>
<P>
To further promote tourism, a pillar industry in Yunnan, the
province should boost infrastructure construction as well as the
service sector catering to tourists from home and abroad, Zhu
noted.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan also should attach great importance to its education,
for it requires both technology and talented personnel to turn
natural resources into economic growth, he added.

<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' merchandise
trade with the rest of the world for the first half of 1999 posted
a 5.5-percent rise to 30.91 billion U.S. dollars from 29.285
billion dollars in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released Tuesday here by the National

dollars increased by 13.6 percent from 13.906 billion dollars in
the same period of 1998 while imports amounted to 15.107 billion

earlier.
</P>
<P>
The balance in goods amounted to 696 million dollars in favor
of the Philippines, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
For June 1999, receipts from exports rose by 19.5 percent to
2.857 billion dollars from 2.39 billion dollars while payments for
imports reached 2.671 billion, 18.1 percent up from the 2.261
billion dollars in the same month of 1998.

<P>
Since last year's severe flooding, Premier Zhu has shown great
concern for the protection of forests. Wherever he went, he
elaborated on and stressed the importance of preserving China's
forests.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Protection of natural forests is pressing work, and
by delaying efforts by even one day, our losses will add up by one
inch, and our Yellow and Yangtze rivers will not give us peaceful
days."
</P>
<P>
The premier added that "protection of forests should be viewed
from the vantage of the entire nation's economic and social
development, and from the height as something that concerns the
Chinese people's long-term development."
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the country has seen a drastic decrease of
illegal logging, but that there are still some problems hindering
forest protection which need solutions.
</P>
<P>
He said that this effort to protect natural forests on a large
scale comes at a right time when China has become strong enough
economically, especially with an ample grain supply.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that to mobilize enthusiasm of local
governments, enterprises and people for protecting the nation's
forests, the central government will offer compensatory funds for
the reduction of local revenues.
</P>
<P>
Farmers who leave their land for growing trees and grass will
be provided with free grain for a certain period of time, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that small paper mills with timber as their raw
material will be closed down in a planned way, and urged that new
building materials be developed to replace timber.
</P>
<P>
Tough measures will be taken to crack down on illegal logging,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also visited Lijiang County, which suffered heavy losses in
an earthquake three years ago, and praised local efforts in
restoring its historic and traditional look in such a short period
of time.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Seeks Change in Water-Sharing System With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is asking Israel to change
the way it provides water to the kingdom in summer under the water
clauses in the 1994 bilateral peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Jordan proposed to take its summer water share directly from
the Yarmouk River instead of storing the water in Israel's Lake
Tiberias before pumping it into the desert kingdom, Jordan Times
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1994 treaty, Jordan allows Israel to take more water
from the Yarmouk River in winter, the rainy season for Jordan,
and the Jewish state provides some 20 million cubic meters of
water, stored in Lake Tiberias, to Jordan in summer when the
kingdom has virtually no rains.
</P>
<P>
The Yarmouk River, originated in Syria, flows along the
Syrian-Jordanian border before joining the Jordan River downstream
from Lake Tiberias.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hopes the new Israeli government under Prime Minister
Ehud Barak would react positively to its proposal.
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about a change in the quantity of water, we
are just saying that instead of using water stored in the lake,
let us take it form the river," said a Jordanian officials who
declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
Jordan made the request after Israel's water company went on
strike two weeks ago, disrupting the flow of Jordan's share stored
in lake, Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jordanian experts said water stored in Lake Tiberias
and received by Jordan is of poor quality, and Jordan found it
difficult to deal with the algae in the water, Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Technical teams from Jordan and Israel are holding talks on
the Jordanian proposal, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Promising Postal Sector: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- "The upcoming 22nd Congress of
the Universal Postal Union (UPU) in Beijing will provide a good
opportunity for China's postal sector to exchange with and learn
from its foreign counterparts, which will promote the postal
industry in China," said Liu Liqing, director of the State Post
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
China's postal sector is making headway in spite of all the
difficulties it now confronts, Liu said, adding that this sector
will soon reverse its losses and start to show a profit.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the postal sector was separated from the
telecommunication sector, which weakened its strength to some
extent. At the same time, its traditional services, including the
delivery of mail and parcel and the distribution of newspapers and
magazines, are facing strong competition from other sectors in the
new market economy.
</P>
<P>
The postal sector reported a loss of 14 billion yuan (1.7
billion US dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, it does boasts good credit, and a nationwide postal
network with international links, so the industry still has great
potential, Liu said. The industry has th confidence to cut the
loss by 7 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to provide satisfactory and comprehensive postal
services to the public and operate at a profit, the postal sector
must modernize by upgrading its technical level and training more
qualified personnel, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Maps Agro-Science Development Program for New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Minister of Science and
Technology Deng Nan said here today that 28 State Council
departments are drafting a China Agricultural Science Development
Program for the first 15 years of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Wan Baorui, Vice-Minister of Agriculture, explained at a news
conference here today that a major task of the blueprint is to
turn China from a grain producer of large quantity to an
agricultural giant with high-quality crops and farm produce.
</P>
<P>
He said the guideline for China's agro-science development will
focus on high-quality, high-efficiency, and low-cost sustainable
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Wan said that according to the development program, Chinese
agro-scientists are required to provide technical support to
insure food and nutrition self-sufficiency for the Chinese people,
the improvement of crop quality, the rising of farmers' income,
and the rapid industrialization of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The program will also encourage the rational use of resources
and protection of the environment.
</P>
<P>
The spreading of science among Chinese farmers and the
restructuring of agro-science institutions are also major tasks
outlined by the program.
</P>
<P>
China now has around 1,220 agro-science research organizations
above the prefecture level, with nearly 70,000 agro-scientists.
</P>
<P>
Deng Nan said at the press conference that enterprises and
farmers will also be encouraged to invest in agro-science projects.
At present, only the government is funding agro-science programs.
</P>
<P>
The new development program is expected to be completed and
adopted by next February.

<HEADLINE> Water at Lower Reaches of Yangtze Receding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The water level at the lower
reaches of the Yangtze River has dropped back below the danger
level after besieging the banks for 46 days.
</P>
<P>
Last year, flood waters stood above the danger level for over
90 days at Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake, and at
the Jiujiang section of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Jiangxi provincial flood control
headquarters said that the province's banks have withstood the
onslaught of flood waters this year, suffering no breaches, unlike
last year.
</P>
<P>
After the dykes at the Jiujiang section were breached last year,
the province invested heavily on dyke construction and turned lake
reclaimed farmland into water area again.
</P>
<P>
On July 21, the Jiujiang section of the river and the Poyang
Lake witnessed its second highest flood peak, next only to that of
last year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Partially Lifts Ban on Pepsi Production Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian Health Ministry has
decided to partially lift its ban on a local Pepsi Cola
production line, but two other soft drinks produced by the same
line will be banned for another week.
</P>
<P>
The production and marketing of reusable Pepsi-Cola bottles
resumed from Monday but the ministry maintained its closure of 7UP
and Miranda production of the Jordan Ice and Aerated Water Company
owned by the Pepsi-Cola International of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Further laboratory tests would be conducted during the
following week to determine whether the locally bottled 7UP and
Miranda meet hygienic standards of the Health Ministry, Jordanian
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry shut down the whole Pepsi-Cola production line a
week ago after the products were found to be contaminated with
impurities, including sands, insects and cement.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Pepsi Cola International rushed to the
desert kingdom to look into the issue, and repaired the plant's
electronic apparatus which were found unable to detect impurities,
Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Pepsi-Cola in reusable glass bottles are the flagship product
of the Pepsi company in Jordanian market, accounting for some 80
percent of its overall operations in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Other production lines for canisters and plastic bottles were
not closed since the decision covered only glass bottles.
</P>
<P>
The semi-closure came at the peak sales season for the soft
drink manufacturer with an influx of tourists and increased local
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Pepsi-Cola products accounted for some 75 percent of the soft
drinks market in Jordan.

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's biggest listed
company, Telecom, has posted an after tax profit of 202 million NZ
dollars (107 million U.S. dollars) for the second quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
That is an increase of 2.7 percent on the same quarter last
year.
</P>
<P>
The company said it experienced strong growth in data and
cellular services.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Roderick Deane said the transformation of
Telecom's core business had continued, with the data, mobile and
Internet businesses all experiencing continued strong growth in
revenue and volumes while revenues from voice calling slowly
declined.
</P>
<P>
He said volume growth in cellular and data markets had helped
drive a 2.7 percent increase in normalized revenue to 848 million
NZ dollars (450 million U.S. dollars). Normalized operating costs
were 0.4 percent lower at 499 million NZ dollars (264 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Telecom's cellular business drives a large portion of overall
revenues, and the Internet is where the future of this industry
lies," he said.
</P>
<P>
However revenues fell for voice calling services, including
local calls, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Revenues also fell for national and international calls.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Import Maize to Ease Famine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will ask
private or commercial importers to purchase maize from abroad as
a measure to curb the looming famine in the country.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Musalia Mudavadi said here Monday that due
to the prolonged drought, about a million bags (90-kg bag) of
maize will be required to cushion the famine, the state-run Kenya
Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the commercial importers will be
required to pay all the duties and abide by the regulations
governing the importation of cereals.
</P>
<P>
About two weeks ago, Kenya announced to import two million bags
of maize for the cereal deficit between July and November, and
also lowered the import duty for maize from 32.5 percent to 25
percent in a bid to encourage traders to import maize from foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi said the National Cereals and Produce Board was at the
moment buying maize from farmers who had surplus and expressed
optimism that by the end of next month the deficit of one million
bags might have been drastically reduced.
</P>
<P>
He also advised Kenyans to use their stocks of cereals
carefully to avoid being exploited by traders through inflated
prices.
</P>
<P>
It is important for farmers to observe various weather patterns
to know the ideal time to plant seeds of different crops to
ensure that they are sufficiently endowed with food, the minister
added.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Committed to Reviewing Indo-Nepal Treaty: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is
committed to reviewing the 1950 treaty with India with a view to
updating it to suit the changed political situation, The Rising
Nepal reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr. Ram Sharan Mahat made the
assertion in the House of Representatives Monday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to what basic changes Nepal wants in the India-Nepal
Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1950, Mahat said that the
changes should be in conformity with present political context and
should reflect the universally accepted principles and norms.
</P>
<P>
The amendments should also have the thrust for further
consolidating Nepal-India ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said the government would talk with the opposition
parties on the clauses that need to be reviewed and changed,
adding that a national stance in this regard will be established
after discussing with other political parties.
</P>
<P>
"We want to push forward by building consensus with the
opposition parties as it is a national issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has been voicing the need for reviewing the Treaty of
Peace and Friendship with its southern neighbor since early 1995,
when former prime minister Manmohan Adhikari (who died in April
1999) spelled out Nepal's intention to update the treaty by
discarding some clauses which were obsolete.
</P>
<P>
India, which wishes to continue its patronage over Nepal, has
taken a negligent attitude towards Nepal's demand.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- India's rice exports declined
by over 50 percent during the first 4 months of the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commerce Ministry, registration for
non-basmati rice exports between April and July this year
decreased to 815,000 tons from 1.752 million tons recorded during
the same period last year.

<P>
Registration for exports of basmati, too, witnessed a decline
to 152,000 tons from 267,000 tons during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The decline was caused by reduced imports by some Asian and
African countries, which have recovered from last year's crop loss
due to drought.
</P>
<P>
Registration for rice exports are done with the Agricultural
and Processed Food Export Development Authority.

<HEADLINE> Water at Lower Reaches of Yangtze Receding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The water level at the lower
reaches of the Yangtze River has dropped back below the danger
level after besieging the banks for 46 days.
</P>
<P>
Last year, flood waters stood above the danger level for over
90 days at Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake, and at
the Jiujiang section of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Jiangxi provincial flood control
headquarters said that the province's banks have withstood the
onslaught of flood waters this year, suffering no breaches, unlike
last year.
</P>
<P>
After the dykes at the Jiujiang section were breached last year,
the province invested heavily on dyke construction and turned some
portions of the Poyang Lake into farmland.
</P>
<P>
On July 21, the Jiujiang section of the river and the Poyang
Lake witnessed its second highest flood peak, next only to that of
last year.

BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Express Mail Service (
EMS) has enjoyed rapid growth in the first half of this year with
earnings hitting 1.6 billion yuan (193 million US dollars), a 14
percent year gain over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the State Post Bureau said that the EMS has
been growing substantially for the past twenty years. Now, the EMS
has extended its service to more than 1,900 cities and towns
across the country, and has developed ties with 200 countries and
regions all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The EMS offers many kinds of services to cater to a growing
market, and has also opened a hotline to disseminate information

</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts attribute the rapid growth of the EMS to
its broad service network and the good service it is providing,
and they expect it to keep the momentum into the next century.
</P>
<P>
They also called for improvement in EMS management and the
establishment of an international express service network, which

<HEADLINE> Tibet Ready for Sixth National Ethnic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
LHASA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Potala Palace remains
reverence-looking, the Jokhang Temple keeps receiving faithful
pilgrims, and the Norbulingka garden goes on glittering under
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
What is different is the emergence of colorful banners, hot
balloons, picture posters and clean streets, which all send a
strong signal that the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAG) was greeting
a grand festival.
</P>
<P>
Lhasa, the capital of the TAG densely populated by Tibetans, is
extending its arms to welcome ethnic minorities from all over the
country as the Sixth National Games of Traditional Ethnic Sports
are to be opened here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Great enthusiasm has arisen from the locals who are the first
time to host such sports gala which has drawn about 2,500 visitors
including 1,241 athletes and coaches from 31 ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Tse Ren Dol Ka, chairwoman of the organising committee, said
that since the TAG won the bid to share the sixth version in 1995,
Tibetans have been activated for they "aspire to see a united
China and a prosperous Tibet".
</P>
<P>
The organising committee, who faced the sticky issue of
shortage of quality sports facilities, has seen the stadiums
revamped or rebuilt as hundreds of thousands of volunteers pitched
themselves into face-lifting work and unselfish support from
across the country came to their help.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu Province, which has involved in helping support TAG
social and economic development, contributed 100 million yuan RMB
to help build the Jiangsu Avenue, which is the best ever in the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
Locals also reveal their great ardor as a group of 7,000 youth
volunteers from all walks of life was set up in charge of games
services such as reception and medical care.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony, which will feature a grand show of dance
and song, will see a total of 5,000 actors and actresses from the
rank and file and only 30 are professional.
</P>
<P>
Fu Kaiyou, a reporter with the Tibet Daily, was glad to see his
10-year-old son during the opening ceremony rehearsal although his
apple of eye failed to have an easy summer holiday.
</P>
<P>
"My son has begun training for the opening ceremony before the
end of last semester and began daily exercises after the summer
holiday started. We parents have to pay their lunch and traffic
fee for the training exercises, and our hearts sometimes feel ache
as we saw them undergoing repeated and dull exercises."
</P>
<P>
"But we are all ready to do that and play our due part for the
games." said Fu.
</P>
<P>
The locals took the games to heart so much that the producers
of the memorials become one of the biggest beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
Along the streets over weekend memorial stands are in sight
here and there with some young volunteers selling an assortment of
memorials with the prices ranging from 1999 yuan RMB to 15 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Han Han, the agent who are in charge of the memorial sale, said
that he had not expected to see such strong individual consumption
momentum in Lhasa, a city with only a population of 30,000.
</P>
<P>
"The individuals have accounted for almost half the sales. It
is really out of my expectation that whether haves or have-nots,
they all show interest in the games," Han said.
</P>
<P>
"Like a popcorn-selling parent, though he only earned 100 yuan
every day, he did not hesitate to buy his son a watch valued at 30
yuan. On the other side one self-employed labourer splashed out 17,
000 yuan to buy golden memorials for his three sons."
</P>
<P>
Among the items the most popular is the picture album titled "
56 ethnic nationalities is a whole family", which put together all
the nationalities in China.
</P>
<P>
The title echoed a slogan along the street which saluted the
eyes of every passers-by. It reads "56 ethnic nationalities, 56
full-blown flowers."

<HEADLINE> Sea Level Along Bangladesh Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The sea level along the
Bangladesh's coast is rising at about 3 millimeters a year and the
sea temperature is showing a rising trend, the Independent daily
reported Tuesday, quoting a latest research.
</P>
<P>
The research was conducted by the SAARC (South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) Meteorological Research
Center (SMRC).
</P>
<P>
The findings of the research confirm the forecasts made by
scientists about sea level rises due to global warming that is
caused by excessive emission of greenhouse gases including carbon
dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The work, done since early this year by Dr. O.P. Singh of India
and Dr. Tarek of Pakistan under the supervision of the SMRC
Director Dr. Sazedur Rahman, forms the first phase of a study on
global warming and its impact on SAARC member states.
</P>
<P>
A rise in the sea level has the potential of increasing the
frequency and the depth of flood inundation, by slowing down the
discharge of river water, scientists predicted, adding that in a
worse scenario of a one-meter rise in the sea level, about 17
percent of the low-lying areas might go under water.
</P>
<P>
During the current decade, about half a dozen researches on sea
level rises have been conducted in Bangladesh, and all those
studies, however, concentrated on Bangladesh's vulnerability to
sea level rise and on possible mitigation measures.
</P>
<P>
The latest one is the first conducted directly by
meteorologists and delves into the area of concrete measurement of
the changes in the sea due to global warming.
</P>
<P>
The mean tide level showed a steady rise while the sea surface
temperature showed only in the months of May and October, and the
average was yet to be worked out, said the SMRC director.

<P>
HAVANA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuban authorities announced
Monday an increase in oil production during the first semester of
this year to 6.28 million barrels, a 23 percent increase compared
with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Cuban oil industry sources said the figure is approximately 50
percent of the year's total estimated output, which is a little
more than 13 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that 218 million cubic meters of natural gas
were also produced, which is five times more than that in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The estimated goal for natural gas this year is 455 million
cubic meters, which will be used for generating electricity and in
domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
The island's output of crude oil in 1991 was 3.8 million
barrels and natural gas was burned off into the atmosphere. The
opening of the oil industry to foreign investment as a result of
the economic crisis gave a strong boost to that section of the
industry.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Sugar Industry Incurs Heavy Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's sugar industry
incurred a loss of 700 million taka (14 million U.S. dollars) in
the 1998-99 fiscal year ending on June 30, The Financial Express
daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The industry has been in the red for the last few years except
the 1997-98 fiscal when it earned a profit of 20 million taka (4
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Officials said the loss was mainly the result of a fall in
production and low return from sales due to high production costs.
Influx of low-priced sugar from India has aggravated the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's 15 sugar mills produced 152,979 tons of sugar last
fiscal year, 17.3 percent less than the targeted 185,000 tons, and
8.09 percent less than the production of the previous fiscal.
</P>
<P>
The devastating flood last year which damaged about 15 percent
of sugarcane had an adverse impact on the country's sugar
production, and a massive pest invasion and lower sugar recovery
rate also affected production in most of the mills.
</P>
<P>
Influx of Indian sugar which is being sold at cheaper prices,
especially in frontier districts, has discouraged consumers to buy
local sugar, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report listed high prices of sugarcane, inadequate cane
supply, high rate of taxes, old-age machinery and excess manpower
as the main reasons behind high production costs.
</P>
<P>
The 15 sugar mills have a production capacity of 210,000 tons
against a total demand of 350,000 tons, and to meet the demand,
the country will have to import 150,000 tons of sugar during the
1999-2000 fiscal, according to the report.

ALMA ATA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak
Nazarov summoned on Monday Uzbek Ambassador to Tajikistan,
Bakhtiyar Urdashev, to protest the bombing of its northern
territory by Uzbek planes early Sunday morning, and demanded steps
be taken to prevent such events from happening again.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted Tajik Foreign Ministry as saying that on August
15 four aircraft with Uzbek air force markings flew over the Osh
region of Kyrgyzstan to bomb the Tajik regions of Garmsk and
Dzhirgatal, 250 kilometers away from Dushanbe, capital of
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The air attacks caused no casualties but killed more than 100
animals and ruined a lot of buildings and farmlands, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Nazarov expressed "shock" at the act of the Uzbek air force,
demanding Uzbekistan to act immediately to guarantee against
repetitions.
</P>
<P>
But on the same day Uzbek Foreign Ministry issued a note to its
Tajik counterpart, denying Uzbekistan's knowledge of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that in the recent week Tajik armed rebels
frequently crossed the border linking the two former Russian
republics.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Be Short of Half A Million Housing Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will be short of half
a million houses by year 2005 and the requirement will keep
growing as there is a backlog on the required number of houses
each year, according to media sources here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Housing Development Authority (NHDA), which has
made this projection, was quoted as saying that at present there
is a shortage of about 183,700 houses with urban areas needing
172,400 and rural areas needing 11,300 houses.
</P>
<P>
By year 2005 there will be a shortage of 509,000 housing units,
of which 322,600 will be in urban areas and 186,400 in rural
areas, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
This situation will emerge although the government has
initiated several projects to overcome the shortage of dwelling
facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government is now constructing flats with
basic dwelling facilities around Colombo and other cities to
settle shanty dwellers, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
The government can provide funds for only 27 percent of the
country's housing needs while the private sector and individuals
would have to take the major share in constructing houses, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
A sum of 4,296 million rupees (60.5 million U.S. dollars) has
been allocated for this year housing program of the NHDA.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Privatize More State-owned Cinemas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen more state-owned cinemas
in different parts of Myanmar will be privatized and sold through
competitive bidding to national entrepreneurs, the official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 19 cinemas to be privatized include those in the country's
Yangon, Bago, Mandalay and Ayeyawaddy divisions.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the submission of bidding is set on September
17, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in July, the Myanmar government's Privatization
Commission  announced the auction of eight cinemas along with one
rice mill and two soft drink and ice-making plants in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, during the first half of this
year, a total of 74 state-owned economic enterprises (SEEs)
including four factories, seven rice mills, 57 cinemas and six
hotels were included in the privatization plan.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has, since January 1995, been implementing a
privatization plan for its SEEs, aimed at transforming them into
effective business organizations.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the scheme covers 51 SEEs including
processing and manufacturing factories, livestock breeding farms
and cinemas, and has been implemented in various forms --
auctioning and leasing out the enterprises or establishing joint
ventures with local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In a significant move to accelerate the privatization of heavy
industries, Myanmar transferred to local private entrepreneurs the
Ywama Steel Mill in September 1998, the biggest SEE leased out
since the privatization plan began.
</P>
<P>
There were a total of 36,275 private industrial enterprises in
Myanmar by the end of 1998.

PANAMA CITY, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The toll revenue through the
Panama Canal during the first 10 months of the 1999 fiscal year
increased by 4 percent over estimates that have been made,
administrator Alberto Aleman Zubieta said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Aleman told the Canal Commission Managing Board that the toll
revenue reached 480.6 million dollars, while the estimated figure
for the period was 462.3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The administrator attributed the increase to the increase in
the average size of the ships passed through the canal. Since last
October, the starting month of the fiscal year, commercial cargo
tonnage increased 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Key products for the increase were corn, soybeans, wheat,
chemicals and petrochemicals, refrigerated products, cargo in
containers and oil byproducts.
</P>
<P>
About 825,000 ships have passed through the canal since it was
opened in 1914 and about 34 freight ships daily. These ships,
mainly from the United States, China, Japan and Chile, bring a
yearly toll revenue of 500 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Wider to Overseas Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to open
wider to overseas investment and a series of new policies will
soon be promulgated to encourage foreign investors to enter more
industries in the country.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Xie Shusheng, chairman of the China
Association for Overseas Investment, at a recent business forum
held in Chengdu, capital city of Sichuan Province in southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policies, China will further relax control over
overseas investments in the retail sector, according to Xie. Since
1992, overseas investors have engaged in more than 200 retail
businesses in a number of Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation is renewing its policies which are expected to be more
favorable for overseas business people to cooperate with their
Chinese partners in dealing in foreign trade business. Overseas
investors will be allowed to play a bigger role in the country's
foreign trade business, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, foreign banks have been allowed to open
branches in any Chinese cities, and to deal in Renminbi (the
Chinese currency) business in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province
in southern China, in addition to Shanghai in the east.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of four more foreign insurance companies
in China this year, the government is considering to allow to
overseas insurers to do business in Shenzhen, Chongqing, Dalian
and Tianjin. At present, only Shanghai and Guangzhou are opened to
overseas insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
Xie disclosed that the Chinese government is also considering
to allow foreign accountants and lawyers to open offices in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, China gave the green light to foreign travel
agencies for setting up joint ventures with Chinese partners.

<P>
COLOMBO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan women account for
more than 60 percent of the workforce of foreign exchange earners
in garments, migrant labor and tea, the Board of Investment (BOI)
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The magnitude of women's direct contribution to the national
economy is clearly evident when considering the performances of
these three foreign exchange earning sectors," the BOI said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The garment sector accounted for 69 percent of the total
industrial exports with a foreign exchange earning equivalent to
159.3 billion rupees (2.4 billion U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The tea sector accounted for 71 percent of agricultural exports
with a foreign exchange earning of 50.3 billion rupees (740
million dollars) last year, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Private remittances from migrant workers reached an all time
high of 64 billion rupees (940 million dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Workers' remittances, which have been accounting for around 16
percent of the total foreign exchange inflows during the past
decade, have had a significant impact on Sri Lanka's balance of
payments, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented industries such as garments and electronics,
both within and outside the Export Promotion Zones (EPZs), have
provided job opportunities to a large number of young women.
</P>
<P>
Female workers in Sri Lanka's EPZs at Katunayake, Biyagama and
Koggala constitute a sizable 80 percent of the total workforce of
over 93,000.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU to Investigate French Feed Contamination Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
send a team of food security officials to France to investigate
reports that some French factories use toilet sewage and sludge to
make pig and poultry feed, an EU spokesman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, the spokesman said the EU will carry out
a serious investigation into the incident despite France's
announcement that the problem has been solved.
</P>
<P>
Germany's ARD television channel claimed Thursday that at least
five French feed-making plants were suspected of using animal
corpses or sediment from sewage disposal tanks to produce fodder
for pigs and chickens.
</P>
<P>
Some of the pork and chicken products were exported to Germany,
said the report, which prompted many German supermarkets to
immediately announce withdrawal of the sale of French chickens.
</P>
<P>
Such sediment, mainly excrement from toilets, could contain
heavy metal, dioxin and some super-bacteria, which can cause great
harm to the human brain, nerves, heart, muscles and other organs,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission reacted quickly to the report Thursday,
sending an urgent message to the French government demanding
details and an immediate solution to the incident.
</P>
<P>
In a reply to the EU Commission earlier Monday, France admitted
that the French National Anti-fraud and Consumer Protection
Department discovered in late 1998 that three slaughterhouses
provided the mixture of the sediment and the raw material for
producing feed to feed-makers.
</P>
<P>
France said it had taken severe measures to deal with the
problem.
</P>
<P>
EU countries have been haunted by food contamination scares
since the start of 1999, including the contamination of chicken
and pork by cancer-causing dioxin in Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Rampant in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 2,000 Romanian were
infected by meningitis during the past two months, and most of the
patients were teenagers, an official from the Health Ministry said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The acute infection has spread rapidly to most of the country's
northeast area, including the capital city of Bucharest, the port
city of Constanta and other places since the first meningitis
patient was found this June in Iasi, northeast of the country, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Health experts warn people to drink clean water and practice
hygienic habits. They also appealed to the government to be more
strict on food hygiene checks, to raise the fines for commercial
firms from 300,000-1,000,000 lei (19 to 61 U.S. dollars) to 6-20
million lei (374 to 1,250 U.S. dollars), for violations.
</P>
<P>
Children and teenagers are more vulnerable and easily infected
by meningitis than adults. So the yearly registration of schools
could have to be delayed, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of the disease include a fever, vomiting, headache,
even delirium, shock and hydrocephalus.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the spread of the infection, neighboring Hungary has
taken measures to tighten customs quarantine for Romanians who
want to enter their country.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Bank of Communications
has become one of the first Chinese banks officially assigned to
provide futures traders with settlement services.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based bank has signed agreements with China's
three futures exchanges in Shanghai, Zhengzhou, and Dalian to help
them handle trading settlements, according to Liu Yuchang, vice-
governor of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that his bank has been engaged in futures settlement
services for years and now handles more than 70 percent of the
trading settlements in the three futures exchanges.
</P>
<P>
This year, the bank has stepped up efforts to improve internal
management in order to provide safe and fast futures settlement
services, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Futures trading first started in China in the early 1990s and
in 1998 the State Council issued a ruling on standardizing the
futures market. All of the country's 14 pilot futures exchanges
were subsequently merged into three. Last year, the three futures
exchanges reported a combined trading volume of 3.68 trillion yuan
(about 443 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Communications is one of China's five state-owned
commercial banks and the country's first share-holding bank.

<HEADLINE> Chile Fish Catch Up in First 7 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Chile, one of the world's top
fish-producing countries, recorded a 37.5 percent increase in the
harvest of fish in the first seven months of the year compared
with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
 A total of 3.541 million tons of fish were caught during the
period. And a latest official fishery report attributed the catch
increase to the improvement in the capture of anchovy, common
sardine and Spanish sardine, despite a reduction in the capture of
jurel.
</P>
<P>
Between January and July, 1.451 million tons of anchovy were
caught, representing a 273 percent increase over the same period
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Jurel capture amounted to 616,914 tons, 51.2 percent less than
the amount caught in the first seven months of last year.
</P>
<P>
Fishery plays an important role in Chile, which is the biggest
producer of fish meal and the third largest fish-producing country
in the world.

<HEADLINE> China Escalating War Against Plant Diseases, Pests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China is intensifying a
nationwide war against an outbreak of plant diseases and pests
that have been ravaging the country's forests since early this
year, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Following the allocation of a record eight million yuan(dlrs
960,000) in funds to several programs aimed at controlling deadly
plant and tree predators late last month, the State Forestry
Adminstration(SFA) has decided to increase the proportion of mixed
forests in China's key national afforestation campaigns to control
future outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
The rate of mixed forests must account for at least one third
of the total trees planted as of the year 2000, up from the
present 7.8 percent, sources close to the administration said.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, China will face a potential spread of
pests in cultivated forests, or forests made from trees planted by
man. These vulnerable forests currently feature only one kind of
tree, such as cypress, elm, and poplar, concentrated in a certain
region.
</P>
<P>
With only one or two species of trees in a forest, certain
pests can easily propagate and destroy the trees, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Damages incurred by pests can be far worse than that of forest
fires, and the pests are sometimes referred to as "smokeless
forest fires."
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Wen Jiabao has called for forceful measures to
stop the spread of the deadly pests as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SFA experts have recommended at a recent conference
urgent measures including sealing off affected areas, establishing
an effective monitoring system, and combining the use of chemical,
physical and biological measures to bring the situation under
control.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 40 young volunteers
from 16 countries, including the United States, Britain, France,
Japan, and Turkey, have taken part in a 15-day afforestation camp,
starting from August 15, in the Manchu Autonomous County of
Fengning, north China's Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
Fengning, a poor county, located at the intersection of the
Inner Mongolia Plateau and the province, features serious
desertification and poor ecological environment. And it has
exerted direct effect on the ecological conditions in its
neighboring Tianjin and Beijing municipalities and the two cities'
water sources, Luanhe and Chaohe rivers rise in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China,
therefore, has launched afforestation drive in this area since
last June, offering the youth both at home and abroad an
opportunity to make contribution to environmental protection, said
involved officials.
</P>
<P>
According to related statistics, water and soil erosion area in
China reached 3.6 million sq km in 1997, 38 percent of nation's
total area, and desertification area 2.62 million, 27.3 percent of
the whole territory.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that the participants will also publicize
knowledge on environmental protection, visit eco-improvement
projects in China's rural areas, enterprises, and mines so as to
further develop friendly relationship among the youth, and
intensify their understanding of the importance of environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China planted trees in a total area of 4.
21 million hectares in 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Says Security Improved in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. secretary general's
special envoy for East Timor, Jamsheed Marker, Monday said the
autonomy ballot in East Timor can be conducted peacefully
considering the improved security situation in the territory.
</P>
<P>
"In Jakarta, I heard the commitment of the Indonesian
government to carry out the consultation peacefully, while in East
Timor I heard the commitment of the warring parties to support the
success of the consultation," Marker said in Dili, capital of East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
Marker has been in Dili since Saturday to officially launch the
campaign period for the ballot, which runs from August 14 through
27.
</P>
<P>
After his visits to some areas in East Timor, Marker admitted
that the security situation was much better although there was
still some unrest.
</P>
<P>
He said security in the territory could not be considered as
100 percent secure but the Indonesian government had shown its
seriousness in improving the situation. Indonesian security forces
would guarantee security for the consultation so that people could
channel their aspirations freely.
</P>
<P>
"We will conduct the popular consultation although the
condition is not perfect," Marker was quoted by the Antara News
Agency Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, visiting Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Machimura
Nobutoha hoped that the two rival factions in East Timor would
accept the result of the direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the result, the Japanese government will continue
giving assistance to the East Timorese people," an East Timor
government spokesman quoted Machimura as saying after a meeting
with Governor Abilio Jose Osorio Soares in Dili Monday.
</P>
<P>
Machimura arrived in Dili Sunday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold the autonomy ballot on August 30. The ballot will allow
the territory's people to choose whether their homeland should
become an autonomous region within Indonesia or totally
independent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NBA Star Elliott Receives Kidney from Brother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- San Antonio Spurs forward
Sean Elliott received a transplanted kidney from his brother today
and doctors have not ruled out his return to the NBA this coming
season.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to tell you he's not going to play this year
but time will tell," said Dr. Francis Wright, who held a news
conference following the completion of surgeries on Sean and Noel
Elliott at the Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
Wright performed the 3 1/2-hour transplant surgery on Sean
Elliott. He said the NBA star is in stable condition in the
hospital's intensive care unit and barring complications will be
moved to a regular hospital room on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Sean is on the road to recovery right now," said Wright,
adding that Elliott is expected to remain hospitalized for about a
week.
</P>
<P>
Compatibility tests were conducted last week and Noel Elliott
donated the organ. His surgery, known as a live laparoscopic donor
nephrectomy, was a four-hour procedure performed by urologists Dr.
Sammy Vick and Dr. Cliff Sarnecky.
</P>
<P>
"We're a team just like the Spurs are a team," Wright said. "
His brother has provided a terrific gift."
</P>
<P>
A statement released by Neol Elliott said, "My brother will
always be here for me and I will always be here for him."
</P>
<P>
Wright sprinkled his comments with basketball phrases. He
talked about difficult shots, then likened today's procedures to a
"swish shot -- the transplant falls in that category."
</P>
<P>
However, Wright also revealed that complications can arise in
cases of compatibility between family member donors. He also
mentioned historical data that showed blacks have a lower
acceptance rate for transplanted organs.
</P>
<P>
Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was at the news conference and
joked about having his forward back to defend the NBA title.
</P>
<P>
Sean Elliott, 31, played with kidney disease for the last few
years but significant deterioration of the renal function over the
last 12 months led to today's surgery. He has said he has no
retirement plans, although his return for the 1999-2000 season
still is considered highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
For the last seven years, Elliott had a condition known as
focal glomerulosclerosis, a kidney disease that could lead to
chronic failure of the organ, the need for dialysis and,
eventually, a transplant. His condition deteriorated much faster
than expected.
</P>
<P>
Elliott was aware of his diagnosis before the 1999 playoffs
and kept it a secret from management. He was a key component in
the Spurs' run to their first NBA title.
</P>
<P>
Elliott played in all of San Antonio's 17 playoff games this
year and averaged 11.9 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists in a
15-2 postseason run.
</P>
<P>
Elliott has spent all but one of his 10 seasons with the Spurs.
He played in all 50 games during the lockout-abbreviated campaign
this past year and averaged 11.2 points and 4.3 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> 7th Plenum of Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Seventh Plenum of the Eighth
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam closed here
Monday, stressing the strengthening and raising of the quality of
the organization and apparatus of the present political system,
</P>
<P>
A communique of the plenum issued Monday said that the
organization and apparatus of the political system has operated
with low quality and efficiency, with cumbersome and overlapping
methods.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to streamline the staff, especially the
administrative staff, of the party and state agencies and mass
organizations, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the strengthening of the organization
and apparatus of the political system is aimed at maintaining and
strengthening the leading role of the party and the revolutionary
nature of the state, improving the operational efficiency and
effectiveness of the organizations in the political system,
accelerating the renovation process for national industrialization
and modernization, strengthening national defense and security,
maintaining socio-political stability.
</P>
<P>
The plenum set the target of making full compensation for
inflation by raising wages from now to 2001; re-establishing order
in wages management; doing away with irrationalities in the
current wages mechanism and in the wages table, thus creating
conditions for further improvement of the wages regime from 2002
on.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to convene the Ninth National Party
Congress at the end of the first quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The week-long plenum called on the entire Vietnamese party,
people and armed forces to continue promoting the tradition of
solidarity and unity, spare no efforts to implement the
resolutions of the party and the policies and solutions of the
state, thus taking the country through difficulties and trials,
successfully fulfilling the socio-economic tasks of 1999 and the
1996-2000 five-year state plan.
</P>
<P>
The Seventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of CPV
opened here on August 9. General Secretary Le Kha Phieu chaired
the plenum and delivered the opening and closing speeches.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Pilots Stage Third 24-Hour Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Pilots of the Ansett New
Zealand, an airline owned by Australians but operating in New
Zealand, staged their planned third 24-hour strike early Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The strikes are held to protest against airline's proposals
which involve longer working hours, make 30 pilots redundant and
save the company five million NZ dollars (2.65 million U.S.
dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The previous two walk-outs took place on August 6 and 10
respectively.
</P>
<P>
A 24-hour strike will force Ansett to cancel 100 domestic
flights.
</P>
<P>
Ansett has told its striking pilots, who are members of the
Airline Pilots Association of New Zealand, that it has prepared
another contract, which it will forward to their union later this
week.
</P>
<P>
"The revised offer follows a union request for a roll-over of
the existing contract so negotiations could resume," Ansett Chief
Executive Kevin Doddress was quoted as saying by the New Zealand
Press Association (NZPA).
</P>
<P>
The new offer "not only addresses the company's commercial
imperatives, but also provides opportunities for pilots to
increase their remuneration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Adam Nicholson, advocate of the Airline Pilots Association,
said the union is waiting to see what the company has to offer.
</P>
<P>
No further strike action has been filed, but pilots are meeting
Tuesday to discuss the issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Ansett has accumulated losses of 250
million NZ dollars (133 million U.S. dollars) during its 12 years
of operation.

<HEADLINE> Global Glut Hits New Zealand's Apple Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand earnings from
its apple exports this season are about to be gutted, partly
because of a flood of low-priced, good-quality exports from South
American and South African competitors.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) Tuesday quoted Chief
Executive Gary Smith of the NZ Apple and Pear Marketing Board as
saying that the global apple market was suffering from increased
competition and a glut of supply.
</P>
<P>
"We've seen low values emerging, as a result," he said.
</P>
<P>
A key New Zealand variety, braeburn, is about to be badly
affected, even though the board had at the start of the season
pinned its hopes on that cultivar being the most buoyant of the
season, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Braeburns, which make up 40 percent of New Zealand's apple
exports, will earn only seven to nine NZ dollars (3.71 to 4.77
U.S. dollars) a carton, compared with budgeted earnings of 14 to
16.75 NZ dollars (7.42 to 8.88 U.S. dollars) a carton, and actual
earnings last year of about 14 NZ dollars a carton, according to
the chief executive.

<HEADLINE> Sinclair Silences Villa Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A goal deep into injury time from
Trevor Sinclair helped West Ham United for a 2-2 draw with Aston
Villa on Monday and prevented Villa from going back to the top of
the English Premiership table.
</P>
<P>
Dion Dublin's double had looked like taking the home side above
perennial title rivals Manchester United and Arsenal in the early
season standings.
</P>
<P>
But Sinclair, who stood out for West Ham during an absorbing
contest, had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
He finished off a flowing move to level the match, in the
process wrecking the last two 100% records in the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
With 92 minutes on the clock and Villa playing out time, Frank
Lampard sparked a swift counter-attack with a ball to Paolo
Wanchope's feet on the edge of the area.
</P>
<P>
The Costan Rican striker beat his marker Ugo Ehiogu with a
sublime back heel into the path of Sinclair, who finished the move
with a flourish, curling the ball around a despairing David James.
</P>
<P>
Champions Manchester United lead the table on seven points by
goal difference from Villa, the premier league pacemakers last
season until they lost their way in January, and Arsenal.

<HEADLINE> (rpt with correction)U.S. Senators Urge to Lift Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. prominent senators
Monday called for lifting an embargo on food and drug sales to
Cuba after returning from a visit to the Caribbean Island.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota and
Byron Dorgan of North Dakota made the call in a statement issued
after the visit that included a seven-hour meeting with Cuban
leader Fidel Castro on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Senate approved a legislation to lift
ban on food and medical exports to Cuba. However, the measure
still needs to be approved by the House.
</P>
<P>
"It serves neither the U.S.'s nor Cuba's interest to continue
the embargo on vital supplies like food and medicine," Daschle
said.
</P>
<P>
"To continue such an embargo only hurts U.S. family farmers,
who are prevented from serving that market, and the citizens of
Cuba, who need the food and medicine," Dorgan said.
</P>
<P>
In their statement, Daschle and Dorgan said Cuban officials
told them the country imports almost one billion U.S. dollars in
food and medicine and that food imports could double in five
years.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said Cuban doctors and hospital officials
told them more than 200 pharmaceuticals are out of stock in Cuba,
which has created a serious need to replenish the country's supply
of medicines.

<HEADLINE> Italian Audit Court Warns of Deficit in Pension Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Italian State Audit Court
Monday produced figures suggesting that the accumulation of annual
deficits in the national pension fund's accounts could sooner or
later jeopardize the very payment of pensions.
</P>
<P>
According to the Court, the Italian pension fund has been
running a deficit for the last 10 years and between 1989 and 1998
it paid out 286.8 trillion lire (about 160 billion U.S. dollars)
more than it received in pension contributions.
</P>
<P>
Although the annual deficit is falling as a proportion of
overall spending - last year it was 12.8 percent compared to 21.7
percent in 1994 - the accumulated deficit is still growing, the
Court pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The worsening of the deficit situation could sooner or later
have effects on the availability of funds for the payment of
pensions," it said.
</P>
<P>
"It will also pose serious problems with regard to the public
accounts objectives outlined in the European Union's "Stability
Pact," it continued, with reference to the deficit-cutting accords
signed by Italy and its euro area partners.
</P>
<P>
The government appeared set on a major overhaul of the pension
system about a month ago but then backed down when major trade
unions made it plain they would consider no revisions before 2001.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of the Audit Court's report on pension,
Italian Treasury Undersecretary Piero Giarda denied the Audit
Court's claim that problems might arise in paying pensions as a
result of the pension fund's deficit.
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense in 1999 to speak of even a possible lack of
funds to pay pensions," he said in a statement released Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
"The Italian state has never in recent years been as solid as
it is today," he continued, 'pension-drawers can relax and have no
fears about the state's solvency."

<HEADLINE> Former Governor Drops Out of U.S. Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Tennessee governor
Lamar Alexander announced Monday that he will drop out of U.S.
presidential race after finishing poorly in Saturday's Iowa straw
poll.
</P>
<P>
"My heart wants to keep going, but there is no realistic way to
do it," Alexander said in a statement to supporters gathered at
the Tennessee state Capital of Nashville.
</P>
<P>
Alexander, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1996,
finished sixth with 1,428 out of 25,549 votes cast in Iowa straw
poll, the first test for the Republican presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
The poll was won by Texas Governor George W. Bush, front-runner
of the Republican presidential race. Bush achieved 7418 votes, 31
percent of the total ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
Alexander was the first in a crowded Republican field to drop
out after the weekend's nonbinding vote confirmed the Texas
governor as front-runner.
</P>
<P>
"There's a powerful force for George W. Bush's nomination in
this country, and I saw it in Iowa last weekend," said Alexander.
</P>
<P>
Bush is expected to benefit from Alexander's announcement to
quit as many Alexander backers could shift their support to Bush.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Foreign Minister Reaffirms One-China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Swiss Federal Councillor and
Foreign Affairs Minister Joseph Deiss has reaffirmed the Swiss
government's one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Chinese Ambassador Zhou Zizhong at the
Chinese embassy in the Swiss capital of Berne on Monday, Deiss
said that Switzerland has always held that the government of the
People's Republic of China (PRC) is the only legitimate government
of China since Switzerland recognized the founding of the PRC in
1950 and that it has never changed the stand.
</P>
<P>
Deiss also stressed that the Swiss government has attached
great importance to the development of relations between
Switzerland and China, saying that China is one of Switzerland's
important partners in economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Deiss said that the smooth development in trade and economy
between the two countries is in the interest of both. To further
promote the bilateral relations, he said, Swiss Federal Councillor
and Economic Affairs Minister Pascal Couchepin will visit China
this Autumn.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Zhou extended his appreciation for the Swiss
government for its adherence to the one-China policy and efforts
to develop the bilateral relations. He told his guest that the
Chinese government welcomes Couchepin's visit.

<HEADLINE> Groupware Software Users Increase Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Groupware software topped 21
million new users worldwide in the first half of 1999, according
to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The growing rate of groupware deployment on a worldwide basis
underscores the real advantages achieved by promoting
collaboration as an integral part of the work environment," said
U.S. research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) in the
report. "Corporations are continuing to recognize the value of
collaborative applications in uniting workers both within and
outside the organization."
</P>
<P>
Groupware software is designed to support multiple users that
work on related tasks. Groupware is an evolving concept that is
more than just multiuser software which allows access to the same
data. It provides a mechanism that helps users coordinate and keep
track of on-going projects together.
</P>
<P>
IDC said that Microsoft took the lead in the United States,
rest of the world and overall worldwide markets while Lotus
retained the lead in Europe and Asia-Pacific markets. In terms of
client access licenses distributed worldwide in the first half of
this year, Microsoft reported 9.6 million new licenses, while
Lotus reported 7.8 million.
</P>
<P>
The European groupware market is a major contributor to overall
worldwide growth, steadily accelerating as organizations look
beyond basic messaging to groupware that meets a variety of
collaborative needs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the approach of the year 2000 and demand for
integrated collaborative platforms have helped to drive groupware
deployments at firms with older email-only solutions that may
malfunction on December 31. "There are many questions that can't
be answered until January 1, 2000, and many organizations are
taking the necessary precautions to ensure that their businesses
will continue to run smoothly," IDC said.
</P>
<P>
The heart of groupware is a messaging system, because email is
used to notify team members, obtain responses and send alerts.
Email messages increasingly include live links to databases,
intranets and the Internet. Other applications include document
sharing and document management, group calendaring and scheduling,
group contact and task management, threaded discussions, text
chat, data conferencing and audio and videoconferencing. Workflow,
which allows messages and documents to be routed to the
appropriate users, is often part of a groupware system.

<HEADLINE> WHO Reports Short Shelf Life Drugs Donated by U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- About 30 percent of the
drugs donated by U.S. organizations to a certain number of
developing countries had s shelf life of less than one year, a
U.N. agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Bulletin of the World Health Organization (WHO) said some
30 percent of the items had a shelf life of less than 100 days.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the worldwide median time to expiry for the
drugs should be longer than 550 days at the time of shipment, the
bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
The cases of Armenia, Haiti and Tanzania show that between 10
and 42 percent of the drugs sent were not on the countries' lists
of essential drugs; nor were they permissible therapeutic
alternatives to needed drugs.
</P>
<P>
The findings were based on the analysis of experts from several
U.S. institutions. Data of 16,566 donations shipped between 1994
and 1997 for the two unidentified organizations to 129 countries
were collected.
</P>
<P>
The experts' assessment came amid criticism against
international donors providing unsuitable items. They proposed
that actions be taken to improve the relevance and time-to-expiry
of U.S.A. pharmaceutical donations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- London's FTSE-100 index of
leading shares closed slightly lower in thin trade Monday as
caution set in ahead of key U.S. consumer price data Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The index stayed steady through much of the session as
investors took a respite following a 267-point rally over the past
three sessions. The blue chip index dipped 0.16 percent, or 9.7
points, to close at 6,235.4.
</P>
<P>
With U.S. and UK inflation data due Tuesday and a U.S. interest
rate rise expected next week, dealers said there was little
incentive for the market to extend its recent recovery.
</P>
<P>
The rate-sensitive banking sector erased about 10.2 points from
the FTSE 100 index. Standard &AMP; Chartered lost 1.34 percent to 88
pence Lloyds gave up 2.05 percent to 871 pence and Barclays
retreated 1.13 percent to 1847 pence.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the electronic Xetra Dax notched up 0.72 percent,
or 37.67 points, to finish at 5,257.10, pulled higher by
speculation of a possible tie-up between two utility heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
A rise in the blue chip index was made hard by concerns about
the possibility of a rise in interest rates both in the United
States and the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Paris's blue chip CAC 40 edged 0.55 percent higher to close at
4,458.75, a gain of 24.47 points, as traders kept a watchful eye
ahead of an upcoming meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve a week
from Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Barak Exchange Letters on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak have exchanged letters exploring
prospects for peacemaking in the Middle East, the White House said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wrote Barak over the weekend, responding to a letter
the prime minister sent him about week earlier, White House
National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also spoke twice last week on the telephone as
Clinton tries to set the stage for a successful trip by Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright to the region starting on September 1.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have criticized Barak for stretching out the
phases of an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank
under the U.S.-brokered Wye River agreement.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton told a group of American Jewish leaders last week
at the White House he expected an agreement between Israel and
the Palestinians on a schedule within three weeks.

cents per share a year ago.
</P>
<P>

aggressive actions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Colombia Plans Strategy for Many Crises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
on Monday that Colombian President Andres Pastrana plans to
formulate a national strategy for dealing with the country's
"multiple crises."
</P>
<P>
The crises Colombia needs to tackle with include a leftist-led
civil war, rampant narco-trafficking and a deplorable human rights
situation, Undersecretary Thomas Pickering told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana made the commitment during discussions with Pickering
last week in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
Pickering told reporters that the United States has no
intention of intervening in Colombia beyond continuing support for
the country's counter-narcotics efforts.
</P>
<P>
Rumors say that the United States is "about to launch the 82nd
Airborne" into Colombia. Pickering rejected the notion and called
that a "crazy idea."
</P>
<P>
Pickering also visited Venezuela for talks with President Hugo
Chavez after his visit to Colombia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senators Urge to Lift Food and Drug Embargo on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. prominent senators
Monday called for lifting an embargo on food and drug sales to
Cuba after returning from a visit to the Caribbean Island.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota and
Byron Dorgan of North Dakota made the call in a statement issued
after the visit that included a seven-hour meeting with Cuban
leader Fidel Castro on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Senate approved a legislation to lift
ban on food and medical exports to Cuba. However, the measure
still needs to be approved by the House.
</P>
<P>
"It serves neither the U.S.'s nor Cuba's interest to continue
the embargo on vital supplies like food and medicine," Daschle
said.
</P>
<P>
"To continue such an embargo only hurts U.S. family farmers,
who are prevented from serving that market, and the citizens of
Cuba, who need the food and medicine," Dorgan said.
</P>
<P>
In their statement, Daschle and Dorgan said Cuban officials
told them the country imports almost one billion U.S. dollars in
food and medicine and that food imports could double in five
years.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said Cuban doctors and hospital officials
told them more than 200 pharmaceuticals are out of stock in Cuba,
which has created a serious need to replenish the country's supply
of medicines.
