<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Concerned Over Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
expressed his deep concern over the escalating warfare in
Yugoslavia here Wednesday, deploring the loss of lives and
destruction of homes and infrastructure by Nato's stray missiles.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the 17th session of the U.N.
 Commission of Human Settlements which opened at the United
Nations Office in Nairobi, Moi said, "The Kosovo crisis is
worrying many of us at the meeting."
</P>
<P>
"I have in the recent past held consultations with a number of
 officials connected with this crisis and raised my own concern on
the escalating warfare in the region," he told over 600 delegates
from more than 120 countries attending the meeting.

The president said when a stray missile missed its target and
hit a civilian residential area in Yugoslavia, it caused
destruction of homes, infrastructure as well as loss of lives.

<P>
"The Kosovo crisis has triggered massive displacement of
civilian population occasioning serious human sufferings," he
said, adding that "this is contrary to the principles of the
Habitat (the U.N. Center for Human Settlements) agenda."

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Produced 38,500 Tons of Sugar in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique turned out 38,500 tons of
sugar in 1998, 13,300 tons more than in 1997, Alessandro Marini,
economic consultant with the national association of sugar, said.
</P>
<P>
With very good forms of the Mafambisse Sugar Plant in central
Mozambique and Xinavane Sugar Plant in southern part of the
country, the major sugar producers, the prospect for this year's
sugar production is very good, Marini noted.
</P>
<P>
Maragra Sugar Plant, which has been paralyzed ever since 1984,
will add another 15,000 tons of sugar to the country's total sugar
production, after it resumes operation this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another factor for an increase of the sugar production, Marini
said, is the rise in yield of per unit area, citing that the per
hectare sugar cane yield was raised to 10.46 tons in 1998 from the
9.17 tons in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique turned out 325,000 tons of sugar in 1972, but the
16-year- long civil war in the country after its independence has
rendered a lot of sugar cane fields deserted and paralyzed many
sugar plants.
</P>
<P>
Since it consumes about 120,000 tons of sugar per year,
Mozambique has to import a lot of sugar from abroad to meet the
needs of its home market.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
said on Wednesday that the Group of Eight (G8) most industrialized
countries should adopt an agreement with Russian approval on the
principles for a political solution to the Yugoslav conflict.
</P>
<P>
The G8 countries' foreign ministers, who will meet on Thursday
in Bonn on Yugoslavia, should ``confirm and make precise an
agreement in management between the Western countries and
Russia,'' said Vedrine in a speech at the Institute of
International and Strategic Relations in Paris.
</P>
<P>
``This agreement will open the way for a resolution of the
United Nations Security Council,'' he said, indicating that the
principles of such an agreement could be those of a future U.N.
resolution.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Kosovo should only gain autonomy but will be
under an ``international protection'' with the ``indispensable''
condition of an international force to be deployed in the
province.
</P>
<P>
``No government of the Alliance (NATO) has changed stand on
this point and has not adopted the idea of independence (of
Kosovo),'' he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that a future international peacekeeping force in
Kosovo could consist of troops from NATO, Russia and ``neutral''
countries in the Balkans or other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
``At the same time, one should be sure that this whole force
functions well and does not repeat the errors committed (by the
international community) Bosnia,'' he said.

He also said that an international force for Kosovo should be
decided by the United Nations Security Council with or without the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tension Between Government and Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The high tension between the
Kuwaiti parliament and government, which was sparked by the
parliament grilling of a cabinet minister, has been defused with
Tuesday's dissolution of the legislature by Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad
Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The decision to dissolve the parliament and to elect a new one
on July 3 was announced hours after the relations between the
executive and legislative powers seemed irreversibly
unreconcilable.
</P>
<P>
A decree issued by the Emir said the parliament was dissolved
because "parliament members (MPs) have misused constitutional
powers in a way not consistent with the spirit of the
Constitution."
</P>
<P>
The decree was also based on a recommendation by Crown
Prince and Prime Minister Saad Abdullah Al-Sabah, which was
approved by the cabinet ministers, the Kuwait News Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Saad sent Emir Jaber a letter in which he expressed outrage
over the parliament questioning of Minister of Justice and
Islamic Affairs Minister Ahmad Khaled Al-Kulaib, who was accused
of being responsible for misprints of 120,000 copies of Quran.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's parliament debate, MP Abbas Al-Khodari, who
launched the grilling motion, described the typo mistakes of
the holy book as "a disaster." He also accused Al-Kulaib of
failing to adopt measures to avoid the misprinting, wasting
public funds and forgery.
</P>
<P>
What added fuel to the crisis between the government and
parliament was that two motions for a vote of confidence on
Al-Kulaib received enough backing for a formal parliament vote.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister blamed the parliamentary practices "entered
into controversies at the expense of the nation and the people
and were therefore "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Besides the typo mistakes of the holy book, MPs are also
reportedly at odds with the government over the purchase of
the American-made Paladin howitzers, which MPs said are
"outdated" while the cabinet insisted that the Kuwaiti army is
"in dire need of the guns ."
</P>
<P>
The parliament was also refraining from giving green light to
the country's oil project for fear that the government would
confer ownership of the state oil fields on foreign companies,
which is banned by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government has been seeking technical assistance
from international oil companies in developing the country's oil
fields.
</P>
<P>
The government's revoking of a six-month share sale which,
opposition legislators blamed, cost some 60 million dollars of
public funds was also believed to be lying behind the friction
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The dissolution of the parliament, the third time since the
Gulf country introduced parliamentary democracy in 1963, received
mixed reaction from the MPs.
</P>
<P>
MPs who favor the decision said this "is an Emiri right
and guaranteed by the constitution," while those who are
against said the dissolution "does not solve the problem."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that since the crisis between the
parliament and the government reached a dead end, dissolving
the former was the last straw for the Emir to avert
Al-Kulaib to be voted out of office.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation was not new, they said, adding that a
parliament grilling last March, which was followed by a motion
for a vote of confidence, against the then information
minister forced a mass resignation of the last cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, a parliament dissolution, which was prompted
by a serious dispute between the executive and legislature
authorities over the government-proposed reform package as well
as by the threatening of some MPs to question several
ministers, was narrowly averted by the Emir's timely mediation.
</P>
<P>
However, despite both sides had pledged to kick off a "close
cooperation to serve the country and the citizens," only a
fragile relationship was maintained eversince.
</P>
<P>
As a new parliament will be elected within two months,
observers here are doubting whether the outstanding disputes
between Kuwaiti government and parliament can be rooted out.

LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
pledged on Wednesday to tighten the law on incitement to racial
hatred in the wake of the London nail bombings.

hatred is a crime."
</P>

"We will do everything we can to make it clear that, though we

<HEADLINE> W. Bank Funds Two Projects in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will fund two
projects in Uganda to help restore the country's poor
infrastructure and improve its financial system.
</P>
<P>
The two, named Nakivubo Channel Rehabilitation Project and the
Financial Markets Assistance Project, will cost a total of 26.8
million U.S. dollars, a press release from the World Bank office
in Uganda said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of the Nakivubo channel is significant given
that it is the main drainage channel in the capital city built in
the 1930s. The decline in its efficacy caused by non-maintenance
often results in considerable hindrance to economic activity in
the populated areas such as the central business district of
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
This project would support the government's program by
alleviating the frequent and increasing incidence of flooding in
the area, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The financial project can improve the soundness, performance
and competitiveness of the financial system. This is aimed at
supporting broad-based private sector growth.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's growth targets require a sound and more efficient
financial system which would facilitate and secure payments and
transfers, provide savings facilities for urban and rural
population and loans to credible businesses.
</P>
<P>
World Bank is one of the key international financial
institutions providing fund for the development of Uganda in
recent years. One third of the government spending comes from
this fund. Since 1994, the World Bank has funded a total of 21
projects in Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Ratio paid to Compensation Fund Unjust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- It was unjust that 30 percent
proceeds of the oil sold under the oil-for-food program should be
deducted in order to provide compensation, Iraq said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a latter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraq's
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf, said the
percentage to be paid to the Compensation Fund must be
reconsidered, in view of the fact that this percentage was
calculated on the basis of revenues that could not be realized
because of the continued imposition on Iraq of the tyrannical
sanctions and the reduction in the level of oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, revenue had been reduced as oil prices had
fallen, Al-Sahaf said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
"The oil-for-food program is intended to provide food and
medicine. It is not an oil-for-compensation program. The
oil-for-food program may in no way be considered as a lifting of
the sanctions. Therefore, the allocation to the Compensation Fund
of any sums raised through this program must be considered as an
abusive practice that should be halted forthwith, since Iraq is
suffering from the sanctions," Al-Sahaf said.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of reports issued by United Nations agencies have
affirmed that the oil-for-food program has humanitarian purposes,
and that revenues from oil exports are insufficient to meet the
humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people, Consequently, the
program has not been successful in its aim of materially
reducing the difficulties faced by Iraq as a result of the
tyrannical sanctions that have been imposed on the country for
nearly nine years," he continued.

"The 30 percent currently paid to the Compensation Fund
represents a serious and unjust obstacle to the implementation
of the purposes of the purchase and distribution plan agreed
under the Memorandum of Understanding," Al-Sahaf said.
</P>
<P>
It amounted to a violation of Iraqi people's human rights,
foremost among which was the right to live, Al-Sahaf added.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant U.N. resolutions, 30 percent of Iraq's
revenues from oil export goes to the Compensation Fund.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Int'l Cooperation in Human </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to further expand
its cooperation and exchanges with the U.N. Center of Human
Settlements (Habitat) as well as with other countries and relevant
agencies in the field of human settlements, a Chinese minister
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vic-Minister Song Chunhua of Construction made the
remarks here at the17th session of the U.N. Commission of Human
Settlements which opened at the United Nations Office in Nairobi
with hundreds of delegates attending from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Song urged international communities,
particularly developed countries, to provide the developing
nations with more technological and financial support for
facilitating the improvement of human settlements in these
countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that one of the key topics at this session is to
revitalize and reform the Habitat, namely, to transform the center
into a City Agency focusing its work on urban settlement
governance and secure tenure.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that while attaching importance to
urban human settlements, human settlement issue in rural areas
should not be neglected where huge population of many developing
countries are still living there with serious human settlement
problems.
</P>
<P>
General speaking, the vice-minister said, China supported the
reform of the Habitat to improve its efficiency and perfect its
mechanism, and stressed that the reform is aimed at strengthening
the role of the Habitat so that it could better serve its member
states, especially developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Song also briefed over 600 participants from all parts of the
world on China's efforts in implementing the Habitat agenda and
commitment in accelerating housing construction and improving
living environment.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that a revitalized Habitat would become
an independent and highly efficient U.N. agency for handling
global human settlement issues.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Open Training Center for Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will open a training center next
Monday in an effort to enhance the development of the country's
private sector.
</P>
<P>
The training center for the Private Sector Development Program
(PSDP), which is funded by the European Union (EU), is to promote
Egypt's privatization process by providing business services, the
center's preparatory body said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The center's overall target is to provide the kind of training
that will assist the local business and industry to meet
challenges created by the privatization drive, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started its privatization drive in 1996 to sell off more
than 300 inefficient and loss-making state-run enterprises. Over
one third of the enterprises selected for the process have so far
been privatized.
</P>
<P>
The private business is expected to control up to 80 percent of
Egypt's economy by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory body said that training courses will be offered to
management at all levels in both the manufacturing and service
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Specialized courses have been designed in such areas as sales,
marketing, finance, personnel and human resources, executive
secretariat, quality control, it said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Advises Citizens Not To Visit Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Foreign Office on Wednesday
advised its citizens not to visit Yemen after a court there
sentenced three Islamic militants to death for their part in the
abduction and killing of Western tourists last December.
</P>
<P>
"Following the judge's verdict, the (militant) group's leader
called on his supporters and their associates to target Western
interests and foreigners in Yemen," the Foreign Office said in a
statement issued on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to advise against all travel to Yemen. Random
armed kidnapping is common in Yemen," it said.
</P>
<P>
British nationals living in Yemen should leave if their
presence was not "absolutely essential," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Last December, three Britons and an Australian were killed in
an incident when Yemeni troops fought a gun battle with their
kidnappers in a desperate bid by the army to free the 16 tourists
who had been taken hostage.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militiaman Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) was wounded Wednesday in attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas in south Lebanon, the militia's official radio Voice of
the South reported.
</P>
<P>
The militiaman was injured by the rockets launched by
guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah on SLA's outpost at
Kafarhun, just north of the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The attacks came apparently in response to earlier Israeli air
raids on Hezbollah's alleged communication center in central
Baalbek in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, two Israeli warplanes fired missiles on a
small building adjacent to a mosque in the city in retaliation for
Hezbollah's deadly bombing ambushes against Israeli forces and its
allies in the past two days, in which an Israeli soldier and a SLA
officer were killed and four Israeli soldiers and two SLA
militiamen were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The missiles injured two Lebanese civilians and at least three
Hezbollah members, according to security sources.
</P>
<P>
Sources of Hezbollah's command said that Hezbollah is studying
several options in response to the Israeli action which it
believed has violated the cease-fire understanding reached
between the two parties three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The pact, brokered by the United States to end a 16-day
Israeli assault on Lebanon, prohibited any attacks on civilians
or from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its ally
SLA out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Free Exchange Rate Urged in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Central Bank of
Angola Aguinaldo Jaime said Wednesday that a free exchange rate
will be beneficial to the country's economy and finance, since
Angola's foreign exchange reserves are on the verge of exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at the plenary session of the 1999 annual budgetary
parliamentary session here, Jaime said that "the country has no
longer had the conditions for a fixed exchange rate."
</P>
<P>
Now that Angola is running out of foreign exchange reserves,
the only way out is to change the fixed rate into a floating rate
system, and let the market to adjust the value of kwanza, the
Angolan currency, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Though the official rate between kwanza and the U.S. dollar
has remained 720,000 to one in the past six months, it has soared
to 1.8 million kwanza to one U.S. dollar at the black market.
</P>
<P>
Angola, the biggest oil producer second only to Nigeria in
Africa, is experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis, due to
the renewed civil war and the plummeting oil price on the world
market, Jaime said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the country's liability has reached its limit
and no more loans are likely for the government.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Angola failed to get any loan from the
London financial market on its oil guarantee basis by the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore, impossible to continue its deficit budget like
what the government did before, the central bank chief said,
adding that the new budget he is submitting to parliament is well
balanced in terms of its income and spending.

<HEADLINE> Financial Institutions Blamed for Discriminating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's State Minister for Gender
Issues Oppah Muchinguri Wednesday accused finance institutions of
having a negative attitude toward women seeking funding for
projects.
</P>
<P>
Opening a four-day Southern African Conference of the
Associated Country Women of the World (ACWW), Muchinguri said the
practice of racism and gender discrimination continued to dominate
in financial institutions, with some banks regarding women as
risky despite the potential viability to their projects.
</P>
<P>
This hindered the participation of women in meaningful
projects, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Women are totally excluded from participating in capital
ownership activities," she said, adding that the exclusion
contributed to women's inability to produce collateral security
when approaching financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Participants drawn from nine southern African countries were
discussing here in the Zimbabwean capital ways of creating
business opportunities for women.
</P>
<P>
ACWW, an international organization that seeks to offer
support, friendship and practical help to its members, now has
nine million members in more than 70 countries.

GENEVA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of Thailand's Supachai
Panitchpakdi have urged the General Council of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to form consensus around Supachai as WTO's new
director-general.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made public here Wednesday, trade envoys, called
as "Friends of Supachai", reaffirmed their support for Kenya's
proposal submitted on May 4 to the General Council that consensus
now be formed around Supachai
</P>
<P>
Commenting on General Council Chairman's remarks that "Dr
Supachai is out of the race" for the WTO post, they said, "It is
important to clarify that it is the General Council which has the
responsibility to decide on this matter."
</P>
<P>
"The chairman has no authority to exclude any candidate, or to
declare that any candidate is 'out of the race'," said the trade
envoys from Australia, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong of China, Japan,
Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe

Mchumo's proposal was rejected by Supachai's supporters who
demanded that the selection process should go in a transparent and
fair way.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania Call for Ceasefire in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania
Wednesday issued a joint communique calling for an immediate
ceasefire in the war- torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The communique said presidents of the three nations "urged all
the parties to the conflict to urgently put in place a cessation
of hostilities and a ceasefire agreement in the interest of peace
and stability of the Democratic Republic of Congo and other
countries in the region."
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Rwanda, a key player in the DRC war, has been
under pressure to take an identical stand with its close ally
Uganda, which signed a ceasefire agreement with DRC government at
a regional summit in Libya last month.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, and their host Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa held
the discussions at the Chamwino State Lodge in Dodoma, central
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Before the summit, Rwanda was unhappy about Uganda's peace deal
with DRC government. Uganda later played down the importance of
the agreement saying it would not pull out of the vast central
African country until its security concerns were fully met.
</P>
<P>
During the talks in Dodoma, which were also attended by Rwandan
Vice- President and Minister for Defense, Major General Paul
Kagame, Rwanda and Uganda have apparently healed rift to a great
extent over their military campaign in DRC.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, which has remained neutral in the DRC conflict, has
been urged by other African countries to take a more active role
in brokering peace, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have allegedly backed rebels fighting to
topple the government of DRC President Laurent Kabila since August
last year.
</P>
<P>
The nine-month war has also dragged in Zimbabwe, Namibia,
Angola and Chad fighting on the side of Kabila. Last week, Chad
announced it would pull its troops out of DRC.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Rwanda's presence in appealing for a
ceasefire has brought the hope of peace to the third largest
African country.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, "the summit re-affirmed the need
for peace, unity, reconciliation and reconstruction in the
Democratic Republic of Congo as well as an all-inclusive national
dialog of the stakeholders to discuss and determine the new
political dispensation in the country."
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, the summit welcomed President Laurent Kabila's
 expressed readiness to hold direct talks with the rebels," it
said.

<HEADLINE> Currency Depreciation to Be Reversed: Ugandan Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The marked depreciation of the
Ugandan shilling is seasonal and will be reversed with the coming
of another coffee season and more effective measures taken by the
central bank of the country.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Wednesday by the Bank of Uganda said the
falling trend of the shilling will end as soon as the new coffee
season sets in.
</P>
<P>
"The rate will continue to be market determined, but Bank of
Uganda will not stand and watch instability prevail in the market.
 In the month of April 1999, Bank of Uganda intervened in the
foreign exchange market on the sale side by 25.6 million U.S.
dollars," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
"Bank of Uganda stands ready to intervene prudently in order to
smoothen out wide fluctuations in the exchange rate and to avoid
instability in the market," it added.
</P>
<P>
The release attributed the depreciation to mainly the unwinding
of the coffee boom, insecurity in the country and region, delay in
donor fund and others.
</P>
<P>
Over the period of July 1998 to April 1999, the exchange rate
between shilling and dollar has depreciated by 18.9 percent from a
mid-rate of 1, 232 shillings per dollar to 1,520 shillings to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
In April 1999, pressures have been much stronger and these have
seen the rate depreciate from a mid-rate of 1,390 shillings per
dollar as at end of March to 1,518 shillings per dollar as at the
end April. This is equivalent to a monthly depreciation of 8.56
percent in April alone.

<HEADLINE> UN Meeting on Human Settlements Opens in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 5 (xinhua) -- Over 600 delegates from more than
120 countries Wednesday attended the 17th session of the
Commission on Human Settlements of the U.N. Center for Human
Settlements (Habitat) which opened at the U.N. office in Nairobi,
Kenya's capital.
</P>
<P>
During the nine-day meeting, the delegates will focus on such
issues as the revitalization of the Habitat, work program and
budget for the biennium 2000-2001, human settlements foundation,
cooperation with partners, and the implementation of the Habitat
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said the problem of human settlement remains unsolved and
human settlement conditions have continued to deteriorate due to
overwhelming socio-economic difficulties facing many countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the on-going commission
session would approve a realistic work program and budget that
will fulfil the expectation of the member states, in their pursuit
of human settlement development.
</P>
<P>
The president told the participants that Kenya is implementing
the "National Poverty Eradication Plan 1999-2015" and hoped the
U.N. Commission

for Human Settlements would find ways of integrating its world
program with the objectives of Kenya's poverty eradication plan.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Toepfer, acting executive director of the Habitat, said
radical and swift social transformation in this century has seen
an exponential growth in global population and is also a period of
increasing migration of populations from the countryside to the
cities.
</P>
<P>
"Sustainable development depends to an ever greater degree on
the effective management of urban areas. In this regard, this
session of the Commission will give a strong signal to the
international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer noted that a revitalized Habitat must develop
strategies that transform cities from being part of the problems
into a part of the solution for the sustainable development of
urban areas as well as rural areas.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation with partners, Toepfer said, his center should
facilitate and encourage the leading role of local authorities in
decision-making at the city level and in improving urban
management and governance practices.
</P>
<P>
During the session, the delegates will review proposals for
Habitat' s reform and revitalization. It is expected that the
session will also endorse and launch the Habitat as the "City
Agency" of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Comprising 58 countries, the Commission of Human Settlements is
the governing body of the Habitat and approves the center's
overall policy, project priorities and action, with its
commission session held every two years.

<HEADLINE> Blair, Ahern to Chair N.Irish Arms Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern will chair talks with leading
Northern Irish politicians on Thursday in a fresh effort to break
the deadlock over disarmament in the province.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman told reporters on Wednesday the two
prime ministers would chair bilateral talks with the main parties
involved, including the Ulster Unionist Party, Sinn Fein and the
Social Democratic and Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
"The first thing the Prime Minister did when he got back from
the Balkans (on Monday) was to get on the phone to Bertie Ahern."
</P>
<P>
"We are still working on the timings. The position is he
(Blair) will co-chair talks on a bilateral basis with Ahern. The
four main parties have all been invited," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But he played down its chances of brokering a speedy agreement
on the disarmament issue, which is threatening the peace agreement
sealed in April of last year.
</P>
<P>
"I think we should see this as a continuation of the process
rather than the culmination of it. We've maintained throughout
that things continue to be difficult, but we have to find a way
through," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has refused to share
power with Sinn Fein until its military arms the Irish Republican
Army hands over its weapons as proof that its 30-year war against
British rule is over.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein is bitterly opposed to the decommissioning,
arguing it is not a pre-condition included in the peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Greece Takes Measures to Combat Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece has taken a series of measures
to fight forest fires, which plague the country every year.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Public Order Ministry, which is responsible for the
country's fire brigade, has issued a ministerial decree setting
out the responsibilities and obligations of those involved in
preventing and fighting forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Four new fire stations and an extra 20 fire-fighting units are
to open while several separate organizations have been merged in
order to simplify procedures and ensure swift responses.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation provides for seasonal firefighters to act
as volunteers after their contract expires, while provision is
also made for any citizen who wishes to act as a volunteer
firefighter.
</P>
<P>
Greece has this year 1,300 new permanent firefighters while
4,000 seasonal contract workers will be reportedly hired in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
So far, Greece has purchased two CL415 "Canadair' aircraft and
another eight will arrive by 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Public Order Ministry will also lease two CL215s aircraft,
an Ilyushin jet and four helicopters for the current season.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five new fire engines have also been purchased and are
already in service.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM On ASEAN Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's admission into the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a necessity of
geo-politics and geo-economics, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks at an evening party held at the Hotel
Inter-Continental to celebrate Cambodia's admission into ASEAN,
now a 10-member regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 people, including government officials, diplomats and
representatives of international organizations, attended the
party.
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia's membership in ASEAN is one of the top priorities of
the Royal Government of Cambodia's policy. ASEAN membership is an
event of historical importance and will have far-reaching
ramifications for the country's future," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia officially joined ASEAN on April 30, fulfilling the
vision of ASEAN-10 as envisaged by its founding fathers 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen cited four major factors behind Cambodia's decision to
join ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
-- ASEAN created a regional environment of security, peace and
stability, allowing this region to prosper. This is ASEAN's
strongest point;
</P>
<P>
-- ASEAN is a region for cooperation, thus playing a crucial
role in fostering the community spirit among members;
</P>
<P>
-- ASEAN is a region known for its strong economic growth. For
more than two decades ASEAN has become a main economic growth
center;
</P>
<P>
-- ASEAN is an arena for diplomacy and a major international
gateway.
</P>
<P>
"As ASEAN's full member, Cambodia will actively participate in
various regional economic initiatives and try our best to
implement ASEAN agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is well prepared to contribute to build a more
developed and prosperous Southeast Asia, he said. "Cambodia did
not join ASEAN with bare hands."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Finances Health Project in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Wednesday that it will provide a total of 60 million U.S. dollars
in loan and credit to help China address its top priority health
needs.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank-supported China Health Nine Project has two
components, one to improve maternal health and child development
and the other to prevent and control serious infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the first component of the project is
designed to reduce maternal and child mortality and morbidity and
to improve child survival and development.
</P>
<P>
This component would be entirely focused on the poorest
families living in the poorest regions of China and will include
programs to improve the quality of maternal and child care
services as well as the measures to make the services accessible
to the poorest.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the second component is to prevent and control
sexually-transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, and other blood-borne
infections. This component will implement comprehensive and
multisectoral public health policies and programs in four of
China's high-risk provinces, and will also build technical and
management capacity at the central level and promote the
involvement of non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
The loan, totaling 50 million dollars, will have a grace period
of 5 years with 20 years to maturity and the credit, amounting to
10 million dollars, will be payable in 35 years, including a
10-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rocket Fails to Deploy Satellite Properly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A new Delta 3 rocket, launched by
Boeing Corporation of the United States in Cape Canaveral in
Florida State Tuesday, failed to send a commercial communications
satellite into a proper orbit, company officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 12-story rocket, which was flying for the first time since
the booster exploded on its maiden launch last August, vaulted off
its launch pad in a brilliant eruption of flame and smoke.
</P>
<P>
A little less than 22 minutes later, the rocket's second stage
engine failed to relight leaving its costly cargo in a lopsided
orbit, with a low point about 157 kilometers above the earth.
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive failure for the Delta 3 and was a
bitter blow to the U.S. launch industry which was already reeling
from three failures of the U.S. military's Titan 4 rocket and the
loss of a satellite on a commercial Athena rocket.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said an investigation team would be arriving at Cape
Canaveral Wednesday to begin reviewing telemetry from the
ill-fated rocket. Detailed readings from a ground station on
Ascension Island were expected to shed light on the nature of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The Delta 3 was carrying Loral Space and Communications' Orion
3 satellite, which was to be stationed over Asia to provide
television, Internet and other communications links from India to
Hawaii. It was also to beam television channels direct to home
across South Korea.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Will Not Resume Land Sales Until Next Year: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for National
Development Lim Hng Kiang Wednesday indicated that the government
will not resume land sales until next year.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question in parliament on when the government
will launch the next land sales, he said that with 24,000 units
still unsold, a resumption of residential land sales next year
would ensure the pipeline of supply is maintained.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the government will only review its land sales
program in September as planned. "There is no change in our
schedule."
</P>
<P>
The government suspended land sales after the Asian financial
crisis began to hit the country.
</P>
<P>
While demand for private property has picked up, there is ample
supply of private housing, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As at the first quarter of 1999, there were 4,100 launched but
unsold units. Another 9,800 units had the pre-requisite approvals
to be launched," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, there were 6,300 units from other land sales
projects and 3,700 units from private land projects under
construction," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lim also said the government would go ahead with the release of
a site in Clarke Quay as announced last June.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, there were 790,000 square meters of
office space and 150,000 square meters of shop space under
construction in the first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
"This will be sufficient to meet demand for the next few
years," Lim said. "We will review the situation and announce our
plans for future land sales for commercial development in
September as well."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Democratic Party New Political Home of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Party has
replaced the New National Party as the political home of whites in
South Africa, according to a recent survey by the Human Sciences
and Research Council (HSRC).
</P>
<P>
The results of the poll were released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll shows that potential voters for the Democratic Party
are most likely to be Afrikaans- or English-speaking whites.
</P>
<P>
They account for 72 percent of the party's support base. About
ten percent of blacks, 11 percent of coloreds and seven percent of
Indians across the country back the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Most New National Party supporters are colored (36 percent) or
white (42 percent) Afrikaans- or English-speaking voters.
</P>
<P>
About 13 percent of blacks and nine percent of Indians indicate
they would vote for the party.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in March among 2,200 people who
claimed to have registered for the June 2 election and said they
intended to vote.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that most supporters for both Democratic Party
and New National Party are living in Gauteng, the Eastern Cape or
the Northern Province.
</P>
<P>
African National Congress (ANC) supporters are likely to be
speaking one of the five most common black languages, and are
members of the Zionist Christian, the Roman Catholic and the
Methodist churches.
</P>
<P>
Zulus living in KwaZulu-Natal dominate the Inkatha Freedom
Party's support base. Voters backing the United Democratic
Movement (UDM) are mostly Xhosa and Zulu and live in the Eastern
Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Alliance would find 70 percent of its support in
the Free State, mostly white males. About seven in every 10
Federal Alliance supporters are employed, the survey reveals.
</P>
<P>
The same survey shows that the support for the ANC is 62
percent, that for the New National Party is eight percent.
Support levels for the Democratic Party and UDM are six and three
percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Leading Tobacco Producer Fostering New Industries (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province, a
leading producer of tobacco, is actively involved in the
development of its tourism and biological resources, seeking
alternative sources of revenue to the cigarette industry.
</P>
<P>
The province is now beset with crises in the tobacco business:
The cigarette market will open to foreign enterprises for fiercer
competition sooner or later, as China is taking measures to join
the World Trade Organization; and the anti-smoking tide is growing
in China as it is in the rest of the world, said Che Zhimin,
deputy director of the Provincial Economic and Technology Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
"To cope with this, the provincial government has to cultivate
new industries, including the tourism industry, as Yunnan is rich
in ethnic folklore and natural scenery, and the tapping of
biological resources," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has produced about one third of China's cigarettes since
the 1980s, statistics show, and the revenue it gains from this
sector -- about 70 percent of the province's total -- has helped
it to shake off poverty. Yunnan earmarked as much as more than 13
billion yuan (about 1.57 billion US dollars) to build halls and
basic facilities for the World Horticulture Exposition, which was
inaugurated just a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government began to restrict the production of
cigarettes as an economic policy last year. As a result, Yunnan's
acreage devoted to tobacco and tobacco yield decreased by half
from the previous year, and the local financial revenue was 1.8
billion yuan (about 216.87 million US dollars) less.

<HEADLINE> French PM Fixes Two Conditions for Stopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
said on Wednesday that if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
begins to withdraw Serb forces from Kosovo and accepts the
principle of a return of Kosovo refugees to their homes, NATO
could stop its bombing campaign "immediately."
</P>
<P>
Jospin made the statement during a hearing at the National
Assembly, or lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The two conditions presented by Jospin for NATO to stop
airstrikes were included in the five-point proposal by the United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Annan has called for a stop of repression in Kosovo, the
withdrawal of Serb troops and paramilitary forces, the return of
refugees, the establishment of an international force and the
acceptance by Belgrade of a framework for a political solution on
the basis of the Rambouillet agreement.
</P>
<P>
Jospin also announced that he would fly to Moscow on May 24 to
hold talks with Russian leaders on the Yugoslav crisis.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Rejects Businessman's Offer to Buy Clob Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Singapore
(SES) Wednesday rejected a Singaporean's offer to buy Malaysian
Clob shares at steep discounts.
</P>
<P>
The SES said in a statement that the offer document submitted
by Akbar Khan, a Malaysia-based Singaporean businessman, "falls
short of generally accepted standards."
</P>
<P>
Khan's company, Effective Capital Sdn Bhd, offered at the end
of last month to buy Clob shares at a premium of about 45 percent
to last traded prices on 15 September 1998, the date when trading
in Malaysian securities on Clob ceased.
</P>
<P>
The offer lacks relevant price information, said the SES
statement, because it has not mentioned that most Clob shares on
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) on that particular day
closed higher than Khan's offer.
</P>
<P>
For most shares, said the statement, Khan is therefore offering
prices at a discount to that day's prices on the KLSE and the
offer prices are also on average about 50 percent lower than KLSE
closing prices on 30 April this year.
</P>
<P>
The SES also said Khan's offer does not demonstrate his
financial ability to secure the buying of all the Clob shares.
</P>
<P>
Other defects cited by the SES statement include the offer's
"not unconditional" nature and its lack of confirmation of
official approvals.
</P>
<P>
The SES said it will distribute details of the offer to Clob
investors for their careful consideration and ask whether they
would accept it.
</P>
<P>
Most Clob investors have openly objected Khan's offer and asked
the SES to protect their interests, according to local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The SES said it will continue to press the KLSE to perform an
agreement signed last year to transfer the Clob shares into
individual accounts and allow them to be traded.
</P>
<P>
The controversy between Singapore and Malaysia over the
Malaysian Clob shares has been at a stalemate since last September
following the Malaysian government's announcement of capital
control measures.
</P>
<P>
There are 170,000 shareholders with Clob accounts, with shares
estimated to total at least 10 billion Malaysian ringgit (4.5
billion Singapore dollars) at current prices.

<P>
ANKARA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of Kosovar refugees in
Turkey has reached 14,223 since NATO launched air strikes against
Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Wednesday by the Turkish Interior Ministry
said that 6,076 Kosovar refugees including 2,425 women, 2,243 men
and 1,408 children have entered Turkey from the Tekirdag-Corlu
Border Gate since the beginning of the NATO air campaign against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that a total of 6,842 refugees including
2,435 women, 1,780 men and 2,627 children have entered Turkey from
the Edirne-Kapikule border gate.
</P>
<P>
And a total of 1,305 refugees including 475 women, 453 men and
377 children have entered Turkey from Istanbul, the largest city
of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 5,767 Kosovar refugees including 1,831 women, 1,627
men and 2,309 children have been taking shelter at the
Gaziosmanpasa Refugee Camp in Kirklareli province near Istanbul.
</P>

Turkish F-16 warplanes that have been joining in the NATO air
raids on Yugoslavia have accumulated to 1,184 flight hours.

<HEADLINE> Taliban to Build Two Highways to Connect Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban militia have plans to
construct two main highways connecting Afghanistan and Pakistan to
facilitate smooth transportation between the two countries, a
Taliban official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Maulvi Ahmed Jan, Taliban's senior official responsible for
mineral development and industries, disclosed the plans in
Karachi, the southern Pakistani port city, according to a report
of the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
One of the two proposed highways will run from the Afghan
capital Kabul to Torkham on the Pakistan border, around 190
kilometers, and the other from Qandahar in southern Afghanistan to
Chaman in Pakistan, 120 kilometers long.
</P>
<P>
There are now two roads along the routes linking Afghanistan
and Pakistan, but lack of maintenance has ruined both of them.
</P>
<P>
Jan said several companies including Daewoo Corporation of
South Korea and a Pakistani firm had expressed willingness to
construct these roads.
</P>
<P>
He said experts from these companies had completed a survey and
were expected to submit their feasibility studies soon.
</P>
<P>
He said both roads will also cater to the transportation of
goods from Pakistan to Central Asian countries and back.

<HEADLINE> UAE Armed Forces for Protection, not Aggression, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Military leaders of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) Wednesday stressed the country is building
its armed forces for the purpose of protection, not aggression.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the country's armed forces unification day,
which falls on Thursday, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Sheikh
Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan reiterated that the UAE's armed
forces are a self-defense organ.
</P>
<P>
The forces also support stability and security at international
levels, he added.
</P>
<P>
"History will be a witness of glorious efforts of the UAE
armed forces in its cooperation with the GCC forces, its heroic
participation in liberating Kuwait, its defending of Lebanon and
in the operation of hope restoration in Somalia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE armed forces were unified on May 6, 1976 under the
"objective and historical decision" made by the country's leaders
to "put the interests of the country before any other
consideration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander
of the UAE Armed Forces Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan also
said the UAE forces "do not intend agression on others, but serve
as a shield to protect the UAE against offense from outside and to
spread security and stability in the country."
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 Gulf War, which ended with Iraq being
driven out of Kuwait by the U.S.-led alliance, the UAE bought
huge amounts of weapons and military equipment from the U.S.,
France, Britain to strengthen its forces.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is particularly wary of its strong neighbor Iran,
with which it has a dispute over three Gulf islands.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Deputy Minister Urges Progress in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Politicians in Northern Ireland must
act quickly to make the Good Friday Agreement work or face the
ridicule of the world, the province's Deputy First Minister Seamus
Mallon warned on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mallon's warning came as the Ulster Unionists, Sinn Fein and
the Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) were locked in talks
in Belfast aimed at breaking the deadlock in the peace process
over weapons decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern will meet the party leaders for more intensive talks
in Downing Street on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mallon, who is also deputy leader of the SDLP, said at the
international State of the World Forum peace conference in Belfast
that key decisions, such as the establishment of the Northern
Ireland executive, had to be taken now because they would only get
more difficult as time went on.
</P>
<P>
"Are we to drag the lumber and baggage of this century, of this
millennium, into the next century, into the next millennium? " he
asked.
</P>
<P>
"To do so will draw down the ridicule of the world - and
ridicule is all we'll deserve," Mallon said.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland was in a state of transition and on the road
to reconciliation, Mallon said. But he warned that the
difficulties in establishing the assembly executive caused by the
impasse over IRA weapons could only get worse, and action was
needed now.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock over the Northern Ireland peace process emerge
after the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has refused to
share power with Sinn Fein until its military arms the Irish
Republican Army hands over its weapons as proof that its 30-year
war against British rule is over.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein is bitterly opposed to the decommissioning,
arguing it is not a pre-condition included in the peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Meets Rwanda Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
had talks here Wednesday evening with the International Panel of
Eminent Personalities, which is investigating the 1994 Rwanda
genocide, over the cause of the genocide.
</P>
<P>
The panel, spearheaded by the former President of Botswana
Ketumile Masire, is in Uganda to collect views about what happened
in Rwanda between April and June 1994, a press release from the
president's office said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni warmly welcomed the panel members and was happy to
note that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) had set up an
investigative team to look into the crimes against humanity
committed in the region.
</P>
<P>
The president gave the panel a comprehensive and thorough
briefing on the genesis of the genocide which he traced to the
genocide that took place in Rwanda in 1959.
</P>
<P>
The culture of impunity which accompanied the genocide and
subsequent massacres has over three decades compounded the problem
culminating in the 1994 massacre, Museveni noted.
</P>
<P>
Masire thanked Museveni for sharing his knowledge of the region
with the panel members and stressed that human rights are a human
heritage which the African people must protect and enhance.
</P>
<P>
The Panel of Imminent Personalities was set up by the OAU
during its summit in Burkina Faso in 1998, whose mission is to
probe the causes leading to the genocide in Rwanda.

ROME, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
reiterated Wednesday his opposition to launching a ground attack
in Kosovo, but also said there should not be a unilateral halting
of the NATO air attacks.

In a meeting with anti-war parliament members at the prime

Following the meeting, the pacifist parliament members appeared
relatively satisfied with D'Alema's words, adding that "his
convincing and persuasive exclusion to the possibility of ground
troops in the conflict in Kosovo was good for us to hear."

<TEXT>
<P>
Delegates at the two-day consultative group meeting that began
Monday, commended Tanzania's success in its macro-economic
performance and improved management of the economy, the World Bank
said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a forum at which major donor countries and
multilateral financial institutions meet individual Third World
countries to review donor funded projects, macro-economic
performance, management of the economy, monetary and financial
policies and agree on future funding.
</P>
<P>
The donors were impressed with Tanzania's efforts to boost
revenue collection, taming inflation and proper budget management
and other economic policies which led to economic growth despite
adverse weather conditions during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
However, they emphasized the need to improve resource
allocation to fund priority expenditures in roads, education and
health.
</P>
<P>
The donors also expressed concern that the gains from
macro-economic stabilization and the adjustment program have not
yet been adequately shared by the population at large and that
corruption remains a very serious problem requiring urgent and
systematic action.
</P>
<P>
Other issues central to Tanzania's economic growth included the
 improvement of private investment, accelerating the restructuring
or privatizing public enterprises and effecting comprehensive
public service reform.
</P>
<P>
The meeting were attended by delegates from many countries and
organizations like Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, the United States, the
World Bank, the Africa Development Bank, the Arab Bank and the
European Commission.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Computer problems at the main air
traffic control center for O'Hare International and Midway
airports in Chicago of the United States Wednesday caused numerous
flight cancellations and delays for passengers traveling into and
out of the city, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Flight backups were expected to continue throughout the day
although the software problem was fixed by late morning, according
to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Takeoffs and landings were delayed for an hour or more, said
Chicago Aviation Department spokeswoman Monique Bond. But, she did
not know how many flights were delayed or how many, if any, were
diverted from the airports.
</P>
<P>
The trouble started when the Tracon Center in Elgin tested new
software that displays a plane's size on radar screens, said Tony
Molinaro, a spokesman at the Federal Aviation Administration's
Great Lakes office.
</P>
<P>
However, controllers never lost sight of planes and did not
lose communication with planes, the reports quoted Molinaro as
saying.
</P>
<P>
United Airlines canceled 25 percent, 164 flights, of its
afternoon flights into and out of O'Hare, said spokeswoman
Kristina Price. American Airlines canceled 42 of its 337 flights,

<HEADLINE> Regional Ministers to Meet for Peace in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said Wednesday that a regional meeting to be participated by the
foreign ministers of the countries concerned will take place soon
for a cease-fire agreement on the nine-month war in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who has been mandated by the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to mediate a peaceful solution to the
conflict, disclosed this after returning here Wednesday from a
two-day visit to Libya.
</P>
<P>
He said upon his arrival from Tripoli that his consultations
with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi made preparations for the
foreign ministers' meeting, which is designed to pave the way for
a long-expected summit on the Congo issue.
</P>
<P>
At the ministerial meeting a document for a cease-fire
agreement will be finalized, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said he and Gaddafi agreed that Lusaka peace initiative
should continue and be given support by other African leaders
because it has reached an advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
Signing the cease-fire accord is part of the peace process in
the war- torn central African country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement signed by Congolese President Laurent
Kabila and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni last month in Libya
is not meant to take anything away from the Lusaka process, said
Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited Lusaka summit to seek a peaceful solution to
the crisis have been postponed several times from the originally
planned date of December 8 last year because of largely Kabila's
refusal to allow the rebels fighting to topple him to be involved
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In March, Kabila changed his mind and agreed to allow them to
be involved.
</P>
<P>
The rebels attended a meeting of defense and security chiefs of
the concerned countries for the first time held here last month,
but walked out of the meeting, demanding a bilateral meeting with
a Congolese government delegation.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Belgium Fail to Agree over Extradition of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda will not back down from
requesting the extradition from Tanzania of former Rwandan army
officer Major Bernard Ntuyahaga, who is accused of genocide in
favor of Belgium, a government minister in Kigali declared
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
''We still maintain our request to have Ntuyahaga extradited to
Rwanda to be tried for genocide crimes,'' Rwandan minister of
Justice Mucyo (only one name) told reporters in the Rwandan
capital, quoted by Rwanda News Agency (RNA).
</P>
<P>
'' The crimes he is charged of were committed on Rwandan soil
against Rwandans,'' Mucyo recalled.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga is now held by Tanzanian authorities for illegal
entry on their territory after charges against him were withdrawn
by the prosecutor of the U.N. Tribunal for Rwanda last March and
subsequently set free.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor had ordered judges to extradite Ntuyahaga to
Belgium where he is wanted for ordering the murder of 10 Belgian
blue helmets who were guarding former Rwandan Prime Minister
Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who was assassinated on April 7, 1994 at
the beginning of the genocide.
</P>
<P>
A special delegation of the Belgian Ministry of Justice was
dispatched to Kigali early this week to negotiate concession from
Rwanda so that Ntuyahaga be sent to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
''No concession was made because we want Ntuyahaga to be handed
over to us. But we finally convened to let the Tanzanian
government decide on who should have priority,'' Mucyo indicated.
</P>
<P>
Both Rwanda and Belgium, however, agreed on a joint trial of
the former army officer regardlessly of the jurisdiction he will
be handed over to.

JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for African
Unity (OAU) would send a team to observe South Africa's June 2
general election, OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Salim told reporters in Pretoria that he looked forward to a
poll that would be peaceful and successful, and that the OAU
wanted to be associated with this.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever government is elected by the people of South Africa,
we will expect it to build on the Mandela era," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim, who met South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad
earlier in the day, said the OAU expected a greater commitment
from South Africa in dealing with crises on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Salim and Pahad discussed the recent coup d'etat in the
Comoros, as well as efforts to restore peace in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and Angola.
</P>
<P>
Salim said much still needed to be done in the DRC, but a
military solution to the crisis was not the answer.
</P>
<P>
Salim condemned the coup in the Comoros and said several
African countries had called on the military in the country to
restore peace.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to Host African Women's Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 women from
different African nations are expected to gather in Zanzibar to
attend a four-day international conference discussing peace,
stability and culture this month.
</P>
<P>
The co-ordinator of the conference, Mariam Hamdan, said in
Zanzibar Wednesday that the conference, starting on May 17, is
aimed at addressing thorny problems facing women in the African
continent, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Four topics are going to be presented to the conference,
including the Impact of Conflict in Africa, the Role of Women in
Conflict Prevention and Management, Capacity Building for Women
and Gender Issues Toward the Next Century of Science and
Technology, Hamdan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The gathering is co-sponsored by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and
the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Hamdan, who is also the Acting Principal Secretary in the
Information Ministry of Zanzibar, said the meeting is to recommend
ways of solving women's problems originated from violence and war
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Surveys done by international organizations showed that women
are a group vulnerable to violence and wars, therefore efforts
must be made to help and prepare them in dealing with the
situation, she said.
</P>
<P>
Exhibitions will be staged during the conference to illustrate
problems facing African women in a bid to sensitize the
participants to the predicament, the official said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Zanzibar to host a large
international gathering. International figures like the
vice-presidents of Uganda and Gambia, the UNESCO Director General
and the wives of South African, Tanzanian and Zanzibar leaders are
expected to be present.

LONDON May 5 (Xinhua) - European leading stock markets closed
substantially lower Wednesday as an early slump on Wall Street and
fear of higher interest rates.

<P>
After opening lower on the back of the Dow Jones industrials'
overnight slide Tuesday, London's FTSE 100 nosed further into the
red, sliding 2 percent, or 131.4 points to close at 6401.7.
</P>

Traders said London's shares need something new to drive the
market forward and until this impetus arrives, shares will
continue to drift.

There were some suggestions that the monthly wait for a

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Talks with Libya in Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Wednesday
denied its State Department officials responsible for Libya held a
meeting with Libyan representatives in Rome.
</P>
<P>
The London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq al-Awsat reported the
meeting on Wednesday and said it was part of an attempt to turn a
"new page" in relations between the two countries, which do not
have diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
"No one from the Egypt and North Africa office has met with
Libyan officials in Rome," State Department spokesman James Foley
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But he said he could not speak for all branches of the U.S.
administration.
</P>
<P>
"Have other officials from the U.S. government met with
Libyans? I'm not going to deny that anyone has, but certainly no
one that I deal with in this building has," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asharq al-Awsat said the participants included the Libyan
ambassador to Italy and officials from "the State Department's
Libyan affairs desk."
</P>
<P>
It said the ambassador had earlier held talks with British
officials mediated by Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Libya and the United States became more plausible
after Tripoli last month handed over two Libyans to be tried in
the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Foley said Libya has more to do before the United States will
consider resuming diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
"We have still several major areas of remaining concern with
the Libyans that we want to see addressed," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators of the Philippine
government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) are now
laying the groundwork for the start of their formal peace talks
aimed at finally ending the conflict in Mindanao, the Presidential
Palace said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing, Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said
the GRP (Government of the Republic of the Philippines)--MILF
coordinating committee on the cessation of hostilities is meeting
informally Thursday in Cotabato City to draft the rules and
procedures in the determination and verification of the coverage
of the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Barican said that the committee will meet formally to go over
the initial procedures on May 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
He said on the same date, the agenda-setting subcommittee would
also meet to discuss the final details of the formal peace talks,
slated for the first week of June this year.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has said his administration
is committed to pursue total and lasting peace in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government forged a peace agreement in September 1996 with
the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front headed by its
chairman, Nur Misuari, now governor of the Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
In March, President Estrada made a five-day visit to Mindanao
where he inspected and launched several government projects to
spur economic development of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Although the president's scheduled meeting with MILF chairman
Hashim Salamat did not push through because of security problems,
the president approved Salamat's request for various development
projects in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The president said this gesture would show that his
administration is sincere in promoting peace and development in
Southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> US Bank Can't Seize Philippines' Planes: SEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank cannot
seize four planes of Philippine Airlines (PAL) while the
rehabilitation of the flag carrier is still going on, Philippines'
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay Jr. said the U.S. Eximbank's
planned move disregards procedures under Philippine laws.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, Eximbank has submitted itself to the
jurisdiction of the Philippine SEC insofar as the rehabilitation
proceedings of PAL is concerned. We have allowed them, under the
process, that we have adopted, to assist in the drawing up of a
rehabilitation plan," Yasay said in a radio interview this
morning.
</P>
<P>
As such, he added, Eximbank is bound by the process of the
Philippine courts, and should first bring its case before the
Supreme Court of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"They should not be acting like bullies and go to the U.S.
courts. Their action is not proper," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yasay said his office received Wednesday a notice from
Eximbank's legal counsel informing the SEC that it would ask the
U.S. courts to seize four Boeing 747 planes that it leased to PAL.
</P>
<P>
He said Eximbank also told the SEC that it was not happy with
the retention of Lucio Tan as PAL chairman.
</P>
<P>
The SEC chief pointed out, however, that the rehabilitation
plan for PAL, which creditors, including Eximbank, approved last
March 15, did not state as a condition that Tan should not manage
PAL.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine laws, he added, the free enterprise policy
allows any investor the right to manage a firm.
</P>
<P>
Yasay said the SEC is now working full time to comply with
Philippine President Joseph Estrada's order to keep PAL flying at
all costs.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar powered
through the 67 U.S. cent mark for the first time in more than a
year Thursday, as an upbeat assessment of the domestic economy by
the Australian central bank and soaring retail sales provided the
spark.
</P>
<P>
The Australian currency picked up more than one U.S. cent in 24
hours of frenzied trading, closing the local session at 67.24 U.S.
cents in Sydney, up from 65.94 U.S. cents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the session, it reached a peak of 67.30 U.S. cents, a
level not achieved since March 1998.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very, very buoyant market, I haven't seen the Aussie
perform like this for a long, long time," said Paul Macarounas,
senior manager of foreign exchange at NM Rothschild &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
The currency started the day around its lows of 66.37 U.S.
cents with expectation that offshore hedge funds would be looking
to sell.
</P>
<P>
But the news from both the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA's)
semi-annual statement and the March retail sales figures were
unambiguously supportive and the currency was pushed higher.
</P>
<P>
The RBA said Australia's excellent inflation performance should
continue, increasing to around 2.0 percent by the end of 1999 and
remaining at that level into the following year.
</P>
<P>
This was a slightly more optimistic forecast than was heralded
in the RBA's February quarterly economic outlook when it said
inflation would likely rise to 2.0 percent by the end of 1999 and
be "moving slightly higher over the following year."
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney, the Australian dollar was also buying
0.6257 euro from 0.6193 euro Wednesday and the euro was trading at
1.0747 U.S. dollars from 1.0649 U.S. dollars, while the Australian
dollar was buying 81.07 Japanese yen from 79.81 yen.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Discussing Sustainable Forest Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 6 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN countries held their
first meeting here Thursday to discuss the formulation of criteria
and indicators for sustainable forest management for the region.
</P>
<P>
The countries have realized that demand for tropical forest
products was growing steadily while their resources and supply of
wood were gradually declining, according to a statement issued at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, many governments and institutions in ASEAN are taking
measures to ensure their forest resources are managed on a
sustainable basis so that these resources can continue to bring
benefits to the region," it said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members have been asked to promote the use of
international, regional or national criteria and indicators for
sustainable forest management, it said.
</P>
<P>
Almost all countries in ASEAN are using the International
Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO)-sanctioned criteria and
indicators as the basis for their own national criteria and
indicators.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN member countries have a combined total forested area of
about 274.55 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia which
joined the regional grouping a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Thirty forestry experts from ASEAN members are attending the
two-day meeting organized by the Regional Center for Forest
Management.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was considered as an important and significant
development in ASEAN cooperation on forestry.

<HEADLINE> Manila Clears Way for Trading of Debt Instruments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)
has cleared the way for the trading of securitized debt
instruments in the secondary market.
</P>
<P>
In a presentation made for Jose Luis Yulo Jr., president and
chief executive officer (CEO) of the PSE, Dr. Jose Fernando
Alcantara, PSE vice president for business development and
information group, said that trading of debt securities is
important because this can boost the development of the capital
markets in the country.
</P>
<P>
The PSE official further said that the Exchange is now moving
closer to fully develop the local bond market in order to mobilize
the capital market effectively.
</P>
<P>
Alcantara also said that the move will provide alternatives to
issuers and investors and at the same time lessen dependence on
foreign savings to provide liquidity.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of policy, the PSE can boost the bond market by
providing benchmark for pricing issues on the list of treasury
bonds.
</P>
<P>
He believes that investments in this type of market will get
positive response because it will involve itself in further
educating the sectors that do not yet participate in the local
debt markets.
</P>
<P>
Among the target sectors are the PSE member-brokers and private
corporations and individuals who may be interested learning more
about investing in the local debt market.
</P>
<P>
Alcantara assured the participants that it will allow issuers
to be flexible as far as the PSE coverage of rules and regulations
are concerned.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the listing rules that are to be covered.
Except for the full disclosure and mandatory rating requirements,
the PSE will allow minimal documentary requirements, flexibility
on issue dates, low minimum issue volume and low listing fees.

"Kosovo should stay in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,"
Chernomyrdin told a press conference after he briefed President
Boris Yeltsin on his recent mediation efforts in the United States
during which he met with President Bill Clinton and United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was indivisible, a key point
in solving the Kosovo problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia would continue to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis
by launching a new round of negotiations with representatives of
NATO countries and Belgrade in the near future, the envoy told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said his task was to "narrow differences between the
interested parties, convince them that bombing will not achieve
anything". He called on all the conflicting sides to begin talks
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also held talks with visiting Spanish Foreign
Minister Abel Matutes on Thursday during which Chernomyrdin called
for an end to the war in Balkans and peaceful settlement of the
conflict through United Nations-brokered negotiations, a stance
shared by both Russia and Spain.

<HEADLINE> NATO Says Allies, Russia to Reach Accord On Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A NATO spokesman said here Thursday
that the Group of Seven (G-7) most industrialized countries and
Russia would issue a joint statement on ending the war in
Yugoslavia, but differences between NATO and Russia remain.
</P>
<P>
An agreement at a meeting of the Group of Eight, which is the G-
7 countries and Russia, in Bonn would be "a really significant
thing", Jamie Shea, NATO spokesman, told reporters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a post-war political settlement, Shea said that
any international force should be armed and the agreement should
be based on NATO's proposed five demands.
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing the NATO demand that the international force
must include a core contingent of NATO troops, Shea also said that
if the G-8 meeting of foreign ministers issued a joint statement,
Russia would be the alliance's partner.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the international civil and security presence
would enter Kosovo under a United Nations mandate after an
eventual withdrawal of Serbian forces. The agreement between the
allies and Russia should be in line with a UN Security Council
resolution agreed under Chapter Seven of the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
Shea also cast doubt on any possible breakthrough in the accord
between NATO and Russia since their differences remain. The Group
of Seven are the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany,
Britain and Italy. All of them, except Japan, are NATO members.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shea said NATO, during the last 24 hours, had hit
strategic targets in Kosovo, including radio relay stations, fuel
depots, airfields and ammunition installations.

LANZHOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A worker was reported missing in a
landslide caused by a fierce storm which lashed this capital of
northwest China's Gansu Province Wednesday evening, sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
The landslide happened at ten o'clock last night on Mount
Gaolan in the southern suburbs of the city, destroyed a brick
plant and cut off electricity supply to the mountain area.
</P>
<P>
A dozen workers at the plant fled as the landslide engulfed it,
and one of them is still missing, said a local government official.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that several million cu m of rocks and mud
burst from a 200-m-high cliff, burying half the area of the plant
under 13 m of debris.
</P>
<P>
A transformer and some 100 m of high-voltage electric power
line of the plant were damaged, which cut off electricity to the
rural area around the mountain.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 policemen from downtown Lanzhou were drafted for

<HEADLINE> China Adopts Regulations on Sales of Public Owned Apartments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China has approved a set of
regulations for the sale of public owned apartments that have been
sold to individual Chinese in the country's housing reform, to
boost the development the housing business.
</P>
<P>
For decades China used to distribute public owned apartments at
very low rents to those people working in government departments
and state-owned institutions and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in late 1998, these employees were allowed to
purchase residences with either their own salaries, public housing
funds, mortgage loans, or, in some places, subsidies from the
government using apartment building funds.
</P>
<P>
However, the house owners are not allowed to sell their houses
immediately, until the Ministry of Construction has worked out the
detailed regulations guiding the sales of previously public owned
apartments early this month.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, those cities and counties which
have conducted surveys about local housing condition can allow
free transactions of public owned apartments. They also need to
have dealt with misbehavior and illegal practices in the housing
reform and have adopted measures for the sale in line with
government policies.
</P>
<P>
Both house sellers and buyers can negotiate the prices and the
final price should be reported to local real estate management
departments for further examination.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, house sellers have to pay taxes before obtaining all
the income from the transactions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China announced today to cut fees
charged for the inspection of imported and exported goods and on
the evaluation of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission (SDPC), the Ministry
of Finance and the State Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection
and Quarantine have jointly issued a circular in this respect.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, China began from May 1 to cut the
export inspection fees for processed goods with client-supplied
materials. Quality inspection fees is lowered to 70 percent of the
previous rates. The general inspection fees is lowered to 35
percent of the previous rates. The fees for acceptance inspection
is lowered to 17.5 percent of the previous rates.
</P>
<P>
China will exempt inspection on imported raw materials that
overseas clients supply to the processing of export-oriented goods,
according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
The circular also stipulates the limit on the scope of property
assessment of foreign investment. Such property assessment is only
necessary for overseas-funded enterprises and for trade
compensation.
</P>
<P>
The scope of assessment is now strictly restrained to the
property that overseas investors, including those from Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan, invest in the form of materials, or the property
that foreign-funded enterprises entrust overseas investors to
purchase from abroad with investment funds.
</P>
<P>
The rates of fees charged on property assessment of foreign
investment were also lowered by different degrees.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets S. African President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (xinhua)-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
expressed appreciation of the South African new government's
domestic policy of pragmatism, and its foreign policy of
advocating a peaceful settlement of international disputes.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting South African President Nelson
Mandela, Zhu said, under Mandela's guidelines for racial
reconciliation, South Africa has maintained its political
stability, realized a smooth transition, consolidated its
democratic system, kept economic growth, and improved people's
living standard.
</P>
<P>
"Such achievements are precious for a new administration," he
said, adding that President Mandela's five years in office has
laid a solid foundation for the future prosperity of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Premier said in recent years, economic and trade
cooperation between the two countries have witnessed rapid
progress, citing the fact that South Africa has become China's
largest trading partner in Africa, and economic and trade links
have become a stabilizing factor in the overall bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is willing to further expand
cooperation with South Africa in various forms based on equality
and mutual benefit," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He voiced consent over Mandela's speech on relations with China
before his visit, and said friendship between the two countries
fostered by former leaders has withstood the test of international
changes.
</P>
<P>
At present, the third generation of Chinese leadership with
President Jiang Zemin at the core, together with President Mandela,
has forged a new chapter in their mutual friendship, Zhu said,
adding Mandela's current visit would certainly push forward
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the friendly contact between people of South
Africa and China enjoys a long history, and South African people
are familiar with the names of China's former leaders including
Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
He described his talks with President Jiang yesterday as
successful, and said his current visit is also a success. He
voiced satisfaction over the present bilateral ties and expressed
the conviction that although he will soon retire from his current
position, the friendship between the two countries will be further
reinforced.
</P>
<P>
Mandela arrived in Beijing early Wednesday morning on a state
visit as guest of President Jiang Zemin.

With the development of the "knowledge economy" and "economic
globalization", nations all over the world are bound to face
tougher competition in attracting investment, she said.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that China should use overseas investment more
efficiently and in a wider range of fields, to improve the
economic structure.
</P>
<P>
In order to give overseas investors more confidence, Wu Yi
urged that all regions improve their "soft environment", which
means more effective implementation of regulations and policies.
</P>
<P>
Sticking to the ongoing laws and regulations, they should
improve the legal system for overseas investment according to the
demands of the country's socialist market economy, she said.
</P>
<P>
She also called for more operative regulations and better
administration for investment, as well as vowing to crack down on
illegal practices in business operations.
</P>
<P>
Several Chinese provinces and cities received more overseas
investment in the first quarter of this year than previously,
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi
Guangsheng told the conference.
</P>
<P>
He listed four provinces -- Shandong, Sichuan, Gansu and
Ningxia -- and Chongqing Municipality as models, as they have
witnessed big increases in both contractual and arrived overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
Arrived investment in Shandong grew by 28.7 percent, while that
in Sichuan nearly doubled in the first three months, compared to
the same period of last year, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that China still has difficulty attracting
enough overseas investment. The latest statistics show a decline
in the number of newly-approved overseas-funded projects and in
the volume of arrived overseas investment, along with a very
slight increase in contractual investment.
</P>
<P>
He called for more efforts and measures to attract more
overseas investment this year, as this is closely related to the
success of China's reform, development and stability.

<HEADLINE> Land Fund for Macao SAR Worth 8.88 Billion Patacas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The land fund controlled by the
Chinese side of the Sino-Portuguese Land Group is now worth 8.88
billion patacas (1.11 billion U.S. dollars), thanks to sound
management.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be handed over to the government of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR), which will be established on
December 20 this year, and will be used to back the operations of
the MSAR government.
</P>
<P>
The land fund comes from the income of the land approved by the
Portuguese Macao government. Because of massive land reclamation
projects, the Macao government has gained substantial amounts of
money in this way over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
According to Annex II of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration,
the income from this category of land, after deducting the cost of
land development, will be shared evenly by the Portuguese Macao
government and the future MSAR government from January 15, 1988 to
December 19, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The land fund for the MSAR government is now run by the Chinese
side of the Sino-Portuguese Land Group. From January 15, 1988 to
the end of 1998, the Portuguese side has allocated land income
worth 6.446 billion patacas to the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
In the management of the land fund, the Chinese side follows
the principle of stability and low risk, and attempts to obtain
greater profits from the fund, said Yang Runzhen, chief
representative of the Chinese side of the Sino-Portuguese Land
Group.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side established an investment committee and a
consultative committee to manage the land fund, and publishes the
figures related to the land fund in Macao every spring.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the Chinese side increased its study and consulted
prestigious financial experts during the Asia financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic low-ebb in Macao and its neighboring
regions, the Chinese side still obtained recorded profits of 688
million patacas from the land fund investment in 1998, Yang said.

<HEADLINE> British Royal Ballet Takes China by Storm (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Still looking fresh after a
punishing performance schedule which has seen the acclaimed Royal
Ballet of Britain take Beijing by storm in the last week, its much
respected director Sir Anthony Dowell took time away from his
hectic timetable to explain how he thinks Chinese audiences have
changed since the last time the company was here 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Over a five-day stretch more than 20,000 people in Beijing
flocked to watch this 87 strong troupe run through a repertoire
which included a full length Romeo and Juliet and La Fille mal
Gardee plus a Gala selection of pas de deux and Act II from Swan
Lake.
</P>
<P>
On one particular evening the audience was cheering to the
rafters as the company's principal dancers, Carlos Acosta, Darcey
Bussell, Jonathan Cope, Bruce Sansom and Miyako Yoshida, went
through their paces at the fabled Russian-style Beizhan Theatre in
Beijing's Xicheng District.
</P>
<P>
It is now to unleash its artistic expertise on audiences in
Shanghai where a total of seven performances at the Grand Theater
Arts Center begin on Friday and carry through to the end of next
week, with most tickets already sold out.
</P>
<P>
Such is the prestige of the Royal Ballet that its last Gala
evening in Beijing was attended by President Jiang Zemin and a
string of Chinese leaders including Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and
State Councilor Wu Yi.
</P>
<P>
Sir Anthony Dowell reveals that in 1983, when he was actually a
principal dancer on that tour, the reaction of Beijing audiences
was reserved and quiet. This was after all, he remarks, the first
time that western style ballet had been seen in China for many
years.
</P>
<P>
"This time it has been very much different and people have
stayed in their seats for curtain calls and encores, which I know
is not a traditional Chinese habit," he said. "We have been very
encouraged at the response from many, many young people."
</P>
<P>
Perhaps his only criticism concerns the bad habit, which he
admits is a worldwide issue, of some people leaving mobile phones
switched on, which during sensitive moments can be distracting for
performers and audience alike.
</P>
<P>
"It is the curse of the modern age," he comments ruefully,
while adding that another particular matter which worries him,
especially in China, is the irksome habit of people taking
photographs of the performance.
</P>
<P>
"On the first night I was taken aback to see banks of cameras
and tripods set up in the front row and after the first act we had
to make an appeal for people to stop as the constant flashes were
really upsetting a few of the performers." he added.

<P>
The Royal Ballet's tour of China is presented by the CPAA
Cultural Entertainment Company in Beijing and the Shanghai Grand
Theater Arts Center at the invitation of the Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing the Orchestra of the National Ballet of China was
conducted by Royal Ballet Music Director Andrea Quinn and in
Shanghai Graham Bond and Anthony Twiner will take the baton in
turns to lead the Shanghai Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
Sir Anthony Dowell was born in London and joined the Royal
Ballet in 1961 after training at its lower and upper schools. By
1966 he had been promoted to the rank of principal dancer and
through the remainder of the 60s and early 1970s stamped his mark
on the classical ballet world with many astounding performances
such as Prospero in Rudolf Nureyev's The Tempest.
</P>
<P>
He continued to dance around the world in many famous ballets
and was appointed director of the Royal Ballet in 1986 after
stints as associate director and assistant. His first production
for the company was a spectacular Swan Lake in March 1987.
</P>
<P>
In 1972 Dowell was made a Companion of the Order of the British
Empire (CBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours List and in 1995 was
created a Knight Bachelor in that year's Honours.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps what has turned this tour into something really special
for Sir Anthony, who is renowned for encouraging young dancers,
has been the high level of skill demonstrated by the Chinese
dancers he has met from the Beijing Academy of Dance, 20 of whom
he recruited as extras for several of the performances.
</P>
<P>
The British company also used two rehearsal studios at the
Academy and was treated to a demonstration of Chinese national
dance on one occasion which Sir Anthony described as hugely moving.
</P>
<P>
"I went along with British Culture Minister Chris Smith and the
dancers put on an impromptu show for us. It was truly terrific.
</P>
<P>
"There is great talent here in China and I was particularly
impressed with a number of young male dancers. They are
beautifully trained with wonderful physiques, so well suited to
classical ballet." he said.

<P>
"I do believe that Chinese dancers can convey the inner and
finer meaning of such classics as Romeo and Juliet. There is
incredible use of the arms and upper body and so much expression
of emotion in their faces.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that there are quite a few young
dancers we saw here very capable of becoming students of the Royal
Ballet," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We had brought along our education unit, which works with
schools and dance studios in Britain, and they went to teach
various parts of Romeo and Juliet to students at the Academy but
also did a cross over with Chinese national dance," said Sir
Anthony.
</P>
<P>
"I was very impressed with their commitment and they were so
fast at learning. This has persuaded me that I must explore the
possibility of teaching Chinese national dance in the UK as
opposed to the Russian national dance which we do at present," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Cultural cooperation and exchange programs are other areas
which Sir Anthony believes could be of much mutual benefit in the
future. He wants to consider ways in which Chinese dancers could
be invited as guests of the Royal Ballet and vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
"At present we haven't really discussed this with anyone but
this tour has opened so many doors I am sure it will happen," he
remarked.
</P>
<P>
Back to the present tour and Sir Anthony is delighted that the
chosen repertoire seems to have been so well received. "We decided
to do several inventive and modern pieces for our Gala evening
along with Kenneth MacMillan's much loved Romeo and Juliet on
other evenings, which will also be performed in Shanghai with
Frederick Ashton's lauded La Fille mal Gardee," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Audience reaction in Beijing was mixed but positive. At the
final Gala evening Li Jing, a 26 year old marketing executive,
said: "It was tremendously good except that the opening scenes
were not ideal for me. It was too modern. What we really
appreciate is the classical pas de deux. But I cherished the
opportunity to see them perform."
</P>
<P>
Twenty-year-old Shan Bing, a fresher at the Capital University
of Economics and Trade in Beijing, said: "I have been a fan of
ballet since my childhood and my dream was to become a ballet star.
" Her mother Wang Jun added: "Moved by my daughter's enthusiasm I
came along to ballet for the first time in my life and don't
believe I wasted my money, though the cost was quite high for us."

<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met here today with youth delegations from the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and Macao.

<P>
Wang, who is also head of the United Front Work Department of
the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, noted that
this year is the 80th anniversary of the May 4th Movement, and
inspired by the patriotic spirit of the movement, Chinese young
people have for 80 years contributed greatly to the country's
revolution and construction.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has returned to China, and Macao will also return to
the embrace of the motherland in 220-plus days, he said.

He expressed the hope that the young people in the HKSAR and
Macao will play a better role in maintaining the long-term
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and the smooth transition of
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they should adopt various means to increase
exchanges in the fields of culture, economy, and so on, with the
young people of the inland areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Invited by the All-China Youth Federation, the youth
delegations from the HKSAR and Macao came to Beijing to attend the

<HEADLINE> Britain Says Macedonia to Open Border With Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Thursday that the
Macedonian border with the Yugoslav province of Kosovo is to be
reopened.
</P>
<P>
"The border in Macedonia has been or is being reopened," Prime
Minister Tony Blair's spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Macedonia closed its border with Yugoslavia,
saying it could not cope with the influx of more Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
The closure left at least 3,000 people waiting on the Kosovo
side of the border on Thursday, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations refugee agency had planned to ease the
burden on Macedonia by transferring up to 60,000 Kosovo refugees
to Albania. But it said on Thursday the move was being held up by
political and logistical problems.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia has said repeatedly it cannot cope with the influx,
which is threatening its internal ethnic relations and economy.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Pakistan to Discuss Gas Pipeline Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A high level delegation from Iran
arrived here Thursday for detailed discussions on a proposed gas
pipeline linking Iran and Pakistan, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Hussein Kazempour Ardebelli, senior
advisor to the Iranian government, will have detailed discussions
with Pakistani officials on the project through which Pakistan
will import gas from Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Pak gas pipeline project is estimated to cost 2.5
billion U.S. dollars. The pipeline, 1,638 kilometers in length and
56 inches in diameter, will have the capacity of transporting 1.6
billion cubic feet of gas per day from Iran to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The project is believed to meet a quarter of Pakistan's
requirement for gas, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Although Pakistan is committed to import gas from Turkmenistan
via a proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan pipeline, the
country is keeping other options open including that of Iran on a
basis of lowest landed price and earliest delivery time.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Breed Disease-Resistant Transgenic Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- With the help of genetic-engineering
technology, Chinese scientists have bred a strain of transgenic
cotton which is resistant to bollworms and other disease-producing
parasites.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the world's major cotton producers, however,
bollworms and other cotton parasites often affect the yield and
quality.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the use of farm chemicals and pesticides has
caused environmental pollution and had caused the pests to become
resistant.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhenghua of the Institute of Genetics under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences explained that they implanted a special
proteinase inhibitor into the embryo of the cotton.
</P>
<P>
The proteinase inhibitor interferes with the bollworms'
digestion of proteins and eventually kills them.
</P>
<P>
Scientists with the institute have also bred new transgenic
cotton, which is resistant to both verticillium and fusarium wilt.
</P>
<P>
Last year, this transgenic cotton was grown in experimental
farms in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, one of the key
cotton production bases in northwest China, and the yield and
quality were greatly improved. The genetic-engineered cotton will
be planted in the region on a large scale beginning next year.

<HEADLINE>   Nepalese Student Abandons Bid on Mt. Qomolangma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Arbin Timilsina, a 15-year-old
Nepalese student who aimed to become the youngest conqueror of the
world's highest peak, 8,848-meter Mount Qomolangma, has abandoned
the bid, the Nepali Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Timilsina left South Col or Camp IV (8,000m.) at 10:00 on
Tuesday evening and reached the South Summit (8,700m.) at 11:30
Wednesday morning with three Nepalese Sherpas, the ministry said
in a press release.
</P>
<P>
At the South Summit he felt pain in his eyes, so he returned to
South Col at 15:45 Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that at 9:00 Thursday morning, he and the
three Sherpas left South Col for Camp II (6,700m.). "He has
abandoned the expedition. He will leave the Base Camp (5,300m.)
the day after tomorrow. He is now well," the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
The record is held by his compatriot Shambhu Tamang in 1973 at
the age of 17.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Babu Chiri Sherpa, who conquered Mt. Qomolangma at 9:
00 on Thursday morning with two other Sherpas, had set up a tent
at the summit. At 14:00 he sang the national anthem. He plans to
stay at the summit for another 15 hours in a bid to set a record
of staying at the summit for 20 hours. The other two Sherpas were
returning to South Col.
</P>
<P>
Summiters stay at the peak usually for a maximum of one hour,
an officer from the Nepali ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"He will hoist the national flag at the summit during his stay
at the summit," the Nepali ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The three Sherpas were serving the 1999 International Everest
Expedition of Sweden led by Tina Olga, the ministry added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Import and Export Bank of China
said today that it has issued five billion yuan-worth of two-year
financial bonds through public tendering.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time in history and the first time this year
that the bank has issued financial bonds through public tendering.
It issued two batches of financial bonds in this way last year,
worth six billion yuan in total value.
</P>
<P>
The annual interest rate of successful bids was 3.78 percent
this time. The interest will be paid annually.
</P>
<P>
The Import and Export Bank of China has been given approval by
the central bank to operate in the domestic inter-bank loan market.
</P>
<P>
Since it was established in July, 1994, the bank has provided
funding for a great number of export deals involving hi-tech, high
value-added and economically efficient electronic and machinery
products, in addition to complete plants and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Facing the challenge of the financial crisis in the rest of
Asia, the bank has tried to expand its scale of credits and
optimize its capital structure.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from bond issuance will account for more than 60
percent of the bank's fund resources in Renminbi currency.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the bank had extended 59.2 billion yuan in
suppliers' credits and issued 38.9 billion yuan-worth of financial
bonds. At the same time, it had repaid 8.7 billion yuan in
interest and principal on bonds.

The organization should follow the latest instructions by
central leaders, including Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, and live up
to the expectations of the CPC and the people, in order to make
greater contributions to the materialization of the magnificent
century-straddling goal of the country, the vice-premier said.

<HEADLINE> Wrap-Up: China, EU Make Progress in WTO Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Both Chinese and European Union (EU)
negotiators said here today that the talks on China's entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO) have made progress.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (
MOFTEC) Shi Guangsheng described the China-EU talks on Thursday as
"constructive" after he concluded the three and a half hours of
talks with the EU delegation led by Leon Brittan, vice-president
of the Commission of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Brittan arrived here Wednesday for a two-day visit prior to the
China-EU summit scheduled for May 13.
</P>
<P>
Shi said the talks resulted in progress.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides have agreed to speed up talks on the remaining
issues so as to do positive work with concerted efforts for
China's entry into the WTO this year," said Shi.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue the technical group discussions in
Beijing, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Brittan told a press conference
prior to leaving Beijing Thursday night that progress had been
made in the talks. He did not elaborate, but said that the two
sides discussed in detail issues concerning tariffs, services and
goods trading.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on whether the China-EU summit next week
would produce a bilateral agreement, but said that the two sides
would make further contacts whatever the outcome.

Brittan welcomed the relevant agreements Beijing and Washington
reached during Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's recent visit to the
United States, adding that progress in China-EU talks on China's
WTO accession must be confirmed on the basis that the benefits
attained will be available to all partners.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng said in March this year, while meeting with
Germany's new ambassador to China, Hans-Christian Ueberschaeer,
that China's commitments to the WTO in bilateral negotiations
apply to all members of the organization in accordance with the
WTO's principle of non-discrimination.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China's bid to enter the multilateral trade
body is prompted mainly by its reform and opening up policy, and
that China will never sacrifice its fundamental economic interests
and principles for WTO membership. He said China's stand on its
WTO accession has not changed.
</P>
<P>
"China's stand on the WTO issue remains consistent: that its
rights and duty as a WTO member should be balanced," Shi said. "
What China promises must comply with China's economic strength."
</P>
<P>
"As a developing nation, China, particularly at its current
stage, can only undertake what a developing nation should
undertake," he said.
</P>
<P>
The China-EU talks were held between the Chinese delegation and
the nine-member EU delegation, including six from the EU
headquarters and three from the EU delegation in China.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji and State Councilor Wu Yi both gave
important explanations on China's principles and views on the
China-EU negotiations during their respective meetings with
Brittan Wednesday, according to the trade minister, and that "
demonstrates the importance China attaches to the current
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Shi cited Brittan as "a friend of China" and a person who
earnestly supports China's entry into the WTO.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rules out Debt Cancellation for Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The American government would not
support any debt cancellation proposal for Nigeria but would
support a debt reschedule arrangement for the country, a senior
U.S. official has said.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Pickering, visiting U.S. Under-Secretary of State for
Political Affairs, said Wednesday in Lagos that Nigeria with its
enormous income from oil export does not deserve debt
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
According to him, if such returns were properly managed by a
very accountable government, Nigeria should be able to fulfil its
fiscal obligation, media reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. official, who ended his three-day visit to
Nigeria Wednesday, said his country would support the efforts to
reschedule the repayment of Nigeria's debts to enable the
in-coming civilian regime tackle some economic problems.
</P>
<P>
This too, he said, would depend on the implementation of a
program Nigeria is negotiating with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), adding the successful implementation of the IMF
program would qualify Nigeria for foreign loans and rescheduling
of its foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigerian Vice President-elect Alhaji Atiku Abubakar
said in London Wednesday that Nigeria's debt burden is "a threat"
to the development of democracy in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with a debt overhang of about 28.8 billion U.S.
dollars, the challenges to democracy in the most populous African
country was greater than its prospect.
</P>
<P>
Pickering disclosed that a high powered U.S. delegation would
visit Nigeria early next month as part of a new American
initiative to assist the country' s development process.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, he met with Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar and President-elect Olusegun Obasanjo, and
said the American government had ranked Nigeria among "four top
nations" of the world it had programed to improve relations with
in the shortest time.
</P>
<P>
The envoy disclosed that the United States is to provide 30
million U.S. dollars to the in-coming civilian government of
Olusegun Obasanjo who is scheduled to take office on May 29 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The money is expected to be used in training the elected
administrators in the three tiers of the Nigerian government and
in helping the country's judicial system and in the training of
the military for peacekeeping efforts.

<HEADLINE> S. African Prisoner Gets Law Degree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A 35-year-old South African
prisoner made history this week when the University of South
Africa (UNISA) conferred him a law degree, the Sowetan newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to his sustained effort to study in prison, Japhet
Butiki Pitikoe received a bachelor's degree with majors in private
law and criminology Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to prison authorities, Pitikoe is the first prisoner
at Pretoria's Central Prison to be allowed to be present at his
graduation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Previously prisoners graduated in absentia," Pitikoe's
lecturer, Antoinette du Toit said. The University of South
Africa, established in 1916, is one of the biggest universities in
the country and famous for its distance education.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Pitikoe as saying that studying privately in
prison was not easy.
</P>
<P>
He said that he managed to complete his degree with a loan from
the Tertiary Education Fund of South Africa and with some help
from his parents.
</P>
<P>
Pitikoe, a former school teacher in Soweto, the well-known
black town about 20 kilometers south of Johannesburg, was
sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment in February 1994 for murder
and possession of an illegal firearm.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, he will be out of prison before the general
elections in June this year following several remissions he
received for good behavior.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Finnish nationals kidnapped by
 Somali gunmen off the coast of Somalia's northeastern port town
of Bossaso have been freed. According to sources close to the
area, the responsibility of the Finnish nationals, a man and his
wife, was turned on to the U.N. officials in the region Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
No ransom was said to have been paid. But underground sources
said businessmen from the region along with their colleagues in
Djibouti have secured the release with the payment of an
unspecified amount of money.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the yacht the Finnish man and his wife were
travelling in still remains in the hands of the gunmen. The
Finnish tourists were on their way to Comoro Islands and sailed
from Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
Somali gunmen of the northeastern Somali Salvation Democratic
Front (SSDF) intercepted the yacht a few days ago by using a
small armed boat and forced them to dock into a village, a few
kilometers east of the port town of Bossaso.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen did not make their captives public until Monday
probably in fear of being forced to free the hostages.

And it also depends on the progresses the Western countries

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Currency of Naira Depreciates Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian currency of naira has
devalued for the third time this year by 5.42 percent from 90
Naira to 94.88 Naira to one U. S. dollar at the Autonomous Foreign
Exchange Market.
</P>
<P>
Tony Ede, spokesman of the Central Bank of Nigeria, explained
that the bank had to devalue the naira because of the excess
liquidity in the system caused by the transfer of 100 billion
naira parastatals' (state owned enterprices) and ministries'
account from the central bank to commercial banks, This Day
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the central bank introduced the Special
Treasury Bills in a bid to curb excess liquidity in the system,
but it was not enough to address what was pumped into the system,
hence the further devaluation of the naira, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the devaluation of naira will reduce the
excess liquidity as well as stem excessive demand by banks at the
exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman maintained that the state bank had resolved it
would no longer manipulate the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The first devaluation took place on March 17 when the Naira
exchanged for 86.25 naira to the dollar as against the former rate
of 86 Naira, representing 0.30 percent depreciation.
</P>
<P>
The second depreciation occurred on March 24 when the Naira
exchanged for 90 Naira to one Dollar at the AFEM, representing
4.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
With the current depreciation, the Naira has suffered a total
depreciation of 10.66 percent this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao reiterated China's stand on the Kosovo issue at a
regular press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's consistent stance in this regard is that
Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity should be
respected while the lawful rights and interests of all ethnic
groups in Kosovo including Albanians should be guaranteed, so as
to realize a political solution to the Kosovo issue on the above-
mentioned basis.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese government has opposed any act
of ethnic cleansing. However, he said, "remarks and reports on
Yugoslavia's so-called 'ethnic cleansing' have different
interpretation."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said it is impossible that domestic and ethnic
problems of a country can be solved by external military
interference.
</P>
<P>
Although NATO's wanton bombing of Yugoslavia has lasted for a
long time, it doesn't solve the issue, but has caused more
problems instead, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that only through diplomatic efforts of the
international community, can the Kosovo issue be solved in a
proper and just way.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China supports the efforts made by the
international community for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo
crisis, and holds that any plan for the solution should not bypass
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> HK Gov't to Solve Right of Abode Issue with Basic Law: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government will
decisively solve the right of abode issue as soon as possible in
accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), told the Legislative Council here
Thursday that there will be unimaginable consequences if the
influx of 1.675 million residents of the inland areas given the
right of abode by the Court of Final Appeal.
</P>
<P>
According to the court's ruling, inland area children born to
Hong Kong residents, whether legitimate or not, have the right to
live in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung pledged that the SAR government will, taking into account
of Hong Kong's long-term interests, decisively and thoroughly
solve the problem in a shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever approach we adopt, whether interpretation or
amendment, either way we must work in accordance with the Basic
Law. We have the rule of law here, so we have to obey that," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the Central People's Government has all along
supported Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the principle of "one country, two
systems" will be fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
The cost of accommodating the estimated 1.675 million inland
area residents will reach 710 billion Hong Kong dollars (about 91.
02 billion U.S. dollars) over the next 10 years, according to the
government's assessment document reported to the Legislative
Council Thursday Morning.
</P>
<P>
Tung attended the Legislative Council question-and-answer
session on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During the session which lasted one hour and 40 minutes, Tung
answered dozens of questions raised by 25 legislators, covering a
wide range of topics such as the rule of law, judicial
independence, the three inquiry reports on the new airport opening
and the reform of civil servants as well as environment.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of civil service, Tung said Hong Kong's civil
servants are honest and clean. The purpose of the reform is to
adapt themselves to the changing new situation, adding that he was
full of confidence in the reform.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the government is committed to continuously
maintaining Hong Kong's status as a trade, financial and shipping
center and constantly raising the quality of people's life.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales Dip in S. Africa Despite Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Despite falling interest rates,
vehicle sales in South Africa dropped by 18.5 percent in April
compared with a year before, Business Day newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Total vehicle sales stood at 21,138 units in April, a 17.6
percent down against March and 17.4 percent lower than April in
last year. This leaves sales down 18.5 percent over the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The highly sensitive passenger car segment recorded the lowest
sales total last month in 14 years, with only 13,477 units sold.
Passenger car sales declined by 18.1 percent compared with April,
1998 and by 16.8 percent when compared with March 1999.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted McCarthy Motor Holdings Chief Executive
Officer, Brand Pretorius, as saying that the medium and heavy
commercial vehicle sectors were particularly hard hit. He blamed
recessionary conditions for the negative effect on the vehicle
market.
</P>
<P>
Medium commercial sector sales declined to 306 units in April
from 432 in March and 447 in April last year, while heavy
commercial sales in the same three months were 423 unit, 548 units
and 588 units respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The positive influence of the reduced interest rates is,
however, expected to start lifting the market during the third
quarter," Pretorius said.
</P>
<P>
Other factors that aggravated the April sales figures included
the limited number of selling days -- 21 compared with 24 days in
March -- due to public holidays. Stock shortage on some of the
more popular model ranges and a degree of uncertainty surrounding
the coming election added to the poor sales performance.
</P>
<P>
According to another analyst, initial positive reaction to
recent interest rate cuts slowed down in April as buyers held off
in anticipation of further cuts to come before the election.

<HEADLINE> "List of Agreements" on China's WTO Entry Inaccurate: MOFTEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The list of agreements for China's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that the U.S. side
unilaterally published is not accurate, Chinese trade minister Shi
Guangsheng said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Although China and the United States scored major progress on
China's accession to the WTO during Premier Zhu Rongji's recent
visit to the United States, it was different to the published list,
" Shi was responding to the press on the issue following his three
and half hours of talks with Leon Brittan, vice-president of the
Commission of the European Union, on China's WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
The minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
said that Chinese and U.S. negotiators worked arduously, sometimes
overnight, during Premier Zhu's visit to the United States, and
have achieved importance progress on the issue. The U.S. side
voiced firm support for China's entry into the WTO in the year
1999.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "list of agreements" the U.S. side unilaterally
publicized in newspapers and on the Internet does not accord with
what actually happened, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"China did reach agreements with the United States on some
issues, but some of the listed issues are still under negotiation,
and some so-called 'agreements' are only demands from the U.S.
side, and have never been agreed by the Chinese side," Shi added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rules out Change in Policy on CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday ruled out any
change in its position on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
and reiterated that it will sign the treaty keeping in view its
security concern and in a situation free of coercion.
</P>
<P>
"On the CEBT our position is well-known. There is no change in
that position," a spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Office Tariq
Altaf said at weekly press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Our security compulsions are essentially in the framework of
India's huge military build-up including its nuclear and missile
arsenal and increasing asymmetry in the conventional field," the
spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan, however, had de-linked itself from India and
adopted an independent posture in conformity with the country's
own policies and interests.
</P>
<P>
"I may also point out that maintenance of a credible
deterrence, and the options linked to it, have to be fundamentally
viewed in the security context," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He said Islamabad cannot remain oblivious to developments in
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The Indian leaders, he said, have taken a certain position on
CTBT on account of the political vacuum there, adding there are
other important powers, who have signed but no ratified the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
"In the consideration of our options we will take everything
into account."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that all sanctions on military sales to
Pakistan are still imposed. "It is our desire that all these
sanctions should be lifted. They are unjust and they should be
lifted."
</P>
<P>
On reports that India is set to test-fire its Agni-III
ballistic missile, Altaf said Pakistan has always expressed an
opinion that more and more accumulation of weaponry and military
build-up is undesirable.
</P>
<P>
"It adds to the aggravation of the existence precarious
situation of security," the spokesman observed.
</P>
<P>
He said such a build-up threatens peace and security in the
region. "We believe that it should be avoided," he insisted.

<HEADLINE> EDS-With Details China, EU Talks on China's WTO Entry "Constructive" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The negotiations with the European
Union (EU) on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO)
were "constructive," and resulted in progress, Chinese Foreign
Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides have agreed to speed up talks on the lingering
issues so as to do positive work with concerted efforts for
China's entry into WTO in 1999," said Shi who heads up China's
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), after
holding three and a half hours of talks with a European Union (EU)
delegation led by Leon Brittan, the vice-president of the European
Commission (EC).
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue the technical group discussions in
Beijing, according to the minister. He said China's stand on its
WTO accession has not changed.
</P>
<P>
"China's stand on the WTO issue remains consistent, that its
rights and duty as a WTO member should be balanced," Shi said. "
What China promises must comply with China's economic strength."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China's bid to enter the multi-lateral trade
body is prompted mainly by its reform and opening policy, and that
China will never sacrifice its fundamental economic interests and
principles for WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
"As a developing nation, China, particularly at its current
stage, can only undertake what a developing nation should
undertake," he said.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which concluded at 1:50 p.m. were held between the
Chinese delegation and nine members of the EU delegation,
including six from the EU headquarters and three from the EU
delegation in China.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji and State Councilor Wu Yi both had made
important explanations on China's principles and views on China-EU
negotiations during their respective meetings with Brittan
Wednesday, according to the trade minister, and that "demonstrates
the importance China attaches to the current negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Shi cites Brittan as "a friend of China" and a person who
earnestly supports China's entry into the WTO.

<P>
MAPUTO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican External Friendship
Association Thursday slammed NATO for its bombing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried in the Noticias newspaper, the
association accused the NATO of interfering with the internal
affairs in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It urged NATO to immediately stop its bombing in Kosovo and
seek for resolution to the crisis through dialog, noting that NATO
had taken military actions against a sovereign state without U.N.
authorization.
</P>
<P>
The association voiced its support for the Yugoslavian people
in their struggle to protect their sovereignty, territorial
integrity and independence of their country.
</P>

NATO should bear the responsibility for all the damages
suffered by the Yugoslavian people, the association pointed out.

It called upon the NATO people to show support for the victims
of the Kosovo crisis and urge their governments to comply with the
U.N. Charter and the related international laws.

CANBERRA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket closed
marginally lower Thursday, weighed down by continued softness in

The banks were led lower by National Australia Bank, which gave
up 56 cents to 27.50 Australian dollars, despite posting a record
half year net profit of 938 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Kukes, A City of Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUKES, Northern Albania, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Kukes, this small
and little known border city in north Albania has earned a fame
for it ever since the beginning of the influx of Kosovo refugees
on April 28, four days after NATO bombs dropped on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
For all Kosovo refugees who entered Albania through the Morina
border crossing, Kukes, a city merely of 20,000, is their first
stop, where they started their life as refugees.
</P>
<P>
The town lies several kilometers away from the Albania-
Yugoslavia border at the foot of the snow-capped Gjallica Mountain.
</P>
<P>
With refugees keeping coming, it is difficult, even for the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), to have an exact number of
those who have reached Kukes, though an UNHCR estimation stands at
150,000.
</P>
<P>
Kukes, with 11 refugee camps scattered around it, has virtually
been turned into a city of refugees in the past 40 days.
</P>
<P>
Only those who came early can find a tent in the camps set up
and manned by foreign humanitarian agencies, or managed to put up
with local families.
</P>
<P>
The late comers, men and women, young and old, are left with no
choice but to wait for buses to drive them to other refugee camps
and centers built with international aid.
</P>
<P>
But before they can board a bus, many, mostly farmers from
Kosovo, will have to sleep several nights on tractors covered with
plastic sheets, though a mass evacuation, organized by the UNHCR,
has been under way for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
A UNHCR worker told Xinhua Wednesday that the idea of a mass
evacuation is to transport those who have got a tent and stayed in
Kukes for some days to other places so that their tents could be
given to exhausted new comers, many of them having walked more
than 30 kilometers before reaching the Morina crossing.
</P>
<P>
Those who have got tent are reluctant to leave in the hope that
by staying close to the border they could return home easily and
quickly once conditions permit.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement of refugees was so slow and difficult that
UNHCR changed its strategy by shipping instead the new arrivals
away the soonest possible.
</P>
<P>
As nobody foresees a fast end to the war that may even turn
worse if NATO launches a ground offensive, UNHCR plans to ship
away as many refugees as possible to avoid possible Serb artillery
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
With summer drawing close, UNHCR and the World Health
Organization (WHO) fear an epidemic could break out as sanitation
condition in the camps is very poor and water shortage very acute.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, 3,000 to 7,000 refugees are transported
every day to Tirana, Durres and other cities.
</P>
<P>
With no end of the war in sight, it is highly possible that
Kukes will remain a city of refugees for months or even longer.

<HEADLINE> Over One-third American Women Go Without Health Insurance: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A survey released Wednesday said
the percentage of U.S. women who lack the health insurance
increased during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Commonwealth Fund Survey of Women's Health found an
increase in the uninsured, particularly among working women with
low to modest income levels.
</P>
<P>
The report said in 1998, 35 percent of women under the age of
65 with incomes of 16,000 U.S. dollars or less were uninsured,
compared with 29 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
For women with incomes from 16,001 to 35,000 dollars, the
uninsured rate also increased from 15 percent in 1993 to 21
percent in 1998, the report added.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a booming economy and one striking finding of our
survey is that it has not stopped the steady erosion of health
insurance among adult women," said Cathy Schoen, one of the
report's authors.
</P>

The report also found a high number of women were physically or
sexually assaulted either as children or adults. Almost two out of
every five women surveyed -- 39 percent -- said they had been
victims of abuse or violence in their lifetimes, including rape,
sexual assault or other physical attack.
</P>
<P>
The survey sample was based on interviews with 2,850 women
conducted from May 7 to November 10, 1998, by the Commonwealth
Fund, a national philanthropy based in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Armed Forces to Send Anti-riot Force to Aceh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister and
Armed Forces Chief Gen. Wiranto Thursday said he will send an
anti-riot force to the country's westernmost province of Aceh to
pacify the riots that have broken out in the area recently.
</P>
<P>
The law must be upheld across the country, Wiranto said,
assuring that the sending of the force does not mean a revival of
the military operation in Aceh which was stopped last year.
</P>
<P>
The force will consist of the mobile brigade, riot control
troops, a bomb defusing team and a legal team, Wiranto told
reporters here.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara News Agency, the death toll in Monday's
riot in Lhokseumawe in northern Aceh has risen to 39 until
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total number of injured victims has reached 115 and two
persons have been reported missing, Antara quoted the head of the
fact-finding team formed by the district administration TS Sani as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the incident broke out due to a
misunderstanding between troops of a guided missile detachment and
residents of Cut Ngurong village.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the latest in a succession of violent clashes
between the military and campaigners for a referendum in the
troubled province. Demands for a referendum in the province have
intensified in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The previous clash in Lhokseumawe occurred on April 21 when
thousands of students tried to attack local police headquarters. A
student and a member of the Mobile Brigade were killed.

<HEADLINE> WWF: Countries with Important Wetlands Join Ramsar Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
has called on the countries with important wetlands to join the
Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance to
protect the nature.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here Thursday, the WWF expresses hope
that non-signatories like Cambodia, Cameroon, Cuba, Laos, Nigeria,
and Tanzania join the convention initiated in Ramsar, Iran.
</P>
<P>
There are now 114 contracting parties to the convention. Since
its inception, almost 1,000 valuable ecosystems have been listed
under it, according to the WWF.
</P>
<P>
Freshwater ecosystems such as lakes, rivers, ponds, marshes and
underground sinks, are an integral and essential part of the
hydrological cycle, absorbing rainfall and surface run-off,
storing this water and gradually releasing it over time,
minimizing the risk of flooding in many areas.
</P>
<P>
The conservation organization estimated that between 300 and
400 million people live close to, and depend on, wetlands.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, freshwater fisheries and aquaculture together
equaled to about a quarter of the planet's fishery yields. Other
living freshwater resources include rice, aquarium fishes, rushes
for weaving, peat, cranberries and fish for sport.
</P>
<P>
However, the WWF noted that the scale and pace of wetland
destruction have reached unprecedented levels in the past three
decades. Some countries have already lost 50 to 80 percent of
their wetlands. Many plant and animal species have disappeared in
the process.
</P>
<P>
The WWF will launch the Living Waters Campaign in members of
the Ramsar Convention on its meeting on May 10-18 in San Jose,
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
One aim of the campaign is "to increase, by 50 percent, the
area of the world's freshwater ecosystems that are committed for
conservation and management, commitments that include a total area
of more than 25 million hectares", said the WWF.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Millions of people are going to the
polls in Scotland and Wales on Thursday to elect their assemblies,
the first in British history.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish Parliament comes nearly 300 years after the union
with England, while the Welsh have to look back to 500 years ago
to find their previous autonomous assembly.
</P>
<P>
There are 60 seats available in the Welsh Assembly and 129 in
the Scottish Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Proportional representation will be used for the first time in
Britain when voters choose from the candidates in Scotland and
Wales.
</P>
<P>
Voters will receive two different colored ballot papers, one
to choose a member for the constituency, and the other to choose a
member from a "top-up" list to represent a region.
</P>
<P>
Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar is expected to become the
country's First Minister. But whether Labor can win outright or
will need coalition partners is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish National Party, which favors independence for
Scotland, is likely to be the second largest party.
</P>
<P>
In Wales there could be upset for Labor if Welsh Secretary
Alun Michael, the party's leader in the principality and possible
First Secretary, is not elected.
</P>
<P>
Michael is standing on a regional list for Mid and West Wales,
after he entered the race in its later stages when the former
Welsh Secretary Ron Davies resigned last year.
</P>
<P>
Polls opened in Scotland and Wales at 0700 and will close at
2200.
</P>
<P>
Counting will begin as soon as polls close, but final results
will not be known until Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Insists to Solve CLOB Issue With Malaysia as Bilateral Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong Thursday assured the parliament that the issue
over the billion-dollar suspended CLOB shares will be solved by
the Singapore and Malaysian governments as an outstanding
bilateral problem.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question in the parliament this afternoon, Lee said
his government and the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) will make
every effort to resolve the CLOB issue expeditiously and the issue
should not remain outstanding when the package of other bilateral
issues is resolved by the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and his Malaysian counterpart
Mahathir Mohamad had last December agreed to include CLOB in the
package of outstanding bilateral issues, Lee added.
</P>
<P>
CLOB, the over-the-counter market in Singapore with a name of
the Central Limit Order Book (CLOB), was the over-the-counter
market in Singapore set up after the divorce of the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange (KLSE) and SES in 1990. CLOB ceased trading in the
Malaysian stocks last September when Malaysia imposed exchange
control. Stocks of 112 Malaysian companies were previously traded
on the CLOB and their value hit 10 billion Malaysian ringgit (4.5
billion Singapore dollars or 2.65 billion U.S. dollars ). Although
shares have since been transferred to the Malaysian central
depository, the Malaysian government has not unlocked the 172,000
accounts on legal concern and for fear that CLOB investors would
dump their shares and derail the upward thrust of the KLSE
Composite Index.
</P>
<P>
Lee revealed that when Malaysian and Singapore senior officials
met in March and April to discuss the package, the Malaysian
delegation had asked at both meetings that the CLOB issue be
removed from the agenda as it was not a government-to-government
issue.
</P>
<P>
But Singapore's response on both occasions was that the CLOB
issue should not remain outstanding when the package is finally
resolved, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"This remains Singapore's stand," he said, adding Singapore's
stand has not changed.
</P>
<P>
On the current cash offer for the CLOB shares by businessman
Akbar Khan, Lee reiterated SES's stand that the offer document
falls short of generally accepted international standards.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the offer can't and doesn't affect the agreement
between Singapore's Central Depository Pte Ltd. (CDP) and
Malaysia's Stock Exchange and Securities Clearing Automated
Network Services (SCANS) on the migration of the CLOB shares.
</P>
<P>
He also said the SES will continue to press the KLSE to meet
its obligations under the migration agreement, adding the SES has
obtained legal advice that the migration agreement is a legally
binding and enforceable contract.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the agreement signed last September between
SES and SCANS, which covers the transfer of CLOB shares to a
proposed new account to facilitate subsequent trading of these
stocks in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister also rejected accusations that CLOB
investors short-sold Malaysian shares and were responsible for the
collapse of the Malaysian stock market.
</P>
<P>
There had been no significant short-selling on CLOB, he said,
pointing out that very few institutions invested in Malaysian
shares through CLOB and an overwhelming majority of CLOB investors
were individuals rather than institutions.
</P>
<P>
Citing a recent analysis by the Business Times on falls and
turnover on the KLSE, Lee said the result of the analysis hardly
shows a picture of rampant short-selling on ClOB.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Indonesia to Cooperate in Tackling Forest Fires, Haze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Indonesia agreed
Thursday to cooperate to tackle forest fires and haze, Malaysian
Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat said.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready take any step to prevent open burning and
possible fires," he said at a joint press conference with
Indonesian Minister for People's Welfare and Poverty Alleviation
Haryono Suyono after they co-chaired a meeting of the
Malaysia-Indonesia Joint Committee on Cooperation and Disaster
Relief here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the second since 1998, was to discuss and
implement preliminary measures to prevent and monitor forest fires
within the context of the Memorandum of Understanding signed
between the two countries in December 1997 following forest fires
in Indonesia, which caused the serious haze problem in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said both countries had agreed to formulate an action
plan and regulations to facilitate border-crossing and deployment
of equipment and personnel in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The standing regulations will reduce bureaucracy at the state
and provincial level in both countries, said Mohamed, who is
chairman of Malaysia's National Disaster Relief and Management
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Haryono, who is chief of Indonesia's National Disaster
Management Coordinating Board, said on the occasion that Indonesia
is more prepared this time around of any eventualities, including
a warning system which would pinpoint places where forest fires
occurred.
</P>
<P>
He said that several forest areas were given to local
universities for researches and this would provide added
commitment to prevent forest fires.
</P>
<P>
He said directives were also given to companies to look after
their plantations as more than 80 percent of forest fires reported
in 1997 reportedly originated from plantations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint statement issued after the meeting said both
countries agreed to continue joint training and operations in
terms of fighting forest fires to ensure highest level of
preparedness. At present, 25 Indonesian fire-fighters are
attending a course on fighting forest fires in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Both countries also agreed to beef up enforcement against open
burning, exchange staff and experts in forest management, greater
flow of technical and scientific information and intensify efforts
to educate the local people on the danger of burning forest.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urged to Help Lift Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 6 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi official newspaper Thursday
urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to quickly move for the
unconditional lifting of the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ath-Thawra daily, organ of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist
Party, said that the U.S. and Britain will go ahead with their
feverish endeavor hostile to Iraq by premeditatedly holding off
Iraqi contracts signed under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The daily appealed to Annan to do his utmost and stand with
Iraq in its legitimate and legal demands and put pressure on
U.N. Sanctions Committee for speeding up the approval of
contracts with the aim of improving the humanitarian conditions
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council slapped sanctions on Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, but it allowed Baghdad to export
limited amount of oil every six months since December 1996 to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian goods for its 22 million
people.
</P>
<P>
But only after the approval of the U.N. Sanctions Committee can
the contracts Iraq signed be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and British representatives at
the Sanctions Committee of blocking the approval of the contracts
under flimsy pretexts.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is also worried that the U.S. and Britain are trying to
make the oil-for-food deal an alternative to the lifting of
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper argued that the only solution was the immediate
removal of the U.N. sanctions because the oil-for-food deal meets
only little portion of basic needs of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Iraq are not a people of refugees and the U.N.
is not a charity," it said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In a signed article published by Liberation, European deputy
and economist Philippe Herzog called for the building of a
democratic Europe by supporting the economic development of the
Balkans. He said that by refusing entrance by all European
countries, the European Union is actually supporting the
development of ultra-nationalism in the Balkans. ``The future of
European democracy is decided in the Balkans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
-- An immense American flag in the background, a F-117 bomber
at the forefront, an enthusiastic group of soldiers and their
children: the White House succeeded on Wednesday to stage a show
to re-mobilize the morale of the American forces in Germany which
are engaged in the strikes against Serbia. U.S. President Bill
Clinton arrived at a U.S. military base from Brussels to produce
the images of determination which could rival those of rock
concerts in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The indexes of a slow progress toward a negotiated solution
of the war in Yugoslavia continued to appear on Wednesday. Russian
presidential envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin expressed his optimism
about a solution, while Yugoslav President Slobodan Miloesvic is
reportedly studying a project which could lead to the deployment
of a U.N. force in Kosovo. The visit to Italy by Kosovo Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova was also seen as a positive sign.
</P>
<P>
-- According to a poll by Le Figaro and several other media
institutions, the Socialist candidates for the European elections
will lead in the vote on June 13, followed by the Rally for the
Republic and its ally the Liberal Democratic Party. Five weeks
away from the voting, one French in two is not determined yet who
to vote.

<HEADLINE> China's Non-Governmental Organizations to Play Bigger Roles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Various non-governmental
organizations in China will play bigger and bigger roles in China
with the deepening of reform and the operation of the market
mechanism, according to Chen Guangyao, an official from the
Administration of Non-Governmental Organizations under China's
Ministry of Civil Affairs today.
</P>
<P>
According to him, as a result of the current institutional
reform in the Chinese government at all levels, much coordination
and service work previously done by the government will be
conducted by various non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, the government's role is mainly to outline
development plans, formulate policies and do macro-adjustments,
this will leave much room for various non-governmental
organizations to serve as a bridge," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the present co-existence of the multi-ownership
economic system in China will also help to enhance the role played
by various non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
In China, he said, non-governmental organizations include all
kinds of associations, chambers of commerce, federations,
foundations, academic societies and so on.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, it is very urgent for China to
encourage the development of trade associations among various
industrial sectors including agriculture, industry and finance.

<HEADLINE> Australian Women Urged to Rip Down Diet Signs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Australian promoters of
International No Diet Day Thursday urged people to rip down diet
signs from telephone poles and bulletin boards and send junk mail
diet ads back to the sender.
</P>
<P>
Melbourne-based Body Image and Health Inc. also suggested
setting up a bin for people to throw away relics of dieting such
as calorie counters and bathroom scales.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Australia's New Woman magazine Thursday urged
women to write to women's magazines to ask them to use larger size
models.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of Australia's women are on a diet or feeling
guilty about breaking one, the spokeswoman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Other tips from the magazine and Body Image and Health Inc.
include "buy clothes that show off your glorious body rather than
hide it" and "dump the lover who is always telling you to diet."
</P>
<P>
Luncheons were held in six Australian cities Thursday with the
aim to increase public awareness of the dangers and futility of
dieting, weight loss surgery, and obsession with thinness.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Heart Foundation also joined the anti-dieting theme
Thursday, launching a weight loss checklist designed to ensure
consumers make good choices and do not waste money on weight loss
programs.
</P>
<P>
Susan Anderson, the foundation's national nutrition program
manager, said Australians spend more than 1 million Australian
dollars (650,000 U.S. dollars) on weight loss programs and
products a day, although experts agree that quick-fix diets do not
work.
</P>
<P>
Anderson said research showed that frequent dieting was
associated in women with depression and eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that even people in the healthy weight range
believe they are overweight, she said.
</P>
<P>
But in a society where 63 percent of men and 47 percent of
women are truly obese, people should be aware of the health
benefits of achieving an ideal weight, she added.
</P>
<P>
The New Woman magazine said that a generation ago the average
model weighted 8 percent less than the average American woman, but
now it's 23 percent less.
</P>
<P>
The message they are trying to get across is that "beauty,
health and fitness comes in all shapes and sizes."
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the number of people with eating disorders has
more than doubled since the 1960s, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
This year's International No Diet Day is being sponsored in
Australia by naturopathic medicine and supplement manufacturer
Blackmores Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the society's preoccupation with fat-free products,
many dieters are eliminating essential fatty acids, or good fats,
which are critical for optimum health," Marcus Blackmore, chief
executive officer of the company said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Disrupts Assasination Attempt on Former </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- An assasination attempt against
former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani was discovered and
disrupted, the daily Iran News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the daily that a group called Mahdiyoun
has targeted Rafsanjani. However, the source did not reveal
details about the issue.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the group was also involved in the failed
assassination against head of Tehran Justice Department Ali
Razini, who was injured by a bomb adhered to his car in January.
</P>
<P>
Last month, commander of ground forces of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Brigadier General Mohammad Ali
Jaafari said a new Iranian religious group called "Mahdaviyat"
was responsible for the aborted assassination against Razini.
</P>
<P>
Jaafari made the remarks after some Iranian newspapers claimed
that the IRGC was behind the assassination attempt against the
Iranian conservative judicial official.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian outlawed Mujahideen Khalq Organization
(MKO) claimed responsibility for the attack soon afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Bustards Well Protected in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of bustards are thankfully
under the state's first-class protection and living happily in a
nature reserve in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The birds are usually one to 1.3 meters tall, with black or
yellow-brown spots and lines on the back, grayish white abdomens.
In China, the birds mostly live in either the Inner Mongolia or
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
They are not good at flying but prefer walking, living on
insects including locusts, and searching out grain husks on
farmland in the winter.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve, set up in 1996, is China's first for the
breeding and protection of bustards that are listed worldwide as a
species on the verge of extinction. And the manager said that the
number of the birds has been increasing in recent years, now
exceeding 60 from just over ten in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Years of study show that 175 kinds of birds are now living
there, including seven species under the state first-class
protection, bustards, red-crown cranes, white cranes, golden
eagles, and 20 among the second-class such as black eagles, gray
cranes, and swans.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zixue, who is in charge of nature protection at the
region's Environmental Protection Bureau, said that grassland
protection is crucial for the survival of bustards, for they are
grassland birds, and the regional government has set up altogether
58 nature reserves with flourishing grass and abundant water
resources in the region.

<HEADLINE> China Strongly Opposes Inclusion of Taiwan into TMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China has today expressed strong
displeasure with and resolute opposition to the incorporation of
Taiwan into the U.S. Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remarks at the
regular press conference when asked to comment on a recent report
submitted by the U.S. Defense Department to the U.S. Congress on
TMD Architecture Options for the Asia-Pacific Region, in which it
makes "research" on the incorporation of Taiwan into the TMD.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory and the
issue of Taiwan is "purely an internal affair of China and no
foreign country has the right of interfere," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, again spreads the so-call China's missile
threat to Taiwan and dish up the so-called option to include
Taiwan into TMD in an attempt to whip up public opinions and find
pretext for selling more sophisticated weapons to Taiwan, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"The move has violated the principles set forth in the China-U.
S. August 17 Communique and constituted a serious interference of
China's internal affairs," he said, adding that the move is also
detrimental to the stability across the Taiwan straits.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the U.S. side to observe the principles set in the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and relevant commitments made by
the U.S. side, stop the sales of more advanced weapons to Taiwan,
make explicit commitment not to transfer TMD and relevant
technologies and equipment to Taiwan, and not do anything that may
impede China's reunification," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's Attempt to Enter WHO Dooms to Fail: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The attempt of the Taiwan
authorities to enter the World Health Organization (WHO) is doomed
to fail, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks at the regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, WHO is an inter-governmental
organization within the framework of the United Nations (UN) and
its organization rules clearly stipulate that only a sovereign
state is qualified to table application for joining the
organization. "Taiwan, which is a province of China, has no
qualification to join such organization," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 2758 of U.N. and WHA25.1 Resolution have restored
all rights of China in both U.N. and WHO, he said, adding that the
two documents have fully resolved the issue of China's
representation in the two organizations in terms of politics, laws
and procedures.
</P>
<P>
On the recent move that a few countries applied for Taiwan an
observer's status in WHO, Zhu said the move was in violation to
WHO's organization rules.
</P>
<P>
Also, he considered the action not only a violation of China's
sovereignty, but also an interference in China's internal affairs
and a random trampling of the U.N. Charter and relevant WHO
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"It will be surely opposed by the Chinese government and all
countries that uphold justice," he said.

<HEADLINE> Village Head In China No Longer Appointed By Higher Authorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Nearly all villages in China have
now established their own villagers committees to administer their
own affairs, and the village head in China is no longer appointed
by higher authorities as in the past, official sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1980s China has carried out a policy named "
villagers administrating their own affairs". Since 1983, China
has established a total of more than 900,000 villagers committees
whose members were all elected directly by villagers themselves.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than
60 percent of the villagers committees in China have established
villagers conferences, villagers congresses, open system of
village affairs. And they have also formulated village regulations
and rules for governing their own affairs, which have helped
guarantee the democracy rights of all the villagers.
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally Chinese villagers paid more attention to their
material benefits rather than their rights, but now, the awareness
of seeking and protecting their rights has been largely raised
among villagers," commented an official with the Ministry of Civil
Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Imelda Asks Philippine Govt to Release Settlement Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine former first lady Imelda
R. Marcos Thursday formally asked the country's anti-graft court
Sandiganbayan to allow the release of the 150-million-U.S.-dollar
settlement fund to human rights claimants.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. federal district court in Hawaii approved on April 29
the settlement of claims of 9,539 victims of human rights abuses
during the Marcos regime, ordering Manila to transmit the money to
a court-designated bank in Hawaii by May 10 and granting the
Marcoses immunity from future human rights suits.
</P>
<P>
In a two-page statement, Imelda said the anti-graft court
should recognize the settlement agreement by approving the
transfer of the 150 million U.S. dollars to the First Hawaii Bank
in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
She also reiterated her commitment towards "helping the less
fortunate, in the interest of peace, reconciliation and unity."

<HEADLINE> South African Giraffes Settle Down in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Two giraffes from South Africa
have been doing well in Changchun, capital of northeast China's
Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The giraffes are the first ever in this Chinese auto city. Both
animals are two years old; the male weighs 500 kilos and is 3.2
meters tall, while the female weighs 400 kilos and stands 2.8
meters tall.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Changchun said the two giraffes were shipped to
China from South Africa via a special plane last November. But the
couple could not stand the rigid cold of northeast China, so they
were later placed in the Shanghai Zoo.
</P>
<P>
Two keepers were sent to Shanghai to fetch the giraffes back
late last month as the weather in Changchun started to become
warmer, and the giraffes arrived in Changchun on May 3 after a
journey of five days.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government of Changchun earmarked a special fund
to build a 700-sq-m Giraffes Hall in the zoo, and a 900-sq-m
exercise field in front of the hall.
</P>
<P>
The giraffes looked rather tired when they arrived, but they
seemed to like their new home. Seeing the food and water prepared,
the giraffes did not hesitate to eat and drink, said one zookeeper.
</P>
<P>
A zoo official said the giraffes will be shown to visitors
after they are adapted to their new environment in about two weeks.

<P>
ANKARA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 30 rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) were killed in operations launched by
government security forces in eastern Turkey, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The military operations came one day after a large group of PKK
militants ambushed the security forces on duty in Yayladere town
of Bingol province, in which nine soldiers were killed and another
was wounded, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted the
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The wounded soldier has been in a military hospital in Elazig
province for treatment, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
They added that the armed clashes between the PKK and the
Turkish security forces are continuing in the region.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the Turkish security forces had
launched large operations against the PKK militants in the region
linking Bingol and Tunceli provinces with the strong support of
Cobra and Skorsky helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
state in southeastern Turkey. The conflicts have claimed over
37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured by the Turkish special
agents in Kenya in mid-February and has been detained on Imrali
Island in Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of Bursa for
trail on charges of treason.

<HEADLINE> Former Tehran Mayor Ready to Serve Prison Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Former mayor of Iranian capital
Tehran Gholamhussein Karbaschi, a well-known reformist, announced
on Thursday morning his readiness to serve prison terms over graft
charges.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Karbaschi
introduced himself to the conservative judiciary while some of
his friends and a group of people gathered in front of the
judicial building to show their support for him.
</P>
<P>
The group shouted slogans in support of Karbaschi when he
arrived at the judicial complex in downtown Tehran, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian judiciary last week ordered Karbaschi to report to
court for prison terms after Iran's supreme court rejected an
appeal by his lawyers earlier in April.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a strong supporter of President Mohammad Khatmi,
was publicly tried on charges of graft last July and received
five years in prison, a 20-year ban from holding government
posts, 60 lashes of the whip and a fine of 1 billion rials (about
160,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A Tehran appeal court later reduced his prison sentence to two
years and the period Karbaschi was banned from taking public
office to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was appointed the capital's mayor in 1989 when the
Iranian government started post-war reconstruction programs.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of pocketing public fund and offering financial
support to Khatami in his 1997 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
In April last year, Karbaschi was temporally jailed, but was
released under an order from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei following a political disturbance in the country caused
by his arrest.

<HEADLINE> South Australia to Enhance Economic Ties with Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- John Olsen, premier of South
Australia, said here Thursday that his government encourages South
Australia's companies to invest in China including Hong Kong and
welcomes investment from China's mainland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the Grand Hyatt Hotel on Thursday,
Olsen said that South Australia's total exports to Hong Kong and
China's mainland are growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
During 1994-1995, the total exports to Hong Kong and China's
mainland were 192.7 million Australian dollars (125 million U.S.
dollars) and 177.9 million Australian dollars (115 million U.S.
dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
In 1995-1996, the figures rose to 201.9 million Australian
dollars (131 million U.S. dollars) in Hong Kong and 293.3 million
Australian dollars (190 million U.S. dollars) in China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Last year, they were totaled to 240 million Australian dollars
(156 million U.S. dollars) in Hong Kong and 331.5 million
Australian dollars (215 million U.S. dollars) in China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is a resource-rich nation on the Asia-Pacific rim
and mutual benefits can only be achieved by closer business
association with Asia," said Olsen.
</P>
<P>
"At present, 5 percent of Australian population is of Asian
origin and, by year 2020, this is expected to rise to 10 percent.
The growing Asian population will definitely give rise to an
increase of trade linkage and cultural understanding," he said.
</P>
<P>
John Cambridge, chief executive for State Development of South
Australia, said that China is the biggest market for South
Australia's sea food.
</P>
<P>
Companies from South Australia will help China improve its
environment by providing China with its advanced technology and
equipment in pollution and water management.
</P>
<P>
A South Australian company has won a 55 million-Australian
dollar (36 million U.S. dollar) project in restructuring old towns
in Shanghai, China's biggest city, Cambridge said.
</P>
<P>
As for Hong Kong, Cambridge said that Hong Kong's role as the
bridge between China's mainland and the rest of the world will
still be there even after China enters the World Trade
Organization because foreign companies will still need Hong Kong's
services and expertise.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The killer Tornadoes that ripped
through Oklahoma and Kansas of the United States earlier this week
may cost insurance companies more than 500 million U.S. dollars,
according to the Insurance Information Institute Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although it is still too early to determine the actual losses,
the institute said records for storms of similar intensity suggest
that insurance costs could easily exceed 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The twisters left 43 people confirmed dead and 669 injured in
the two states. More than 2,000 homes were destroyed and 8,000
damaged by the tornadoes, the institute said, adding that standard
business and homeowners policies will cover wind damage from the
tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
The median sale price of homes in the Oklahoma City area, where
the losses were concentrated, is 77,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The tornadoes are already expected to rank as the worst
insurance catastrophe in Oklahoma's history, topping June 1992
hail and windstorms that caused 150 million dollars in insured
losses.

<HEADLINE> China to Invest More in Poverty-Relief (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China will increase investment in
poverty-alleviation greatly this year to accomplish its goal of
providing adequate food and clothing to 42 million needy farmers
by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
This year's total investment from the central government will
reach nearly 25 billion yuan, including loans, food-for-work
grants, and financial allocations, said an official from the State
Council's leading group for eradicating poverty.
</P>
<P>
The local governments are also asked to allocate funds
equivalent to at least 30 percent of the central government's
input.
</P>
<P>
"China has entered the final stage of fighting against absolute
poverty," the official said, "increasing investment is the
inevitable choice to reach that goal."
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Chinese Government set an ambitious plan to help
its then 80 million needy farmers out of poverty by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
China's absolute poverty line was set at an annual income of
300 yuan per capita by 1990 standards, and adjusted for inflation,
the standard was equivalent to some 680 yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the pace of poverty-relief, the Chinese
government has been increasing investment in this field every year
for the past number of years.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the total investment from the central government was
18.3 billion yuan, including 3.3 billion yuan in loans, 5 billion
yuan in work-for-food grants, and 10 billion yuan in financial
allocations.

"In general, our efforts have paid off and we have achieved a

years, the country has helped 38 million poor farmers shake off
poverty and become better off.
</P>
<P>
Juergen Voegele, principal agricultural economist with the
World Bank's Resident Mission in China, said that China has done
an "outstanding" job of reducing the poor rural population from
one third of the world's total 20 years ago to the current one
twentieth.
</P>
<P>
Though this is the case, an official from the leading group
admitted that the task is becoming increasingly tougher as the
majority of the remaining 42 million poor people live mostly in
most remote regions and outlying mountainous areas and the
deadline is less than two years away.
</P>
<P>
"Even if we fulfill our goal on time, we still has a long way
to go as our poverty standard is low compared with other countries,

<HEADLINE> National Semiconductor Corp. Exits PC Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 5 (Xinhua) -- National Semiconductor Corp.
announced Wednesday it plans to exit the personal computer
business to focus on the information appliance market and its
analog business.
</P>
<P>
"We will immediately cease slugging it out in the PC processor
market, which has been dragging down our financial performance for
several quarters," said Brian L. Halla, chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say the announcement by National Semiconductor
Corp., one of Silicon Valley's oldest chip makers, is an
indication that it plans to reel from tougher competition with
Intel, the world's largest chip maker.
</P>
<P>
National entered the Intel-compatible chip business when it
bought Cyrix Corp. for about 550 million U.S. dollars in 1997.
Cyrix targeted the very low-end of the PC chip market, hoping to
avoid Intel and its then-costlier processors.
</P>
<P>
But Intel, after losing significant share of low-end of the PC
chip market, launched a processor for the very low-cost sector of
the PC market, called Celeron, and in the past several months has
engaged in an aggressive price war with National, which said it
expects to lose about 45 to 50 million dollars in the fourth
fiscal quarter in PC processors, more than analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford, nor do we need to continue to fight Intel,"
Hall told analysts on a conference call Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
National also plans to sell a majority stake in its state-of-
the-art plant in South Portland, Maine, where it makes both Intel-
compatible processors and chips for low-cost appliances. Rumors
say it could be sold to International Business Machines Corp.
</P>
<P>
National will continue to focus on analog products, which
represented about 70 percent of its fiscal 1999 sales through the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Analog chips are used in the fast-growing markets of wireless
and communications, and other more mundane areas like automobiles
and battery power management.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Bourse Ends Week Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Amid hopes that the dissolution
of the parliament will give the government a free hand in making
economic decisions, the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) index
Wednesday closed the week 1.17 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
The KSE index closed at 1,495.9 points Wednesday, up 17.4
points from the finish a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Other indicators also picked up this week. The average daily
turnover was 6.4 million Kuwaiti dinars (21.14 million
U.S. dollars) compared with last week's 2.08 million dinars (6.86
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
During the week, a total of 255.61 million shares were traded
in 5,319 deals as against 61.68 million shares in 1,631 deals last
week.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts attributed the strong market to the dissolution
of the parliament by Kuwaiti Emir Jaber, an action which is
believed to release pressure from parliament on the government in
making decisions on issues related to reviving national economy.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted more short-term gains for the bourse. "The
KSE always reacts positively when the parliament is weakened," an
economic consultant told the local daily Kuwait Times.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of the parliament, he said, investors will
"expect the government only to take popular decisions which will
benefit companies and investors."
</P>
<P>
He predicted further gains for at least the next week, but
doubted if the trend could be sustained while a prospect still
lingers that the majority of the deputies in the dissolved
parliament will get re-elected in fresh elections slated on
July 3.

<HEADLINE> Australia Sees Underlying Inflation Around 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA), Australia's central bank, expects the underlying inflation
to be around 2.0 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In its semi-annual statement on monetary policy, which was
released Thursday, the bank said Australia's excellent inflation
performance should continue, and the inflation rate is expected to
increase to around 2.0 percent by the end of 1999 from the current
1.7 percent, and remain at that level into the following year.
</P>
<P>
The RBA said the combination of strong economic growth and
exceptionally low inflation "is quite unlike the experience of the
preceding 30 years."
</P>
<P>
"Overall inflation has been held down to a surprising degree by
declining import prices. Even so, the underlying inflation rate
has tended to drift up, to its current level of 1.7 percent," the
RBA said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australia Federal Treasurer Peter Costello predicted
the country's economic growth would outperform his department's
targets and come in above 4 percent in the fiscal year of
1998-1999, which ends on June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Australian economy grew at 4.7 percent in 1998, making it
one of the fastest-growing economies in the world despite the
ongoing Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said in the coming fiscal year of 1999-2000, economic growth
would slow to 2-3 percent, due to a slowing world economy.
</P>
<P>
Costello warned that the international economic climate still
remained difficult, with strong domestic demand bolstering imports
while commodity export prices were at historic lows, and that
Australia could not afford to become complacent.
</P>
<P>
"We are still in a difficult international environment," he
told reporters.

<P>
LUOYANG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Xiaolangdi Multi-Purpose Water-

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Property Market on Track for Smooth Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's property market has
bottomed out after a year of readjustment and embarked on the road
of smooth development, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Transactions are becoming brisk. On April 18, a new residential
building attracted more than 1,000 potential buyers and the 138
units listed for transactions were sold in a single day. The good
results of land sale on April 20 strengthened the citizens'
confidence in property market.
</P>
<P>
The 900,000 residential units that have been completed and the
more than 30,000 units put on sale by property developers have
formed a buoyant property market.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the financial crisis, an average of more than 10,000
housing transactions were conducted each month, giving impetus to
property market, banking, construction, advertising, retail sales
and other relevant businesses.
</P>
<P>
However, in the past year, under the influence of the financial
crisis, housing transactions declined by big margins and prices
dropped by 40 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government
adopted various measures in 1998 to boost the citizens' purchasing
power and encourage free development of property market. Land
sales were suspended for over nine months.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the HKSAR government has put
forward a series of economic measures to guarantee property
development, including renewal of land sales.
</P>
<P>
All these measures, plus a mortgage insurance program and bank
interest rate cuts, helped boost public confidence in the property
market. The 11 buildings put on sale by developers in March were
well received. Foreigners also began to invest in HK's property
market. An Australian company purchased a luxurious building for
580 million HK dollars (74.35 million U.S. dollars) in March.
</P>
<P>
Secondary property market also recovered. Of all residential
flats sold, the proportion of second hand houses has increased
from 45 percent during the crisis to the present 65 percent.
Figures released by the government show that the number of
transactions of properties for both residential and non-
residential purposes reached 10,332 in March, almost the same as
before the crises. Housing prices also went up 10 to 15 percent
from the lowest in August and September 1998.

<HEADLINE> President Mandela Delivers Speech in Beijing University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua)-- Visiting South African President
Nelson Mandela said in a speech at Beijing University today that
his country and China "are building a constructive partnership".
</P>
<P>
He said that potential contribution by China, one of the
world's largest economies and a leading figure in world affairs,
cannot be exaggerated in the establishment of the new world order
that will have to emerge to promote equity and to safeguard world
peace.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is committed to working with China towards these
goals," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president praised the unwavering political, diplomatic and
material support of the Chinese people and government for South
Africa's struggle for liberation.
</P>
<P>
"We can proudly say that in our five years of democracy, ties
between South Africa and China have grown stronger and broader",
Mandela noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the world economy, the president said, "we must
ensure that globalization benefits not only the powerful but also
the men, women and children whose lives are ravaged by poverty.
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure that the multilateral institutions, which
regulate international trade and investment, are redirected so
that they better reflect the needs of developing countries",
Mandela stated.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Kosovo crisis, President Mandela said that it
raises questions about "our international institutions." "Can the
world afford, at the end of a century that has seen so much pain
and suffering, to risk damaging the authority of the world body
that has the task of maintaining international peace and security
on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of nations"? he asked.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, invited by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, arrived in
Beijing early this morning to start a three-day state visit. He is
the first South African head of state to visit China.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sees Direct Foreign Investment Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has attracted direct foreign
investment worth 16 billion shillings (some 240 million U.S.
dollars) in the past few years despite the harsh economic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Executive Chairman of Kenya's Investment Promotion Center,
Joseph Ng'ok told a press conference here Wednesday that foreign
direct investment had been growing in recent years, contrary to
the belief that the investment portfolio had dropped.
</P>
<P>
He cited recent investment projects in which four companies
separately invested a total of 180 million dollars as a pointer to
investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
Ng'ok gave as examples of increasing direct foreign investment
the purchase of shares in Kenya Airways by KLM, Dutch national
carrier, for 40 million dollars, the 100-million-dollar investment
by Ibera Africa and Westmont in power generation, a
20-million-dollar investment by Nairobi Cargo Center, and Bamburi
Cement's investment of 20 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Daily Nation newspaper quoted the investment
official as saying that the figure did not include other foreign
investment such as the four billion shillings (about 61 million
dollars) by Castle of South Africa at Thika, one of the county's
export processing zones.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Commonwealth Development Corporation has also
put in 30 million dollars in Sulmac Flower Company formerly owned
by Brooke Bond which now concentrates on tea.
</P>
<P>
The Orpower of the United States will invest 202 million
dollars in building a power project, Ng'ok noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kenyan official admitted that although 30 percent
of all investment proposals passed through his investment
promotion center, its data might understate the actual inflow of
direct foreign investment since some investors ignore the center.
</P>
<P>
Other sources of foreign investment information include the
Central Bank of Kenya, customs department and the Registrar of
Companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
On future prospects, Ng'ok said the future is promising as the
government is implementing measures to ensure that Kenya remains
the prime investment market in the region.

<HEADLINE> China Confident in Touching Overseas Fund Utilization Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China has confidence in using as
much overseas funds as projected for 1999 amid optimistic
expectations of its continuing and healthy economic growth,
according to an official source here today.
</P>
<P>
This was the conclusion of an ongoing conference sponsored by
the State Development Planning Commission, held in Chengdu, the
capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, on overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
Localities are being encouraged to take in more overseas
investment in such sectors as banking, insurance, commerce,
transportation, telecommunications, and the country's central and
western parts.
</P>
<P>
The state will make efforts to further open the commercial
sector, promote the property rights transfer of infrastructure
facilities, and prohibit adoptions of regulations concerning
arbitrary fee charges on overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Steps will also be taken to stabilize the scale of loans from
foreign governments, to support agriculture, transportation,
environmental protection, and rebuilding in flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the central government will tighten control over
the total amount of foreign debts and maintain a rational
structure of foreign debts structure in a bid to keep major
payment indicators blow the safety mark.
</P>
<P>
However, negative effects of the Asian financial crisis on
China's utilization of overseas funds are still around, a barrier
to a smooth influx of direct overseas investment from the
neighboring countries and regions. And volatile stock markets in
Asia pose another difficulty for China's large businesses to raise
money through issuing shares therein.
</P>
<P>
China used a total of 58.9 billion U.S. dollars in overseas
funds last year, including 45.6 billion U.S. dollars in overseas
direct investment, remaining the first among the developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
Sector insiders attributed this mainly to a series of measures,
including policy revisions for overseas investment orientations,
newly-adopted favorable tax policies on overseas investment in
such areas as hi-tech, and the pro-active financial policy.

tons," Kibria said on Wednesday, after returning from a meeting of
the Asian Development Bank in Manila, the Philippines, The
Independent English-language daily newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to withdraw all duties on import and
power tiller and pumps and timely supply of agricultural inputs to
the farmers had contributed to the revival of the agricultural
sector after the two-month-long flood sweeping the country from
July to September in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has disbursed agricultural credits of about 25
billion taka (515.46 million U.S. dollars) since July last year,
and the total disbursement during the current fiscal from July
1998 to July 1999 is expected to reach about 28 billion taka
(577.32 million dollars). Last year's agriculture loan
disbursement was about 12 billion taka (about 247 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Kibria said that his claim of regaining of liveliness and
growth of the economy was also based on the encouraging industrial
production and exports after the devastating flood.
</P>
<P>
"The industrial growth is much less than last year's, but not
bad in the context of the floods and the situation in other Asian
countries," he said. The growth in the country's industrial sector
is only 5.31 percent at present, against the 12-percent growth
last year.
</P>
<P>
The overall export was moving ahead bypassing the impacts of
the floods, although the export performance was about 9 percent
less than the target, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The country exported goods worth 441.85 million dollars in
March this year, about 2.6 percent higher than the amount of the
same month the previous year. And the total exports during the
July 1998-March 1999, the first nine months of the current fiscal
year, stood at 3,804.87 million dollars, against 3,767.71 million
dollars during the same period in the previous fiscal.
</P>
<P>
The government originally set an export target of 5.8 billion
dollars for the present fiscal year, but scaled down the volume to
5.63 billion dollars early this year, after realizing that it was
"difficult" to achieve the 5.8 billion-dollar target as the
country's exports suffered a major setback during last year's
severe flood.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime ministerial candidate and Center Party leader Yitzhak
Mordechai asserted Wednesday that he will fight on in the
elections campaign, despite polls showing that his support is
dwindling. But the media reported that his party has ordered fresh
polls to see what would happen should he drop out the race before
the May 17 voting.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States administration is holding talks with senior
congressional leaders in an attempt to avert pressures to move the
U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
U.S. administration officials fear that progress on the
embassy's planned move could heighten tensions over the Jerusalem
issue in the election campaign, and postpone the beginning of
permanent status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that he
did not rule out the possibility of giving the portfolio of
Interior Ministry to Yisrael Ba'aliya party in the next
government if he wins the elections.
</P>
<P>
The party, representing Russian immigrants, has conditioned its
support for any coalition government on control over the Interior
Ministry, which is now under the control of Shas.

<HEADLINE> UN Meeting on Human Settlements Opens in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (xinhua) -- Over 600 delegates from more than
120 countries Wednesday attended the 17th session of the
Commission on Human Settlements of the U.N. Center for Human
Settlements (Habitat) which opened at the U.N. office in Nairobi,
Kenya's capital.
</P>
<P>
During the nine-day meeting, the delegates will focus on such
issues as the revitalization of the Habitat, work program and
budget for the biennium 2000-2001, human settlements foundation,
cooperation with partners, and the implementation of the Habitat
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said the problem of human settlement remains unsolved and
human settlement conditions have continued to deteriorate due to
overwhelming socio-economic difficulties facing many countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the on-going commission
session would approve a realistic work program and budget that
will fulfil the expectation of the member states, in their pursuit
of human settlement development.
</P>
<P>
The president told the participants that Kenya is implementing
the "National Poverty Eradication Plan 1999-2015" and hoped the
U.N. Commission

for Human Settlements would find ways of integrating its world
program with the objectives of Kenya's poverty eradication plan.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Toepfer, acting executive director of the Habitat, said
radical and swift social transformation in this century has seen
an exponential growth in global population and is also a period of
increasing migration of populations from the countryside to the
cities.
</P>
<P>
"Sustainable development depends to an ever greater degree on
the effective management of urban areas. In this regard, this
session of the Commission will give a strong signal to the
international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer noted that a revitalized Habitat must develop
strategies that transform cities from being part of the problems
into a part of the solution for the sustainable development of
urban areas as well as rural areas.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation with partners, Toepfer said, his center should
facilitate and encourage the leading role of local authorities in
decision-making at the city level and in improving urban
management and governance practices.
</P>
<P>
During the session, the delegates will review proposals for
Habitat' s reform and revitalization. It is expected that the
session will also endorse and launch the Habitat as the "City
Agency" of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Comprising 58 countries, the Commission of Human Settlements is
the governing body of the Habitat and approves the center's
overall policy, project priorities and action, with its
commission session held every two years.

<HEADLINE> Fishing Industry New Source Of Growth In Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The dry, land-locked province of
Gansu held a symposium on the fishing industry recently in its
capital Lanzhou, where it was decided that fishing could become a
new growth industry for local development.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the province already had nearly 20,000
hectares of water areas used for aquatic products, according to
provincial fishery departments.
</P>
<P>
Although Gansu only had a two-decade history of fisheries, the
913-kilometer part of the Yellow River that runs through the
province, along with its 450 other rivers and lakes and its 340
reservoirs mean that fish could be big business.
</P>
<P>
It has Yellow River carp and soft-shell turtles and in recent
years has developed new species like rainbow trout. By the end of
1998, it had 21 rainbow trout breeding centers on 16.2 ha. of land
producing 800 tons of fish each year and making Gansu the
country's largest rainbow trout producer.
</P>
<P>
According to the fishery departments, Gansu's soft-shell turtle
output has reached 40 tons a year and the average per capita
income of the fish growers was 2,500 yuan at the end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Concerned Over Kosovo Crisis (by Li Jinqi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
expressed his deep concern over the escalating warfare in
Yugoslavia here Wednesday, deploring the loss of lives and
destruction of homes and infrastructure by Nato's stray missiles.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the 17th session of the U.N.
Commission of Human Settlements which opened at the United Nations
Office in Nairobi, Moi said, "The Kosovo crisis is worrying many
of us at the meeting."
</P>
<P>
"I have in the recent past held consultations with a number of
officials connected with this crisis and raised my own concern on
the escalating warfare in the region," he told over 600 delegates
from more than 120 countries attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The president said when a stray missile missed its target and
hit a civilian residential area in Yugoslavia, it caused
destruction of homes, infrastructure as well as loss of lives.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo crisis has triggered massive displacement of
civilian population occasioning serious human sufferings," he
said, adding that "this is contrary to the principles of the
Habitat (the U.N. Center for Human Settlements) agenda."
</P>
<P>
Moi told the participants that Kenya is a firm believer in
peaceful and negotiated settlement of any differences between
communities and nations.
</P>
<P>
He called on all member countries of the United Nations "to
work together for the realization of our common objective of
ensuring adequate shelter and peaceful co-existence for all
people."

<HEADLINE> CIH Virus Damages 360,000 PCs in China: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide survey completed this
week showed that 360,000 computers were damaged by the CIH
Chernobyl virus in China on April 26.
</P>
<P>
Economic losses caused by the virus totaled at least one
billion yuan, according to the survey carried out by the Beijing-
based Rising Company, China's leading anti-virus company, in
association with a local information service.
</P>
<P>
It was found that about 15 percent of the damaged computers
suffered breakdown in hard drive and the others lost all or part
of their data.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the affected users have had anti-virus
software, but most of them failed to initiate it on the day the
CIH virus was activated, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
While most of the victims were enterprises, computer users in
the banking, securities, telecommunications customs and civil
aviation sectors generally kept away from the disaster because
their systems were not based on the Microsoft Windows platform.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xu, chief engineer of the Beijing-based Rising Company
told Xinhua that his team has succeeded in designing a program
that is capable of restoring most of the data on CIH damaged disks.
</P>
<P>
"The program has been added to the upgraded version of the anti-
CIH software developed by the company and is now available for
users across the country," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
CIH is a widely distributed virus with the potential to render
PCs useless. Its payload results in a significant loss of data
from the hard drive, as well as the possible inability to start up
or reboot the computer.
</P>
<P>
The virus had been timed to strike on April 26, June 26 or each
26th to mark the anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in
the former Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> UAE Takes Precautions Against Meningitis Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Medical authorities of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) have taken precautions to avoid the current
outbreak of meningococcal meningitis in Sudan from touching the
UAE, whether through airports or seaports.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health and other health authorities have
taken prompt and necessary action to ensure that there are no
undetected cases of patients suffering from the disease or
carriers infected with the meningococcal bacterium entering the
country, the Khaleej Times daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The alarm was sounded after the World Health Organization and
Sudanese health authorities confirmed that 1,500 people have died
of the disease and another 16,000 infected cases have been
reported in the recent outbreak of the epidemic, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
As Dubai International Airport is served by four airlines
linking the emirate with eight flights arriving from Khartoum per
week, a surveillance program on all incoming passengers and those
outbound for Sudan has been put into place since Monday, an
aviation source said.
</P>
<P>
As flights linking the UAE and Sudan "arrive and depart at
various times of the day, we have put a team of doctors, nurses
and health inspectors on a 24-hour watch," the source said.
</P>
<P>
When a flight arrives, a medical team boards the aircraft and
administers antibiotic to all passengers.
</P>
<P>
A team of health inspectors also checks whether passengers are
carrying valid health documents certifying that they have been
vaccinated against meningococcal meningitis.
</P>
<P>
"If they are not, we vaccinate them on the spot," the source
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that there had been no reported case of such disease
so far among passengers arriving from Sudan.

BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A survey has found that the quality
of leather shoes, shampoo and other commodities produced by large-
and middle-sized enterprises is higher than that of small
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
All the leather shoes produced by large enterprises have now
met state standards, while 69 percent of the products of the
middle-sized enterprises are now qualified, according to the
survey, which was conducted by the State Quality and Technological
Supervision Bureau during the first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that only 47 percent of the leather
shoes produced by small enterprises are up to standards.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also conducted a survey on shampoo products in
Guangdong, Shanxi, Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and
Fujian provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and
the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing, and found
that 90 percent of these products had reached state standards.
</P>
<P>
Large- and middle-sized enterprises have a stronger awareness
of quality and brand-recognition, and have in turn won a large
share of the market with good quality and special styles.
</P>
<P>
"Some small private-run enterprises are producing low-quality
products, hindering their development," said Zhu Mingxuan, deputy-
director of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said that quality supervision departments at all levels
should step up their inspection of private-run enterprise, and
should help them improve the quality of their products.

<HEADLINE> Regional Ministers to Meet for Peace in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said Wednesday that a regional meeting to be participated by the
foreign ministers of the countries concerned will take place soon
for a cease-fire agreement on the nine-month war in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who has been mandated by the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to mediate a peaceful solution to the
conflict, disclosed this after returning here Wednesday from a
two-day visit to Libya.
</P>
<P>
He said upon his arrival from Tripoli that his consultations
with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi made preparations for the
foreign ministers' meeting, which is designed to pave the way for
a long-expected summit on the Congo issue.
</P>
<P>
At the ministerial meeting a document for a cease-fire
agreement will be finalized, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said he and Gaddafi agreed that Lusaka peace initiative
should continue and be given support by other African leaders
because it has reached an advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
Signing the cease-fire accord is part of the peace process in
the war- torn central African country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement signed by Congolese President Laurent
Kabila and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni last month in Libya
is not meant to take anything away from the Lusaka process, said
Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited Lusaka summit to seek a peaceful solution to
the crisis have been postponed several times from the originally
planned date of December 8 last year because of largely Kabila's
refusal to allow the rebels fighting to topple him to be involved
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In March, Kabila changed his mind and agreed to allow them to
be involved.
</P>
<P>
The rebels attended a meeting of defense and security chiefs of
the concerned countries for the first time held here last month,
but walked out of the meeting, demanding a bilateral meeting with
a Congolese government delegation.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Reports on Mainlander Right of Abode Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government reported
here Thursday the negative effects upon the Hong Kong society of a
possible influx of mainlanders eligible for the right of abode
here according to a controversial Court of Final Appeal's ruling.
</P>
<P>
According to the government's preliminary assessment, the total
annual recurrent cost for providing various kinds of services to
the 1.675 million eligible persons is estimated at 33 billion HK
dollars (4.23 billion U.S. dollars) in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
These services include housing, education, vocational training
and retraining, medical and health care, welfare services,
employment services and transport.
</P>
<P>
Reporting the assessment to the Legislative Council, Michael
Suen Ming-yeung, acting administrative secretary, said that in
addition, a total capital cost of 710 billion HK dollars (91.02
billion U.S. dollars) will be required within the next 10 years
for providing these services.
</P>
<P>
Of the total capital cost, 347 billion HK dollars (44.48
billion U.S. dollars) will be provided for construction, 93
billion HK dollars (11.92 billion U.S. dollars) for land
production and 270 billion HK dollars (34.61 billion U.S. dollars)
for the transport infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,277 additional hectares of land and premises with
floor areas of 500,000 square meters will be required for
providing these facilities and services.
</P>
<P>
Suen noted that the total 1998-99 government recurrent and
capital spending is 167 billion HK dollars (21.41 billion HK
dollars) and 55 billion HK dollars (7.05 billion U.S. dollars)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Funding aside, he said, the massive construction program would
bring about huge problems in terms of land availability,
environmental nuisance, delivery capability and planning and
community concerns.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that even if money and land were
available, given the long lead time required to provide the
facilities, public services would deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from various departments also explained the
serious impacts that the right of abode issue will exert on
sectors of housing, education, vocational training and retraining,
medical and health care as well as employment services and
transport.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Pledges to Win Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Zimbabwe African National
(Patriotic Front) will win the general elections scheduled for
next year, First Secretary of the party and President Robert
Mugabe has said.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that the party will win the next general
elections. I do not see any other party swinging itself into
power," the Herald newspaper Thursday quoted Mugabe as saying who
is on an eight-day working visit to China.
</P>
<P>
At a dinner hosted for him at the Zimbabwean Embassy to China
Wednesday, the president said that the ruling party is firmly in
power.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he was aware that the Zimbabwe Congress of the
Trade Union would soon announce the format of a new party.
</P>
<P>
Other "small" parties that have recently mushroomed would also
not make it during next year's elections, he said, adding that the
majority of the people still supported his ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also called on workers to desist from being
confrontational, but to negotiate peacefully for wage and salary
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
He said the current difficult economic situation required that
workers " understand" the situation and negotiate for increases in
a more humane manner.
</P>
<P>
This comes in the wake of threats by the union organization to
hold a sit-in on May 14 to force employers and the government to
award increases.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that workers need more money given the
situation, but this is not the manner in which things should be
handled," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the government is currently working on
various ways to improve the country's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the situation is expected to improve this
year.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Fires Rockets at Israeli Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's guerrilla group Hezbollah,
or Party of God, Thursday morning fired a number of Katyusha
rockets and motar bombs into the Israeli-occupied border zone.
</P>
<P>
A statement by Hezbollah said one of its groups unleashed
rockets and motar rounds at Israeli outposts at Ramieh and al
Abaid near Israel's northern border, setting the Ramieh outpost on
fire.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Voice of the People radio quoted witnesses as saying
that some of the rockets and bombs landed in north Israel, but
didn't cause casualties.
</P>
<P>
The group said the rocketing came as a response to Israeli air
raids on Lebanon's eastern city of Baalbek and villages in south
Lebanon on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, two Israeli warplanes fired missiles on a small
building adjacent to a mosque in Baalbek, injuring two Lebanese
civilians and at least three Hezbollah members, according to
security sources.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli campaign was a retaliation for Hezbollah's bomb
ambushes against Israeli and South Lebanon Army (SLA) forces in
the past two days, which killed an Israeli soldier and an SLA
officer, and injured four Israeli soldiers and two SLA militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah condemned the Israeli raid as a violation of a
cease-fire pact reached between the two sides in 1996, which
prohibited any attacks on civilians or from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israeli air forces Thursday morning
blasted villages and hills in the western sector of the border
zone, firing at least eight air-to-surface missiles on its
targets. There has been no immediate reports on casualties from
the raids.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces
and its ally South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<HEADLINE> 18-Million-yuan Patent Transfer in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Well-known Chinese painter Huang
Yongyu recently obtained 18 million yuan (2.17 million U.S.
dollars) for transferring his designing patent rights to a brewery,
the Wenhui Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based newspaper said this patent transfer was a
record for such a transaction in China.
</P>
<P>
Huang, who has enjoyed domestic and overseas recognition for a
long time, designed two unique bottles, one of which resembles a
clumsy linen bag, for two alcohol products made by the Xiangquan
Group, a brewery in Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The products, called Jiu Gui -- which means drunkard -- and
Xiangquan, instantly became very popular among drinkers.
</P>
<P>
Intellectual property rights specialists say that the
protection of these rights in China has been greatly improved, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> China Witnesses Increase of Popular Magazine Subscribers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China has been witnessing a marked
rise in the number of subscribers to popular prose magazines in
the first three months this year, after four major literary
magazines ceased publication.
</P>
<P>
Today's Guangming Daily reported that subscribers to China's
seven leading prose magazines including Selection of Prose,
Chinese Prose, and Prose, increased by around 25,000 copies in
their first season.
</P>
<P>
Editors-in-chief of the prose magazines believe that the rise
in subscription numbers is due to their magazines' focusing on
real life, and reform and changes in people's attitudes toward
money, work, and marriage.
</P>
<P>
They said these publications pay attention to issues of concern
to ordinary people and are without pretence.
</P>
<P>
They said most modern poetry cannot be understood by ordinary
people and some fiction seems self-centered, and that the popular
prose magazines are more readily acceptable to readers because of
their realistic content and elegant wording and phrasing.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Turns to Hitachi for Data Storage Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. announced
Wednesday it will resell high-end data storage products developed
by Hewlett-Packard and Hitachi Ltd of Japan, under the terms of a
three-year original equipment manufacturer (OEM) pact.
</P>
<P>
The pact, reached by the two computer equipment makers, also
provides Hewlett-Packard will add feature-enhancing software to
Hitachi's hardware.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard had relied on high-end storage products from
Hopkinton, Massachusetts-based EMC Corp., the world's top supplier
of such equipment, which counted Hewlett-Packard among its largest
customers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, sales of EMC equipment to Hewlett-Packard customers
totaled more than 700 million U.S. dollars. But analysts predict
that the new deal could shrink EMC revenues derived through
Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard officials said Wednesday that the company had
soured on EMC's "aging architecture," which did not provide the
features desired by its customers.
</P>
<P>
"To reach our goals (of 100 percent data availability), we
needed a high-end product with no single points of failure. We
believe the EMC (product) will not meet that criteria," a
spokeswoman of Hewlett-Packard said.
</P>
<P>
HP SureStore E Disk Array MC256, a new product created by
Hewlett-Packard and Hitachi, satisfies the needs in question, the
spokeswoman said, adding that the two companies will also
cooperate on the design and development of other storage software
projects for businesses.

<HEADLINE> Qatar to Begin Gas Talks With UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Qatar will soon initiate official
talks with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on the long-term supply
of natural gas from Qatar to the UAE, said local newspaper Gulf
News on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As negotiations between private oil and gas companies have been
deadlocked over prices, "we will now begin talks with the UAE
government for a speedy decision," a senior Qatari government
official was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We feel a government level intervention is very necessary at
this stage to finalize the deal," said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
For the past several years, more than five oil and gas
companies based in Doha have been making efforts to sign a deal
with Dubai on the supply of natural gas, but pricing has been a
major deterrent, the official disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"We need to hurry up and take a decision on the proposed
UAE-Qatar pipeline, which has been pending for a long time," the
official stressed.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Detects 16,287 Cases of Smuggling in Past Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese police have detected 16,287
cases of smuggling and commercial fraud, confiscating illegal
goods worth more than 573 billion Vietnamese dong (VND) (41.2
million U.S. dollars) over the past one year, Vietnam News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure was revealed at a conference in Hanoi on Wednesday
by Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security to review anti-smuggling
activities.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Vietnam's police discovered more than 13,000 cases
of smuggling and commercial fraud with confiscated goods worth
509.23 billion VND ( 36.4 million U.S. dollars). Tax and fines
from these cases reached 137.31 billion VND (nearly 10 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The number of cases of smuggling and commercial fraud and the
value of confiscated goods in 1998 rose 51 percent and 70 percent
respectively, compared to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hanoi's courts carried out 1,093 trials including 598 criminal
cases last April, or 281 and 125 cases, respectively, more than
March of the same year.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Hanoi People's Court performed 12 trials
relating to 13 drug-related criminals in the city's districts last
month.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Doctors Intensify Strike Over Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel's doctors Thursday
intensified their strike for salary increases, shutting most of
the nation's hospitals and clinics except for emergency services.
</P>
<P>
The strike was launched by the Israel Medical Assosiation (IMA)
on Monday to protest against the lack of progress in the
negotiations with the Finance Ministry over wage growth.
</P>
<P>
The doctors are trying to win a new contract that would update
their salaries, set in a 1994 contract that expired in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry claimed that, under the old contract, the
doctors enjoyed a 50 percent hike in real wages. The ministry
opposed a new contract, fearing this would set off an avalanche of
wage demands in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
Before the IMA decided to intensify the strike, its chairman
Yoram Blashar said on Wednesday that "despite all of our efforts
to reduce the suffering of the patients, the Finance Ministry has
left us no alternative but to again use the strike weapon."
</P>
<P>
Blashar also called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
intervene in order to break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Finance Ministry officials accused the
doctors of exploiting the coming May 17 general elections to
pressure the government into compromise.
</P>
<P>
Until now, politicians from all the parties have avoided
commenting on the strike.

<HEADLINE> 6,239 Filipino Rebels Surrendered in Four Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Exactly 6,239 rebels from the rebel
New People's Army (NPA) and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
have surrendered from 1995 to April 30, 1999, a ranking official
of the Philippine Armed Forces said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Nestor Castillo, commanding general of the Public
Affairs Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines said that
since 1995 to date, MILF rebels surrendered 1,907 firearms while
the NPA turned in 1,367 guns of assorted calibers.
</P>
<P>
Castillo said the Philippine government pays a certain amount
for every firearm surrendered, thus infusing some 100 million
pesos (2.5 million U.S. dollars) for the former rebels' livelihood
to start a new life.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, a rebel who surrenders his M-16 or M-14 assault
rifle is given 16,000 pesos (about 400 U.S. dollars) as his seed
money to start a small business. For a.30 caliber or M-60
machinegun surrendered it commands a price of 30,000 pesos (about
750 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Also during the four-year period, the NPA surrendered 321
explosives while the MILF yielded 170 pieces of explosives of
various types, he said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Hails Tourism Agreement With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Newly-appointed Tourism Minister
of New Zealand Lockwood Smith Thursday praised a new China-New
Zealand tourism agreement as a "big boost" to New Zealand's
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was signed in Beijing on Tuesday between
the New Zealand government and the National Tourism Administration
of China, gives New Zealand "approved destination status" for
self-funded Chinese visitors.
</P>
<P>
It allows designated tourist agencies in both countries that
have met agreed criteria to arrange group tours.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, Smith said that along with Australia, New
Zealand is "the first Western country to be accorded the
sought-after status."
</P>
<P>
"This agreement is a real achievement for tourism in New
Zealand and will allow the industry to develop a potentially huge
new market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that though it is difficult in a market as big as
China to estimate what the growth might be, within three years
tourism from China could be worth 60 million New Zealand dollars
(33 million U.S. dollars) a year to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Tourism Board has no presence in China's
mainland but its Hong Kong office markets New Zealand there.
According to an earlier official announcement, the New Zealand
Immigration Service will open a branch in Shanghai in July. The
opening of the branch will certainly help promote the New Zealand
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is New Zealand's biggest foreign exchange earner. In
the year ending Last June, it generated 4.4 billion New Zealand
dollars (2.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the only other countries China has granted
approved destination status to are Singapore, the Republic of
Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Currency Ties With U.S., Australia Overstated: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Finance Minister Bill
English noted here Thursday that arguments in favor of using the
U.S. dollar or the Australian dollar as New Zealand's currency are
"overstated and there are national identity issues at stake."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Wellington Chamber of Commerce,
the minister said that it is worth debating whether New Zealand
should have a common currency with Australia or the United States,
but economic arguments in favor of a common currency "are not that
clear cut."
</P>
<P>
A document of the New Zealand Treasury, which was disclosed a
few days ago, suggests New Zealand should consider entering a
monetary union with Australia or the United States. The paper says
the benefits of monetary union appear to be greater than
previously thought, and the costs much less. It says a monetary
union could substantially reduce New Zealand interest rates and
boost trade.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of the document has prompted in local media a
debate on whether New Zealand should adopt the U.S. dollar or the
Australian dollar despite of repeated statements of New Zealand
government officials that monetary union is not on the
government's agenda.
</P>
<P>
English said there is a view that adopting either the
Australian dollar or the American dollar would lead to less
currency volatility. "Yet the Australian dollar has been volatile
in the past decade and both it and the Kiwi (the New Zealand
currency) have been less volatile than the American dollar," he
said.
</P>
<P>
There is, however, an argument that adopting the American
dollar would, for instance, increase exporters' opportunities,
English said.
</P>
<P>
"If there were benefits there then we should look at them. But
we have to weigh up the other side of the ledger that a key
economic policy would be run from the Federal Reserve or, even
worse, from an unmentionable place across the Tasman (referring to
New Zealand)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the New Zealanders to think hard before
opting to join either the American or Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
If New Zealand decided to abandon the Kiwi and merge with
another currency then not only would someone else run New
Zealand's monetary policy, but they would also have an influence
on the government's fiscal policy, English said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to have a hard think before we go down that track," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Truth As Effective Cancer Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A person suffering from cancer is
better off knowing the facts about the disease, some experts
studying cancer say.
</P>
<P>
Cancer patients need to be aware of the situation and of future
possibilities with the disease to understand better how to deal
with it, some experts of the disease have told a seminar on cancer
treatment in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Doctors should tell the patient the facts and provide
psychological counseling to deal with their fears and even tap
their potential for improving immunity, one was quoted by today's
"Wenhui Daily".
</P>
<P>
Cancer claims the lives of 1.3 million Chinese every year and
many ordinary people simply equate the disease with death and many
cancer patients are often kept in the dark because doctors and
family members prefer to hide the truth so as not to add to the
patient's misery or to keep them from losing confidence.
</P>
<P>
But, the situation could be made worse in this way through
feelings of anger or loneliness or of having been cheated when the
patient finds out what has happened.
</P>
<P>
Telling the patient the truth and increasing communications
with the doctor may be a better way of helping the patient get out
from under the shadow of anxiety, depression, fear, anger, or even
despair.
</P>
<P>
Cancer is an illness that is affected by behavioral and
psychological factors and modifying the patient's behavior and
improving confidence are vital to medical treatment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company to Develop Music Download System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Universal, the world's largest
music company, Wednesday entered into a partnership with a
California-based software company to develop a system that would
allow customers to download music to their computers in a secure
format that prevents mass copying.
</P>
<P>
"We have to try and find out what the consumers want and what
they are willing to pay for," Larry Kenswil, head of electronic
commerce at Universal, said Wednesday. "One thing for sure is
people want to download music," he added.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say Universal's move underscores the music
industry's difficult search for a way to take advantage of the
Internet and, at the same time, curb piracy that cost companies
about 5 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
They say Universal's announcement is significant because it
marks the first attempt by a major music company to go digital.
The legitimate music market is worth about 40 billion dollars a
year and a report by Forrester Research said digital distribution
of music will be worth 1.1 billion dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Other technology companies, including Sony, Microsoft and IBM
are competing to develop secure systems for digital transmission
of songs.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture In Southern China Getting More Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors in China's
Guangdong Province have gradually shifted their focus to the
agriculture sector from industry and real estate.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the province's agriculture sector used 200 million U.S.
dollars worth of foreign investment. The sector has had annual
average growth of 25.3 percent since 1990, according to provincial
agriculture departments.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Guangdong's foreign investment mainly came from
Hong Kong and went to food processing, but more Taiwanese,
Southeast Asian, European, and American companies have been
putting investment into Guangdong's agriculture. In the past
decade, Guangdong imported equipment for processing vegetables,
livestock, poultry products, and fodder.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment went mainly to the Pearl River Delta from
1978 to 1988, but mountainous areas have now began attracting
foreign investors thanks to more rapid economic development and an
improved investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment contracts in mountainous areas now account
for 80 percent of the province's total foreign investment in
agriculture.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China National Oil and Gas Group's
Geophysics Office signed 38 million U.S. dollars worth of
exploration contracts in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaomu, the deputy head of the office, says that the
contracts are the result of China's improvements in technology
applied to oil exploration. "The world generally allows an error
rate of 5 percent in exploration work, but China has it down to 0.
2 percent," the geologist says.
</P>
<P>
This means that Chinese oil exploration teams can locate a 10-
meter-thick oil layer that is 5,000 meters deep, he explains. They
have developed seismic data collecting technology for the
oilfields in Tarim.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, China has located 300 oil wells in the
Tarim and has had a success rate in drilling of 47 percent, of 15
percentage points higher than the world average.
</P>
<P>
The country has sent nine teams to the United States, Sudan,
Iran, Peru and the Philippines.

WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Phil Jackson said he has talked
to Jordan Wednesday about the possibility of his former star
player buying part of the Charlotte Hornets and becoming an NBA
owner.
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Michael a couple of times about his chances about

hope that it works out for him," Jackson said.

The Chicago Bulls' former coach also mentioned the possibility

</P>
<P>
"We discussed that as kind of an outside possibility, but there
was really nothing concrete talked about," he said. "And I really
support the fact Paul Silas is a guy who deserves the chance, and
would be a good choice and has indeed proved to have done a good
job."
</P>
<P>
Silas, an assistant, became the interim coach when Dave Covens
resigned in early March. Jordan and current owner George Shinn
reportedly have agreed that if Jordan becomes co-owner of the
Hornets, Silas would be kept as coach.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Milwaukee Bucks forward Glenn
Robinson, the team's leading scorer who has missed the last two
games with a deep bruise in his right knee, was placed on the
injured list today.
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who averaged 18.7 points per game, will miss
tonight's regular-season finale against the New Jersey Nets but
hopefully be ready for the playoffs, which begin this weekend. The
Bucks 28-21) are in the playoffs for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Robinson joins teammates Dell Curry and Vinny Del Negro on the
injured list. Both guards also are expected to play in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
Robinson suffered the injury against Detroit on Friday as he
hyperextended his knee when Pistons forward Grant Hill fell on him.
He experienced no swelling and has a full range of motion but he
is unable to put full weight on the leg.
</P>
<P>
He did not travel with the team over the weekend and underwent
an MRI scan, which revealed nothing more than the bruise.
</P>
<P>
Curry, who leads the NBA in 3-point shooting at 47 percent, is
sidelined with lower back spasms. Del Negro went on the injured
list on Tuesday with an ankle sprain.

<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A leading archeologist said today
that Chinese scientists have now mastered most of the advanced
underwater archeology techniques that were introduced into the
country only ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, groups of underwater archeologists have been

Liaoning provinces and have discovered the remains of some dozen
sunken ships, as well as ancient chinaware and other relics which
were part of the ships' cargoes, according to Yu Weichao, curator
of the Museum of Chinese History.
</P>

Not long ago, an excavation team found over 1,500 cultural
relics in the South China Sea, including pottery, ironware and a
500-kg stone anchor dating back 1,000 years.

China began underwater explorations with a Sino-Japanese joint
expedition in the sea near Taishan in Guangdong Province ten years
ago, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, a group of Chinese archeologists, together with their
Australian counterparts, spotted another sunken ship which dated
back to the Song (960-1279) or Yuan (1271-1368) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
After underwater explorations near Changshan islands in the
Bohai Bay, archeologists now believed that a 4,000-year-old ship
lies somewhere beneath those waters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the remains of a warship were retrieved from the
water near the city of Xinhui, also in Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The cultural relics protection authorities have also launched
the longest and largest endeavor yet to search for another ship
and its cargo believed to have sunk some time during the Yuan
Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that roughly 3,000 sunken ships remain
buried in Chinese waters.
</P>
<P>
China has now formulated regulations to preserve its underwater
cultural relics and established its own research and excavation
center.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Museums Gain Popularity (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Large-scale national museums and
specialized ones in Beijing attracted a great number of domestic
and overseas visitors during the recently ended Labor Day holidays.
</P>
<P>
Museum specialists believe that Chinese people, who are trying
to improve their knowledge and scientific understanding, have
recently begun favoring cultural places such as museums and
libraries.
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Chinese History recently organized a series of
cultural relics exhibitions. Staff in the museum said that most of
their exhibitions aroused an enthusiastic response.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the huge number of visitors during the
latest holidays were far beyond their estimates.
</P>
<P>
The Museum of the Chinese Revolution last year launched an
exhibition marking the 100th anniversary of the late Premier Zhou
Enlai and many people kept as souvenirs the entrance tickets.
</P>
<P>
The dome-shaped China Science and Technology Museum is the
greatest attraction for young people and students. Its computer
labs are opened to the public free of charge four days a week and
visitors to the museum are even able to use interactive exhibits.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, young students in other cities visit the Beijing
Museum of Natural History, the China Science and Technology Museum
and Beijing Planetarium during their summer or winter vacations.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey organized by local cultural relics protection
authorities show that 60.13 percent of 3,825 surveyed Beijingers
show a great interest in visiting museums.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Sees Recovery in Thai Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Companies in Thailand's
manufacturing sector believe that the country is close to seeing
an economic recovery after a two-year recession, the latest World
Bank survey available Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 companies representing the country's leading
manufacturers including the garment, textile, electronics and food
sectors expect to see an increase in production and domestic
consumption in the near future, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 642 companies interviewed, 35 percent expected to
increase their production capacity and 22 percent expected a
decline in the first half of this year while the rest expected no
change.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis has brought a sharp decline in both
domestic and regional demand. Some 70 percent of the companies
questioned reported a fall in production levels during the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
The average capacity utilization decreased from 71 percent in
the first half of 1997 to 61 percent in the first half of 1998.
Higher costs for imported raw materials caused by the deflation of
the baht and a slump in domestic demand are the major problems.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Bank survey showed that private sector
confidence has been growing in the wake of the government's reform
measures, the stabilization of the baht, lower interest rates and
falling inflation, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
At present, local product manufacturers pointed out that credit
crunch remains a major barrier to full recovery.
</P>
<P>
To relieve the problems, the World Bank suggested that the Thai
government continue fiscal expansion, support small and
medium-sized enterprises, enhance credit expansion and further
carry out its financial reform package.

<HEADLINE> Thai Power Authority Says Y2K Problem Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Local power suppliers in Thailand
have claimed that they have the Y2K computer problem under
control, the Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Electricity bills would not be affected at the start of the new
year, the newspaper quoted the Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand (EGAT) as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the authority did not rule out the possibility of power
blackouts caused by factors other than computers, such as
short-circuits and fallen power poles.
</P>
<P>
EGAT will take a proactive approach in handling problems that
might stem from the millennium bug or any unexpected elements.
</P>
<P>
It would reserve production capacity of 700 megawatts on
January 1, 2000, which will be adequate to cover any shortages.
</P>
<P>
EGAT has been working on Y2K solutions for two years, with a
total budget of 814 million baht. Work was 85 percent complete and
the utility would be fully Y2K compliant by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
EGAT is confident that all the computer systems including those
related to electricity transmission and those handling electricity
bills and issuing receipts will not be affected.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Build Deep-Sea Port in Central Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has decided
to support investors to construct a deep-sea port in the central
province of Thua Thien-Hue to boost the central area's
socioeconomic development.
</P>
<P>
Last November, President and General Director of the U.S.-based
International Investment Corporation (SCOTT) Laurence Aflesworth
proposed to the Vietnamese authorities that the company develop
the Chan May deep-sea port project under the BOT
(Build-Operate-Transfer) form.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai has recently directed
the Ministry of Communications and Transport and the Thua
Thien-Hue Province People's Committee to create favorable
conditions for investors to construct the Chan May seaport, the
Vietnam News English daily said on Thursday,
</P>
<P>
The deep-sea port will cover 480 hectares on the East Chan May
peninsula which is near the central city of Da Nang. Its annual
cargo handling capacity is projected at 40 million tons, and the
facility will be designed to accommodate vessels of 60,000-70,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
Chan May Bay is one of the several sea gates to the South China
Sea and behind it is the trans-Indochina corridor. Vietnamese and
foreign experts say the bay's natural features make it an
excellent location for building a large deep-sea port to serve
trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's senior government officials regard the Chan May
project as vital to the socioeconomic development of Vietnam's
central coastal and Tay Nguyen regions as well as the entire
Mekong River Delta.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam needs an international transit port to facilitate
transportation of its cargo abroad," Vietnam News quoted Deputy
Minister of Communications and Transport Nguyen Viet Tien as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Tien said, "At present, foreign cargo shipped to Vietnam and
cargo shipped abroad from Vietnam sometimes requires transshipment
via another port."
</P>
<P>
According to experts, Vietnam annually disburses nearly 240
million U.S. dollars in transit fees for goods. That amount could
rise to 1 billion dollars over the next four years.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has taken
measures to check the outbreak of diarrhea which has so far killed
 162 people in the country's southern districts.
</P>
<P>
A total of 668 medical teams have been formed and four
temporary treatment centers set up to provide medical care to the
patients of the water-borne disease in the capital city of Dhaka
and six coastal districts, according to a report in Thursday's The
New Nation daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
There is an adequate stock of oral re-hydration saline,
intravenous fluid and antibiotics in government hospitals in the
affected areas and more drugs are being sent to boost the stock,
the report quoted sources at the Directorate of Health Services as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka-based International Center for Diarrhea Disease
Research, Bangladesh, popularly known here as cholera hospital,
has set up two temporary tents to accommodate the rising number of
patients and has increased the number of medical and nursing staff
to cope with the situation.

under the Barisal division while in Noakhali and Lakshmipur, two
districts under the southeastern Chittagong division, the disease
has killed 62 people and affected 5,000 others in the past one
month, reports said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Young People Finding Love On TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese are showing increased
interest in TV programs about courting.
</P>
<P>
Most of them follow the model of the Taiwan program "
Outstanding Men and Women". The most successful of the many
programs is a Hunan Star TV program that has two hosts who
encourage guests humorously to reveal their true feelings about
such interesting topics as "Is marriage the grave of love ?", or "
What will you do when your spouse commits adultery?"
</P>
<P>
Many guests on these programs are men chosen for their looks or
career success and attractive, gentle women, who are asked to
choose the person they like most, at the end of the program, and
then are left to their own devices.
</P>
<P>
Young people are looking for greater freedom to try to break
away from the out-moded methods of choosing a partner that their
parents used. But, choice is mainly limited to acquaintances,
colleagues, or classmates and many are too shy to tell others
about this.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the market economy has brought changes
and young people are becoming more open-minded and they are more
likely to choose someone they feel suits them even on the Internet
or at an agency.
</P>
<P>
Li Yinhe, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, says that the changes in this regard have reflected the
process of moving toward a modern marriage.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi TV was one of the first to put on programs about love.
That was in 1988. But, these programs gradually began losing their
novelty, mostly because they were dull, too practical, or lacked
romance.
</P>
<P>
The new programs that have been appearing over the last two
years combine romance with fun and reflect young people's stronger
belief in "love at first sight".
</P>
<P>
Lu Hong, a company employee in Beijing and a viewer of the
Hunan program, says that young people today are more confident
about themselves. "Love is no longer a mystery to them and that
they would rather go chase after love than to wait for it to come
to them some day," she says.
</P>
<P>
Programs like Beijing's "Tonight We Meet", Hebei's "Square of
Hearts", Shaanxi's "Fantastic Men and Women", Shanghai's "Saturday
Date", and Shandong's "Dating Today" have become regular features.

<P>
American crocodiles are in danger of extinction in Cuba and

Flamingoes, parrots, herons, pelicans, as well as iguanas,

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Reaffirms Protection of Ozone Layer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The result of a recent environmental
study shows that Indonesia is no producer or exporter of ozone
layer destroying substances (ODS), Assistant to the State Minister
for Environment Aca Sugandhy said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the consequence of the fact that Indonesia has ratified
the 1985 Vienna Convention (for the Protection of the Ozone Layer)
and the 1987 Montreal Protocol and their amendments by
Presidential Decree No. 23 of 1992," he said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international seminar on phasing out ODS in
Denpasar, capital of Bali Province, Aca said the ratification is
to protect the ozone layer, to gradually abolish the production of
ODS and to limit the use of ODS at national and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
He said protection of the capacity of the atmospheric ecosystem
including the ozone layer has now become a very important
environmental issue, both for Indonesia and other countries in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Therefore Indonesia also took part in the protection of the
layer whose chemical symbol is O3, as protector of humanity on
earth from direct ultra violet rays of the sun which may cause
skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere has a vital function for the entire system which
supports life on earth, he said, adding that the ozone layer which
exists some 25-46 kilometers above the earth's surface can also
protect the earth from global warming, he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about Indonesia's needs for various ODS-containing
substances such as those of the refrigeration and air-conditioning
industry, he said Indonesia has been importing these substances
merely at a rate of 0.03 kilogram per capita per annum, which is
very small compared with other countries accounting for more than
1 percent of world consumption.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the relatively very small ODS consumption per
capita per year, Indonesia is classified in the fifth position
under the Montreal Protocol which provides Indonesia with
facilities in abolishing ODS in 10 years, longer than the period
required of other countries, he added.

<HEADLINE> IFC Ties Up With Sri Lankan Company to Boost Factoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, has
tied up with a Sri Lankan company to expand export factoring
operations, the official Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that IFC will provide Lanka Orix Factors
Ltd. (LOFAC) a foreign currency loan of 1.5 million U.S. dollars
and invest a 15-percent stake in LOFAC's equity.
</P>
<P>
While the equity investment will help LOFAC to diversify
shareholdings, the loan will enable it to develop its export
factoring operations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Export factoring is considered an ideal financial service which
will enable exporters to cover risks and yet exploit opportunities
offered in international trade.
</P>
<P>
Export diversification is seen as the key to Sri Lanka's future
economic performance and export factoring has been shown worldwide
to be effective in assisting export-oriented entities to grow.
</P>
<P>
According to available figures, the international factoring
industry recorded a business volume of 530 billion dollars in
1998, up 17 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 50 countries with an established factoring
industry in which more than 700 companies operate.
</P>
<P>
LOFAC pioneered factoring in Sri Lanka in 1992. For the fiscal
year ending on March 31, 1999, it recorded a domestic business
volume of 2.8 billion rupees (40 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Its main services are providing funds against trade receivables
 and managing clients' receivable ledgers including credit control
and collections for domestic business.

<HEADLINE> 13 Provinces Suffer From Food Shortages in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Out of Indonesia's 27 provinces, 13
are facing food shortages, according to a report issued by the
office of the deputy for regional affairs of the National
Development Planning Board on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said five of 13 provinces have been categorized as
having "very poor food security" and in need of immediate
assistance. The provinces are Irian Jaya, Maluku, East Timor, East
Nusa Tenggara and Southeast Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
The report, in the form of questionnaires sent out to 4,028
district administrations in February, said 55 percent of the
districts in the five provinces have been categorized as having
"poor" and "very poor" food security, with Irian Jaya being the
worst.
</P>
<P>
Food security was gauged by indexing residents' purchasing
power, distribution and rice production per capita, according to
the report which was based on the response from 1,961 returned
questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
The government said last September that 17.1 million families
were facing food shortage nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The report also identified 16 provinces as facing education
problems, including high dropouts and non-schooling rates.
</P>

state of education in their districts and they are East Timor,
Central Kalimantan, East Nusa Tenggara, Irian Jaya and Aceh, the
report was quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Slovakia Discuss Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Slovakia agreed Wednesday
that nations directly participating in current bombings against
Yugoslavia should not be allowed to send troops to a planned
international peace-keeping mission in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and visiting Chairman of
Slovakia's National Council (the parliament) Jozef Migas made the
remark after their meeting here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma's Press Secretary Alexandr Martynenko said that during
their meeting, Kuchma and Migas stressed that a political solution
could be reached on the Kosovo crisis only when multinational
peace-keeping troops under the leadership of the U.N. Security
Council are stationed in Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, to guarantee
Yugoslavia's territorial integrity and an extensive autonomy in
Kosovo, NATO should stop its bombings while Yugoslavia withdraws
its troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma reiterated Ukraine's willingness to send its troops to
participate in the possible peace-keeping mission there.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Migas met his Ukrainian counterpart, Alexandr
Tkachenko. Addressing the Ukrainian parliament, Migas said
Slovakia and Ukraine should join their efforts to help Yugoslavia,
NATO and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
He said the current Kosovo crisis would not affect Slovakia's
relationship with NATO. Slovakia is, as always, making efforts to
seek membership of the 19-nation military bloc.
</P>
<P>
Tkachenko, however, said his parliament is to review Ukraine's
foreign and domestic policies in light of NATO's air strikes.
Since NATO's actions in Yugoslavia are aggressive in nature,
Ukraine's parliament passed a resolution in late April, demanding
a re-examination of the country's relations with NATO.
</P>
<P>
Migas arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit. Besides the
Kosovo crisis, he also discussed bilateral economic ties with
Ukrainian leaders.

<HEADLINE> China's Growing Demand For PVC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China will need more polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) in 1999, China Light Industry News reports.
</P>
<P>
PVC is used in the production of plastics and plastic sheeting
for agricultural use. Industry analysts predict a rise in PVC
demand because of the increased use of the sheeting.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of China's land contract system will encourage
farmers to increase input into agriculture, which will in turn
increase demand for agricultural materials, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
In addition, increased demand for housing in the wake of
China's housing reforms and increased housing loans are expected
to increase sales of plastic building materials, especially since
China has imposed a ban on logging for environmental protection
purposes.
</P>
<P>
China's PVC output has grown steadily but it falls short of
demand, with industry analysts estimating a shortfall of about 200,
000 to 400,000 tons each year.
</P>
<P>
PVC imports have been growing in recent years, with the price
on the international market remaining low because of the Asian
financial crisis, but smuggling of PVC has had a negative effect
on the market.

<HEADLINE> Breakthrough in Research in Fatal Horse Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have determined
the complete nucleotide sequence of equine infectious anemia (EIA),
a disease fatal to horses and similar to acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans.
</P>
<P>
The research was done by a four-member team from the National
Key Lab of Veterinary Biotechnology attached to northeast China's
Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences (CAAS).
</P>
<P>
Kong Xiangang, who heads the group, said they used total DNA
from donkey leukocyte attenuated (DLA) EIAV (equine infectious
anemia virus) infected cells and ribonucleic acid (RNA) from virus
in peripheral blood of donkey-adapted (D-A) EIAV infected donkey
as starting materials.
</P>
<P>
After the genes of proviral (or previous) DNA and virus RNA
were amplified by a special method called PCR and RT-PCR, they
were cloned and sequenced. The complete nucleotide sequences of
DLA EIAV DNA and D-A EIAV RNA were determined by comparison with
nucleotide sequences of other EIAV strains.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old Kong explained that the sequencing can help
mankind better understand the working mechanisms of EIAV. Kong
received his doctorate in molecular immunology from Tokyo
University in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese researcher believes that their achievement may shed
light on the designing of new and effective vaccines against AIDS,
and against other lenti-viruses suffered by animals.

<HEADLINE> China Has Great Potential In Container Shipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's container shipping industry
has seen speedy development over the past two decades and enjoyed
a 30 percent of growth in business annually since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed at a two-day seminar on China's container
shipping development strategy, which was sponsored by China
Institute of Navigation and China Shipowners' Association and
ended here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 150 shipping companies dealing with
container transport, which are equipped with more than 600 ships
and 300,000 TEU containers.
</P>
<P>
There are some 70 berths in the country designated for
container businesses, with combined annual handling capacity
amounting to more than 12 million TEUs.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai and Shenzhen ports are ranked among the world's
leading ports.
</P>
<P>
China's ports are now open to more than 140 sea routes with
overseas counterparts, with over 2,500 voyages available for each
month.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country's ports handled 13 million TEU containers,
a 21 percent rise on a yearly basis. As many as 280,000 TEU
containers were shipped across the Taiwan Straits last year.
</P>
<P>
Insiders says that country's fast economic growth has paved way
for the shipping industry and its container shipping sector is
geared up, partly owing to its manufactured goods' growing
contribution to the country's exports which account for 40 percent
of exports.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, China is to build 100 10,000-dwt
deep-water berths and adds 200 million tons to the handling
capacity of its ports. It will also further improve the laws on
container shipping, increase the use of high technology in the
sector and open wider the market for overseas container
transporters.

<HEADLINE> China to Reach 2000-Year Goal of IDD Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign health experts
said on Wednesday that China would be able to reach a national
goal of eliminating iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) before the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of Chinese citizens have access to iodized
salt, and the incidence rate of goiter, a common disease cause by
IDD, dropped to 10.86 percent last year from 24.43 percent in 1995,
Yin Dakui, vice-minister of health, was quoted by today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
"China has gone far in combating IDD, and its experiences could
be useful for other countries where IDD is a problem," Ray Yip, a
senior adviser with the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef),
said at a seminar on the iodine deficiency problem in China.
</P>
<P>
Yin Dakui attributed the progress to the extended promotion of
iodized salt, iodine supplements and publicity on IDD over the
past six years.
</P>
<P>
IDD can cause mental disabilities and result in miscarriage,
pre-mature birth and a lowering of intelligence in infants. IDD-
related problems have been reported throughout the country, and
over 80 percent of the nation's 10 million cases of mental
disability are a result of IDD, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1990-91, several United Nations agencies, including the
World Health Organization, Unicef and the UN Development Programme,
jointly launched a global campaign to wipe out IDD by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government committed itself in 1992 to eliminating
IDD domestically by 2000.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the supply of iodized salt, a major measure
to prevent IDD, China increased annual output of iodized salt to 6.
5 million tons last year, from 3.65 million tons in 1994, largely
meeting public demand for such salt.
</P>
<P>
However, the health officials acknowledged that many people in
poverty-stricken areas can not afford iodized salt, and the
smuggling and black market sale of non-iodized salt has also
affected its promotion in some places.

your motivation," he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will meet Malaysia on May 11 and China on May 12.

</P>
<P>
"We can't be over confident against Malaysia, but we'll loosen

<HEADLINE> China's Color TV Tube Producers Plan to Halt Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's leading color TV tube
manufacturers have called on the whole sector to suspend
production for a month in an effort to curb the continuous price
erosion, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from eight leading tube producers have made a
joint statement recently, saying that they had reached a consensus
to suspend production from May 30 to June 30 amidst the current
sluggish market.
</P>
<P>
The eight companies, including Rainbow Corp. and Beijing
Panasonic TV Tube Co., have also urged the government to stop
issuing licenses for color TV tube import.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ministry of Information Industry (MII), the
watchdog of the TV tube sector, said it was unaware of the
proposed suspension.
</P>
<P>
China's color TV tube industry, once fueled by the robust
growth of the TV industry, has overinvested in expanding
production capacity, causing the current oversupply in the market.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to take radical measures to prop up the
industry," said Tong Mingjing, an official with Shanghai Yongxing
Color TV Tube Manufacturing Corp.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is more likely to turn around after the one-
month suspension," Tong added.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts attributed the decision made manufacturers to
the recent round of price cuts in the color TV sector.
</P>
<P>
Changhong Electronics Group, the country's largest TV producer,
announced a price cut for all its products by nearly 10 percent
last month.
</P>
<P>
In response, Konka, TCL and Skyworth, three other leading TV
producers, immediately followed suit and started a price war.

<HEADLINE> Russia, NATO "Substantially" Closer on Kosovo Plan: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said here on Wednesday that Russia and NATO have moved closer on
the fundamental principles of a political settlement to the Kosovo
crisis despite remaining differences.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of recent measures, above all the active shuttle
diplomacy of special envoy (Chernomyrdin), we have succeeded in
moving closer on many principles of a political solution," Ivanov
told a joint press conference with his visiting Spanish
counterpart Abel Matutes, who made a brief visit to Moscow on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The principles include: to end violence in Kosovo and create
conditions for the return of refugees, to station an "
international entity" under the control of the United Nations, and
to provide financial help for the reconstruction of the region.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who is scheduled to travel to Bonn on Thursday for the
meeting of foreign ministers from the Group of Eight (G8)
countries, noted, however, that these principles need to be
substantiated. He said the acceptance of these principles would
pave the way for the political settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress in talks with NATO, which has been engaged
in a air war against Yugoslavia, Ivanov said differences remain.
</P>
<P>
"We still have differences which are significant, but this is
understandable as the situation has gone too far and the problems
we face are too complicated."
</P>
<P>
He appeared little optimistic about the outcome of Thursday's G
8 summit in Bonn, saying that Russia's differences with NATO were
unlikely to be solved at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to achieve certain steps forward in finding a
political solution. At the same time, I have to look at things
realistically and I don't feel great optimism in some kind of
breakthrough," he said.
</P>
<P>
Matutes said that Spain hoped to find a way to a political
settlement of the Kosovo conflict through the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Both foreign ministers said they only discussed the fundamental
principles of a political solution to the ongoing crisis in the
Balkans and did not touch upon the composition of the peacekeeping
forces to be deployed in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> China Warns Farmers Not to Use Unregistered Fertilizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers are warned not to
use unregistered fertilizers because they may cause economic
losses and threaten the safety of agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
"Some illegal vendors recently promoted, via mass media,
unregistered fertilizers as high-tech products, and under the
names of authoritative departments," Ministry of Agriculture
official Wang Jindeng was quoted as saying by the China Daily.
</P>
<P>
This caused chaos within fertilizer science research and
resulted in heavy losses to many enterprises and farmers, Wang, a
division director of the ministry, added.
</P>
<P>
The situation prompted the ministry to issue an urgent circular
over the weekend. It stressed fertilizer products, especially
bacterial manure, should be registered by the ministry before they
enter the market.
</P>
<P>
Bacterial manure, which is environmentally friendly and helps
improve quality of crops, has been used in China for nearly 50
years.
</P>
<P>
However, some bacterial manure contain pathogenic microbes,
which may cause the spread of diseases among animals, plants and
people in areas where they were applied, notes Ge Cheng, an
official with the ministry's Bacterial Manure Quality Inspection
Center.
</P>
<P>
The registration system is a key component in China's efforts
to prevent pathogenic microbes from endangering people's health
and harming agricultural and animal husbandry production, Ge said.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials are urging bacterial manure manufacturers,
and other fertilizer-related enterprises, to register their
products as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
said Wednesday that they will sponsor a committee to examine how
new flight data technology can improve aviation safety in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium on transportation recorders, NTSB Chairman Jim
Hall and FAA Administrator Jane Garvey said they are asking a
group of experts from industry and the government to form the
Future Flight Data Committee. The panel will look ahead to 2015
and beyond to see how new technologies can be used to collect and
use flight data.
</P>
<P>
The committee will draw members from U.S. and international
safety boards, manufacturers, flight crew organizations and
regulatory agencies. The group will be asked to submit a final
report by next spring.
</P>
<P>
Flight data collection technologies, such as flight data
recorders, known as black boxes, and cockpit voice recorders, are
key components in the investigation of aviation accidents and
incidents.
</P>
<P>
Quick-access data collection devices are also providing
information that air carriers are using to improve safety and make

<HEADLINE> Australian IOC Member Refuses to Quit Over Alleged Wrongdoings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Despite growing pressure for his
resignation over alleged wrongdoings, Australian International
Olympic Committee member Phil Coles said Thursday he will fight to
clear his name, refuting claims that he accepted bribes from Salt
Lake City bid Committee for the 2002 Winter Games and gave secret
Sydney bid documents to the U.S. city.
</P>
<P>
A pale and tired-looking Phil Coles said Thursday he had
refused to quit his International Olympic Committee (IOC) post
until he had looked his accusers in the face.
</P>
<P>
Coles, who is now the focal point of the news reports by
Australia's major newspapers and television broadcasting
corporations, said he could not easily throw away a life-long
dedication to the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to walk away until I look my accusers in the
face and say you were wrong," Coles said Thursday in a TV
interview with Australia's Nine Network.
</P>
<P>
"If I'm wrong, then I will have to go but I'm not wrong, I'm
not wrong."
</P>
<P>
He again reiterated his innocence over claims he gave
confidential Sydney bid information to Salt Lake City's bid
committee for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Coles said he had dedicated most of his life to the Olympic
movement.
</P>
<P>
"I've given the best part of my life to the Olympic movement,"
Coles said.
</P>
<P>
Sandy Hollway, chief executive of Sydney Organizing Committee
for 2000 Olympics Games, Wednesday joined a growing chorus of
demands for Coles to resign from the Sydney Games Organising
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Others included Olympics Minister Michael Knight and Australian
Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, saying the continued scandal
was affecting sponsorship for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
Coles said the physical and emotional toll had caused him to
lose nine kilograms in weight and suffer many sleepless nights.
</P>
<P>
"I will never be the same, my family will never be the same,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The vilification that I've suffered in the previous months ...
nobody could go through what I have and stay the same."
</P>
<P>
Coles' troubles began last year when he was found to have
accepted excess hospitality from the Salt Lake City Winter
Olympics bid committee.
</P>
<P>
He is yet to be cleared on claims he accepted over 6,600 U.S.
dollar worth of jewellery from a Greek businessman associated with
the Athens Olympic bid for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
His fate now rests with the IOC, which meets in Lausanne next
month.
</P>
<P>
Coles again denied claims he gave 400 pages of confidential
information to Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
"I did not send any documents to Salt Lake City. I've denied it
before and I do so again today," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I saw the documents for the first time yesterday. Most of them,
there were documents from governments, embassies and consuls, I
had never seen before."
</P>
<P>
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio said
Tuesday highly sensitive briefings from the Australian Department
of Foreign Affairs and notes by Coles had fallen into hands of
Salt Lake City of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The leaked documents included letters and cables from senior
diplomats at 23 foreign missions, with one offering to get around
rules on gifts to IOC members by having the embassy pay.

<HEADLINE> Wright Charged over Referee Rage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- England Premier League soccer club
West Ham striker Ian Wright was charged with misconduct by the
Football Association on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wright was alleged to have caused damage to the referee's
dressing room, following his sending off against Leeds on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The former England striker had to be restrained by team-mate
Trevor Sinclair after being dismissed by Robert Harris for two
bookable offences during his side's 5-1 home defeat on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wright's 16th minute red card sparked a flurry of sending offs,
with the Hammers finishing the game with only eight men on the
pitch.
</P>
<P>
Wright had earlier attempted to defuse the row by reportedly
apologising for his behaviour, insisting he cannot even remember
the incident which was due to a "stupid and reckless" brainstorm.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in The Sun newspaper, he said: "I was furious at being
sent off for only the second time in my career.
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed at being dismissed, at letting down my
manager Harry Redknapp, my team-mates and the West Ham fans by not
being on the pitch to help win the game and get us into Europe.
</P>
<P>
"I hope and pray to God that I can be forgiven for this stupid
and reckless act."
</P>
<P>
The FA, who acted after receiving a report from fourth official
David Elleray, will now consider what action to take against a
player who is no stranger to controversy.
</P>
<P>
While a suspension would seem to be the most likely outcome, a
large fine is also a possibility.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FA also separately charged Nottingham Forest
midfielder Carlton Palmer with misconduct following gestures which
he allegedly made to the crowd after his sending-off at Leeds on
April 3.

<HEADLINE> China-produced Milk Powder Not Selling Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's domestically produced milk
powder is not selling well, and stockpiles continue to increase,
though the country's dairy industry grows steadily, according to a
report in the Township Enterprise News.
</P>
<P>
The stockpiling began as early as 1993 and has been increasing
at an annual rate of 30 percent, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts attribute the stockpiling of milk powder to
the lack of promotion, and unsuitable types of the dairy products,
as well as the low quality of some products.
</P>
<P>
Competition from imported milk powder and smuggled powder milk
have also added to the stockpiling of China's milk powder, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The growth of China's dairy industry has been on a fast track
and there remains a huge potential for this market among the
country's vast population.
</P>
<P>
China's total milk output was 6.6 million tons in 1998, 5.6
times the 1980 figure. However, the annual per capita milk
consumption is only six kilograms, while the world average is 103
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
China's milk output accounts for only one percent of the
world's total, though the country's population is one-fifth of the
global population.
</P>
<P>
Market analysis points to expanding the market by nurturing the
habit of dairy-product consumption.

<HEADLINE> Violence Sparks New Security Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The English Premier League is set to
introduce new security methods to protect officials from irate
fans. The announcement comes after a spate of violence towards
referees, according to the BBC reports on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rob Harris, who sent off three West Ham players on Saturday,
allegedly had his car attacked by fans on his way home after the
game.
</P>
<P>
And Scottish referee Hugh Dallas had his home vandalised after
sending off a number of players during Rangers' title clincher
against Celtic on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The plans are likely to take the form of 'safe cars' -- which
would be used to ferry officials in and out of grounds.
</P>
<P>
Under the new measures, the referee, his two assistants and the
fourth official would meet at a hotel near the ground a few hours
before every Premiership match.
</P>
<P>
They would then be driven to the stadium in a secure vehicle
and returned to the hotel after the game to collect their cars.
</P>
<P>
Premier League referees' officer Philip Don confirmed an attack
had been made on Harris' car but stressed that problems with fans
attacking referees should not be overstated.
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the number of games played you can count on
one hand the incidents involving referees," Don said.
</P>
<P>
"The authorities are doing everything in their power to
alleviate any problems.
</P>
<P>
"There have been isolated incidents over the last two or three
years, but it is only a handful of people involved, a small
proportion. It is that proportion which grabs the headlines," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Don said the transporting of officials was still being
discussed, but the hope is that the new security measures will be
quickly approved by Premier League clubs.

Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in south China, has opened to
public in the city of Liuzhou.
</P>
<P>
There are over 5,000 rare birds, including 1,000 from Europe,
Africa and South America, living in the two-hectare park.
</P>
<P>
Just like walking in a natural forest, visitors can view these
birds sashaying and flying freely in the "Bird World" covered by a
28-meter-net, and people also have a chance to enjoy feeding the
birds.
</P>
<P>
Children are the happiest flock here. Their laughter can be
heard everywhere in the park, especially while playing with the
swans or watching the parrots perform.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government invested four million yuan (
about 482,000 U.S. dollars) to build the park, said Liu Baili,
head of the Liuzhou City Bureau of Gardens and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
The birds in the park can be divided into 150 species, the
official said, and the park will be built into a center for the
birds' domestication, protection, and breeding.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Supports Palestinian Aspirations for Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton has
writted to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that he supported the
aspirations of the Palestinian right to determine their future on
their own land."
</P>
<P>
The letter, sent last week but available only on Wednesday,
shows Clinton's incremental shift toward recognition of
Palestinian hopes for statehood and is certain to boost
Palestinian hopes for U.S. support on that goal.
</P>
<P>
The wording goes one step beyond what Clinton said when he
visited Gaza last December on what was widely seen as tantamount to
a state visit to the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
What Clinton said in Gaza was: "For the first time in the
history of the Palestinian movement, the Palestinian people and
their elected representatives now have a chance to determine their
own destiny on their own land."
</P>
<P>
This time, Clinton said in the letter: "In the spirit of my
remarks in Gaza, we support the aspirations of the Palestinian
people to determine their own future on their own land."
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Clinton also criticized Israeli practices in the
West Bank. He said: "The United States knows how destructive
settlement activities, land confiscations, and house demolitions
are to the pursuit of Palestinian-Israeli peace."
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, we will continue to exert maximum efforts to
have both parties avoid unilateral steps or actions designed to
change the status of the West Bank and Gaza or the prejudice or
preempt issues reserved for permanent status negotiations,"
Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
The thrust of Clinton's letter was in line with the initiative
announced by the White House last week to avert a crisis on May 4,
the deadline for completing talks on a settlement of
Israeli-Palestinian disputes, as stipulated in the Oslo interim
accord.
</P>
<P>
The United States proposed that talks resume when a new Israeli
government takes office after upcoming elections on May 17 and
that the two sides reach an agreement within about one year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton qualified his support for Palestinian aspirations by
saying that Arafat should rely on negotiations to achieve them, in
effect giving Israel a veto over the outcome.
</P>
<P>
"I am asking that you continue to rely on the peace process
as they way to fulfil the aspirations of your people. Indeed,
negotiations are the only realistic way to fulfil those
aspirations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also pledged to press Israel to carry out another
withdrawal from the West Bank, as agreed in the Wye agreement that
he mediated last October.
</P>
<P>
Israeli ambassador to Washington Zalman Shoval, said "the most
important message" in the letter was that any decision on
statehood had to be reached through negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The letter is a total denial of unilateral actions on the
part of the Palestinians," he said.

<HEADLINE> (Update)Indonesia, Portugal Sign Pacts on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas and his Portuguese counterpart Jaime Gama signed a set
of documents here Wednesday on the August 8 poll to determine the
future of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The documents were also signed by United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan who said "this is a historic moment"
and that the foreign ministers "have shown an exemplary spirit of
cooperation and statesmanship".
</P>
<P>
The accords signed include an autonomy package proposed by
Indonesia and security arrangements and procedures for the
U.N-organized vote.
</P>
<P>
A 58-article Constitutional Framework for a Special Autonomy
for East Timor provides that Indonesia will have responsibility
for the foreign affairs of the Special Autonomous Region of East
Timor (SARET).
</P>
<P>
"For such purpose, the Indonesian armed forces shall maintain a
military presence in the SARET in the context of defending and
safeguarding the external security of the SARET", the document
said.
</P>
<P>
It said SARET will be part of the Indonesian monetary and
customs unit subject to national monetary and fiscal policies and
laws and regulations of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The pact covering the security arrangements for the peaceful
poll charges all parties with ensuring the laying down of arms and
taking measures for disarmament prior to and following the poll.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the modalities for direct ballot to decide
whether the East Timorese accept or reject the proposed autonomy,
provides that it will be observed by Indonesia and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Both countries are entitled to send an equal number of
representatives to observe all the voting process.
</P>
<P>
The pact requests Indonesia to ensure a secure environment for
a free and fair popular consultation process and to be responsible
for the security of U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
A number of U.N. security guards will be deployed to ensure the
security and safety of U.N. personnel and a number of
international civilian police will be available in East Timor to
advise the Indonesian police during the process.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of 800,000 and area of over
18,800 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975
when a civil rift induced Indonesian occupation. In 1976, it
became a province of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has since been seeking a "just and comprehensive"
solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Indonesia and Portugal under the U.N.
auspices have been intensified since last year. In January this
year, Indonesia said if East Timorese reject the autonomy
proposal, it would allow the territory to become independent.
</P>
<P>
The latest talks have made progress and on April 23, the
negotiating parties decided that a popular consultation on the
future of the territory through direct ballot be conducted on
August 8 and the final agreements on the poll be signed on May 5.

<HEADLINE> Rugova's Arrival in Italy Refutes Rumors of His Detain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Ibrahim Rugova, the top moderate ethnic
Albanian leader from Kosovo, held talks with Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini here
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of Rugova and his family Wednesday afternoon in
Italy refuted rumors of his arrest by Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Wednesday evening from Italian premier's
office said that "during the long and cordial" talks, Rugova,
D'Alema and Dini reviewed the step-by-step developments of the
crisis in Kosovo and examined the possibilities for a
political-diplomatic solution to the ongoing conflict to which
Rugova can contribute as a free man.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not reveal other details of talks between
Rugova and Italian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Italian government sources said to Italian news agency ANSA
that Rugova did not carry any messages nor does he have any
specific plans to resolve the crisis in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government said that Rugova who want to seek a
diplomatic solution to the war in the Balkans made request to come
to Italy acting as a free agent in politics.
</P>
<P>
Observers here described Rugova's arrival in Rome as "a clear,
very significant signal" from Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic who released three captured American servicemen three
days ago.
</P>
<P>
In the initial days after the NATO bombings began, Rugova was
shown on Yugoslav television meeting with Milosevic in an apparent
effort at negotiations. Later reports from Western media indicated
that Rugova was being held under house arrest by the Yugoslav
government.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade's ambassador to Rome, Muigrad Lekic, issued a
statement Wednesday saying that Rugova's arrival in Italy was
evidence that he had not been held prisoner nor hostage.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the moderate Albanian Kosovar, Lekic said that
"is very important because it shed light on an affair which has
had diverse phases," adding that it offers an occasion for Italian
diplomacy to achieve positive results for the crisis over Kosovo
and "not only because Italy is considered a friend of Balkan
countries."
</P>
<P>
Albania's ambassador to Italy, Leontiev Cuci, expressed his
hope that Rugova came to Rome with a mandate to negotiate also on
behalf of the Kosovo Liberation Army, he added that he would be
interested to meet with him here but only if this was approved by
all Kosovar political forces.

<HEADLINE> Fed Reports Improvement in U.S. Manufacturing Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. manufacturing is improving
in most parts of the country as jobs remain plentiful and U.S.
consumers continue to spend briskly, the Federal Reserve said in
its latest "Beige Book" report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. economy continues to operate at generally strong
levels and to expand at a moderate pace," the Fed said in its
survey of regional economic conditions before April 26.
</P>
<P>
It said inflation, though feared, has not materialized, and
prices generally remain stable. The compilation of anecdotal
information is collected by the Fed's 12 regional banks for the
benefit of Fed policy-makers who are scheduled to meet next on May
18.
</P>
<P>
The report said "Most districts report recent improvement in
the manufacturing sector." Only one persisting weak spot was
identified by the Atlanta bank: Apparel production and orders
remain low because of "fierce foreign competition".
</P>
<P>
The Fed said with unemployment remaining at a 29-year low, many
parts of the country are experiencing labor shortages. Shortages
of truck drivers have slowed shipping growth in Atlanta, St. Louis
and Chicago. The Atlanta and Dallas banks said their regions are
short of construction workers.
</P>
<P>
However, "there were no reports of significant pickup in wage
increases," which can be an early warning sign that inflationary
pressure are building, said the Fed. Instead, some companies are
improving their benefits and offering hiring and retention
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, confident consumers are spending more than
they did at this time last year. The Philadelphia bank said sales
of sports and luxury cars increased. And demand is strong for
sports utility vehicles, the Dallas bank said.
</P>
<P>
The report said home sales and residential construction remain
strong. Commercial building projects are also continuing at a good
clip, although some areas, including Atlanta, reported some
slowdown. It said rising prices for building materials were an
exception to low inflation, along with oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
But farmers are still being hurt by low international commodity
prices, the Fed concluded.
