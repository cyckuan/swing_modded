<HEADLINE> Germany, Ukraine Hold 1st High-Level Gov't Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma launched here Friday a mechanism
of regular high-level government consultations between the two
countries in a bid to strengthen bilateral contacts and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the talks, which also involved government
ministers from both sides, Kuchma described the start of the
bilateral consultations as "a historic event" and "a convincing
proof of the dynamic and sustained development of the relations
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
According to Kuchma, Ukraine's efforts to seek closer links
with the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) as well as its current reforms were among the
key issues that have been discussed during the talks.
</P>
<P>
"To deepen cooperation with the EU and NATO is and will remain
a strategic goal of Ukraine," Kuchma said. "The map of a unified
Europe in the 21st century would be incomplete without such an
important part like Ukraine."
</P>
<P>
Kohl Friday also stressed the importance of closer ties between
Ukraine and the two Western organizations. However, he cautioned
against unrealistic expectations on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The links between Ukraine and NATO had to be pursued "step by
step and in a pragmatic manner," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
On Ukraine's relations with the EU, Kohl also refused to be
specific about any timetable.
</P>
<P>
"Our long-term expectation is that the relations between the EU
and Ukraine will develop intensively towards an associated
partership," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders Friday also expressed support for a possible
Russian-Ukrainian-German project to build a large military
transport plane based on the prototype of Antonov 70 jointly
developed by Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said he hoped that the decision on Germany's participation
in the project would be made next year after a feasibility study.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the bilateral talks, the two countries also
signed an agreement Friday under which Germany will grant Ukraine
30 million marks (17 million U.S. dollars) in loans to help
promote the country's small and medium-sized companies.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Output Decreases in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Industrial output in the first
four months of this year was smaller than that in the same period
of 1997, the National Statistics Board of Romania said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The monthly average industrial output over January 1-April 30
was by some 12 percent smaller than in the same period of 1997.
The gradual increases on the first term peaked by 9.6 percent in
March against February, but were lagging at the beginning of the
second term, with the output decreasing by 8.7 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of the volume was visible in almost all the
industrial branches, with the peak being registered in textiles
with a 26.9 percent drop, and in the manufacturing, transportation
and distribution of electric power, gas and hot water with a 27
percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
As compared with the same months of 1997, industrial output
registered minuses in each of the first four months of 1998,
ranging between 19.8 percent in January and 7.8 percent in March,
with metallurgy being the only branch which overcame, each month,
the previous year's output.

<HEADLINE> London to Remain Europe's Financial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- London's position as the financial
center of Europe will not be affected by Britain's absence from
the first wave of membership of European economic and monetary
union (EMU), the Financial Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a survey of foreign banks by the London Chamber of
Commerce (LCC), the newspaper said that of the 100 banks surveyed,
23 percent said they would consider relocating to another European
city, down from 28 percent three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"London's inherent strengths are more than sufficient to
overcome any problems caused by the UK's non-participation in the
single currency," said Simon Sperryn, chief executive of the LCC.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey said that if Britain remains outside EMU in
the long term, it will affect the attraction of London.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are concerns over the city's rising rents and
the transport system.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found concerns that London's regulatory
structure is too fragmented, too complicated, has too many
overlapping responsibilities and is too bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the London International Financial Futures
and Options Exchange lost its dominant position in German
government bond futures to the Deutsche Terminborse earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
All this has led to further concerns that London's position
will increasingly come under threat after the launch of the euro
in 1999.

ALMA ATA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh Foreign Minister
Kasymzhomart Tokayev Friday stressed the importance of his
country's cooperation with NATO in maintaining security in Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The development of cooperation with NATO, especially within the
framework of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), was an
important aspect of Kazakhstan's foreign policy, Tokayev said
while addressing the EAPC meeting in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
He said greater cooperation with the EAPC, the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union
was also important to Kazakhstan in its ongoing economic reforms,
the KazTAg-TASS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan needed to cooperate with NATO in order to reform its
military forces, he added.
</P>
<P>
Central Asia was unstable due to many factors which could
escalate tensions in the region, Tokayev said, referring to the
situations in Afghanistan and in Tajikistan as well as the crisis
caused by India's nuclear tests.

<HEADLINE> U.S. World Cup Team Hit by Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The American squad has been hit
by injuries during it's tune-up for Saturday's exhibition game
against Scotland -- the last game before it heads to France for
the World Cup soccer finals.
</P>
<P>
At least two regular starters of the lineup will be missing the
battle. Eric Wynalda, the top U.S. forward, will stay on the
bench for the second straight week as he builds back his left knee
follwoing arthroscopic surgery on April 16.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Frankie Hejduk is unable to play because of a
hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is the first measuring stick to see where we are,"
said midfielder Tab Ramos, coming off reconstructive knee
injury. "I think this is a very good match, very World Cup-like."
</P>
<P>
With Wynalda tamed on the bench, U.S. coach Steve Sampson said
he had to rely on the 34-year-old Roy Wegerle on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I think Roy has played very well all week long. He's played
very hard."
</P>
<P>
Because of the injury to Wynalda and Brian McBride's failure
to seize scoring opportunities against Macedonia two weeks ago,
Wegerle, who had three operations and wound up as a second-half
substitute in all four of the American's games, has re-emerged.
</P>
<P>
Wynalda, the ace scorer of the team, is stillthe favorite to
start when the U.S. team faces Germany on June 15 in Paris in its
opening game at the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Sampson said he is unlikely to add Roy Lassiter to the roster
in place of No. 3 goalkeeper Juergen Sommer. Lassiter, out of the
lineup last month, has six goals in six games.
</P>
<P>
Hejduk, who missed the previous two games due to a hamstring
injury, took part in the training session Thursday. Sampson hopes
to see him to recover quickly. The deadline for submitting World
Cup rosters to FIFA is Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sampson said injuries to midfielders Chad Deering, Brian
Maisonneuve and Claudio Reyna were minor and all three were
available for Saturday's fight.
</P>
<P>
Scotland is expected to start the 39-year-old goalkeeper Jim
Leighton, who played in the past three World Cups.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Central Asian leaders agree that a
structural reform of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
is needed to fully exploit its potential, visiting CIS Executive
Secretary Boris Berezovsky said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky made the remark after meeting with Kazakh President
Nursultan Nazarbayev, who he described as the most determined
supporter and a key figure of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
A group of experts from CIS nations will work on the proposal
from the Kazakh leader to establish a united economic sphere in
the CIS, Berezovsky said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal will then be submitted to the CIS head of
governments' meeting for discussion and finally be signed at the
CIS summit, he said.
</P>
<P>
On his ongoing Central Asian tour visits, Berezovsky said the
leaders of these countries agreed to seek new means of economic
cooperation with the recognition that the problems their countries
face have to be resolved through their joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the CIS resolutions and agreements must
be monitored so as to give full play to these documents, he said.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky, who was appointed executive secretary on April 29,
at the CIS summit in Moscow, came here Friday in his Central Asian
tour to discuss CIS issues with the leaders of these countries.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Takes Measures to Reduce Traffic Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Tough measures are being introduced
in Cyprus as from Friday with the aim to reduce traffic accidents
after six road deaths in a week.
</P>
<P>
At an emergency meeting held at the Police Headquarters here
Thursday, Police Chief Panicos Hadjiloizou, prompted by the recent
surge of fatal accidents, announced that new measures will be
implemented soon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the police traffic department will be reinforced
and hidden cameras will be installed to catch motorists who speed
or ignore red lights.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include the so-called points system, in which
penalty points are added to offenders' licenses, adding up
eventually to a driving ban, a doubling of on-the-spot fines for
traffic offenses from 50 to 100 Cyprus pounds (100 to 200
U.S. dollars) and a reduction in the maximum blood-alcohol level
for drivers.
</P>
<P>
Anyone on two wheels - including pedal cyclists - will now have
to wear a helmet. Anyone failing to use protective headgear or
refusing to use a seat belt, faces a doubled fine of 30 Cyprus
pounds (60 U.S. dollars) instead of 15 pounds (30 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Professional drivers will not be allowed to drink any alcohol
at all before taking to the roads.
</P>
<P>
Hadjiloizou said police have booked more than 60,000 motorists
for various traffic violations since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
There have been 43 deaths in 38 road accidents so far this
year, compared with 34 fatalities in 28 accidents in the same
period last year, the Police chief added, calling on all to do
their bit to reduce fatal accidents this year by at least 10
percent.

<HEADLINE> Russian Government Plans to Stabilize Financial Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government vowed Friday
to collect more tax arrears and cut spending in what it called
"immediate acts" to stabilize the financial market.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement reported by the ITAR-TASS news agency,
the measures also include shortened bankruptcy proceedings against
companies unable to clear tax debts.
</P>
<P>
"The situation on the Russian financial market dramatically
deteriorated over the past few weeks, which may have rather
negative consequences for the economy in general," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is going to collect by late June "not less than
five billion rubles (about 833 million U.S. dollars) in arrears on
taxes to the federal budget," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Oil exporting companies that fail to pay state taxes could be
denied access to oil export pipelines as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
Plans have also been made for the sell-offs of 10 large
state-owned companies, including Rosneft, Slavneft, Sibur, LUKoil
and Svyazinvest.
</P>
<P>
Spending of the 1998 budget will be slashed by 42 percent by
shortening the list of direct recipients of budget allocations by
29 percent.
</P>
<P>
Limits will be imposed on heat and electricity consumption by
budget-financed organizations to save 30 percent of heat and
energy supply.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the government will decree a shorter list of
installations due to the planned cut-offs of the heat and
electricity supply.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Appoints New Head of State Tax Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Friday appointed Boris Fyodorov to replace Alexander Pochinok as
director of the State Tax Service.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by presidential spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky following a meeting between Yeltsin and Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for Pochinok's sacking.
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov, 40, graduated from the Moscow Financial Institute in
1980 and has a doctorate of science degree in economics.
</P>
<P>
He was on the staff of the Main Currency Board of USSR Gosbank
in 1980-1987 and with the Institute of the World Economy and
International Relations in 1987-1989.
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov was deputy prime minister in the Viktor Chernomyrdin
government since December 23, 1992, and finance minister since
March 1993.
</P>
<P>
He was elected to the Russian State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, on December 12, 1993, and was relieved from the duties
of deputy prime minister in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
As the country grapples with the financial crisis, more
personnel changes are expected. The Provisional Emergency
Commission for Tightening Fiscal and Budget Discipline convened
Friday to discuss personnel issues, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The session may provide additional material for a scheduled
meeting between Yeltsin and the heads of law enforcement and tax
agencies, Yastrzhembsky added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, originally scheduled for Friday, was postponed for
June 2. Another meeting between Yeltsin and representatives of the
country's financial sectors was also put off.
</P>
<P>
"The president's schedule for this week was determined by
pressing issues," Yastrzhembsky said.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Diplomat Clears Romania's Suspicion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The new Hungarian government
moved to reassure neighboring Romania that it will continue to
improve relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Viktor Orban, leader of Hungary's
Federation of Young Democrats (FYD), which won the recent
parliamentary elections, was reported as saying that he intended
defending the rights of Hungarian minorities in neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
Szocs Ferenc, Hungary's ambassador in Bucharest, moved to
smooth things over on Thursday during a meeting between Romanian
Prime Minister Radu Vasile and visiting Hungarian Chief of the
General Staff Ferenc Vegh.
</P>
<P>
Reports on Friday said that the Romanian prime minister had
asked the Hungarian diplomat at the meeting to clear up some
assertions made by Orban in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Orban was quoted as saying in the interview published by
Austrian newspaper that Romania should work out "a new law of
education in the Hungarian language."
</P>
<P>
He said he intended to defend the rights of Hungarian
minorities in neighboring states, which, in his eyes, had not been
secured by agreements signed between the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Ferenc, however, told Prime Minister Vasile that
there was no such interview at all, adding that the FYD did not
take responsibility for the truthfulness of the report.
</P>
<P>
Vasile said the clarification by the Hungarian diplomat
"removes any suspicion in view of the new government line-up" in
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Romania paid great importance to developing a cooperative
relationship with Hungary, the prime minister said, hoping that
the change in the Hungarian government would not affect the
further development of bilateral ties.

MOSCOW, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
praised the government for stabilizing the country's financial
markets, the Interfax news agency report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said, "It was the government action on Thursday that
brought the situation under control."
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the Local Self-Government Council, Yeltsin said
the country now had to tackle various problems such as miners'
strikes, the difficult implementation of the budget and spring
floods.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is at such critical times that the authorities are
tested for strength, maturity and ability to act."

All officials should end their lethargy and get down to work,
the president said.

<HEADLINE> New S. African Defense Force Chief woos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- New National Defense Force
(SANDF) chief General Siphiwe Nyanda said Friday it would be
tragic if white South Africans, particularly Afrikaners, were to
feel they were no longer important in the defense force.
</P>
<P>
Assuming command at a parade in Pretoria, Nyanda, 48, a black
ex-guerrilla, said Affirmative action in the defense force should
not result in an exodus of whites.
</P>
<P>
He was a hero of the black struggle against South Africa's
former white-minority regime, heading up Nelson Mandela's
umkhonto we sizwe (spear of the nation) guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
"As we accelerate the affirmative action program, we need to
ensure that we manage it in such a way that its long-term effects
do not result in an exodus of other nationalities, or in an
impression among black members that they alone should look to the
future of leadership in the SANDF," Nyanda said.
</P>
<P>
Once past imbalances had been redressed, a policy of
appointment strictly on merit should be vigorously pursued,
said Nyanda, who new replaces disgraced white armed forces
chief General Georg Meiring.
</P>
<P>
However, Nyanda noted black members had every reason to be
optimistic about the future. The government's policy of equal
opportunity and affirmative action would be carried out closely.
</P>
<P>
Nyanda, who was chief of staff, became new SANDF chief after
General Meiring retired in the wake of a flawed military
intelligence report of an alleged coup plot against the
government, according to South African Press Association (SAPA).
</P>
<P>
South African President Mandela attended the change of
command parade, also in his capacity as commander-in-chief of
the SANDF.

<HEADLINE> French National Assembly Recognizes Armenian Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- France has taken the first step to
formally recognize Turkey's genocide of Armenians in 1915.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly (lower house) of France on Friday adopted
a bill to recognize the "Armenian genocide of 1915." The bill must
now be passed by the Senate (upper house).
</P>
<P>
"The government took note of the political intention of the
parliament," said State Secretary for Retired Soldiers Jean-Pierre
Masseret. "The government can feel the depth of these feelings."
</P>
<P>
Armenians claim up to one million were massacred by Ottoman
Turkish troops when they were forcibly resettled from their homes
in Anatolia to the Syrian desert. But Turkey says 300,000 died.
</P>
<P>
Turkey on Thursday warned that France's recognition of the
"Armenian genocide" would carry "unfortunate consequences" for
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
France has never fully recognized the massacre of Armenians as
a "genocide," although former President Francois Mitterrand once
said personally that what the Turkish troops did in 1915 was
undoubtedly a genocide.

<HEADLINE> Hungary's Future Gov't to Observe Romanian-Hungarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The future Hungarian government
will observe the Romanian-Hungarian Basic Treaty and will continue
to develop bilateral cooperation, Hungarian ambassador to
Bucharest Szocs Ferenc reaffirmed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
While attending the inauguration of a Romanian-Hungarian
program for young political leaders, he said the cooperation
between the two countries will continue in fields other than those
included in the treaty and Hungary will also back up Romania's
efforts for the integration with the Euro-Atlantic structures.
</P>
<P>
Szocs Ferenc made the same statement at the Thursday meeting
between Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile and chief of the
General Staff of Hungary Ferenc Vegh visiting here.
</P>
<P>
Radu Vasile expressed the hope for clearing up with the
Hungarian diplomat some assertions in the interview by Viktor
Orban, possible candidate for the office of Hungary's prime
minister, reported Rompres news agency.
</P>
<P>
According to France Press which quoted an interview published
in an Austrian newspaper, Viktor Orban, leader of the winning
Federation of Young Democrats in Hungary's elections, said Romania
should work out "a new law of the education in the Hungarian
language" and he had the intention to defend the rights of
Hungarian minorities in neighboring states because the agreements
that had been signed in this field did not take into account their
main issues.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian ambassador said there was no such interview and
the Austrian newspaper combined two statements by Viktor Orban,
one statement made by him in the election campaign and a second
one granted to an economic newspaper. Therefore, the federation
does not take the responsibility for the truthfulness of the
interview that had been translated several times and had lost its
meaning, the Hungarian ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Radu Vasile said then that the statement by the Hungarian
official "removes any suspicion in view of the new government
line-up."
</P>
<P>
"The Romanian-Hungarian relationships are a paramount of
collaboration relations between two neighboring countries and
Romania placed much consideration on these relations," the
Romanian prime minister said. "We do hope that the change in the
government in Hungary will further develop the links between our
two countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> LSE to Review Electronic Trading System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The London Stock Exchange (LSE) will
conduct extensive revisions of its electronic trading system in an
effort to improve its efficiency, national newspapers reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The LSE, the largest in Europe, introduced the new automated
share-dealing system last October. After seven months of
operation, it was regarded by critics as seriously flawed, and
only less than a third of the value of all trades in FTSE 100
companies takes place on the system.
</P>
<P>
The exchange announced a four-phase program to improve the
system. The first step, which is to remove minimum order sizes and
increase maximum trades, will be introduced in just over a week.
This will allow more small investors to use the system.
</P>
<P>
Then, the exchange will align in July the close of its
electronic trading day with that of the London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange, and will delay the opening
until 9 am in an effort to minimize market manipulation.
</P>
<P>
This will be followed in December by the introduction of
volume-weighted average prices in order to address the problem of
discrepancies over closing prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the exchange will look into alternatives to the 20
percent price-movement rule for suspending shares.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: NATO Decides to Aid Albania, Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) agreed Friday to launch aid
programs for Albania and Macedonia to prevent the Kosovo crisis
spreading.
</P>
<P>
The programs include a military exercise involving ground and
air forces in Albania in August and a military drill in Macedonia
in September, and the establishment of a Partnership for Peace
(PfP) liaison in Albania's capital, Tirana.
</P>
<P>
Both Albania and Macedonia are members of PfP, a program
founded by the 16-member NATO largely aimed at promoting links
with the former Warsaw Pact countries.
</P>
<P>
A warship from NATO's Mediterranean Standing Force was
authorized to make a port call at Durres in early July and the
measures were hailed as a sign of NATO display of PfP solidarity.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials expressed deep concern over the situation in
Kosovo and deplored the continuing use of violence in suppressing
political dissent or in pursuit of political change.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been running high in Kosovo since February when
Serbian police clashed with ethnic Albanians who make up 90
percent population of the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have been seeking independence from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed the Kosovo crisis could best be resolved
through open and unconditional dialogue between the Yugoslavian
authorities and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leadership.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance, meantime, admitted it was not
quite ready for deployment in Albania, but detailed deployment
plans could be worked out within weeks.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official said the NATO Military Committee, the
alliance's highest military authority, was given the mandate a
month ago to make detailed studies for options to send NATO-led
border-monitoring troops to Albania.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also endorsed the continuation of the NATO-led
multinational stabilization force (SFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
and allowed SFOR to remain at its current level of some 34,000
troops.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers also strongly condemned the nuclear
tests conducted by India and Pakistan, but stopped short of
announcing any sanctions against the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan detonated five nuclear devices Thursday in response to
the same number of tests by its neighbor India on May 11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers also met their counterparts from Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic and from the member states of the
Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on issues of common concern and reviewed
their cooperation over the past six months.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Strongly Deplores Pakistan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations Friday strongly deplored the underground nuclear
tests that Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the Security Council strongly
urged India and Pakistan to refrain from any further tests, which
are contrary to the de facto moratorium on the testing of nuclear
weapons or other unclear explosive devices, and to global efforts
towards nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The council reaffirmed the crucial importance of the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)and the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Expressing its concern over the effects of this development on
peace and stability in South Asia, the council appealed to India
and Pakistan, and all other states which have not yet done so, to
become parties to the NPT, and to the CTBT, without delay and
without conditions.
</P>
<P>
The council also encouraged India and Pakistan to participate,
in a positive spirit, in the proposed negotiations with other
states for a fissile material cut-off treaty in Geneva with a view
to reaching early agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called upon all parties to exercise
maximum restraint and to take immediate steps to reduce and remove
tensions between them. The council reaffirmed that the sources of
tension in South Asia should be reduced and eliminated only
through peaceful dialogue and not by the use of force and other
military means.
</P>
<P>
The council also urged India and Pakistan to resume the
dialogue between them on all outstanding issues, including all
those that the parties have already discussed, especially matters
concerning peace and security, in order to remove the tensions
between them and to enhance their economic and political
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> UK Export Orders Hit 15-Year Low: CBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's export orders are now at
their lowest level since 1983, according to the Confederation of
Britain's Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
The CBI's latest monthly survey of industrial trends showed
that despite its recent retreat, the strong pound is still hitting
British exporters hard.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that last month only 9 percent of
manufacturers reported export orders higher than normal for the
time of year. In contrast, 60 percent were below average.
</P>
<P>
Its total order book balance was at -17 in May, down from -9 in
April, while the export order book reading fell to -51 from -43 in
the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said the survey showed that the pound's slide from a
seven-year high in recent days brought no relief to British
exporters.
</P>
<P>
The pound averaged 2.93 Deutsche marks during the survey period
compared with 3.07 marks in April. But there is still deep concern
among exporters that the trend may not last.
</P>
<P>
The gloomy data was seized upon by manufacturing union leaders
who predicted up to 200,000 job losses. Ken Jackson, secretary
general of the union, said, "The Bank of England must end its
vendetta against manufacturers and give a clear indication that
rates have peaked."
</P>
<P>
The weak data was also reflected in the CBI's latest economic
forecast, which predicted export volume growth will fall to 1.4
percent this year, compared with a previous forecast of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the poor export performance will mean GDP
growth slowing to 1.6 percent by the end of this year. A pick-up
in manufacturing next year should help the economy to record an
average of 2.1 percent growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference in London recently, Eddie George,
governor of the Bank of England, said, "If we had not had the
impact of the strong exchange rate and the weakening of external
demand, policy would have had to have been significantly tighter."
</P>
<P>
"As it is, we can afford to run the economy at a higher level
than otherwise, without threatening inflation in the short-term."

NICOSIA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Belarus signed here
Friday three agreements on avoiding double taxation, promotion and
protection of investment and air services.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the signing ceremony, visiting Belarussian

the economic field and "our common interest will assist us in
furthering our economic cooperation."

Outlining Belarus' advantages such as its geographical
location, a three-year tax free period for foreign investors and
the absence of trading borders with Russia, Ling said his
government would be willing to help promote Cyprus' goods in his
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced Friday the Justice Department will provide money for 700
additional police officers to target specific neighborhoods in 18
American cities.
</P>
<P>
"We have to focus our resources on high-crime, high-need
neighborhoods to bring the benefits of community policing to every
area," Clinton said in a Rose Garden announcement.
</P>
<P>
"In the difficult areas that means we have to reach a critical
mass of police officers and community policing before it can make
the necessary difference," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The president said Chicago's police department would get an
extra 150 officers to fight drugs, Miami would get another 170,
and Baltimore an extra 100.
</P>
<P>
"We have to do more and more to push back the frontiers of
crime," Clinton said at a ceremony attended by police chiefs and
city officials from across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department grants are being offered under the
current COPS community policing program. That program, which seeks
to put 100,000 extra police officers on the streets, was part of
the 1994 crime law.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the latest grants will help bring the number of
new officers to 75,000.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and the Democratic
Republic of Congo Friday signed an agreement under which the
former would assist the latter in prisons service training.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir
Mohammed and Congolese Minister for Justice Mwenze Kongolo during
a brief ceremony held in the Tanzanian capital.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint communique issued during the function,
two senior prisons officials from Tanzania will soon travel to
Democratic Congo to study the prisons system of Kinshasa and
assess its short- and long-term training needs.
</P>
<P>
The work is to be completed within two weeks.

<P>
The team will thereafter submit their findings and
recommendations to the Congolese government for scrutiny and
approval. Implementation work will start immediately after the
approval of the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the duration of training to be
undertaken by Tanzanian experts will be agreed upon by the
prisons departments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Kongolo commended the
Tanzanian government for its tireless support to his country. He

<HEADLINE> 56 Percent Germans Against Nuclear Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A survey conducted by the German Forsa
institute showed Friday that about 56 percent Germans are against
continued use of nuclear energy in the country in the wake of a
recent scandal concerning contaminated nuclear waste shipments.
</P>
<P>
The production of nuclear energy has become a hot issue in

<HEADLINE> China Signs Kyoto Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the
United Nations Qin Huasun, on behalf of the Chinese government,
singed here Friday the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change.
</P>
<P>
Upon signing the protocol, Ambassador Qin said the Chinese
government has stated on many occasions that it welcomes the
adoption of the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China's signing of the Kyoto Protocol has fully
demonstrated its sincerity and determination to deal with the
problem of climate change in all earnest.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that in general, the Kyoto Protocol is in conformity
with the principles and spirits of the Climate Change Convention,
reflecting the principle of common but differentiated
responsibility by providing on the one hand for the obligation of
developed countries to reduce emission of green-house gases, a
first step in response to the widespread demand of the
international community, and on the other hand refraining from
imposing new obligations to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Qin said there exist in the protocol, however, quite a few
defects and loopholes which need to be clarified and corrected in
the process of relevant forthcoming negotiations. China hopes that
developed countries will honor their commitment and take concrete
and effective domestic steps to carry out faithfully their
responsibility with regard to climate change.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China, as a developing country, will take relevant
measures in accordance with its strategy for sustainable
development so as to make its own contributions to combating
climate change.

<HEADLINE> IAEA Deeply Regrets Recent Nuclear Tests by India, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Director General of the
International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei Friday deeply
regretted the recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The director general said such tests lead to a dangerous
nuclear arms race and call into question the basic principles of
non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
The director general expressed the hope that both states will
exercise the utmost restraint and commit themselves to the course
of action supported by the international community: no nuclear
tests; no additional weapon states; a concrete program to reduce
and ultimately eliminate nuclear weapons with universal adherence
to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and a treaty prohibiting the
production of nuclear material for weapons purposes.
</P>
<P>
He firmly believed that global and regional accommodation and
detente rather than the acquisition of nuclear weapons is the way
to attain and enhance peace and security.

PARIS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- France's national carrier Air France
is considering renting planes from other air companies if the
pilots of the airline go ahead with their strike after Monday next
week, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
But air flights are expected to be greatly disrupted for the
travelers returning home Monday from their Pentecost holidays, a
Christian festival celebrating the descent of the Holy Spirit on
Whit Sunday.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Air France management as saying that Monday only 10
percent of the schedules at Charles de Gaulle airport and Orly
airport in Paris will be maintained for long-distance flights, and
25 percent for medium-distance flights.
</P>
<P>
"In the following three days, it is not impossible that there
would be a change of previsions with rentings," AFP quoted Air
France sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Air France said that it would guarantee that flights linking
France with its overseas territories would be at least partially
maintained, while one plane will fly to Africa and three planes
will fly to the United States Monday.
</P>
<P>
The company's biggest pilots union, SNPL, has called for a 15
day strike from Monday to protest a plan by the management to cut
the pilots' salaries by 15 percent in exchange for stocks.
</P>
<P>
The strike period would cover the 1998 France Football World
Cup finals.

<HEADLINE> French President Arrives in Lebanon on Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 29 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
arrived here Friday night on his third official visit to Lebanon
in two years.
</P>
<P>
His visit came as the Middle East peace process is experiencing
a complicated and crucial situation, especially after Israel
offered a conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the issues surrounding south Lebanon appear to be a
major topic between Chirac and Lebanese leaders, in addition to
regional affairs and bilateral ties, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said it would withdraw from south Lebanon if
Lebanese government promises to guarantee the security of its
northern border.
</P>
<P>
The offer was rejected by Lebanon and its ally Syria, but was
welcomed by the United States, which called it a positive step
toward a solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria insisted that the withdrawal be
unconditional, as stipulated in the U.N. Resolution 425, which was
dismissed by Israel in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon as peacekeepers,
seeks a comprehensive deal which would also involve an Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights it captured from Syria in the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
France, which ruled Lebanon until 1943 and has been enjoying a
good relationship with the country, publicly supported Lebanese
and Syrian stance on this issue.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Chirac will also discuss with
Lebanese leaders an international conference proposed by France
and Egypt during Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's recent visit
to Paris in an effort to save the collapsing peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will also inaugurate the new French embassy in
Beirut. The old one was heavily damaged during Lebanon's
15-year-old sectarian civil war.

KHARTOUM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Speaker of National
Assembly (parliament) Hassan Al Turabi said Friday the visit of
leader of the Palestinian resistance group Hamas Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin is "a symbol of solidarity among the Arabs and Muslims."
</P>
<P>
Al Turabi made the remarks while he greeted Yassin at the
Khartoum Airport together with Sudanese Minister for presidential
affairs Bakri Hassan Salih and Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman
Ismail.
</P>
<P>
Yassin arrived here earlier Friday on a seven-day visit to

their struggle to assert to the whole world that Islam is
invincible.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the firmness of the Sudanese people in the
face of the challenges posed to it by "the powers of international
aggression and arrogance."
</P>

Yassin performed the Friday prayer at the mosque of Khartoum
University. He is scheduled to meet Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir as well as other leaders.

<HEADLINE> Joint Efforts Urged to Fight Child Labor in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Tanzania
Employers (ATE) Chairman Bruno Kwelukwila has appealed to people
to make greater efforts in tackling the child labor problem.
</P>
<P>
Kwelukwila made the appeal at a meeting on child labor in Dar
es Salaam Friday.
</P>
<P>
Child labor is bad to the health and development of the
children, he said, adding that the problem cannot be eliminated
in the country without the strong support and full involvement of
the government and the public.
</P>
<P>
According to Kwelukwila, poverty is the main cause of child
labor in Tanzania but poverty cannot be used as justification.
</P>
<P>
The ATE chairman challenged the government to allocate more
resources to combat child labor as he said it is a matter of
utmost importance.
</P>
<P>
He said the Tanzania Federation of Trade Union (TFTU) has to
work through collective bargaining agreements with employers to
ensure that children are not employed.
</P>
<P>
Kwelukwila also urged the press to play a bigger role in the
campaign against child labor by giving prominence to informing
the public on the scourge of child labor.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he noted that parents must know how to appreciate
and accept their children.
</P>
<P>
Kwelukwila also urged non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
and international agencies to deal with the problem
simultaneously and devote all efforts to the eradication of
poverty as well as the elimination of child labor.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, officials from the International Labor
Organization (ILO) expressed appreciation for what ATE has done
in battling child labor, particularly in the plantations sector.
</P>
<P>
Child labor has been reduced by about 70 percent in
plantations in Tanzania, said Kwelukwila, adding that the
achievement should be viewed as a positive beginning. He hopes
that the efforts to eliminate child labor phenomenon do not end
up in a more than hazardous and exploitative work situation.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of work still needs to be done to ensure that children
are prevented from working on plantations," Kwelukwila said.
</P>
<P>
ILO said it will further cooperate with ATE in the next year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Tanzanian Minister of Education and Culture Juma
Kapuya said while inspecting an anti-child labor march that the
child labor situation in Tanzania has become worse since 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iran Concerned About Pakistan's Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Iran have expressed
concern over the underground nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan
to match India's five explosions two week ago.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Turkish Foreign Ministry Friday said that
the nuclear tests conducted by both India and Pakistan were of
concern for regional and global stability and security.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the two neighboring countries should
refrain from a reciprocal show of power and should solve their
disputes peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey wishes that this alarming development recorded in the
recent weeks will not pave the way for a new nuclear arms race,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan detonated five underground nuclear devices Thursday,
widely viewed as a response to India's five nuclear tests on May
11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
India has so far refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, calling them
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
Iran has called on Pakistan and India to cease nuclear tests
and rivalry and join the comprehensive test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said on
Thursday that Iran follows with deep concern the ongoing chain of
events concerning nuclear tests, the official news agency IRNA
said in a delayed report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the current nuclear race poses a serious
threat and danger to regional peace and stability, a race which is
first and foremost the consequence of lack of political will on
the part of the nuclear powers to heed the call of international
community for a comprehensive nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned that in the absence of an
all-encompassing program for comprehensive nuclear disarmament,
the status and future of Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty would
face great uncertainty.

WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday called
on India and Pakistan to reverse the course of weaponizing
military capabilities so as to avoid a further deterioration of
the situation in the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the message was
delivered by the U.S embassies in India and Pakistan.

He said the U.S. message to India and Pakistan "tells both

situation."

<P>
"The United States government urgently calls on both
governments to prevent a further deterioration of the situation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry also said the message pointed out "the significant
negative consequences" of the tests to relations with the United
States.
</P>

that they will be "increasingly isolated" if they continue their
present course.

WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering to launch a series of international meetings in an
effort to prevent deterioration of the situation in South Asia
because of nuclear testing by India and Pakistan that leads to
arms race in the subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said It would be a
process, launched by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
which will begin "with a ministerial level meeting that we hope
to arrange as early as next week."
</P>
<P>
The purposes of the initial session would be to develop a
coordinated, common approach "to see that there are no more
nuclear tests or escalations in the region, to reaffirm the
world's commitment to the maintenance of the global
non-proliferation regime, to find ways to engage India and
Pakistan in a process that will lead to their signing of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, support for the fissile material
cut-off, and ensuring that they don't take further escalatory
steps in the ballistic missile area," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the participants of the ministerial-level meeting
would be the foreign ministers of the Permanent Members of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the United
States has sent strong-worded message to India and Pakistan,
warning the two countries that "further testing and further

<HEADLINE> Chinese Photo Exhibition Opens in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese photographic exhibition
opened here Friday evening at the exhibition hall of Lusaka
National Museum to the welcome of many Zambian friends.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, the biggest one in the past 10 years sponsored
by the Chinese Embassy in Zambia, is aimed at making foreign
friends understand China better, an embassy source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 photos shown in the 1,000 square-meter
exhibition hall cover the fields of agriculture, education,
religion, medical treatment, the hand-over of Hong Kong as well
as fashion and Chinese traditional culture.
</P>
<P>
In the center of the hall, eight one-meter high vases made in
east China's world renowned Jingdezhen Town are glimmering with
its beauty. Together with the photos on the walls, they make the
visitors feel as if they were in China.
</P>
<P>
"Seeing for oneself is better than hearing from others,"
Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Wang Yunxiang cited an old Chinese
saying in his opening speech while expressing the hope that the
exhibition would help all the visitors have more understandings
about China.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the opening ceremony, Cecil Holmes, Zambian
deputy tourism minister, said the exhibition will promote not
only understanding between the Chinese and Zambian peoples, but
also the bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Chinese culture was and is "dynamic"
and will continue to be so.
</P>
<P>
A Zambian farmer named Benson Banda showed great interest in
the photos on China's agriculture and expressed appreciation over
China's great achievements in food security.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Zambia, a developing country with much fertile
land to be cultivated, can learn a lot from China in the
agricultural field since China can now feed its 1.2 billion
people with less arable land.
</P>
<P>
About 200 foreign diplomats, Zambia's senior officials and
local celebrities have come to view the photos with keen interest
in the exhibition which will last for 15 days.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Ibrahim Rugova, the Albanian
leader of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, urged on Friday U.S.
President Bill Clinton to take urgent action to stop the violence
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We urged an increased U.S. presence in Kosovo and for more
protection on the part of the United States for the people of
Kosovo," Rugova said in brief remarks to reporters after meeting
Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"We also reiterated that the best solution for Kosovo is to be
an independent and neutral country," Rugova said. "We also urged
for some kind of interim or transitional stage for Kosovo so that
the violence is brought to an end and a political solution is
sought."
</P>
<P>
Veton Surroi, a member of Kosovo's four-person negotiating team
that has begun direct talks with Belgrade on Kosovo's status, told
reporters Clinton assured Rugova of U.S. support.
</P>
<P>
Surroi quoted Clinton as saying that "Bosnia should not be
repeated and will not be repeated."
</P>
<P>
On May 19, the Contact Group, including the U.S., Britain,
France, Germany, Italy and Russia, agreed to reward Belgrade for
accepting face-to-face talks by suspending implementation of the
ban on investment in Serbia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soccer Team Unlikely to Advance in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Soccer Federation
president said it was not realistic to expect the American team to
meet its goal of advancing to the second round as it did in the
1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
On the day of the U.S. men's national team's last game on
American soil againt Scotland before heading to France, Alan
Rothenberg said this year's U.S. team seems likely to be stymied
by challenging first-round opponents -- Germany, Yugoslavia and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
"You reach further than what you expect," Rothenberg said. "If
you fall a little short, obviously you have done pretty well. I
think the goal is to make the second round. Realistically, I don't
expect to achieve that goal. I think we will fall a little short
of that goal and not make it out of the first round."
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg made his comments after announcing a national team
development plan that calls for the team to reach the
quarter-finals of the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The American team's World Cup opener will take place on June 15
against Germany in Paris. The team still polishing their new
formation of three defenders, six midfielders and one forward.
</P>
<P>
The team has been hit by injuries to midfielders Frankie Hejduk
and Brian Maissoneuve. "We are in a very, very tough group. It
would be an upset if we beat either of those teams or even tied
any of them," Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team was one of the four third-place teams that
advanced to the second round in 1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Coach Steve Sampson recently said he hoped to advance to the
second phace. Some players have called this the best American
squad ever.

<HEADLINE> European Leaders Condemn New Nuclear Tests by Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- European nations condemned the new
nuclear test conducted by Pakistan on Saturday, and urged the
country to stop nuclear testing immediately.
</P>
<P>
"France condemns the new nuclear test which Pakistan has just
conducted. France asks Pakistan to immediately put a definitive
end to these tests," the French Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
It again called on India and Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and join talks on banning the production of
fissile materials that can be used to produce atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
In London, Britain also unleashed verbal attacks upon Pakistan
for undertaking one more nuclear test early Saturday, saying this
latest action is "flagrant disregard" of international opinion.
</P>
<P>
"The international community is united in its insistence that
Pakistan should refrain from further tests. The need is now more
urgent than ever for both Pakistan and India to work to lower
tensions," British Foreign Secretary Robin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Cook, whose country is the current European Union
(EU) president, announced that Britain would recall the country's
High Commissioner in Pakistan for consultations.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Javier Solana, the secretary-general of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, said the nuclear tests of India and
Pakistan undermined global efforts to counter proliferation and
posed a grave risk to stability in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Solana called again on both India and Pakistan to halt nuclear
and missile testing immediately, to adhere unconditionally to the
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) and to begin a dialogue in order to reduce tensions
in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who
is on a visit in Finland, said Russia was calling for a special
meeting of the permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council to discuss the tense situation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Russia urged both India and Pakistan to sign the CTBT and the
NPT, and to solve their conflicts, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper
published Saturday, Primakov said Russia opposed economic
sanctions against Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pressure should be put on Islamabad, but not economic
sanctions, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia "believed that such a measure makes the
countries subjected to sanctions feel as if they were driven into
the corner, and make them do what they should not do, what we are
opposed to".
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel condemned
Pakistan's latest nuclear test on Saturday and urged the
U.N. Security Council to meet immediately to try to stop the
escalation in South Asia's arms race.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said both India and Pakistan should be compelled to sign
a nuclear test ban treaty.

<HEADLINE> Sudan to Return All Egyptian Properties: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Sudan said on Saturday that it will
return all the Egyptian properties in Khartoum it took in early
1990's, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Egypt "have agreed that 80 percent of the Egyptian
installations in Sudan will be returned to Egypt," Sudanese
Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Sherif Tuhami told a
press conference after a meeting held here between Egyptian and
Sudanese irrigation experts.
</P>
<P>
"Contacts are underway so that all the rest of the Egyptian
installations will be handed back to Egyptian sovereignty," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister assured that there is no problem in
returning the establishments to Egypt as Sudanese President Omar
Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir has issued clear directives in this respect.
</P>
<P>
"It is only a matter of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sudan confiscated Egypt's properties, including schools run by
Egypt and resthouses of Egyptian irrigation experts observing the
Nile, after armed conflicts in 1992-1993 between the two sides in
the area of Halaib, a border strip found to be rich in oil.
</P>
<P>
A thaw seems to have set in in the recent years after al-Bashir
expressed willingness to improve the bilateral relations, to which
Egypt has voiced welcome.
</P>
<P>
Lauding Khartoum-Cairo ties, the Sudanese official said the
ties are deeply-rooted as the leaders of the two countries are
keen on solving all the pending issues hampering bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Tuhami, who arrived here on Tuesday, will tour a number of
Egypt's development projects, including the South Valley land
reclamation project in Toshka that will use Nile water to irrigate
the Western Desert.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's coordination meeting of the experts came ahead of a
ministerial session of the Nile basin countries in September.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States condemned
Pakistan for carrying out one more nuclear explosion on Saturday,
calling the test a serious blow to efforts to defuse tensions in
southern Asia.
</P>
<P>
"This action by Pakistan will further set back our continuing
efforts to defuse tensions and halt the spiralling cycle of
provocative action," said the State Department in a statement read
by a spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan announced Saturday it carried out one more nuclear
test in the hills of Baluchistan in western Pakistan, bringing the
total to six in three days.
</P>
<P>
The tests followed five nuclear tests, on May 11 and 13, by
India.
</P>
<P>
"The United States condemns this second round of nuclear
tests. This second test of nuclear devices can only further raise
tensions in south Asia and undermine the global consensus on
non-proliferation," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It called on both nations to stop nuclear tests now and avoid
any further provocations that could raise tensions further.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Calls on Rebels to Sign Agreement With Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos on Saturday
expressed the hope that the leftist rebel group, the National
Democratic Front (NDF), will sign an agreement on human rights and
humanitarian law with the government soon.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he hoped that the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect
for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law reached
earlier by the government and the NDF negotiators will be signed
on or before June 12, the country's independence day.
</P>
<P>
The government and the NDF peace panels have signified their
intention to sign the agreement, Ramos said, adding that the
signing could signal the start of the general ceasefire until a
final peace agreement is forged.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos rejected the proposal of chief NDF negotiator Luis
Jalandoni for him to sign the agreement, saying that "peace
agreements are normally signed by the respective chairmen of the
peace panels concerned."
</P>
<P>
Ramos urged the NDF peace panel to sign the accord which has
been approved in principle and initialed by both sides in the
Netherlands on March 16 this year.
</P>
<P>
The NDF had agreed to sign the accord in Manila in April but
later changed its mind after the government refused to release
alleged political prisoners as demanded by the NDF.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, a leftist alliance created by the Communist Party of
the Philippines in the late 1960s, has fought the government for
decades.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla war launched by the NDF's military wing, the New
People's Army (NPA), reached its peak in the 1980s, but the
strength of the NPA weakened significantly later due to military
operations and factionalism.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Nuclear Tests Correct Strategic Imbalance in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The chief of staff of Pakistan's
army, General Jehangir Karamat, has defended the country's nuclear
tests as a correction of the strategic imbalance in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
At a presentation at the National Defense College here Friday,
Karamat said, "Pakistan made the bare minimum response only to
re-establish the strategic balance in the region, because numbers
and yields did not matter, only the capability did."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan conducted five nuclear tests on Thursday, in response
to India's five tests on May 11 and 13. Latest report said
Pakistan conducted one more nuclear test on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for a careful monitoring of regional
security, the army chief said, "We did not have to start a race
nor was there a need to escalate tension with unnecessary rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
"This new balance in the military equation could lead to
restraint and rationality by learning from the painful process the
U.S. and former USSR went through in the Cold War era," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Pakistan had already established a firm control
regime to monitor all its missiles and nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
He added that Pakistan's decision had been a difficult one for
a variety of reasons, particularly of the economic fallout.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the need to evolve a plan for the armed forces,
taking short- and long-term measures to offset the economic
impact.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Herbal Medicines Gaining More Popularity World-wide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese herbal medicines are now
selling 10 to 15 billion U.S. dollars worth, two to three times
the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
This trade amounts to 10 to 15 percent of the world's total,
according to Prof. Zhang Boli, director of a traditional medicine
institute in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Zhang told a national medical symposium today that one of
the reasons for the increasing popularity is that people are
becoming more concerned about the side-effects of other medicines
and are looking for alternatives. Another reason is that new
medicines need a lot of time and money to develop.
</P>
<P>
There are at least 170 companies and many research institutes
developing herbal medicines world-wide. Zhang said that some
European and North American countries now account for about a
quarter of the natural medicine use, and the former Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe account for 32 percent, while China consumes
nearly half.
</P>
<P>
The WHO has also put traditional medicine development on its
agenda and has built 26 traditional medicine centers. In 1980, it
announced 43 diseases that it considered suitable for treatment by
acupuncture and moxibustion, and one branch has published a
guidebook on herbal medicines.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A series of briefings on the
country's political and economic conditions will be started on
Monday for President-elect Joseph Estrada, Vice President-elect
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and the future Cabinet members of the
incoming administration.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos said in an interview Saturday
that the briefings will be attended by him, members of the Cabinet
and their counterparts in the incoming Estrada administration to
ensure that the smooth transfer of power will indeed take place on
June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The two presidents will be present to start the macro or
overview briefing that will involve the Cabinet members on both
sides, the outgoing as well as their counterparts in the incoming
Cabinet," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the President-elect, the Vice President-elect
and other officials of the incoming administration will have to go
through orientation "so that there will be continuity of the
programs that have proven to be productive and fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Aside from the regular briefings to be conducted between June 1
and June 30, Ramos urged incoming Cabinet members to "look around"
together with their would-be predecessors to see for themselves
the actual happenings in the field.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Congress formally proclaimed Friday Estrada as the
winner in the May 11 elections and duly elected president of the
country and Aroyo as duly elected vice president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commission on Elections proclaimed Friday night
the 12 duly elected senators at the end of its canvassing.
Proclaimed were seven candidates belonging to Estrada's LAMMP
coalition and five ruling Lakas-NUCD party bets.

<HEADLINE> Accidents in S. Africa Claim 27 Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 27 people were
killed and many others injured Saturday morning in two separate
car accidents in South Africa, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
At least 16 people, including three children, were killed in
an accident involving 10 cars on the N1 highway near
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
SAPA reported that five of the dead were burnt to death when
three cars and a truck burnt out in the pile-up.
</P>
<P>
In the accident, three people were critically injured, 14
seriously and 27 slightly.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the pile-up was caused by a veld fire in
the area which apparently made visibility difficult and initially
resulted in two mini-bus taxis colliding.
</P>
<P>
The N1 highway linking Cape Town and Johannesburg was closed
to traffic.
</P>
<P>
In another accident, at least 11 people died and 16 people
were injured when a bus carrying 30 passengers overturned near
Ixopo in the Kwazulu-Natal province, some 100 kilometers
southwest of Durban.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the vehicle reportedly lost control as he tried
to change into a lower gear when the bus was going around a bend.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Kwazulu-Natal transport chief J. S. Ndebele as
saying that one of the bodies were decapitated and others were
badly mutilated. Two people were critically injured in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
Ndebele said police were at the scene investigating the cause
of the crash. He said indications were that the driver had been
speeding.
</P>
<P>
After the Kwazulu-Natal crash, a South African road safety
campaign, Drive Alive, repeated its call to President Nelson
Mandela to intervene personally and increase the number of
traffic police on South African roads.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns India of Perils of Tobacco Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has issued a grim warning to India on the perils of tobacco
use that claims over 630,000 lives in the country every year,
according to a message issued Saturday by WHO's regional office in
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the World Tobacco Day on the coming Sunday,
WHO cautioned against attempts by the tobacco industry to target
the huge population of South East Asia which is viewed as a
lucrative market by the tobacco lobby.
</P>
<P>
India has one of the world's highest incidence of oral cancer
that accounts for one-third of all cancers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is responsible for half the cancers among Indian men
and a quarter of all cancers in women. Its use has been linked to
25 diseases including cardiovascular diseases, cancers and
respiratory and paediatric diseases, said the message which was
issued by WHO' director Uton Mudhtar Rafei.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco-related deaths are increasing in the region where
tobacco consumption has increased rapidly among all population
groups, especially women, the young and the poor in Southeast
Asian region.

PARIS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- France has reached an agreement with
Mali, allowing emigration of Malians to France, removing
what has become an obstacle in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
A pact to form a joint committee on immigration was signed
Friday by Charles Josseli, the French ministerial delegate for
cooperation with Francophone states, and a Malian government
representative in Bamako, the capital of Mali.
</P>
<P>
The committee will establish French-aided development programs
in African nations, including Mali, from where most of France's
immigrants come.
</P>
<P>
It will help immigrants to return and resettle in their home
countries, and encourage economic cooperation between French and
Malian businesses.
</P>
<P>
France will also establish a new consulate in Bamako to provide
more accommodating services to visa seekers.
</P>
<P>
The former conservative government of France expelled hundreds
of African immigrants in 1996 and 1997, sparking condemnation in

<HEADLINE> Air Strike Against Mosquitos, Flies Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- An air raid will be launched in
Golmud, a major city in northwest China's Qinghai Province,
targeting fat and voracious mosquitos and flies.
</P>
<P>
The city has been plagued by mosquitos and flies, which
flourish in the vast wetlands, jungles and animal wastes that
surround the city, seriously affecting local people's life and
work.
</P>
<P>
The local saying "three mosquitos make a dish, a throng of them
cause a disaster" attests to the size and maliciousness of the
insect. Soldiers have to wear masks in the face of the natural
enemy when standing guard.
</P>
<P>
Locals react to the mosquitos and flies by waving fans and bats
and burning incense, but to no avail. This year they petitioned
the government for help.
</P>
<P>
The government listed eradicating mosquitos and flies as one of
the 12 pragmatic deeds it promised to local people.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhongcheng, deputy director of the city's public health
bureau told Xinhua that the government will lease a cargo plane to
spray 150 tons of pesticides in a 200-square-kilometer area
periodically for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
The "carpet bombing" will cost more than 1.1 million yuan,
"which is a sizable expense for Golmud," a region which has a
concentration of impoverished people, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The air-raid method has been adopted because a similar tactic
several years ago was effective, the official added.
</P>
<P>
However, a local biological expert cautioned the government to
refrain from carrying out the raid immediately, calling for more
study on the local ecological condition.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Xingmin, a professor from a local branch of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, said that using an aircraft to spray
high-density pesticides "may achieve apparent results in a short
period of time but can likely cause pollution to the local water
and soil."
</P>
<P>
Dragonflies and many other beneficial insects might also be
indiscriminately killed in the raid, causing damages to the local
biological food chain, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the scholar's worries are proved to be uncalled-for.
According to Yang, the pesticides to be sprayed are of a special
type, that "will not have much noteworthy harmful influence on
insects bigger than flies and mosquitos, let alone on human beings
and livestocks."
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the pesticides will not constitute
pollution to the local water and soil, adding that such air raids
have been planned for two more consecutive years.

<HEADLINE> China Successfully Launches US-Made Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XICHANG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Long March 3B rocket
carried a Zhongwei I satellite into orbit 6:00 p.m. (Beijing Time)
today from the Xichang Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Today's launch was the 52nd of a three-stage liquid-fuel Long
March series and the tenth successful launch by the Long March
series since October of 1996 and the 3rd of a 3B, which is
designed and manufactured by the Carrier Rocket Technology Academy.
</P>
<P>
The 3B is the most powerful in the series and has a payload of
5,000 kg. so that it can carry two or more satellites at one
time. It has successfully sent Mabuhay and Apstar-2R into space.
</P>
<P>
The 2,984-kg. Zhongwei I is an earth-synchronous satellite
made by the U.S.'s Lockheed Martin Company for the China Orient
Telecom Satellite Company. The satellite has 24 C-channel and 24
KU-channel transponders and a designed service life of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will be controlled by Lockheed Martin and China
Orient to provide commercial telecommunication services for China
and other Asian countries. It is China Orient's first satellite to
get approval from the State Council for China's satellite
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that three successful launches of a 3B show how
China's rocket technology has evolved.
</P>
<P>
According to some analysts, China's international commercial
satellite business will help put its space technology into the
international market.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to be involved in space technology
cooperation with other countries to improve its space technology
and develop space resources for the benefit of the mankind.

<HEADLINE> Immunizations In China Running Into New Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Problems with funding, facilities,
and professional help are hindering China's immunization program
for tens of millions of newly-born babies every year.
</P>
<P>
An international team have pointed this out to public health
authorities after a study tour of ten Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
Storage and transport facilities for vaccines are often
outmoded, according to the team from the WHO, Unicef, the U.S.'s
Center for Disease Control, and the Japanese International
Co-operation Agency.
</P>
<P>
There are also safety, polio control, and immunization problems
that are growing in some provinces, they said, in some cases to a
critical degree that could get worse if these problems are not
addressed, according to Dr. Steve Cochi, the head of the team.
</P>
<P>
He suggests that the Chinese government allocate funds for
vaccines for the routine treatment, and asked for more
international support for this and for eradicating polio in China.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, China successfully protects millions of children
each year with vaccinations, and no polio cases have been reported
anywhere in China for more than two years, Dr. Cochi says.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,600 immunization agencies and 64,000 township hospitals
have been included in the Chinese network since it was set up in
1978.
</P>
<P>
The vaccination rate among children was 85 percent in 1995, and
is supposed to surpass 90 percent by the year 2000, and China says
it will eradicate polio nationwide by 2000.

<HEADLINE> PNA Calls for Sanctions Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Saturday called on the international community to
slap sanctions on Israel and warned that Israel's continued
policy on settlement would lead to an explosion in the situation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in the West Bank town Ramallah following
the weekly cabinet meeting, the PNA said European, American and
Arabic efforts to revive the peace process have led nowhere
because of the hardline policy taken by Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The statement attacked Israel for its continued policy on
building Jewish settlements in occupied territories, especially in
the flashpoint of East Jerusalem, which Palestinians want as their
future capital, saying it would cause an explosion in the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian legislators clashed with Israeli soldiers Tuesday
in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City where dozens of Jewish
religious students erected tin shacks overnight, in a protest
against the provocative act which they said was part of an attempt
to "Judaize" the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the international community to take
economic and political measures against Israel over its "arrogant
policy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio quoted a spokesman for PNA President
Yasser Arafat as saying that the coming week is "decisive" for
the United States' effort to break the deadlock in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman based his prediction on a telephone call made by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on May 22, in which she
asked Arafat for a final extra 10 days to persuade Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept U.S. proposals on further
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has time and again rejected the U.S. formula of 13
percent further withdrawal from the West Bank, citing Israeli
security concerns. This threatened a fatal blow to finish the
already dying peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has flew to Abu Dhabi in an effort to lobby for an Arab
summit to revive the peace talks. He is expected to meet the
president of the United Arab Emirates later in the day.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Speeds up Privatization Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMP[ALA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has made impressive
achievements in reaching the target of privatizing the country's
parastatal enterprises so far.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of 1998, Uganda has sold half of its
stakes in some big parastatals to foreign or local bidders,
adding new energy to the country's robust economy.
</P>
<P>
In March, Uganda Airlines decided to sell its shares in
Entebbe Handling Services Limited, a profit-earning enterprise,
due to its staggering economic burden.
</P>
<P>
In April, the sale of 49 percent shares of Uganda Commercial
Bank (UCB) was completed with its Malaysian buyer, Westmont Land
(Asia) Berhad, paying the remaining six million of the 11 million
U.S. Dollar deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, Westmont should provide
management for the 30-year-old bank for an initial period of
three years.
</P>
<P>
In response to a government invitation for pre-qualification
bids in march, six foreign bidders swarmed into Uganda in late
April offering attractive prices for the purchase of a stake in
Uganda Airlines. Just one day later, four foreign investors have
pre-qualified to bid for the 51 percent shares in Uganda Telecoms
Limited.
</P>
<P>
The pace is by no means slow in May. On May 5, the Ugandan
government signed a share sale agreement with Ethiopia-based
Midroc, selling 80 percent of the shares in the Apollo Hotel
Corporation Limited for 19 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Just 10 days later, the Ethiopian Company returned for a
second Ugandan parastatal, the Coffee Marketing Board Uganda
Limited, offering five million Dollars for 51 percent shares.
</P>
<P>
In the recent Arusha Donors Conference, Museveni promised to
privatize some of the main highways in the country to ensure safe
and proper communication for people and easy access for Uganda's
exports.
</P>
<P>
There are mainly three reasons for the coming up of Uganda's
parastatals.
</P>
<P>
First, the orientation toward state control or ownership of
key public utilities, which prevailed in Britain during the
colonial period was replicated in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Second, the country forcibly acquired 60 percent of the shares
of 80 major industrial, commercial and financial enterprises
during the days of "Ugandanization" policy implemented by the
Apollo Milton Obote Administration in late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Third, during Idi Amin's rule, Asians, who made the bulk of
the entrepreneurial class in the country, were expelled out of
Uganda and more parastatals were set up to take over the
operations of big enterprises of the departed Asian community.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance of the parastatals, under the management
of largely inexperienced Ugandan managers, led to the downward
spiral of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
With Museveni assuming power in 1986, his administration
mapped out and implemented a series of effective measures to save
the country's economy from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
Like other far-sighted leaders of the world, he regarded
privatization as the sole way to satisfy Uganda's acute need for
financial resources to rehabilitate the economy and to alleviate
its indebtedness to the World Bank and other financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
In January 1995, Ugandan President Yowery Museveni set an
impressive target of privatizing 85 percent of the country's some
130 parastatals by the end of 1997, and the target had been
achieved basically by that time.
</P>
<P>
By October 1997, 54 parastatals had been divested, 18 had
either been stuck off the register of companies or liquidated,
and 41 others had been shed off from the state direct control.
</P>
<P>
With the launch and implementation of the privatization
program in Uganda in early 1990s, the economy was revived and it
has developed at a rate seven percent over the last few years, so
fast a rate that it has put Uganda among the world's
fastest-growing economies.

Speaking at a seminar on industrial minerals here Friday,
Augusto de Araujo, director of Geology Bureau, said that Angola
should make full use of its minerals like phosphate and potash
for the fertilizer industry.
</P>
<P>
He said market investigations should be made with concerned
departments involved to make the plan a success.
</P>
<P>
Any sector which needs minerals for its development is
required to get a license from the government, he said, adding
that laws concerning mineral development are to be revised in
June for the better development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar on minerals which ended Saturday, also
discussed issues of joint ventures by foreign capital, Angola's

<HEADLINE> France Opposes Amending U.N. Resolution on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French President Jacques
Chirac here Saturday voiced his opposition to amending the
U.N. Resolution on Lebanon during his meeting with Lebanese House
Speaker Nabih Berry.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from talks with Chirac, Berry told reporters that
Chirac has said that any amendment to the resolution 425, which
calls for an unconditional Israeli troop pullback from south
Lebanon, must get the approval of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Israel offered in April to withdraw from south Lebanon on
condition that Lebanese government took measures to guarantee the
security of Israel's northern border.
</P>
<P>
The conditional offer was firmly rejected by Lebanon and its
ally Syria, which insisted on unconditional Israeli pullback in
line with the resolution, adopted in 1978 after Israel's first
invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has since been trying to convince the U.S., the U.N. and
France which is seeking to play a more active role in the Middle
East peace talks, to amend the resolution to pave the way for its
conditional pullout.
</P>
<P>
However, France, which ruled Lebanon between the two World Wars
and has been enjoying a good relationship with Beirut, gave its
backing to the Lebanese demand of an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who arrived here Friday night on a two-day official
visit, has also held talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri.
</P>
<P>
But no details about their talks are available for now.
</P>
<P>
During Chirac's visit, the third since he took office in 1995,
Lebanon was reportedly to urge France to pressure Israel to
implement the U.N. resolution without amendments and preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip
in south Lebanon since 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting
its northern areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.

underground nuclear tests, both nations began talking of new
arrangements that would stabilize their rivalry and minimize the

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chinese Festival Celebrated in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Residents of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region celebrated their first traditional
Chinese Dragon Boat Festival since Hong Kong's handover, with
territory wide boating races and serving of Zongzi, a traditional
food for the festival, here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Festival falls on the fifth of fifth month every year on
the Lunar Chinese calendar.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR, was
cheered on when he awarded the crews of the winning boats at one
of the races Saturday morning, at the waterfront of Aberdeen
Promenade, South Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
When awarded with colorful champion flags by Tung and Director
of Home Affairs Shelly Lau, the rowers celebrated their triumph
with traditional water splash and thunderous drum beating.
Thousands of spectators gathered along the waterway gave them a
rousing applause.
</P>
<P>
There were nine dragon boat races throughout Hong Kong on
Saturday, with venue locations ranging from Aberdeen, South Hong
Kong Island, and Sai Kung in the east, Tuen Mun in the west and
Tai Po in the north of the New Territories.
</P>
<P>
The race at Sai Kung waterfront attracted a field including 11
boats from Chinese provinces of the mainland and those from Macao,
Australia, France and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The festival also featured traditional Chinese food Zongzi, a
pyramid-shaped dumplings of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo or
reed leaves. The food has been prepared and served for thousands
of years in China. Both dragon boat races and Zongzi are to
commemorate a famous poet in the Chu kingdom in ancient China, who
committed suicide by throwing himself into a river in central
China.

<P>
Jorge Silveira, secretary for justice of Macao, told the Va Kio
newspaper Friday that a dozen "experienced criminal investigation
officers" will come to Macao within two months.
</P>
<P>
They will come to help local police departments investigate
organized crime cases, the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira said earlier this month that
Macao needs specialized experts to help crack down on organized
crimes, whose means of committing crimes are quite sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
Macao was rocked by a series of violent crimes over the past
few months. Several people, including officials, were killed by
gunmen. The crimes were reportedly related to triads fighting for
interests in casinos.

<HEADLINE> Macao Foreign Trade Down in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Both imports and exports dropped in
the first quarter of 1998 in Macao in the wake of the financial
storms in Asia, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
Saturday show that the value of exported goods reached 3.1 billion
patacas (387.5 million U.S. dollars) between January and March,
down 7.5 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The value of imports was recorded at 3.3 billion patacas (412.5
million U.S. dollars), down 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a trade deficit of 185 million patacas (23.1
million U.S. dollars) was recorded.
</P>
<P>
The drop in exports was mainly due to a 10.9 percent decline in
the exports of garments and textile products, which accounted for
85 percent of all exports.
</P>
<P>
The export value to Macao's two leading markets, the United
States and European Union, dropped by 2.8 percent and 17.4 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the decline in import value was mainly due to a 9.9
percent decrease in the import of raw materials and semi-finished
goods and a 7.2 percent drop in that of capital goods.

<HEADLINE> Blatter Promises to Help China Boost Soccer Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Sepp Blatter, one of the two
candidates for the president of world soccer's governing body
FIFA, promised that he will offer help immediately for China once
he wins the election.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely, we will offer immediate help to China if I become
the new president," said the FIFA Secretary General, who came
here early on Saturday by himself to seek support for his
election.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said the priority should go to China though many other
countries also need help.
</P>
<P>
"China has 1.2 billion people, it has big influence in the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blatter was confident to get 118 of the 198 votes in the June 8
election.
</P>
<P>
"Two thirds of the Asian countries will support me. Even in
Europe, there will be about 10 votes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said that Asia will have at least three and a half
slots for the 2002 World Cup finals besides co-hosts Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"The two organizers will be automatically qualified. And like
this time, Asia will have three slots and vie for the fourth
against Oceania."
</P>
<P>
Blatter, criticized by his rival Lennart Johansson as being too
conservative to make any reform, stressed that the principle of
FIFA should maintain continuity but the structure should be
changed.
</P>
<P>
"Football has become an universal game in the past 24 years
since Dr. Joao Havelange became the FIFA president," he said. "In
1974, football was only confined to Europe and South America."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot take the risk to go back and see football become a
game only for rich people."
</P>
<P>
He said that Johansson does not know the international
football, indicating the UEFA president should not preside over
the world soccer governing body.
</P>
<P>
"He knows only about the football of Europe," the Swiss said.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said that if he wins the election, he will not stay in
the place for more than two terms.
</P>
<P>
He said that FIFA officials under his presidency can no longer
stay within their offices.
</P>
<P>
"They should go out of offices, they must play football by
themselves, they must go to the field," he said. "If I become the
president, FIFA's players, referees, coaches and other officials
will be sent to each of the national associations to identify
their needs and problems."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that he will neither imitate Havelange nor
match him.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Havelange has made enormous contributions to the world's
football. It's impossible for me to imitate or match him," said
the Secretary General, who has said early in Zurich that Havelange
should be named as FIFA's honorary president.
</P>
<P>
Blatter confirmed he will quit as FIFA Secretary Genernal if he
fails in the election.
</P>
<P>
"Johansson will not like me to stay there. I will definitely
quit, but I will not quit football," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, leaving for Hong Kong, China tomorrow, will not visit
any other Aisan countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday conducted
another two nuclear tests following its detonation of five nuclear
devices on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) quoted authentic sources
as saying that the two nuclear devices detonated Saturday are all
with a yield of 12 kilotons each.
</P>
<P>
The tests were reported to be conducted at 13:15 p.m. (local
time) in remote deserted areas bordering Afghanistan and Iran in
Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's nuclear tests have brought the total number of tests
to seven conducted by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has every right to further strengthen its nuclear
capability to bolster its defense," APP quoted the sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources maintained that "Pakistan has no aggressive designs
against any country, but is left with no option but to answer the
needs of national security."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, after the international community failed to provide
any guarantee to Pakistan's security, tested five nuclear weapons
with varying yield on May 28, two weeks after India tested its
nuclear devices.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Chief Tom
Ikimi has advocated two permanent seats for Africa in the United
Nations (UN) Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi made the call Friday in Havana, Cuba, while addressing a
group of 18 African ambassadors accredited to that country,
according to Saturday's "The Guardian" newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi said Africa should have a strong voice in the U.N.
system, as the continent's 53 countries constitute one-third of
the total membership of the world body.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Non-aligned Movement calls for a reform
of the Security Council on permanent and non-permanent seats.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Africa's biggest country in terms of population, in
the past has been demanding the proposed one permanent seat for
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Its efforts, however, has been frustrated by the political
situation in the country, and challenged by South Africa and
other African countries that are economically stronger and
politically more stable, and therefore, regarded as more
competitive.

ABU DHABI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived here Saturday to seek backing from the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) for an Arab summit to save the collapsing Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources here, Arafat will meet the UAE
President Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan later Saturday on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has sought for several months to convene an Arab summit
to adopt a unified Arab stance towards the Israeli intransigence
and hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
And he quickeded his pace recently in urging the summit after
the U.S. failed to convince Israel to accept its proposal on a 13
percent troop withdrawal from the West Bank, which further bogged
down the Palestinian-Israeli peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Intensive consultations through diplomatic channels are under
way among Arab states for a mini or expanded Arab summit to close
Arab ranks.

Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Qatar have reportedly

<HEADLINE>   S. Korea's Foreign Debts Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign debts amounted
to 155.2 billion U.S. dollars at the end of April, up 3.9 billion
dollars from the previous month, said the Ministry for Finance and
Economy on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise of foreign debts to the inflow
of four billion dollars coming from issuance of South Korean
government bonds in the United States on April 17.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 155.2 billion dollars, the public sector accounts
for 28.9 billion dollars, local financial institution 71.9 billion
dollars, private companies 37.7 billion dollars and Seoul-based
foreign banks 16.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last month, long-term debt with maturities of
over one year amounted to 113.3 billion dollars, or 73 percent of
the total, while short-term debt stood at 41.9 billion dollars, or
27 percent, which was 13.3 percent lower than in March.
</P>
<P>
In April, long-term debt rose by 22.9 billion dollars while
short-time debt plunged by 19 billion dollars as foreign lenders
rolled over the short-term debt of financial institutions of the
financial crisis-engulfed nation.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy in the world, signed
an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a rescue
loan of 57 billion dollars last December after it began suffering
a financial crisis caused by corporate collapses and bad loans of
financial institutions.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Working out Ways to Reduce Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is working out ways
to lower interest rates, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who is also Chairman of the National Economic Action
Council (NEAC), described the current effective interest rate of
between 15 and 16 percent as very high.
</P>
<P>
Feedback from the business community relayed to the NEAC
indicated that current interest rate at 16 percent had a
crippling effect on their business because of very costly
servicing of loans, he told reporters on the matter after opening
the 45th general assembly of the Malaysian Chinese Association
(MCA) here.
</P>
<P>
He said the actual lending rate is dependent on the cost of
money, the margins banks impose on borrowers and inter-bank
borrowings.
</P>
<P>
"We are under pressure because as you know, the so-called
market forces want us to increase interest rates," he said.
</P>
<P>
On banks being over-cautious in disbursing loans, Mahathir said
the government wanted credit growth to be increased but banks
lacked the confidence in the future performance of companies.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government set the credit growth rate at 15
percent for the year 1998.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara (Central Bank of Malaysia) announced in the day
that Malaysia's real GDP declined by 1.8 percent in the first
quarter of 1998 on an annual basis, against a 6.9 percent GDP
growth in the 4th quarter 1997 and an annual growth of 7.8 percent
in that year.

<P>
TOKYO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Social Democratic Party (SDP)
formally decided Saturday to end its four-year alliance with the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The SDP made the decision at a general meeting of its lawmakers
in both houses of the Diet (parliament), the report said.

In a statement on terminating its noncabinet alliance, the SDP

basics of the Constitution, foreign policy and political ethics.

The statement referred to difficulties the party faced in
reaching an agreement with the LDP on major policy issues
including anti-political corruption measures, bills for
Japan-U.S. defense cooperation in the event of emergencies, and
bills on measures against organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
Takako Doi, chairwoman of the SDP, said at the meeting, "It is
difficult to further maintain the three-party alliance," which
also includes the New Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
Sakigake also plans to quit its alliance with the LDP by the
end of the current Diet session, scheduled to end June 10.
</P>
<P>
Differences between the LDP and the SDP over an anticorruption
bill spurred the breakup of the alliance, which dates back to the
establishment of the SDP-led government of Prime Minister Tomichi
Murayama in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
In January 1996, Murayama stepped down and LDP leader Ryutaro
Hashimoto became prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The SDP has also been unhappy about the cabinet's approval of
defense bills without gaining its agreement.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loan to Help Yunnan's Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province in southwest China
has recently received a World Bank loan of 150 million US dollars
for pollution treatment, the biggest foreign loan the province has
ever received.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank loan-financed environmental protection project
was made up of 19 sub-projects, with the comprehensive treatment
of the Dianchi Lake in Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province, as its
key project, Du Juan, an official with the provincial
environmental protection bureau, said.
</P>
<P>
As a renowned plateau lake, Dianchi is the provincial capital's
important drinking and industrial water source. The lake faces
serious water pollution and water shortage, whose water quality
falls far below the state standard.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has decided to take 18 years to carry
out the Dianchi pollution treatment project, which is divided into
three stages, and the World Bank loan will be mainly spent on the
second-stage project.
</P>
<P>
With the World Bank loan, the Kunming city will build five
waste water treatment plants, expanding two water plants,
renovating urban drainage works, establishing 18 garbage transfer
stations, and two garbage burial stations.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the project, the city's daily capacity
of waste water treatment will reach 585,000 tons, nearly the same
as that of the city's daily waste water amount, and the city's
daily water supply capacity will increase by 170,000 tons; daily
garbage treatment capacity increase by 1,500 tons.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank loan also involves pollution treatment in two
Yunnan cities: Gejiu and Qujing, and the Yunnan provincial
government needs to allocate 150 million US dollars for supporting
the environmental protection project, which is expected to be
completed by 2002.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
has kept economic and trade ties with more than 100 countries and
regions and is now home to 7,500 overseas-funded businesses.
</P>
<P>
Of the 7,500 enterprises, 2,180 are launched by businessmen
from Hong Kong, according to Cai Limin, deputy governor of the
province.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that more overseas businessmen, especially businessmen
from Hong Kong, would come to make investment in Hebei, explaining
the fact that Hebei is the center of Bohai Rim chosen as a major
area for faster development and opening-up after the Yangtze River
Delta and Pearl River Delta, and is close to Beijing and Tianjin,
and will present investors more favorable opportunities for
development.
</P>
<P>
"Overseas investors are welcome to develop high-tech products
in fields of chemical, pharmaceutical-making, metallurgical,
building materials and foodstuff-making sectors," said the deputy
governor, adding that the province especially welcomes Hong Kong
businessmen to use funds and technologies to help Hebei develop
agriculture and power industry.
</P>
<P>
Hebei has had an average annual growth rate of 14.1 percent in
GDP (gross domestic product) since the beginning of the 1990s. The
GDP growth rate has exceeded China's national average in seven
consecutive years. It is placed 6th for gross economic volume
among 31 Chinese provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rebukes French Bill on Armenian Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- That the French National Assembly
voted unanimously to recognize the Armenian genocide of 1915 on
Friday immediately triggered strong reaction from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"This (French) resolution (on the Armenian genocide) does not
have any other meaning than the distortion of historical facts,"
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel was quoted by local press as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Those who try to obtain antagonism from history will be
responsible to history itself," the president said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Armenia says that about 1.5 million Armenians were massacred by
Turks by order of the Ottoman Empire in 1915. Turkey says that
thousands of Turks and Armenians died in fighting between the two
sides in what is now eastern Turkey and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said the French resolution will not serve to achieve
anything except the damaging of relations between Turkey and
France.
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly's adoption of the bill is to be
followed by a vote in the Senate and finally the signature of the
French president.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, who was in Luxembourg,
warned on Friday that the possible repercussions of the French
move would be very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
"The French Parliament passed a resolution which will encourage
terrorism and the terrorists who killed our 34 diplomats. And this
result caused by the French Parliament seems to legitimize the
terrorists' actions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cem pointed out that "It is obvious that this resolution is an
attempt to destroy Turkish-French friendship. It is also clear
that the supporters of that bill prefer their racist feelings to
the national interests of France."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister stressed that security measures
around the Turkish Embassy in Paris will be increased because of
possible threats following the passage of the draft law.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Yen's Plunge to Hurt S. Korean Exports: LG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 30 (Xinhua) -- If the Japanese yen plunges to the
150-yen level against the U.S. dollar, the price competitiveness
of South Korean exports is expected to be eroded almost
completely, said LG Economic Research Institute on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
One of the hardest hit industries will be the automobiles, the
demand of which are quite vulnerable to the price fluctuations
resulted from devalued yen, the institute said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The price of South Korean-made semiconductors is also feared to
decline further in international markets if Japanese producers
expand production to capitalize on the yen's fall, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the price competitive edge of Korean goods
will become almost nil if their currency stays at the current
level, while the Japanese unit falls to the 150 yen level against
the greenback as suggested by U.S. Secretary of Treasure Robert
Rubin recently," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean won appreciated 22 percent against the
Japanese yen as of May 27, compared with the same time of last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, the actual appreciation was estimated
to be about 10 percent, when the difference in commodity prices of
the two countries is taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
If the won appreciates 10 percent against the yen, South
Korea's exports are expected to decline 4.6 percent over the
following year, the institute said, adding that the nation's
export growth rate this year would remain less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Japan's yen tumbled to 139.20 against the U.S. dollar Friday, a
seven year low after a seven-week devaluation.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung has expressed deep concern
that a his country's already beleagured economy will be hit hard by
a devalued yen, which comes at a time when the nation is
preoccupied with raising exports as a major way to overcome the
current financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Beat Bulls to Force Game 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls failed to roll
over the Indiana Pacers Friday night to sail into the National
Basketball Association Finals but instead they were heading where
Michael Jordan hasn't been in six years -- a Game 7.
</P>
<P>
Travis Best scored four points in the final 33 seconds,
including two points with eight seconds to go, helping the Pacers
edge the Bulls 92-89 in Game 6 at home in the Eastern Conference
Finals, forcing a Game 7 Sunday at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for the Bulls to play Game 7 in playoffs
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for Reggie (Miller), but he wasn't open,"
Indiana coach Larry Bird said after the game in Indianapolis,
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
"Travis took it upon himself to penetrate, which we've been
telling him to do because when he penetrates, good things happen."
</P>
<P>
Jordan disappointed his teammates and his fans as he slipped
and fell when he drove to the basket for what would have been a
tying hoop with less than five seconds left.
</P>
<P>
He lost the ball, and the Pacers got it to add one more point
amid the wild yelling home crowd.
</P>
<P>
Rik Smits put in 25 points to lead the Pacers. Miller only
managed eight points on 3-of-13 shooting, including one
three-pointer in seven attempts.
</P>
<P>
With Miller struggling, Dale Davis added a career playoff-high
19 points.
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan scored 35 points, was 10-of-11 from the line and
landed nine rebounds in 41 minutes. Scottie Pippen got 19 points
and Rodman grabbed 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
After leading the half time 49-46, the Pacers still found
themselves down 69-66 with almost three minutes left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
But Best entered and threw a no-look pass behind his back to
Davis, who dunked. That ignited a 6-0 run to put the Pacers up
70-69, and the teams exchanged leads in the rest of the game.

<HEADLINE> Niyazov to Visit Iran for Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran has announced that Turkmen
President Saparmurad Niyazov will visit Iran to sign a
comprehensive agreement on bilateral cooperation in culture,
economy, politics and education.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi upon his return from a one-day meeting of the joint
Iranian-Turkmen political committee in Ashkhabad, capital of
Turkmenistan, Tehran Radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that during his stay in Ashkhabad, he held talks
with Niyazov to mainly discuss the Caspian Sea issue and the
laying of an oil pipeline between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both sides believed the best legal regime for the sea was a
joint ownership by the littoral states, Kharrazi said, adding that
if the littoral states decided to divide it, first of all, the
division should be equal and just, and there should be a regime
concerning the sea bed.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also underlined the need to announce the
Caspian Sea as a non-military region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of oil and gas has put the Caspian into the
limelight, and its littoral states - Russia, Iran, Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan - remain undecided over the status of
the largest inland water.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Niyazov told him that he considered Iran as the
best and most suitable route for Turkmen oil and gas exports. And
the two countries will continue to discuss the envisaged oil
pipeline project between the two countries, Kharrazi added.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Troop Withdrawal From Gulf Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A former member of the Kuwaiti
National Assembly has urged the withdrawal of foreign troops from
the Gulf, saying he was looking forward to that day to come, the
Arab News daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Al-Rubei, who was also Kuwaiti education minister, was
speaking in Beirut, Lebanon at a seminar on the Gulf future eight
years after the war which drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bubei said the Americans had only come to the Arab Gulf in
order to ensure the flow of oil to the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
There are around 31,000 western troops stationed in the Gulf
region, of whom nearly 30,000 are Americans.
</P>
<P>
Blaming the lack of any Arab initiative during the Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait in 1990, Al-Rubei said: "We looked forward to
an Arab resolution but none was forthcoming."
</P>
<P>
He warned that since the Arab nation asked others to solve its
problems, any future crisis might not be resolved unless foreign
intervention is sought.

<HEADLINE> Saudis Develop New Soil Water Sensing Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Researchers in Saudi Arabia
have developed a micro-computer-based soil water sensing
technology to promote water conservation by 24 percent and boost
average wheat yield by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Arab News daily, during a study conducted on
behalf of King Abdul Aziz City for Science and Technology (KACST),
field experiments were undertaken for three successive growing
seasons on wheat crop to implement two automatic scheduling
techniques via soil moisture sensor for center pivots.
</P>
<P>
The study found that working hours of the machinery and
equipment came down by 26.8 percent and 20.8 percent
respectively, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In another study carried out by King Faisal University on
behalf of KACST, the growth and yield of all important feed and
food crops, namely barley, alfalfa, cowpea and soybean, were
reduced with a drop in irrigation frequency and increasing
salinity of irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to basin irrigation, sprinkler irrigation reduced the
growth of alfalfa, cowpea and soybean, especially when drainage
water was used," the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
In order to minimize yield reduction when using saline
drainage water for crop production, the study favored control of
root zone salinity by frequent irrigation and leaching and use of
water with low salinity.
</P>
<P>
Other recommendations were that saline drainage water should
be used in winter to irrigate salt tolerant crops and nitrogen
fertilization should be followed as it enhances salt tolerance.
</P>
<P>
The study also suggested that basin irrigation should be used
rather than sprinklers with drainage water for crops.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial output is
expected to grow by 12.7 percent or about 4.58 billion
U.S. dollars in the first five months against the same period last
year, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
But the figures showed that in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam's
industrial hub, industrial production grew by just 5.9 percent,
about half that for the first five months of last year.
</P>
<P>
The growth is below the nation's target of a 13.5 percent
increase in industrial out for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Economic Times said inefficiency, obsolete
equipment and a chronic lack of capital to upgrade technology are
the major resons for the slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the industrial sector's capital comes from
loans and this is aggravating the difficulties, especially as the
prices for industrial goods was lower than anticipated, according
to the weekly magazine.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Growth Goes Negative in 1st Quarter 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's real gross domestic
product (GDP) declined by 1.8 percent in the first quarter of 1998
on an annual basis, the Bank Negara (Central Bank or State Bank)
announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This was against a 6.9 percent GDP growth in the 4th quarter
1997 and an annual growth of 7.8 percent in that year.
</P>
<P>
This also represented the first quarterly decline since the
mid-1980s. Since 1988, the Malaysian economy grew at an average
annual rate of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The real GDP declined in the first quarter this year as the
severe impact of the East Asian financial crisis since last July
was felt during the period under review, the Central Bank
announced in a press release Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1998, output in the major sectors
recorded either a substantial slower growth or a decline.
</P>
<P>
Output of the manufacturing sector, the backbone of Malaysia's
economy recorded a decline of 2.4 percent on an annual basis
against a 10.9 percent increase in the 4th quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The decline was broad-based, affecting both the domestic and
export-oriented industries, it said.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector recorded a decline of 10 percent during
the period under review following a sharp slowdown in construction
activity, especially those relating to new projects, against a 6
percent increase in the 4th quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Activities in the services sector moderated substantially to
increase by only 2.9 percent, supported mainly by continued growth
in the utilities and finance sub-sectors. The services sector
recorded a growth of 6 percent in the 4th quarter 1997 and a
annual growth of 7.9 percent in that year.
</P>
<P>
In the agriculture sector, output declined by 2.8 percent due
to lower production of all commodities.
</P>
<P>
Output of the mining sector recorded a slower growth of 2
percent in the first quarter of 1998, compared with the strong
growth of 7.7 percent in the 4th quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rose significantly in the first quarter of 1998, it
said, adding that as the pass-through effect of higher import
prices due to the weaker ringgit filtered down to the domestic
price level, the Consumer Price Index showed a stronger increase
of 4.3 percent in the quarter under review, the highest level
since the first quarter of 1993, compared with the 2.7 percent
increase in the preceding quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bank, the overall position of the
federal government remained in surplus in the first quarter as
lower expenditure from the austerity measures enabled the
government to absorb the reduction in revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
The current and overall accounts recorded larger surpluses of
5.4 billion ringgit (about 1.3989 billion U.S. dollars at present
rate) and 4.2 billion ringgit (about 1.088 billion dollars)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The total debt of the Federal government declined by 2.4
percent from the end-1997 level to 87.8 billion ringgit (about
22.7461 billion dollars) at the end of March 1998 with the
domestic debt decreasing marginally by 0.4 percent to 76.7 billion
ringgit (about 19.8704 billion dollars) and the external debt
declining further by 14.1 percent to 11.1 billion ringgit (about
2.8756 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Monetary growth continued to moderate. On an annual basis, the
growth of the broad monetary aggregate (M3) declined further to
13.7 percent due to the significant moderation in loan growth.
</P>
<P>
Total loans declined by 0.2 percent during the quarter under
review to 420.2 billion ringgit (about 108.8601 billion dollars)
at the end of March, compared with the 4.9 percent growth in the
previous quarter, due mainly to weaker business expectations,
higher interest rates and the more cautious landing policies of
the banking institutions.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the decline in domestic demand and a slowing down
in economic activity had adversely affected the debt-servicing
capability of debtors and as a result, some financial institutions
faced a deterioration in their asset quality.
</P>
<P>
As at 31 March 1998, the ratio of non-performing loans (NPL) to
total loans fro commercial banks, finance companies and merchant
banks were 7.6 percent, 13.5 percent and 7.9 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the Central Bank said, the level of NPL of the banking
system, which was 9.1 percent at end-March, remained manageable.
</P>
<P>
The international reserves held the Bank Negara declined by 1.7
billion ringgit (about 440.4145 million dollars) during the first
quarter to 57.4 billion ringgit (about 14.8704 billion dollars) at
the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The external trade surplus increased significantly in the first
quarter of 1998 to a record level of 8.8 billion ringgit (about
2.2797 billion dollars), following a surplus of 1.7 billion
ringgit (about 440.4145 million dollars) in the preceding quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank expects the situation would be better in the
second quarter of 1998 and forecasts that the annual GDP for the
whole year of 1998 would increase by 2.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Annan Approves Iraq's Food Distribution Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan approved the food and medicine distribution plan Friday
presented by Iraq on May 14.
</P>
<P>
The approval paved the way for Iraq to export up to 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil over the next six months, starting June
3.
</P>
<P>
Last February, the United Nations Security Council agreed to
allow Iraq to increase its oil exports from 2 billion dollars to
5.2 billion every six months.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been banned from freely exporting oil since it invaded
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions were imposed by the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, the Security Council adopted the
"oil-for-food" program. It allowed Iraq to export 2 billion
dollars worth of oil under U.N. supervision in order to import
humanitarian goods for its people.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Cause 4.5 Billion Dollar Damages: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's forest fires and haze
inflicted total damages of 4.5 billion U.S. dollars on the
Southeast Asia region in 1997, according to a study released here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some 85 percent of the damage or 3.8 billion dollars was
absorbed by Indonesia while the remaining part, amounting to 670
million dollars, went to other countries of the region, said the
study by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WW1) and the Economic and
Environment Program for Southeast Asia (EEPSEA).
</P>
<P>
The study, submitted to the Indonesian forestry and environment
ministries earlier this week, described the assessment as
"conservative", noting they did not take into account losses of
life and biodiversity as well as haze-related damages such as
long-term health effects, reduced crop productivity and loss of
confidence by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In breakdown, the study estimated that forest fires and haze
from August to December 1997 caused losses of 3.1 billion dollars
and 1.4 billion dollars respectively, affecting some 5 million
hectares in Indonesia and 70 million people in the region.
</P>
<P>
The main damages included timber losses, foregone agricultural
production and contribution to global warming, it added.

WARSAW, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan will never develop
nuclear weapons since it has already depleted its nuclear arsenal,
Kazakh Defense Minister Mukhtar Altynbayev said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Kazakhstan will not seek to fall back on nuclear weapons since
we have already gotten rid of them," the visiting Altynbayev said
at a meeting with his Polish counterpart Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan has transported all the nuclear warheads it
inherited from the former Soviet Union back to Russia, and gained
support from the whole world, including Poland, Onyszkiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
The two defense ministers also exchanged views over the Indian
and Pakistani nuclear tests over the past two weeks. Altynbayev
said the tests are an important indicator of a renewed arms race.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed military cooperation between the two
countries. Onyszkiewicz said Poland is interested in providing
ammunition to and learning warship technology from Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> World Continues Deploring India, Pakistan Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Politicians from Europe and South
America continue to criticize India and Pakistan for conducting
nuclear tests, urging the two South Asian countries to abandon
plans for future tests.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting on Friday, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said Italy deplores the 10 nuclear tests India and
Pakistan have conducted, asking the two neighbors not to test any
more nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
Summoning Pakistani Ambassador Arif Ayub on Friday, the Italian
Foreign Ministry voiced concerns over the Pakistani tests, adding
that India and Pakistan should start talks now and solve conflicts
with the help of the international communities.
</P>
<P>
India set off five underground nuclear devices two weeks ago,
igniting global anger. Pakistan, in response, also exploded five
nuclear devices on Thursday, claiming the tests were done for the
sake of national security.
</P>
<P>
The recent nuclear tests in the two countries have caused
worldwide concern over the possibility of a new arms race, which
could result in dangerous consequences on the South Asian
subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
"The nuclear tests have a direct relationship with the
development of nuclear weapons," the Peruvian foreign ministry
said in a press release. "And in consequence, they are a real
danger to the stability of the region and to international
security."
</P>
<P>
The press release said it is urgent to stop nuclear testing and
create nuclear-free zones.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government noted that universal adherence to the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the complete ban on nuclear
tests is a guarantee against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and Argentine President
Carlos Menem, who is visiting Finland, held a joint press
conference Friday. They expressed firm opposition to the Indian
and Pakistani nuclear tests, which have resulted in international
sanctions against both New Delhi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who is also
visiting Helsinki, said Moscow does not support sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Believing that sanctions achieve nothing, Moscow did admit that
the nuclear tests have made situations in South Asia explosive.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Means Slight Drop in Summer Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to have good
harvest of grain this summer despite enduring drought in the north
and floods in the south, although a slight drop is likely to occur.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture made the conclusion on a the basis
of local reports, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Summer harvesting is carried out from the south to the north,
and will be completed around June 20-25.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official with the Central Meteorological
Observatory as saying that thunderstorms may hit the areas north
of the Huaihe River in the first ten days of next month, when the
area will still be busy with harvesting.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are expected to be able to protect the mature grain
from being beaten down and to drain water from the farm fields.
</P>
<P>
China harvested nearly 124 million tons of grain last summer,
an all-time high, as the natural conditions were favorable.
</P>
<P>
The land planted in summer grain this year is around 660,000
hectares, about the same as last year; but this year drought in
northwest China and rain followed by frost in the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River is expected to affect the summer
harvest.
</P>
<P>
One-fourth of China's annual grain output comes from the summer
harvest.
</P>
<P>
A recent report from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
expected China to harvest a total of 497 to 500 million tons of
grain this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Jaya Sikuru (Certain
Victory) troops Friday advanced further northwards from west of
Mankulam and destroyed several Tamil rebel camps with artillery
fire, reports reaching here from north of the country said.
</P>
<P>
About 25 to 30 rebels could have died in the operation when
advancing troops attacked with heavy artillery fire rebels
occupying west of Mankulam in Northern province, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MI 24 helicopter gunships and Kfir fighter aircraft
bombed areas southwest and east of Mankulam, destroying a large
number of rebel bunkers and inflicting heavy casualties on the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the exact figures of losses suffered by the
rebels were not immediately known though rebel transmissions
monitored by the troops had called for reinforcements to the
battle front.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting in the north and east of
the country for a separate state since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The government troops launched Jaya Sikuru operation on May 13
last year in a bid to recapture 75 kilometers of the main highway
between Vavuniya and Jaffna town which runs through the
rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
To date, the troops have recaptured 45 kilometers of the
highway after heavy fighting with the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Menem Calls for Changes in EU, U.S. Agriculture Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Argentine President
Carlos Menem Friday urged the European Union and the United States
to change their agricultural policies, which, he said, have
hampered the development of agricultural countries like his own.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after a meeting with his Finnish
counterpart Martti Ahtisaari, Menem said he hoped for a removal of
agricultural subsidies in the EU and lift of barriers by European
countries on lemon imports.
</P>
<P>
He asked Finland to facilitate the process of the EU's approval
of a trade agreement with the South American Common Market
(Mercosur), which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Finland was the first EU country to approve the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents focused their discussions on ways to further
develop political, economic and trade relations between the two
countries and exchanged views on EU-Mercosur ties, EU expansion,
reforms of the United Nations as well as nuclear tests by India
and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Menem also met with Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen and
attended a Finland-Argentina economic symposium held by the
Central Federation of Finnish Industries and Employers.
</P>
<P>
Argentina is Finland's number three trade partner in Latin
America. Bilateral trade rose to 140 million U.S. dollars in 1997,
with Finland registering a one-third growth in its exports to
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Close to 100 Finnish enterprises have factories, sales outlets
and other commercial operations in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Menem is to conclude the first state visit to Finland by an
Argentine president on Saturday when he wraps up his Nordic tour,
which also took him to Sweden and Norway.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Peru and the United States are
building an anti-drug military training center in northwestern
Peru to combat drug traffickers using jungle waterways, press
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Amazon jungle of Iquitos, Loreto Department, the

Training will focus on controlling waterways as more drug
traffickers resort to the use of a complicated network of jungle
rivers after effective interdiction in the air by the Peruvian Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
The center will house 140 students and may acquire a regional
character in the future. It is being built under a 60-million
U.S. dollar, five-year program agreed upon by the two countries in
1996.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesians Urged to Observe World No Tobacco Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- the Indonesian government has
called on the people in the country to observe the World No
Tobacco Day on May 31, said Sampurno, director general for drug
and food control at the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Sampurno was quoted by Antara News Agency Saturday as saying
that the World Health Organization (WHO) has asked all member
countries of the United Nations to take active part in the No
Tobacco Day activities under the theme "Growing Up Without
Tobacco".
</P>
<P>
To welcome the 1998 No Tobacco Day, Sampurno said, the
Indonesian government is to expand the no-smoking areas at offices
and schools, distribute posters on the dangers of smoking in
public places and present WHO awards to the country's leading
Kompas daily and film actor Roy Marten for their roles in voicing
the hazards of smoking.
</P>
<P>
He said that still many cigarette sellers are found at public
places enabling teenagers to buy them. Such a condition might be
detrimental to the quality of human resources, particularly that
of the younger generation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Heart Foundation executive director H. Masino hoped
that the people would not smoke on the No Tobacco Day on May 31
and mass media would not carry cigarette advertisements on that
day.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Consumers Institute Foundation chairperson Tini
Hadad urged the government to issue regulations requiring
cigarette producers to write a clear warning on every pack of
cigarettes and advertisement that "smoking is detrimental to
health".
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Health Ministry showed that male
smokers in Indonesia in 1980 reached 46.6 percent and increased to
52.9 percent in 1986, while female smokers in 1980 reached 2.4
percent and increased to 3.6 percent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 survey showed that 23 percent of the Indonesian people
aged above ten years were smokers, and more than 50 percent were
15 to 19 years old.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Standby Credit for Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) approved on Friday a 12-month standby credit for Bosnia and
Herzegovina in an amount equivalent to 81 million U.S. dollars, in
support of the government's 1998-99 program.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, an amount equivalent to 32 million dollars is
available immediately.
</P>
<P>
The economic strategy under the 1998-99 program is based on
four elements: a fixed exchange rate under a currency board
arrangement; budgets that are supportive of reconstruction and
social needs, while avoiding any domestic borrowing; external
financial assistance to help supplement limited domestic resources
and promote economic recovery; and acceleration of the transition
to a market economy through structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the economic growth in 1998 is projected at
30 percent, inflation at 10 percent, and gross international
reserves to reach the equivalent of 3.5 months of merchandise
imports.
</P>
<P>
Since Bosnia and Herzegovina succeeded to membership in the IMF
of the former Yugoslavia in 1995, its quota is about 162 million
dollars; its outstanding use of IMF credit currently totals about
40 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile said that he would invest government power in just "two or
three persons," The National Monitor daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The premier, who is also general secretary of the National
Christian Democratic Peasant Party, made the decision because he
was annoyed by "the indiscipline" of some government members, said
the daily.
</P>
<P>
The possible beneficiaries of this measure are Defense Minister
Victor Babiuc, also vice-chairman of the Democratic Party, and
Minister of Justice Valeriu Stoica, prime vice-chairman of the
National Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
The National Christian Democratic Peasant Party, the Democratic
Party and the National Liberal Party are the major partners in the
ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Minister of Industry and Trade Radu Berceanu,
a Democratic Party member, made changes in the Board of Directors
of three large state corporations "without a previous consultation
with the prime minister and other ruling coalition leaders," which
led to a new tension in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Obviously affected by the consequences of the replacement, the
prime minister declared that he would take "clear measures of
concentrating the decision-making power on two or three persons."

<HEADLINE> Pak Nuclear Weapons Solely for Defense: Foreign Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's nuclear weapons are
solely meant for national self-defense and will never be used for
offensive purposes, Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to weaponize our nuclear program was dictated by
the imperative need to preserve regional peace and security that
was gravely threatened by India's overt weaponization and the
consequential collapse of the existential deterrence," Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed was speaking to foreign ambassadors and heads of
diplomatic missions based in Islamabad, who were summoned to the
Foreign Ministry, according to a government press release issued
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said that India, after carrying out five
nuclear tests earlier this month, threatened Pakistan with nuclear
blackmail to impose a military solution to the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of the immediacy and magnitude of the threat posed
to our security, and in the absence of any credible security
guarantees, Pakistan was left with no choice but to take steps to
restore the strategic balance in South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan detonated five nuclear devices Thursday as a response
to India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan proposes that "all members of the international
community should join us in addressing the implications of
nuclearization of South Asia with a view to evolving effective,
non-discriminatory and verifiable measures to promote peace,
stability and enhance confidence in the Indian ocean and adjacent
regions," Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
He told the envoys that Pakistan is prepared to resume dialogue
on peace and security with India despite the current situation.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Crude Prices Show Sign of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Energy and Mines
Minister Erwin Arrieta said Friday that the benchmark price for a
Venezuelan basket of crudes and byproducts for export registered
an increase of 10 cents per barrel, from 10.95 to 11.05 dollars
this past week.
</P>
<P>
International oil prices also tended to show signs of
recovering after an agreement between independent producers and
OPEC stabilized supply and the demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
The price of a barrel of oil from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) remained at 13.26 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Arrieta said the three weeks preceding the OPEC conference,
which is scheduled for June 24 in Vienna, will be important
because the behavior of oil prices during that period will
influence the decisions oil cartels will make.
</P>
<P>
He said so far there has been no word of a new cut in oil
production other than that agreed on in Riyahd, which has reached
1.7 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
According to Arrieta, the OPEC oil ministers "live united by
the telephone almost every day" and have agreed to await for the
market answer in terms of volume and price.
</P>
<P>
"If by the date of the OPEC meeting the market answers
positively, nothing will be done, but if the answer is negative,
then we will sit down and discuss alternate solutions including an
additional reduction of volume," he said.

DHAKA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad has urged both India and Pakistan to work for peace
instead of testing nuclear weapons, local press reports said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I condemn none, but request India and Pakistan to work for
peace and development," Azad was quoted as saying at a seminar
here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern at the explosions of nuclear devices by
the two countries, saying that they had created tension in the
South Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, the subcontinent and the world "should be
nuclear-free", he stressed, reiterating the country's resolute
stand for disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Azad said in clear terms that Bangladesh, which already signed
CTBT (the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) and NPT
(Non-Proliferation Treaty), was against all conflicts and arms
race.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that when Bangladesh was striving for peace in the
spirit of regional cooperation, nuclear devices were being
detonated by two of the SAARC (South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation) member countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas Friday
expressed deep regret over Pakistan's decision to conduct
underground nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
He said that as party to the NPT and CTBT, Indonesia "cannot
justify nuclear arms tests by any country, including Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Alatas said that Indonesia took the same stance when India
conducted nuclear tests early this month. the series of nuclear
tests has inevitably heightened tension in subcontinent South
Asia. "The national security policy should be implemented without
using weapons," he added

<HEADLINE> Ningbo to Spend 21 Million Yuan on Inland River Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Ningbo, a port city in east China's
Zhejiang Province, will spend 21 million yuan (about 2.6 million
US dollars) on inland river treatment this year.
</P>
<P>
The city has more than 30 inland rivers, with a total length of
100 kilometers and an area of more than 2.2 million square
meters. These rivers are suffering from mounting siltation, eroded
river banks, and degradation of water quality.
</P>
<P>
The Liuxi and Zhongtang rivers are the key treatment targets,
and work has already been under way on the Liuxi River. Trees will
be planted along a 1,200-meter section of the river and a series
of landscaped buildings will be constructed along the river.
</P>
<P>
City officials say the treatment work on the two rivers is
expected to be completed by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua, Honduras Anchor Buoy in Gulf of Fonseca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua and Honduras have placed
a master buoy to identify the maritime borders between the two
countries in the Gulf of Fonseca, the Nicaraguan Foreign Affairs
Ministry said Friday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's "marking" ceremony was presided over by foreign
affairs ministers Emilio Alvarez of Nicaragua and Fernando
Martinez of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
The master buoy was placed as the first step in identifying the
maritime boundaries in the gulf according to the limits determined
by the joint commissions of the two countries. The demarcation
will prevent fishing conflicts, military and diplomatic
differences.
</P>
<P>
"The buoy provides a definitive line between the two
countries. We request fishermen to respect the dividing line we
are marking today in order to prevent incidents," said the
Honduran minister.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan Territorial Studies Institute said the master
buoy is located at 12 degrees 58 minutes and 51.06 seconds north
latitude; and 87 degrees 24 minutes and 12.45 seconds west
longitude.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers called on the joint technical commission to
proceed on June 15 to place the rest of the signal buoys.

<P>
BELGRADE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia proved it a team to be
watched on next month's World Cup finals in France as they
overwhelmed fellow qualifiers Nigeria 3-0 in a warm-up match here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Predrag Mijatovic, whose goal gave Real Madrid the trophy of
the European Cup last week, put the home side ahead with a diving
header from a cross of subsitute Slobodan Komljenovic seconds
before halftime.
</P>
<P>
The Real midfielder intersected Taribo West's back pass to
Nigeria's goalkeeper Abiodun Baruwa and scored a second in the
61st minute.
</P>
<P>
Darko Kovacevic, the subsititute to Savo Milosevic in the
second half, slotted home in the 72nd minute after a spectacular
run through the Nigerian defence.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria showed some fine midfield play in the first half but
could not catch up with the faster and better marshalled attack of
the Yugoslav team.
</P>
<P>
The home side had at least three more golden chances to enlarge
the gap as the veteran playmaker Dragan Stojkovic controlled the
game in his own style.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian guerrilla
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), has

<HEADLINE> U.S. Footballers to Use Bonus to Promote Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. World Cup team players
have voted to use their own bonus to promote soccer and create
their own logo for the World Cup after the national soccer
governing body failed to market the squad adequately.
</P>
<P>
The players, who constitute the only unionized national team in
the United States, agreed to hand out 50,000 U.S. dollars - about
$2,500 per player - from their World Cup qualifying earnings to
cover the development of a World Wide Web site designed to promote
soccer and the U.S. players.
</P>
<P>
The Web site would be distinct from one operated by the
national governing body, the U.S. Soccer Federation. An address
for the site has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
"We go out around here and people don't even know we have a
game on Saturday against Scotland", team captain Thomas Dooley
said Friday. "There is much more to do. If USSF officials don't
want to do it, we would like to promote soccer in America in our
own way."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a tension has been built up on business
dealings between the players and the USSF. The USSF controls some
marketing rights of the players.
</P>
<P>
The players voted to spend 10,000 dollars to create their own
logo. They examined the red, white and blue logo for the first
time yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Because they do not have the marketing rights to the term
"U.S. National Team" - the USSF holds those rights - the players
decided to use the term "U.S. Natioanl Soccer Players" on their
logo.
</P>
<P>
They hope to receive T-shirts and hats bearing their new logo
to wear during the World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
Under their collective bargaining agreement with the USSF, the
players received one million U.S. dollars for qualifying for the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
USSF president Alan Rothenberg could not be reached for
comment.

<HEADLINE> Germany Reports Sharp Rise in Juvenile Delinquencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of crimes committed by
teenagers rose sharply in Germany last year despite a slight drop
in the overall crime rate, the German Interior Ministry said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the ministry on Friday, the
number of crimes committed by children aged up to 14 years surged
10.1 percent to about 144,000 cases in 1997. Crimes committed by
young people aged between 14 and 18 years also rose by 5.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
In total, Germany registered about 6.6 million crimes last
year, down 0.9 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But violent crimes again grew by 2.8 percent last year,
continuing a trend registered every year since 1994. High
unemployment and harder competition in the society were cited by
the authorities as the main reasons for the increased
aggresiveness of criminals.

<HEADLINE> New Hiring Plans Remain Strong for U.S. High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, May 29 (Xinhua) -- While there are layoffs, the
U.S. high-technology sector is likely to outpace their
non-technology peers in employment growth, according to a services
firm's study released this week.
</P>
<P>
The study, in which Coopers &AMP; Lybrand interviewed CEOs from 430
product and service companies, found about 85 percent of the CEOs
at technology companies expect to add new employees during the
next 12 months. Overall, workforce growth for technology companies
is expected to climb 19.5 percent this year, compared with 11.7
percent for non-technology companies.
</P>
<P>
The hot markets that will drive this growth are in the
information technology, Internet and software-development arenas,
industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
These service-oriented sectors employed about 2.5 million last
year, up from 1.9 million seven years ago, according to a recent
report from the American Electronics Association. Jobs in the
software business alone doubled in the seven-year span, climbing
from 364,000 to almost 700,000.
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the growth story, there have been layoff
announcements in recent months. Pressures caused by a PC inventory
glut, the Asian financial crisis and a competitive pricing
environment have caused some chip makers, semiconductor-equipment
companies, PC original equipment manufacturers, and peripherals
manufacturers to move ahead with belt-tightening efforts and lay
off lower-skilled workers who no longer fit into the corporate
structure.
</P>
<P>
On the cutback list are such big companies as Intel, National
Semiconductor, Seagate Technology, Compaq and Applied Materials,
each with employment cuts ranging from 1,000 to up 15,000.
</P>
<P>
But analysts say the layoffs do not necessarily signal
unhealthy employment trends. Rather, they say high-tech in the
United States overall continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
John Sargent, a senior policy analyst at the U.S. Department of
Commerce said that the layoffs also indicate companies are coming
to grips with a changing business model. Many are trying to make
the leap into the global marketplace, integrate systems, create a
more efficient supply chain, and, basically, move into the
Information Age, all of which requires a different business model.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Warns of Consequences of Disarmament Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, leader of the Sinn
Fein party in the British province of Northern Ireland, said here
Friday that the focus on disarmament in Northern Ireland could
wreck the new peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Adams said that he was also
worried about attempts to exclude his party from executive
positions after elections in June.
</P>
<P>
Adams described disarming the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and
the paramilitary Unionist groups as a "dead-end issue" which
opponents of the agreement could use to obstruct it.
</P>
<P>
"There is an attempt now to claw back, to present this
(decommissioning weapons) as a precondition, as an obstacle, to
prevent, if we get a mandate, our party from taking up positions
on the executive or putting our representatives into ministries.
That cannot be allowed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"One of the purposes of the visit here is to warn people of how
this obstructed and collapsed the peace process before," he added.
</P>
<P>
Adams is expected to meet senior officials of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
He said he wants to talk about mechanisms under the new
agreement for bringing about equality, an end to discrimination,
demilitarization, a release of prisoners and economic
regeneration.
</P>
<P>
In a referendum on May 22, the Irish people in both Ireland and
Northern Ireland voted for the peace agreement, a major step in
ending the three-decade conflict between pro-Irish and pro-British
groups.
</P>
<P>
"We also want to warn everyone of the dangers of
cherry-picking, of taking out one issue and presenting it as
superior or as a precondition to any other issue.
</P>
<P>
"I also want to make the case that if Sinn Fein receives a
mandate in this election the people who vote for us must be
treated exactly the same as every other voter," he said.

</P>
<P>
-- Between 1987 and 1996 the infant mortality rate declined
markedly in some countries in Asia and the America;
</P>
<P>
-- Declines in mortality were registered on every continent,
as measured by lower infant mortality and increased life
expectancy; and

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Russia's New Economic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Friday welcomed emergency economic plan, which was announced
earlier in the day by Russia as a "solid strategy for fiscal
reform."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Clinton said the U.S. would support the program
when it is reviewed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
adding that the plan would encourage strong IMF and World Bank
engagement in support of Russia's reform.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly welcome Russia's announcement today of its new
economic programme for 1998," Clinton said. But he clearly
offered no new financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
"This programme, developed in consultation with the IMF,
signals Russia's commitment to a bold economic reform agenda to
strengthen financial stability and encourage investment and
growth," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a financial crisis, the Russian government
announced a number of new emergency measures, including increased
tax collections, spending cuts and hastened privatization.
</P>
<P>
"It gives Russian officials the authority they need to collect
taxes, crack down on companies that ignore their obligations to
the government and control spending in line with revenues,"
Clinton said, referring to the plan.
</P>
<P>
"What is now important is to carry out these reforms decisively
and resolutely," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Russian reform chief Anatoly Chubais, who
left the government two months ago, held top level meetings with
U.S. officials here on Friday. Reports say that Chubais came to
lobby for new assistance.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. administration denies it. "My understanding is
that, in his meetings with the administration, Mr. Chubais did not
ask for such an additional package," State Department spokesman
James Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Says Tobacco Undermines Child Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Carol Bellamy, Executive
Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), said on
Friday that the observance of World No-Tobacco Day on May 31
should mark the beginning of a global drive to halt the rapid
spread of tobacco-related illness, a scourge that is sabotaging
UNICEF's day-to-day efforts to save children in developing
countries from dying of preventable causes.
</P>
<P>
"There is no cause of premature death more preventable than the
use of tobacco," Bellamy said. "That is why UNICEF condemns the
calculated shift of the tobacco market from its shrinking consumer
base in the industrialized countries to the vast, predominantly
young populations of the developing world."
</P>
<P>
The Executive Director said the tobacco industry's actions are
a prescription for a global health catastrophe, especially for
children and women, who are the prime targets for tobacco
advertising and promotion.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF chief, calling tobacco a major threat to child
rights, called for an urgent effort to develop a worldwide
strategy to treat tobacco products commensurate with the harm they
cause, beginning with prohibitions on all direct and indirect
tobacco advertising and associated promotional activities aimed at
children and young people.
</P>
<P>
Other steps, Bellamy said, should include bans on the sale of
tobacco to minors, substantial increases in the retail cost of
tobacco products and a massive educational campaign to promote
awareness of the addictiveness of nicotine and the dangers of
smoking.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF chief said action against the expansion of the
global tobacco market could grow out of alliances involving
governments, multilateral institutions, non-governmental
organizations and other representatives of civil society and
private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
"Children have an absolute right to be protected from tobacco
addiction, including the effects of adult smoking, which can
compromise a child's health even before birth," the Executive
Director said.
</P>
<P>
"And they have a right to be protected from tobacco's
collateral effects, including the diversion of household money
that could pay for a child's education and medical care, and the
sorrow and financial loss that occurs when adult caregivers die
early deaths because of tobacco," the Executive Director added.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's advocacy of worldwide curbs on tobacco products is
based on the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, the most
widely embraced human rights instrument in history. The
agreements, ratified by 191 countries, obligates governments to
safeguard the health of infants and children; protect children
from drugs and exploitation; and promote health education.
