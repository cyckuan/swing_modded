Zuma said cultural development would be a key focus for the
region because it would attract the type of investment that
created work without spoiling the natural resources and beauty of
the region.
</P>
<P>
He said St Lucia's great beauty was contradicted with poverty
and underdevelopment, saying that 95 percent of the people in the

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Syrian-Israeli Joint Efforts Toward Just Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Thursday called for joint efforts by Syria and Israel to
reach a just and comprehensive peace under the land-for-peace
principle.
</P>
<P>
"No one party can lead the negotiations to a successful end,"
Moussa was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "fair peace is impossible if Israel insists on
ignoring the rights of the Arabs."
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel have resumed peace talks in Washington, the
United States, after a suspension of more than three years.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa on Wednesday and Thursday tried to work out a
framework for the negotiations on Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights it captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War, security
arrangements, water resources and normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa "should stick to (his country's) demand to get the
Golan Heights back because this is essential for peace and for
closing the Arab-Israeli file, taking into consideration the
balance of interests between the two parties," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He said he "preferred to remain optimistic" about the results of
the peace talks between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, expressed welcome to the resumption of the Israei-Syrian
talks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa flew to the Syrian capital Damascus on Sunday to
coordinate with al-Sharaa stances on the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Egyptian-Israeli ties, Moussa said the
relations between the governments are normal, but when it comes to
the peoples, "the matter is different because (the Egyptians) feel
that (the Arabs') rights are imperiled."
</P>
<P>
The relations will not be fully normalized before Israel freezes
settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories,
stops confiscating Arab lands and refrain from delaying the
implementation of the accords signed with the Palestinians, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Clerides Voices Some Optimism on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said Thursday the proximity talks on Cyprus and the
European Union (EU) summit have to some extent brought about a
change in the prospects of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
On his return from New York where he attended the U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks, Clerides confirmed that a second round will take
place late January to clarify the positions the two sides held in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash began the
proximity talks on December 3 under the auspices of U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
During the talks from December 3 through 14, the U.N. officials
held separate talks with the two leaders, aimed at paving the way
for substantive negotiations for the settlement of the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said during the proximity talks the two sides made
clear their positions on all issues, but noted that one side does
not know what the other has told the U.N. due to a blackout policy
adopted by the U.N..
</P>
<P>
But he appeared satisfied with a resolution approved by the U.N.
on Wednesday, which renews the mandate of the U.N. peace-keeping
force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) as it reconfirmed previous resolutions on
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island through a
bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula. But the Turkish Cypriots,
who walked out of the peace negotiations in 1997, conditioned the
resumption of the talks on the recognition of their breakaway
republic in the north.
</P>
<P>
The request has been rejected by Cypriot government and the U.
N..
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded EU summit granted Turkey EU candidacy while
reconfirming that Cyprus' EU accession can be achieved even if the
Cyprus issue is not settled.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus, is the
staunch supporter of Turkish Cypriots. Turkey's removal from EU
candidates list was the key reason for Turkish Cypriots' boycott of
the talks in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The president said that in the second round of talks, "an in-
depth examination of the positions expressed by the two sides will
take place."

<HEADLINE> IDB Assists Peru to Recover From El Nino Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) approved Thursday a loan of 120 million U.S.
dollars to Peru to assist the reconstruction of physical
infrastructure and the resumption of services affected by the El
Nino climate phenomenon, which produced disastrous flooding during
1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The resources will be applied to the transportation, sanitation,
education and health sectors, and the investments are expected to
directly benefit the population living in poverty in the program's
service areas, the IDB said.
</P>
<P>
The loan brings the total IDB financing to Peru to combat the
El Nino disaster to 270 million dollars. In 1997, the bank
approved a 150-million-dollar loan to Peru for disaster recovery,
reconstruction, and prevention. The new loan reflects a higher
level of damage from flooding resulting from the El Nino
phenomenon than originally anticipated.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is 171 million dollars. The IDB
loan is for a 25-year term, with a four-year grace period, at the
variable annual interest rate, now 6.84 percent. Local counterpart
funds a total of 51 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara came to the White House to meet U.S. President
Bill Clinton at around 2:15 p.m. (1915GMT) after his second
session of talks with Israeli Prime minister Ehud Barak on
Thursday, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Israeli sources said the talks were likely
to end with a statement by Clinton announcing a new round of
discussions early next year in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli officials said that the negotiations were likely to
resume at the same political level. U.S. officials declined all
comments on whether Clinton might make a statement or what he
might say.
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks between Israel and Syria starting on
Wednesday were aimed at working out a roadmap for the two parties
to get to a peace agreement, which would largely deal with the
Golan Heights -- Syria's territory snatched by Israel during the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria demands a full return of the strategic plateau while
Israel could ask some adjustment for the sake of security.

"I think you can anticipate there are going to be some problems

little likelihood these problems will lead to any military

As a precaution, U.S. troops stationed abroad will operate at a

The U.S. Defense Department has spent 3.6 billion U.S. dollars

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa called on
Thursday for speedy implementation of the peace accord in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to prevent conflict from
escalating, South African Press Associated reported.
</P>
<P>
"If the implementation is accelerated, then we can stop the
escalation of the breaches of the cease-fire," South African
foreign minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said in Kigali, capital of
Rwanda, where she was paying a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
She said despite the fighting in northwestern Congo, it seems
all parties remain committed to the accord, aimed at ending the
year long war.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace agreement was signed in July this year by the
DRC government and the countries involved in the conflict
including Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, and by DRC
rebels in August.
</P>
<P>
During her visit, Zuma is also expected to sign an agreement
deepening trade and cultural ties between South Africa and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Zuma's spokesman, Khangelani Hlongwane, said the foreign
minister would leave Kigali on Friday for a weekend conference of
African foreign ministers in Arusha, Tanzania, which will focus on
African security, development and cooperation and the role of the

<HEADLINE> GA President Urges Political Will in Reforming UN Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Theo-Ben Gurirab,
President of the United Nations General Assembly on Friday called
on the Members States to demonstrate political will in reforming
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Opening a debate of the General Assembly on the reform of the
Security Council, Gurirab said "It goes without saying that all of
us agree on the need to reform and enlarge the Security Council in
all respects, in order for this vital U.N. organ to reflect the
changes of the modern world and be respective to the wishes of all
the Member States in the spirit of equality and justice."
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty is in deciding how this should be brought about
and how such changes will assure equality, representation,
transparency and effectiveness we all want. Collective human
ingenuity created the U.N. in 1945. That ingenuity is still here
and better informed than ever before. What is lacking today is
political will," Gurirab said.
</P>
<P>
The President said that it was most important to provide the
Member States with an opportunity, at this stage, to reiterate
their support of the U.N., including and specifically to express
themselves on the equitable representation on and enlargement of
the membership of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"I do not, therefore, expect any concrete conclusion coming out
of this debate at this time. I will, however, be listening to
helpful ideas and suggestions from the speakers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all Member States to use this opportunity to
offer constructive ideas and insights that will help move the
process forward.

CARACAS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan cabinet ministers
met Thursday for a second consecutive day to study the way to
solve the problems caused by intense rains.
</P>
<P>
The toll to date has been 43 dead, 80 injured, 20,000 homeless
and 120,000 affected in other ways for the rains, said the
authorities.

Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel called on Venezuelans to

<HEADLINE> G-20 Finance Ministers, Central Bank Governors Agree on Agenda on Financial Crises Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, December 16 (Xinhua)--Finance Ministers and Central
Bank Governors of G-20 Thursday afternoon ended their first
informal meeting here with a 6-point announcement aimed to prevent
possible global financial crises in the future.
</P>
<P>
The G-20, a new group including world's seven industrial
nations and most important emerging markets, was established to
provide a new mechanism for "informal dialogues" between
industrial nations and developing countries, said German Finance
Minister Hans Eichel who hosted the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference after the meeting, Eichel
called the G-20 forum "a positive signal to strengthen the
international financial architecture."
</P>
<P>
His Canadian counterpart Paul Martin, who chaired the meeting
on Thursday, said the G-20 marked "the first step of the reform on
international financial system."
</P>
<P>
The G-20 Ministers and Governors had agreed on several issues
crucial to global financial stability, said Martin.
</P>
<P>
They called for reforms on the domestic economic policies in
member countries to reduce vulnerabilities to financial crises.
</P>
<P>
"The major contribution to world economy," said Martin, "is
priority of their economic policy reform."
</P>
<P>
And they achieved common understanding on evaluating their
current compliance with international standards of financial
transparency.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ministers urged the International Monetary Fund(IMF)
to complete Reports of Transparency and Financial System Stability
Assessments.
</P>
<P>
The broad adoption of a set of financial coding and conduct
rules is of importance to global financial security, said Martin.
</P>
<P>
"The global economy must have global rules of game," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that "more should be done" to set up a
solution frame to prevent private capital flows from shocking the
world financial system, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and Governors underlined the impact of exchange-rate
regimes, saying a stable exchange-rate system is critical to
international financial stability.
</P>
<P>
As further steps, G-20 Ministers will ask their deputies to
take part in other relative forum, the Financial Stability Forum
being the most important.
</P>
<P>
They are scheduled to report the achievement at the second
meeting in next autumn in Canada, said Martin.
</P>
<P>
The G-20 is composed of the G-7 industrial nations and other
major economies, such as Argentina, Brazil, China, Korea, India,
Russia and Saudi Arabia. Finland, as the rotating president,
attended the meeting representing the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
These countries account for some 85 per cent of the world's
annual product and two thirds of the population.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting were two most important
international financial institutions, namely the IMF and the World
Bank.

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Ban on Tanzanian Fish Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has
lifted the ban on Tanzania's fish export.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made Thursday by the head of the
delegation of the European Commission Peter Beck Christiansen at a
press conference in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The official said the ban was lifted after the Standing
Veterinary Committee (SVC) of the European Union had recommended
the European Commission to modify its ban decision made in March
this year and allow the imports of fishery products originating in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In March, EU suspended imports of fresh fish fillets from Lake
Victoria, following reports that fishermen of Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda have used cotton pesticides to poison fish. The three
countries suffered great loss in foreign exchange earnings from
the trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
An inspection team from the Food and Veterinary Office of the
European Commission came to the region in August 1999 to assess
the safety guarantees provided to fishery products.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Christiansen said Tanzania had fully complied with
required standards and that the ban would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
He, however, argued that because Tanzania shares common borders
on Lake Victoria with Uganda and Kenya, it was necessary that the
three countries maintain uniform standard of fish exports.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Sets Another Record in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
October's deficit in trade in goods and services was up 7.4
percent from the August imbalance of 24.2 billion dollars, the
Department reported.
</P>
<P>
Imports jumped 1.6 percent to an all-time high of 107.9 billion
dollars, reflecting the rising oil import bill and record imports
of consumer goods ranging from clothing to camping gear.
</P>
<P>
Exports were down 0.1 percent to 81.9 billion dollars as sales
of farm products, telecommunications equipment, computers and
tobacco all declined.
</P>
<P>
The report said that through the first 10 months of this year,
the U.S. trade deficit is running at an annual rate of 262 billion
dollars, far surpassing last year's record deficit of 164.3
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit has set a new monthly record seven out of 10
months this year. It is the one major blot on an otherwise stellar
economic performance. Even though manufacturing has been forced to
cut one-half million jobs in the past two years as export sales
have fallen, the overall unemployment rate has fallen to a 30-year
low of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the U.S. deficit with Japan jumped 8.1
percent to a record 7.2 billion dollars in October, equaling the
deficit with China.
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. exports to Mexico and imports from that country rose
to record levels, but the trade deficit narrowed slightly to 1.4
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. deficit with Canada, its largest trading partner,
increased to 3.2 billion dollars while the deficit with the
countries of Western Europe climbed to 5 billion dollars as
imports from that area jumped to an all-time high of 19.4 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. deficit in petroleum also hit a record in October,
widening to 6.4 billion dollars as the average price of a barrel
of crude oil climbed to 20.74 dollars, the highest level since
January 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Savimbi to Retire From Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Undersecretary of State
for Political Affairs Thomas Pickering Thursday urged the Angolan
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi to retire from politics.
</P>
<P>
The retirement of Jonas Savimbi will be a "positive
contribution" to the pacification of Angola, Pickering said before
leaving Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official appealed to the rebels of the National Union
for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Savimbi to
renounce arms and seek legal ways for meeting their claims.
</P>
<P>
But Pickering said that it is impossible for the U.S.
government to exert influence on the rebel leader at present
because nobody knows Savimbi' s whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned that the U.S. government has been appealing
for tolerance and reconciliation between the Angolan government
and the UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
Pickering said that he had found a series of methods productive
of results through which the U.S. and Angola can cooperate in
promoting the durable peace and developing the Angolan economy.
</P>
<P>
After talking with the Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, Pickering said that "the circumstances for the peace are
closer."
</P>
<P>
With an aim to make an appraisal on the general situation in
Angola, as preparation for reorienting the U.S. Angola policy.
</P>
<P>
During his 24-hour visit, he also met with Angolan Foreign
Minister Joao Miranda, Defense Minister Kundy Paihama and the
opposition leaders in parliament.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Party Suggests to Exclude Savimbi from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Angola's opposition Democratic
Reforming Party stressed here Thursday that Jonas Savimbi, head of
the UNITA rebels, should be excluded from the national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
It's necessary to reach a national reconciliation among all
Angolans, president of the party, Luis dos Passos, told a press
conference on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the
founding of his party.
</P>
<P>
But Savimbi, head of the rebel National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), should be abandoned, dos Passos
stressed, accusing Savimbi of rekindling the flame of civil war
and killing thousands of Angolan citizens.
</P>
<P>
The party leader also announced that his party will lead a
political campaign for promoting the process of the national
reconciliation in the coming 21st century.
</P>
<P>
According to dos Passos, the Democratic Reforming Party will
always be a party with constructive ideas, which will not limit
itself to criticizing the government.
</P>
<P>
It will also give constructive proposals to the government in a
bid to end the suffering of the Angolan people, the party leader
said.
</P>
<P>
After analyzing the latest development of the international
situation and the domestic crisis, dos Passos warned the Angolan
government of an "international collusion aiming to lead Angola to
bankruptcy."

LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) - Britain's manufacturing sector
is still in the doldrums this month despite an upturn in export
orders, according to a survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Total manufacturing orders remained flat in December in
comparison with November, the Confederation of British Industry's
latest industrial trends survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two percent of manufacturers said their total order
books were below normal, while 17 percent said they were above
normal, for a balance of minus 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of manufacturers said their export orders were
below normal, while 13 percent said they were above normal, the

</P>
<P>
Although 31 percent of firms expect output to rise over the
next four months, it is commonly believe that strong Sterling will

ATHENS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Greek students Thursday
conducted rallies in Athens and other large cities across the
country in protest to the state education reforms and the
government decision to allow public prosecutors to intervene in
sit-in protests at schools.
</P>
<P>
In Athens, some 3,500 secondary school students held a two-hour
march through the city's main streets, causing the usual traffic
congestion.
</P>
<P>
To protest against the Education Ministry pushing through new
examination and grading systems, Greek students effectively closed
down schools throughout the country for about three months late
last year.
</P>
<P>
The school occupations has reportedly caused an estimated 6
billion drachmas (about 18.7 million U.S. dollars) in damage.

On December 8, Greek students had staged demonstrations in
Athens and other cities, and they will have similar rallies on

MAPUTO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Results from 10 of Mozambique's
11 provinces for the December 3-5 general elections show that
incumbent President Joaquim Chissano has a significant lead over
his major rival, Renamo presidential candidate Afonso Dhlakama,
the Mozambique News Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party (Frelimo) also
leads over the main opposition Mozambican National Resistance
(Renamo).

Chissano won 2,107,054 votes while Dhlakama got 1,820,746 . In
the parliamentary poll, Frelimo had 1,831,526 votes while Renamo
got 1,385,529.

The province missing is Nampula, which is the largest
constituency and send 50 deputies to the country's parliament, the
Assembly of the Republic. Dhlakama might have an upper hand in
this province.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here projected that Chissano would win the

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.S., Britain for Blocking Communications                 Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Transport and
Communications Minister Ahmad Murtadha Ahmad Thursday slammed the
U.S. and British envoys at the U.N. Sanctions Committee for
blocking its contracts signed under the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, the minister
said the U.S. and British envoys had deliberately suspended 52 out
of 53 communications contracts valued at 175 million U.S. dollars.
The contracts were concluded under the fourth, fifth and sixth
phases of the oil-for-food deal with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
He said those blocked contracts were for the purchase of
different communications equipment, land stations, microwave
networks, mobile telephone systems, cables, generators and
batteries from France, China, Italy, India, Egypt, Vietnam,
Malaysia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iraq's Higher Education Minister Abd
al-Jabbar Tawfiq said Thursday that U.S. and British envoys blocked
his ministry's 27 contracts that are worth 3.36 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the items his ministry had received in the past six
phases were valued at less than 30 percent of the total amount of
fund allocated to his ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal now in its seventh phase, Iraq is
allowed to sell 5.2 billion dollars worth of oil in every six
months to buy food, medicine and other relief supplies for its
people reeling under the U.N. sanctions. The sanctions were imposed
on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys at
the Sanctions Committee of deliberately blocking the approval of
its contracts and impeding the implementation of the humanitarian
program.

<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain freed top IRA guerrilla
Padraig Wilson from prison in Belfast on Thursday under Northern
Ireland's Good Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Wilson, 42, was the 308th guerrilla from the province's rival
republican and loyalist militias to have been freed early from
their sentences since the deal was signed in April 1998, the
Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Until recently he was the leader of the Irish Republican Army's
inmates in Maze prison, which holds extremists convicted during 30
years of strife in the British province.
</P>
<P>
Wilson was jailed for 24 years in 1991 for conspiracy to murder,
plotting an explosion and other charges.
</P>
<P>
Around 200 republican and pro-British loyalist prisoners are
still behind bars in the province including 134 in Maze prison,
where they are segregated in H-shaped cell-blocks. Other
republicans are held in Portlaoise prison in the Irish republic.

ADDIS ABABA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has signed an
agreement with a U.S. company to develop natural gas and other
related fluids in the Horn of Africa country, the Press Digest
weekly reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed early this month by the Ethiopian
government and the Texas-based Sikor Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said that some 1.4 billion U.S. dollars will
be earmarked for the project.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas was found in Ogaden and Southern Ethiopia in 1965.
However, the natural resources remained unexploited so far because
of absence of investors that would undertake the venture.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM to Visit Lebanon on Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss Thursday announced that Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-
Sharaa would visit Lebanon on Sunday to brief Lebanese leaders on
the outcome of the Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, al-Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
kicked off the two countries' first negotiations in nearly four
years.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day talks, the two sides will mainly deal with
such issues as Israeli withdrawal from Syria's Golan Heights,
security arrangements, the rights to the water resources and the
normalization of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, where Israel has been occupying a border strip in its
south since 1985, has been following Syrian foreign policy
especially on the Middle East peace Process.
</P>
<P>
Hoss denied a press speculation that his country has received a
formal invitation from the United States to reopen negotiations
with Israel on December 29.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that until now Lebanon has not formed a
negotiating team but has appointed Deputy Prime Minister Michel
Murr to lead his country's negotiations if they cover political
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats have said the resumption of Lebanese-Israeli talks
hinges on the result of the Syrian-Israeli talks and the date will
be announced once the first round of talks is concluded.

<HEADLINE> Former Lebanese PM Accuses Syria, Israel of Plot on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Lebanese Prime Minister
General Michel Aoun, who is living in exile in France, has accused
Syria and Israel of plotting on Lebanon with the support of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Figaro published on Thursday,
General Aoun said that Lebanon should be represented at the
resumed peace talks between Syria and Israel in Washington.
</P>
<P>
``Otherwise, there is a de facto plot between Syria and Israel
on the Lebanese issue, with the support of the United States,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Syria and Israel, both of which are ``occupying''
his home country, want to decide the fate of Lebanon without
consulting the latter.
</P>
<P>
``Politically, Lebanon does not exist, and the Lebanese
government, totally affiliated to Syria, will not be invited to
the talks but for adopting what has been decided without it,''
said the general, who was driven out of power by a Syrian-Lebanese
joint offensive on Beirut in 1990.
</P>
<P>
General Aoun, the former commander-in-chief of the Lebanese
army, launched ``a liberation war against Syrian occupation'' in
1988.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Affirms Jordan's Intellectual Property Rights Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has decided to remove
Jordan from an observation list of countries which it considers are
short of measures to protect the intellectual property rights, U.S.
Ambassador to Amman Williams Burns said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing, the ambassador welcomed the decision
announced Wednesday by U.S. Trade Representative Charline
Barshevsky.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the decision, coupled with Jordan's efforts to join
the World Trade Organization (WTO), would contribute to a growth in
the kingdom's national economy.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Barshevsky as saying that Jordan has shown a strong
commitment to protecting all kinds of intellectual property, and
its lifting from the list reflects a strong and developing
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a recent reconsideration of Jordan's
position on intellectual property rights protection.
</P>
<P>
The previous reconsideration carried out in April by the U.S.
Trade Office showed that Jordan had no protection for the rights on
pharmaceuticals in addition to a lack of protection for
publications.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the kingdom has passed a serious of intellectual
property rights laws in accordance with its agreements with the WTO
and with understandings it reached with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Joining the WTO is one of the strategic options of the kingdom
to lift its economy out of a chronic stagnation since the 1990 Gulf
Crisis, for which it was isolated by Arab countries due to its
sympathy and support for Baghdad after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is expected to achieve a 2.5 percent economic growth in
1999.

<HEADLINE> Minister Reaffirms Ottawa's Right Against Secession Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Intergovernmental
Affairs Minister Stephane Dion reaffirmed Wednesday that it is up
to the House of Commons to negotiate secession.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa has the right to refuse to engage in secession talks
after a Yes vote in case of a new referendum in Quebec province,
the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to Quebec's bill introduced earlier in the
day to counter the federal legislation based on a 1998 ruling of
the Supreme Court that requires a clear majority and a clear
question on any referendum.
</P>
<P>
"It's very simple. If, unfortunately, there was another
referendum," the determination would belong to the House of
Commons, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa is proposing a bill on clarity, while Quebec is
producing "a bill on ambiguity", he said.
</P>
<P>
The federal government last Friday tabled Bill C-20, which
proposes the House of Commons be in a decisive position to review
any referendum question posed by the Quebec government and to
decide what constitutes a clear majority of voters.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Quebec government Wednesday introduced its own
bill of "self-determination", saying "the people of Quebec alone
has the right to decide the political regime and the legal status
of Quebec."
</P>
<P>
The war of bills came after a series of polls showing a steady
decline in support of a third referendum on Quebec's secession
from Ottawa. The latest, conducted early in the month, indicated a
30 percent of Quebecers still standing for a new referendum.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa won the previous two referendums respectively in 1980
and 1995. But the Quebec government has said that it would call
another one if it saw a hope of win by the end of its term in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Syrian-Israeli Peace Talks Wrap up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 ( Xinhua ) -- Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak ended their
second session of two-day peace talks at the Blair House on
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Shara first came to the White House to meet President Bill
Clinton at around 2:15 p.m. (1915GMT) then followed by Barak, a U.
S. official said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Israeli sources said the talks were likely
to end with a statement by Clinton announcing a new round of
discussions early next year in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli officials said that the negotiations were likely to
resume at the same political level. U.S. officials declined all
comments on whether Clinton might make a statement or what he
might say.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli sources, three topics were on the table of
the negotiations: the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan
Heights, mechanics of implementing it and confidence-building
measures.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart credited the two sides with
a serious approach.
</P>
<P>
"We've brought them here to demonstrate they are serious about
peace, and now we know this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart did not discount the tough bargaining involved in
their talks, saying: "If these were easy issues to resolve, they
would have been resolved a long time ago," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks between Israel and Syria starting on
Wednesday were aimed at working out a roadmap for the two parties
to get to a peace agreement, which would largely deal with the
Golan Heights -- Syria's territory snatched by Israel during the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria demands a full return of the Strategic plateau while
Israel could ask some adjustment for the sake of security.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Governor Designated as New PM of Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Central Bank
Governor Mugur Isarescu late Thursday was designated as the new
prime minister to replace Radu Vasile who had been dismissed by
President Emil Constantinescu in a political crisis early this
week.
</P>
<P>
According to Constantinescu, he made the decision after long
consultations both with the ruling coalition and a large part of
the parliament opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The president asked the designated prime minister to have the
cabinet formed and the government program drawn up this week, as
the parliament is to discuss them Monday. Under the Romanian
constitution, Isarescu should have 10 working days to do the job.
</P>
<P>
Mugur Isarescu, 50, is a career economist who has been leading
the central bank since 1990. According to reports, Isarescu, who
several days ago had ruled out the possibility of his
participation in political affairs, accepted the premiership with
two preconditions: to have the final say in forming the cabinet,
and to be reinstated as head of the central bank after election
late next year.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu was the only non-party person in the list of possible
candidates which also included Interior Minister Constantin Dudu
Ionescu, head of the State Ownership Agency Radu Sarbu, as well as
Mircea Ciumara and Ulm Spineanu, both vice-chairmen of the
National Christian Democratic Peasant Party (NCDPP), a major party
in the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
His designation is seen here as a compromise between the
presidency, the NCDPP and other parties in the ruling coalition.
Sources said that the NCDPP had been supporting Ionescu for the
premiership, while Sarbu was favored by the president.
</P>
<P>
A political crisis broke out in Romania early this week after
the NCDPP and its major coalition partners withdrew their support
to Prime Minister Radu Vasile in a bid to force him out. Vasile
was dismissed by the president early Tuesday after his refusal to
leave the government. Vasile rejected the dismissal, which he said
is "unconstitutional," but later the same day, he expressed the
intention to remain a senator without mentioning resignation.
</P>
<P>
The crisis caused by the prime minister's ouster has stirred up
strong reaction from the media as well as the political forum of
Romania.
</P>
<P>
Most opposition parties and many legal experts have questioned
the authority of the president to dismiss Vasile. The largest
opposition Social Democratic Party said in a statement that under
the constitution only parliament has the right to sack the prime
minister. It demanded the president withdraw his decision.

<HEADLINE> GA President Urges Political Will in Reforming UN Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Theo-Ben Gurirab,
President of the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday
called on the Members States to demonstrate political will in
reforming the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Opening a debate of the General Assembly on the reform of the
Security Council, Gurirab said "It goes without saying that all of
us agree on the need to reform and enlarge the Security Council in
all respects, in order for this vital U.N. organ to reflect the
changes of the modern world and be respective to the wishes of all
the Member States in the spirit of equality and justice."
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty is in deciding how this should be brought about
and how such changes will assure equality, representation,
transparency and effectiveness we all want. Collective human
ingenuity created the U.N. in 1945. That ingenuity is still here
and better informed than ever before. What is lacking today is
political will," Gurirab said.
</P>
<P>
The President said that it was most important to provide the
Member States with an opportunity , at this stage, to reiterate
their support of the U.N., including and specifically to express
themselves on the equitable representation on and enlargement of
the membership of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"I do not, therefore, expect any concrete conclusion coming out
of this debate at this time. I will, however, be listening for
helpful ideas and suggestions from the speakers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all Member States to use this opportunity to
offer constructive ideas and insights that will help move the
process forward.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Resumes Oil Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
announced on Thursday that Iraqi oil sales had resumed after a
three-week interruption.
</P>
<P>
According the U.N., the first loading of Iraqi oil began
shortly after the midnight today at the port of Mina al-Bakr,
where some two million barrels were loaded.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the pricing formula for Iraqi oil exports under the
new phase was approved, clearing the way for a full resumption of
Iraqi oil sales under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30 contracts have already been received for oil
sales, of which four have already been approved by the U.N.
Security Council sanctions committee, U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq suspended its oil exports on November 24 to protest a
Security Council resolution which extended the phase six of oil-
for-food program for two week and it was extended for an
additional week later.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, which began to be implemented in late
1996, is aimed to ease the humanitarian crisis in the country
caused by the U.N. sanctions which have been in place for nine
years.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Iraq is allowed to sell 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and
other necessities for its people.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided last week to implement phase seven
of the oil-for-food program beginning on December 12, 1999.

LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Irish police have seized a haul
of cocaine valued at 4.2 million Irish pounds (about 5.42 million
U.S. dollars said reports here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 52 kilogram consignment was found hidden in boxes of
bananas at a north Dublin fruit and vegetable warehouse late
Wednesday, a Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
"This would be too large a load for the Irish market. We reckon
it was sent to the wrong country," the report quoted a police
spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police believed the cocaine had been transported in error from
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The cocaine found was part of a banana cargo which originated
in Colombia and was sent to Ireland from a major fruit
distribution depot in Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
Before this, the largest seizure of cocaine in Ireland this
year was seven kilograms, discovered during a police raid on a
Dublin hotel in October.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Printer Market Continues to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES`, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Strong consumer demand,
falling PC prices and the proliferation of PC/printer bundles have
built up the worldwide printer market, a U.S. market research firm
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide printer shipments in the third quarter this year were
up 18 percent from a year ago, reaching 16.4 million units,
according to data released by International Data Corporation (IDC).
In terms of value, the third quarter represented 6.9 billion U.S.
dollars, up 8 percent over the same quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The growth was largely driven by remarkable performance in Asia-
Pacific, Japan and the United States, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan, continued its recovery in the
third quarter. Total regional shipments reached 2.3 million units,
a 34 percent growth over the third quarter of 1998. The Japanese
market also showed signs of healthy growth, shipping 1.3 million
units, a 22 percent increase. Commercial demand for laser and
impact printers increased in the region, and color inkjet also
showed exuberant sales fueled by a surge in the demand for home
PCs.
</P>
<P>
The United States showed the strength of its economy with
shipments of more than 6 million units, 26 percent higher than the
quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Western Europe shipped 4.3 million units, up 5 percent. Strong
growth was also seen in the Canadian and Latin American printer
markets, up 29 percent and 17 percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton's Statement on Israel-Syria Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
made a statement Thursday at the White House on the two-day
Israeli-Syrian peace talks. Following is the full text of the
statement:
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 48 hours Israel and Syria have taken a critical
step in the journey toward peace. That journey will be a difficult
one, but with courage and perseverance on both sides, the result
will be deeply rewarding to the people of Israel and to the people
of Syria.
</P>
<P>
"In the course of their meetings with Secretary Albright and
with me, Prime Minister Barak and Foreign Minister Shara agreed to
make every effort to reach peace between Israel and Syria as part
of a just, lasting and comprehensive Middle East peace, based on
United Nations resolutions 242 and 338 and the Madrid terms of
reference.
</P>
<P>
"To that end the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister
agreed to return to Washington to continue the negotiations on an
intensive basis beginning January 3, 2000, about two weeks from
now. They have requested the United States to participate in these
negotiations, and we are honored to do so. They agreed to take
steps to make sure that these negotiations will be conducted in a
productive and positive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing a new beginning in the effort to achieve a
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. With Syrian-Israeli
negotiations off to a good start, Israeli-Lebanese negotiations
expected to begin soon and the Palestinian track well under way,
we can truly set our sights on a new and different Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"As I emphasized from the outset, the journey will be tough.
Nothing in the past 48 hours should lead us to believe otherwise.
But the parties are embarked on this path. They have agreed there
should be no looking back, for the sake of our generation and
generations yet to come.
</P>
<P>
"I thank the Prime Minister and his team. I thank Foreign
Minister Shara and his team. I thank Secretary Albright and those
in the American team. All of them have worked hard and I want
Israel and Syria to know they can count on the United States every
step of the way. Thank you very much."

<HEADLINE> International Crisis Affects Latin America: ECLA (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Commission for
Latin America (ECLA) said Thursday that the international
financial crisis persisted in 1999 for the second year in a row,
and affected the economic trends in Latin American region.
</P>
<P>
The sudden drop in capital income, together with the high
volume of payments abroad for interests and dividends, meant a
negative net resources transfer from the region for the first time
since 1990, said ECLA.
</P>
<P>
The low price of basic products (except oil), together with the
drop in intrarregional trade in South America, diminished the
income from exports, said ECLA in a document about the preliminary
results of the region in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expansion showed a stagnation
in 1999, despite the efforts of the authorities to face external
conditions, said ECLA, a United Nations branch with its
headquarters in Santiago.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the South American countries, which
characterize themselves for concentrating on the export of basic
products had an unfavorable performance.
</P>
<P>
In fact, in many cases, fiscal spending was reduced to
compensate for the reduction of income, so the average fiscal
deficit of the region will surpass three percent of the GDP, the
highest level of the last ten years, says the report. (to be

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS,December 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Friday that the European Union (EU) and Canada confirmed their
healthy bilateral relationship on the occasion of the bi-annual
summit held on Thursday in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU is seeking support for its proposal to launch
a comprehensive round of World Trade Organization (WTO)
negotiations while its leaders travel in North America to meet the
leaders of Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Commission, the EU executive branch, said following the
Seattle WTO ministerial meeting, the way forward for multilateral
trade negotiations was a key issue addressed by the leaders at the
EU-Canadian Summit.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the EU's commitment to launch a new round, President
of the European Commission Romano Prodi and EU Commissioner Pascal
Lamy emphasized that the comprehensive agenda proposed in Seattle,
catering to interests of both developed and developing countries
and introducing more openness and transparency into the WTO, "was
more justified than ever," the commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation, led by President Romano Prodi, EU presidency
leaders, including Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, and EU
Commissioner Pascal Lamy, is trying to persuade EU's major trading
partners to accept European ideas.
</P>
<P>
The EU welcomed Canada's willingness to consider joining its
initiative to offer the world's least developed countries free-
duty access to its markets, the EU executive said.
</P>
<P>
The EU and Canadian leaders also discussed "a number of
important political issues of mutual interest and addressed
bilateral trade issues."
</P>
<P>
The EU and Canada were able to agree on joint statements
underlining "their commonality of views" on electronic commerce,
the information society, northern cooperation concerning
sustainable development, Arctic-related matters, and the problems
of curtailing the spread and accumulation of small arms and light
weapons, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Decline in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. construction of new
homes and apartments dropped by 2.3 percent in November to the
lowest level in seven months as mortgage rates kept rising, the
Commerce Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that builders started new homes at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.6 million units in November,
the lowest level since 1.58 million units were started in April.
</P>
<P>
The performance in the construction sector was worse than the
prediction by many analysts, who had forecast a 1.2-percent
increase in housing starts given the better-than-normal weather in
November.
</P>
<P>
The housing starts were flat in October, slightly weaker than
the 0.1 percent gain previously estimated by the government.
</P>
<P>
Last month new construction on single-family homes declined by
3.6 percent to an annual rate of 1.29 million units, following a 3.
5 percent rise the month before.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, starts on condos and apartment buildings increased
by 3.7 percent to an annual rate of 308,000 units, following a 13.
2-percent decline in October.
</P>
<P>
After a record housing boom last year fueled by exceptionally
low mortgage costs, interest rates have been on an upward climb
this year. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate
mortgage edged up to 7.86 percent this week, from 7.84 percent
last week, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. Other
mortgage rates were on the rise this week as well.
</P>
<P>
Given the continuing economic growth, home builders say they
remain relatively confident about their prospects for sales over
the next six months.
</P>
<P>
However, builders continue to report shortages of skilled
workers and available lots for development, factors that can delay
or disrupt construction schedules.
</P>
<P>
New building permits, considered a gauge of future construction,
increased by 1.3 percent in November.

<HEADLINE> Sufficient Troops Present on Border: Pak Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has sufficient
troops' deployment along the Line of Control in Kashmir and along
the working boundary, military spokesman Brigadier Rashid Qureshi
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He told the media in Rawalpindi that "additional deployment of
the Pakistani troops, effected in the wake of the Kargil conflict,
has been withdrawn in line with Chief Executive General Pervaiz
Musharraf's announcement."

additional Indian reinforcement on the frontline border positions,
Qureshi added.

The spokesman said that India has deployed additional troops on
border in the guise of the Kargil conflict, and Pakistan
reciprocated with additional troops deployment.

<HEADLINE> Trade Unions Urged To Contribute to SOE Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Trade unions across the
country should make further contributions in improving the
industry, especially the performance of China's state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), said Wei Jianxing, chairman of the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions today.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party's Central
Committee, said that trade unions must try to give full play to
the initiative of workers and to fully make use of their expertise
in managing China's industry, and realizing the three-year targets
for the SOE reform and development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the second plenary session of the 13th Executive
Council of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), Wei
said it is also crucial for trade unions to support the government
and Party committees at all levels in providing help and guidance
for laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Newly set up companies must establish trade unions as quickly
as possible, work closely with the Party organizations, maintain
the cohesion of the working class as well as unity and stability,
and uphold the Party's leadership of the workers' movement.
</P>
<P>
Wei also urged trade unions to closely watch for problems that
might arise in the development of China's socialist market economy
and increase the ability to solve problems.
</P>
<P>
Wei called for mobilizing the workers' initiative and
creativeness through such activities as labor competitions and
technical innovations, in order to achieve the targets for SOE
reforms and development for the next three years.

<HEADLINE> France to Abstain From UN Vote on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- France will abstain from a vote
on disarmament in Iraq, which is expected to take place on Friday
at the United Nations Security Council, said French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
The absence of a French veto will let the Security Council
adopt a British-proposed resolution on establishing a new
disarmament monitoring body in Iraq and a suspension of sanctions
implemented against the country by the UN since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the rotating presidency of the Security Council, has
presented a compromise draft resolution on the two issues after
discussions with France and other council members.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot rally behind this text. Except that the elements are
all new, we will abstain," said Vedrine at a ministerial meeting
of the Group of Eight (G-8) countries in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
France, which asked for a delay of the vote earlier this week
in order to reach a compromise with Britain and the United States,
still contends that the conditions imposed on Iraq by Britain for
suspending UN sanctions are too strict and therefore make such a
suspension "too hypothetical."
</P>
<P>
"For voting the text, we should have defined completely a
mechanism for suspension of sanctions. The formula kept in the
draft text which will be submitted to a vote remains too ambiguous,
" said Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
However, he predicted that after months of discussions, "we are
not far from a possible result."
</P>
<P>
Russia and China are also expected to abstain from the vote,
said the French diplomats.

<HEADLINE> China to Amend Corporation Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A draft amendment to the law was submitted for deliberation at
the 13th session of the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The law did not specify the role of supervisory committees
among wholly state-owned companies, explained Yang Jingyu,
director of the State Council Law Office at the 13th session of
the ninth National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee
today.
</P>
<P>
It only stipulated the role of supervisory committees within
limited companies with liabilities and share-holding companies,
but not wholly state-owned enterprises, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that some problems have occurred in the operation and
financing of state-owned enterprises, suggesting that the State
Council regulate its rules regarding those who sit on supervisory
committees and how they exercise their power.
</P>
<P>
China will allow easier access for high-tech firms to enter the
market and the State Council will formulate rules of listing such
companies on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
These measures will help develop new technology firms in China,
Yang said.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov: West Short of Objective Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov at the G-8 foreign ministers' meeting here defended his
country's policy in Chechnya, saying the West's accusation was
based on a "shortage of objective information."
</P>
<P>
At an interview published in Friday's Frankfurt Allgemeine
Zeitung newspaper, Ivanov spoke out against the West for
intervening in Russia's interior affairs, with the exception of
its humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The West's analysis of the situation is always superficial, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Western criticism of Russia for its policies in the North
Caucasus are based primarily on "biased or false information," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As an example, Ivanov quoted a report on Thursday which said
the Russian army would totally destroy Grozny, the capital of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In fact, said Ivanov, neither had this siege begun, nor was
there such a plan.
</P>
<P>
Other reports about Chechnya, especially about the number of
casualties in Russian attacks, were not objective either, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no massacre of civilians in Chechnya," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Russia's military action in North Caucasus is to
end the terrorism, said Ivanov. "After the Chechen terrorists and
their foreign followers had engaged in bloody crimes in Moscow and
other cities, and intruded in Dagestan, it was made clear that
there is no possible political deal with these people."
</P>
<P>
Russia will soon end its anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya,
Ivanov announced.
</P>
<P>
While his Western counterparts condemned Russia for the
conflict in Chechnya, Ivanov did not take part in the joint press
conference after the G-8 foreign minister meeting.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 is composed of Russia and seven leading western
industrial nations, namely the U.S., Britain, France, Germany,
Italy, Canada, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was chaired by German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer.

<HEADLINE> China To Amend Customs Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a written address to the Chinese legislators, Premier Zhu
Rongji said that the draft was approved at a meeting of the State
Council Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
The amendment will help China promote foreign trade and crack
down on smuggling-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
Qian Guanlin, Commissioner of the General Administration of
Customs, said that the Law will specify the role of the newly
established anti-smuggling police force. He pointed out that more
than 80 percent of smuggled goods are brought into China via
freight and urged measures to be taken to monitor the supervision
of customs offices who deal with foreign businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
Qian called on his staff to take more vigorous action against
smuggling and warned that the customs officials who engage in
corruption will be dealt with in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
He said that the law will also provide information on what
behavior or activities are deemed illegal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Fall in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. construction of new
homes and apartments dropped by 2.3 percent in November to the
lowest level in seven months as mortgage rates kept rising, the
Commerce Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that builders started new homes at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.60 million units in November,
the lowest level since 1.58 million units were started in April.
</P>
<P>
Last month's performance was worse than many analysts' expected.
They were forecasting a 1.2 percent increase in housing starts
given the better-than-normal weather in November.
</P>
<P>
The housing starts were flat in October, slightly weaker than
the 0.1 percent gain the government previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
In November, new construction on single-family homes declined
by 3.6 percent to an annual rate of 1.29 million units, following
a 3.5 percent rise the month before.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, starts on condos and apartment buildings increased
by 3.7 percent to an annual rate of 308,000 units, following a 13.
2 percent decline in October.
</P>
<P>
After a record housing boom last year fueled by exceptionally
low mortgage costs, interest rates have been on an upward climb
this year. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate
mortgage edged up to 7.86 percent this week, from 7.84 percent
last week, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. Other
mortgage rates were on the rise this week as well.
</P>
<P>
Giving continuing economic growth, home builders say they
remain relatively confident about their prospects for sales over
the next six months.
</P>
<P>
However, builders continue to report shortages of skilled
workers and available lots for development, factors that can delay
or disrupt construction schedules.
</P>
<P>
New building permits, considered a gauge of future construction,
increased by 1.3 percent in November.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Block Chechen-Georgian Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops on
Friday blocked a road linking Chechnya and the Georgian village of
Shatili, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the accomplishment "might alter the entire picture
of the anti-terrorist operation," the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the militants guarding the strategically vital road
have either been killed or dispersed and that the federal troops
suffered no casualties in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the current military campaign in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya in September following armed incursions by
Chechen rebels into neighboring Daghestan and a series of
apartment bombings, also blamed on the Chechen militants, that
killed over 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen section of the Russian border with Georgia is seen
as a weak point in Moscow's efforts in fighting the rebels as it
has until now had no control over the stretch of the mountainous
frontier.
</P>
<P>
Russia says arms supplies and fighters get into Chechnya
through the Georgian border, an assertion denied by Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
Moscow had earlier urged a joint protection of the Chechen
section of their common border but Georgia rejected the suggestion,
saying it is capable of guarding the frontier itself.

<HEADLINE> Surging Return Enthusiasm in Macao Despite Rain (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A sight that is usually seen
when Macao people rush to buy lottery tickets appears today in
front of the General Post Office. People are lining up here to buy
postal articles to have them stamped on with "Sino-Portuguese
Friendship Macao Return 1999" despite persistent rain.
</P>
<P>
People of different colors are bustling in and out of the
nearby Central Plaza department store, on whose glass facade hang
posters celebrating Macao's return to China and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Some 900 students of the Portuguese School of Macao,the only
one of its kind in the region, have gone on Christmas vacation. "
But we have some staff members and students preparing Portuguese
folk dancing as part of the cultural activities celebrating
Macao's return to China," said Ms. Lo Wai Iok, a school logistics
administrator.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning in Dr. Carlos d'Assumpcao Park, some
people are rehearsing for handover performances. And in the
evening, neon lights illuminate the peninsula, with people
crowding in shops and restaurants with gentle Christmas music
wafting in the air.
</P>
<P>
Some parents are taking their children to various cultural
spots, and others are taking walks to experience the jubilant
atmosphere. "Public security is improving considerably as the
handover approaches. So, residents are willing to come out at
night," taxi driver Chio Wei San said.
</P>
<P>
In front of Casino Lisboa, the best-known gambling venue in
Macao, are parked taxis and pedicabs, their drivers leisurely
reading newspapers while waiting for customers.
</P>
<P>
At Gongbei Customs, the border gate leading to the nearby city
of Zhuhai in Guangdong Province, people are queuing up in good
order. Entries and exits at the customs have registered an all-
time high in recent days, an official said.

Incense is burning 24 hours day in A-Ma Temple; while in Macao
Cathedral, the bell rings to welcome believers.
</P>
<P>
Some people are taking pictures in front of Praia Grande Palace
housing the office of the outgoing governor of Macao, which will
be history in a few days. While on the Tai Fung Bank Ltd., the
temporary office for the Chief Executive-designate of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR), a giant "Returning Swallow"
neon light is flashing over a poster of red lotus.
</P>
<P>
Lotus in full bloom and flying swallow are popular designs
printed or carved on souvenirs. The Macao SAR regional flag with a
lotus design will be hoisted at midnight on December 19, along
with China's five-star national flag. The "Returning Swallow"
symbolizes Macao's return to its motherland.
</P>
<P>
Eye-catching streamers, regional flags and national flags hang
on tall buildings of Portuguese and Chinese styles; shops and
restaurants are catering to clients at discount prices; and
various kinds of return-related books can be found in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
In a market near the city council, fresh vegetables, seafood
and meat, which are newly shipped from Zhuhai, are on sale. "We
have as many shoppers as usual," said Madame Kao, who has been
running a stall here for seven years.
</P>
<P>
Lei Wan Lou, a Macao-born Portuguese, is going home by taxi
from Macao Polytechnic Institute, where he has been taking Chinese
lessons for two years. "I can do my job better if I have a better
command of Chinese," he said. The 4,000 member-strong police are
on full alert to safeguard a smooth handover. Shum Kwok Ching, a
local policeman with 23 years of service, is going the rounds as
usual together with his partners. "Nothing has changed with the
police, and nobody has ever asked to quit," he said. "If anything
different is to take place, that is, we will change our collar and
cap badges on the morning of December 20."

<HEADLINE> Last Work Day of Portuguese Macao Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Lidia Gloria da Luz came to her
office one hour earlier today, as she has done every day for years.
</P>
<P>
Luz is director of Public Administration and Civil Services of
the Portuguese Macao government. For Luz and Macao's other 18,000
public servants, this is the last work day of the Portuguese Macao
government. Most of them will work for the new Macao Special
Administrative Region (Macao SAR) government to be established on
the early morning of December 20, shortly after China resumes the
exercise of sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing unusual at the departments of my services
today," she said after signing some documents and meeting
department heads. "Everybody is working diligently and smoothly at
his or her post."
</P>
<P>
As the Macao SAR government begins operation on December 23,
Luz will come back to her office, which will bear a new name "
Bureau of Administration and Public Services." And the names of
some subordinate offices will also change.
</P>
<P>
"There will not be big changes in the function and personnel of
all offices in the short term," she said, noting that only a few
persons have been shifted to the office of the chief executive,
the head of the new SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Luz's services have been busy turning government documents into
Portuguese-Chinese versions and putting the words "SAR" on
government seals.
</P>
<P>
"We have an enhanced sense of responsibility because we will be
the ones to implement the policies of the SAR government," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to close cooperation between China and Portugal over the
past decade, the majority of the public servants in the Portuguese
Macao government are now local Chinese residents.
</P>
<P>
At the office building of the Identification Services, local
residents queued up in a drizzle applying for Macao SAR passport
or travel document.
</P>
<P>
Chan Hoi Fan, deputy director of the Identification Services,
said "everything is normal." So far the services has received more
than 2,000 applications for the Macao SAR passport and over 200
applications for the Macao SAR travel document from local
residents.
</P>
<P>
Since December 6, the services has been busy handling such
applications in addition to issuing Portuguese passport and passes
for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"After Macao returns to China on December 20, all files kept by
the services will continue to be used and all staff members will
stay on," Chan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that the further consolidation of China-Czech
relations is in the interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks while meeting with visiting Czech Prime
Minister Milos Zeman.
</P>
<P>
Czech was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic
ties with China. Even though Czech and China are geographically
far apart, Jiang pointed out that China and Czech have a long-
standing friendship.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, he said, Sino-Czech bilateral relations have
developed well over the decades. "We have no fundamental conflicts
of interest."
</P>
<P>
It is only natural that China and Czech should hold different
political views on some issues because of different national
conditions, historical and cultural backgrounds as well as
environments. But all these differences should not become barriers
in promoting bilateral relations, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China respects Czech's social system and its path
to reform and change. China is delighted to hear achievements made
by Czech in developing its economy and improving the living
standards of its people.
</P>
<P>
China places importance on its relations with Czech and will
further bilateral cooperation in the areas of politics, economics,
science and technology, and culture.
</P>
<P>
Zeman congratulated China on Macao's upcoming return to the
motherland and highly praised achievements made by China since it
adopted the policy of reform and opening up some 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Even though Czech established diplomatic ties with China 50
years ago, Zeman said that the friendly relations are in the
thoughts of leaders in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Zeman told Jiang that leaders from both countries have had
extensive exchange of views on economic and trade and will carry
out further cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
Zeman stressed that Czech consistently adheres to the principle
of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and
respects the "One China" policy.

<HEADLINE> India Tries to Ensure Y2K Readiness of All Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government said
here on Friday that it had spared no effort to ensure Y2K
readiness of all sectors so that the public is not put to
inconvenience "on account of this man-made problem."
</P>
<P>
Information Technology Minister Pramod Mahajan said that the
government was watching the situation closely and all the sectors
concerned were continuously monitoring, checking and re-checking
their state of preparedness so that "the rollover to the new
millennium is smooth."
</P>
<P>
Mahajan told Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian
parliament, that his ministry was setting up a national control
room which would closely coordinate and work with the sectoral
control rooms of various ministries and would operate from
December 28 to January 3,2000.
</P>
<P>
The minister informed the parliament members that the
government had set up a high-level action force to manage the
possible Y2K impact in the country with representatives from
government, industry associations,banks and financial institutions,
railways, defense services, utility and other public service
organizations as its members.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee recently made an appeal to
the people by placing advertisements in newspapers about the
urgency to deal with the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee has also written to all chief ministers stressing on
the importance of the problem and urging them to initiate
necessary remedial action.
</P>
<P>
The government has allowed various ministries, departments and
agencies to spend up to three percent of their budget for Y2K
preparedness in their quarterly and annual reports.
</P>
<P>
Several sectors including the civil aviation and central bank
have already declared that they were ready to meet any possible
threat posed by Y2K.
</P>
<P>
The department of Atomic Energy said today that all of its 22
organizations have completed their Y2K readiness program and were"
fully Y2K ready."

<HEADLINE> Economist Reiterates Stability of Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Professor Xiao Zhuoji, a well
known Chinese economist, today reiterated that China has a solid
foundation to maintain the stability of the Chinese yuan.
</P>
<P>
The current exchange rate of the yuan is appropriate and
reasonable, Xiao said in an address to a symposium on challenges
of economic globalization that will face both sides of the Taiwan
Straits in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this to China's sufficient foreign exchange
reserves and the positive index of retail consumer goods prices at
home.
</P>
<P>
He went on to explain that China's foreign exchange reserves
reached 151.7 billion U.S. dollars in June this year, and short-
term foreign debt accounts for only about 15 percent of the
country's total foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 18 million Chinese now work for foreign-funded
enterprises whose export volume accounts for 40 percent of China's
total. The stability of the yuan will be helpful to China for
attracting more foreign investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a stable yuan will be conducive to maintaining
normal trade ties between China and its trading partners, to
improving public confidence in economic growth, and for
maintaining the stability of the Hong Kong dollar.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt to Speed up Foreign-Funded Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and three
international aid agencies have forged an agreement aimed at
putting on the fast track the implementation of existing projects
funded by these donors, the Philippine government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said the Asian Development
Bank (ADB), the World Bank (WB) and the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation (JBIC) have expressed optimism that
significant progress in the implementation of these projects will
be realized next year.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the agreement was reached during the first-ever
Official Development Assistance portfolio review which was
concluded Thursday between Philippine officials and
representatives of the three donor agencies.
</P>
<P>
He reacted to reports about a supposed threat by the three
donor agencies to withhold pending loans for the Philippines
because of delays in projects they funded.
</P>
<P>
"There was no threat from the country's three major aid donors
to put on hold pending loans of the Philippine government,"
Barican said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippine government and the international donors have
agreed to accelerate the implementation of existing projects
receiving assistance from the ADB, WB and the JBIC," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
Barican noted that the government has already put in place
initiatives to remove delays in the implementation of foreign-
assisted projects.
</P>
<P>
Felipe Medalla, director general of the National Economic and
Development Authority Medalla, said that the three donor agencies
have made available about 1 billion U.S. dollars in financial
assistance to the Philippines for projects aimed at improving the
lives of the poor.
</P>
<P>
According to Medalla, participants in the Thursday meeting
agreed that there is a need for "greater resolve, concrete actions,
and adequate monitoring and evaluation to turn around the
situation where a number of projects are rated as unsatisfactory."

50 countries and international institutions attended a meeting on
East Timor Friday and pledged a total of 522.45 million U.S.
dollars in financial assistance to rebuild the ravaged former
Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, hosted by Japan and sponsored by the World Bank,

</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, East Timor political leader Xanana
Gusmao called for "true partnership" with the international
community in preparing East Timor for independence.
</P>

East Timor should quickly build up its agricultural sector to
reduce dependency on international aid; build an efficient public
sector with as small a bureaucracy as possible to enable the
empowerment of the people, and receive investment from overseas,
said Gusmao, president of the National Council of Timorese
Resistance (CNRT).

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Parliament Speaker Rules out Coup D'etat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Hassan Abdulla al Turabi,
speaker of the dissolved Sudanese National Assembly (parliament),
has denied reports that a military coup d'etat was expected to take
place in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Turabi said that he was not preaching for a coup d'etat, but
talking in general about prospective expectations should events
develop into a conflict that could lead to a coup, local Al Sahafi
Al Dawli daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has declared a three-months
state of emergency across the country and dissolved the parliament
as the National Assembly was to vote on a bill to drastically
reduce the president's powers.
</P>
<P>
The moves came after relations between Bashir, chairman of the
ruling National Congress Party (NCP), and Turabi, the NCP general
secretary, soured in a power struggle.
</P>
<P>
Turabi ruled out the possibility of a coup by saying that the
nature of ethics and upbringing of the Sudanese people would
safeguard against such a development.
</P>
<P>
However, Turabi seemed pessimistic about the mediation efforts
to bridge the gap between him and Bashir.
</P>
<P>
Bashir had reiterated that he would not go back on his decrees
to dissolve the parliament and to declare a nation-wide state of
emergency for three months.
</P>
<P>
The NCP has nullified its decision which called upon cabinet
ministers to resign from Bashir's government, and made another
decision which relieves the ministers from tendering their
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Turabi said that it would take more time than expected to solve
his row with Bashir. He will convene a meeting Sunday evening to
review a report by a seven-member committee to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
Turabi was reported to have made a statement that unless Bashir
abolished his recent decrees, he would be opening the door to
several possibilities, including a popular uprising, a military
coup or otherwise.

<HEADLINE> Barak to Meet Arafat Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua)-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak plans to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat next week
to discuss ways to push the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
forward, Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Barak will also brief Arafat on the
outcome of the just-concluded Israeli-Syrian peace talks in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Barak, after winding up his two-day talks with Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Sharaa in Washington, returned home Friday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Barak met with Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen.
Shaul Mofaz who reported to him about the latest developments in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Tensions mounted on Thursday in Israel's northern border area
after the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army shelled a Lebanese
school just north of the security zone, wounding 24 Lebanese
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Barak is to brief his cabinet about the Washington
talks with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
The Washington talks on Wednesday and Thursday, the highest ever
level talks between the two sides since early 1996, marked the
resumption of peace talks between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Although no details about the meetings were disclosed, U.S.
President Bill Clinton Thursday hailed them talks as a "new
beginning in the effort to achieve a comprehensive peace in the
Middle East." The two sides have agreed to return to Washington
to resume further talks on January 3 next year, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) - $16 million HK-dollar
compensation were awarded to the Hong Kong crime victims in 1998-
99, according to a latest annual report.
</P>
<P>
The report was published by the Criminal Compensation Board of

Board.
</P>
<P>
These payments were made in 557 new and 440 review criminal
injuries cases, bringing the total payment of grants awarded to $
150.07 million HK dollars since the inception of the CLEIC Scheme
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Social Welfare Department (SWD) of HKSAR
said Friday 760 applications for criminal injuries compensation
were received in the year, as compared with 663 in the preceding
year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Macao, Zhuhai Cross-Border Marriages Booming Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Shuttling through the Gongbei
Border House every weekday has become a routine for Guan Hanlin, a
hotel staff member in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Macao resident lives with his wife and son in Zhuhai, a
port city neighboring Macao that will return to China on December
20.
</P>
<P>
Guan's wife, Wang Liping, is an employee of a real estate
company in Zhuhai. She said she does not see anything odd about
marrying a Macao husband, in fact, she considers that they have
similar cultural background.
</P>
<P>
Although separated by different administrations for hundreds of
years, Zhuhai and Macao are as close as lips and teeth that they
are called sister cities, and relations have been further cemented
by cross-border marriages.
</P>
<P>
The two cities have recorded several thousands of cross-border
marriage registrations and the number has been increasing by
nearly a hundred every year, said Yang Huaigang, director of the
marriage registration office in the Xiangzhou District in Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
Jin Dan, a customs officer at Gongbei, told Xinhua that she can
recognize many passengers, because they become familiar by going
through the passageways twice a day, which takes less than two
minutes. These people usually buy homes in Zhuhai and work in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials have seen an increasingly strong passenger
flow, especially during China's traditional festivals, such as
Spring Festival, Tomb-Sweeping Day, and Mid-Autumn Festival, which
are shared by the people of both cities. The record number of
those passing over from one side to the other in one day is more
100,000.

BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts and scholars

books to the public in a move to spread scientific thinking and
knowledge among the people.
</P>
<P>
The books include 52 foreign and 42 Chinese works and were

<P>
The Beijing-based Science Times, a co-sponsor of the activity,

<HEADLINE> Roundup: A Good Sign - Talks on Cyprus to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Both Greek and Turkish Cypriots
have shown their intention to hold a second round of proximity
talks in Geneva late January next year, sending out encouraging
signal for a settlement in the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot Leader
Rauf Denktash on Tuesday ended their first round of proximity
talks, which started on December 3 in New York under the U.N.
auspices in an effort to reunify the island.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, local press strongly complained about being
kept in the dark by Clerides and his advisors about developments in
the talks, due to a complete news blackout at the request of the U.
N..
</P>
<P>
Later reports said, however, the Greek Cypriots delegation left
New York satisfied in that the dynamic created by the conclusions
of the European Union (EU) Helsinki summit is also expected to be
translated into the continuation of a new round of proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, leader of the Greek Cypriots, said upon his return
from New York on Thursday that he believed the proximity talks and
the decisions made by the EU summit had brought about some changes
in prospects to settle the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders decided last Friday to give Turkey a candidate status
for EU membership and reaffirmed that Cyprus can join its ranks
even if its problem is not settled.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side expressed belief that many issues
relating to Cyprus and Turkey have been placed under the scrutiny
of the EU, as both countries are EU candidates.
</P>
<P>
Clerides noted that the next step "will be to seek
clarifications from both sides on the issues raised" during the
first round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Denktash, after his initial hesitation on the continuation of
the proximity talks and on Turkey's EU candidacy, considered the
New York talks as "beneficial" and welcomed Turkey's EU candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Istanbul airport upon his arrival home, Denktash
claimed that his proposal for setting up a confederation on the
Cyprus island had been accepted by the U.N. for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"The New York visit has been beneficial because many truths were
put on the table," Denktash said, adding that Turkey within Europe
would be in a better position to campaign on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriots
communities since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
U.N. has been trying for years to reunite the island with a bi-
zonal,bi-communal federation formula. The Turkish Cypriots, who
walked out of the peace talks in 1997, conditioned the resumption
of talks on the recognition of their breakaway republic in the
north.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Oil, Chemical Industries Hail 28 Billion Yuan Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua)-- China's petroleum and chemical
industries have witnessed improvement in overall operation this
year, with profit projected at 28 billion yuan (3.38 billion U.S.
dollars)by year-end.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 12 billion yuan (1.45 billion dollars) more than
that of 1998 and eight billion yuan (960 million dollars) more
than the initial plan, said a high-ranking industry official at an
ongoing working conference of the petrochemical industry today.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Yongwu, director of the State Administration of
Petroleum and Chemical Industries under the State Economic and
Trade Commission, in the first ten months this year, China's
petrochemical industry had rolled in 446.69 billion yuan (53.95
billion dollars) in terms of industrial output value, up 11.5
percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The figure for the whole is predicted at 547.13 billion yuan (
66 billion dollars), 10.5 percent higher than a year earlier and 5.
5 percent higher than it was planned early this year, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the whole sector made a profit of 23.52 billion
yuan (2.84 billion dollars) in the ten-month period. Of the total,
the China National Petroleum Corp. accounted for 10.29 billion
yuan (1.24 billion dollars); the China Petrochemical Corp.
contributed 5.95 billion yuan (719 million dollars); chemical
companies took in 2.33 billion yuan (281 million dollars); and the
China National Offshore Oil Corp., made 2.32 billion yuan (280
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Li told the conference that China this year has effectively
controlled the distribution of crude and refined oil products
markets, which helped to stabilize the market supply and got
better economic results.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, China has also made headway in shutting
down poorly-performing small refineries, further curbing the
excessive refining capacity.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 5,592 illegal refineries have been
bulldozed and 56 small refineries, each of which has an annual
processing capacity of less than one million tons, have been
closed down.

<HEADLINE> Murder Case Registered Against Former Pakistani Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani police said Friday
that they have registered a murder case against former Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto for the killing of two activists from a
rival party.
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint lodged at a police station in
Rawalpindi, twin city of Pakistan's capital Islamabad, Bhutto was
accused of ordering police to fire on a rally by the Islamic
fundamentalist Jammat-i-Islami (JI) party in June 1996 in
Rawalpindi.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, who worked as the prime minister of the South Asian
country twice in 1988-1990 and in 1993-1996, left the country
after her second government was dismissed in November, 1996 on
charges of corruption and misrule. Currently she lives in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"We have named Bhutto and five others including her interior
minister Naseerullah Khan Babar in the First Information Report
filed with the police as the murder of our workers was the result
of a conspiracy hatched by them," Maulana Abdul Jalil, a JI
leader who lodged the case, was quoted by local reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said he had tried to register the case earlier but it was
refused. Earlier this month the Supreme Court ordered the case be
registered.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto was the second former prime minister who was accused on
the court after the army took over the country. Deposed prime
minister Nawas Sharif is now under custody with charges of
attempted murder and other crimes.

<HEADLINE> Swisscom to Spin off Blue Window Internet Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Swisscom intends to convert the
Blue Window Internet service into a stock corporation in order to
increase its flexibility for partnerships and encourage even more
growth.
</P>
<P>
The Swisscom board of directors has given the go-ahead for
privatization and the resumption of talks with the media company
TA-Media, according to a Swisscom press release Friday.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the partnership is to consolidate the market
position of Blue Window in the Swiss market. Swisscom will retain
a majority in Blue Window.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Internet market will continue to grow strongly in the
next few years. The importance of e-commerce will increase and
Blue Window will benefit from this thanks to its leading position
in the field of Internet access and portals. The Blue Window aims
to increase the topicality and range of its offer and to grow
faster than the competition.
</P>
<P>
To increase the flexibility of the Internet service provider
and lay the foundations for a continuous partnership, Swisscom
plans to privatize Blue Window during the first half of the year
2000. The present Swisscom division with around 200 employees will
be converted into a stock corporation.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are currently underway with the media company TA-
Media to set up a strategic partnership especially in the area of
on-line banner advertising for employment agencies, real estate,
etc. This business is part of the integrated multimedia strategy
of TA-Media.
</P>
<P>
Founded only three years ago, the Internet provider from
Swisscom has recorded rapid growth. With a market share of around
one-third, Blue Window is the leading Internet provider in
Switzerland and now has over 300,000 access customers and 130,000
Blue Mail customers. With around 38 million pageviews a month,
Blue Window is the most visited homepage in Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Ready for Rebel Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that it is prepared for any attacks that may be launched by
the New People's Army (NPA) on December 26 when they celebrate
their 30th founding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
This was declared by Armed Forces Chief of Staff Angelo Reyes
as he denied a report that 13 Army soldiers and 10 NPA guerrillas
were killed in a gunbattle in Samar province in the central
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"There is a report being circulated that some Armed Forces
elements were killed by the NPA in Samar. That is not true," Reyes
said in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said he was "curious" on the declaration by the NPA of a
Christmas cease-fire from midnight of December 22 until midnight
of December 25, purposely ending on the date the NPA observes its
30th founding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"It is curious because the NPA has left out December 26 to 28
in declaring a cease-fire," Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the NPA conducts tactical offensive to mark
their anniversary, attacking small Army detachments in remote
areas.
</P>
<P>
The NPA was founded on December 26, 1969 at the height of
student activism in the country.
</P>
<P>
Reyes assured the Filipino people that the Armed Forces is
ready for any eventuality.
</P>
<P>
He said government troops have been on "active defense" since
President Joseph Estrada ordered the suspension of military
operations(Somo) starting December 10. It will end on January 9,
2000.
</P>
<P>
By active defense, government forces will conduct normal law
enforcement functions to preempt any attack by NPA rebels during
the duration of Somo for 30 days, Reyes said.

<HEADLINE> Pyramid Not to Be Crowned in Millennium Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has decided not to place a
capstone atop the Great Pyramid of Cheops in Giza in the millennium
celebrations, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
French rock composer Jean Michel Jarre is due to perform a 12-
hour overnight concert on December 31 in front of an expected
audience of 50,000 viewers at the Giza Pyramids to usher in the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The concert, to be colored by lasers and fireworks, is to
incorporate Oriental, Western and traditional Egyptian songs and
last from sunset to sunrise. The placing of a golden peak atop the
missing
peak of the Cheops Pyramid, the largest of the three, had been
billed as the centerpiece of the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
But the Ministry of Culture has decided to cancel the four-
minute performance from the program to ward off further criticism,
The English-language newspaper quoted Minister of Culture Farouq
Hosni as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed regret at the decision as scientific
studies conducted by a technical committee of his ministry have
proven that the placing of a capstone would not damage the Pyramid
of Cheops.
</P>
<P>
Local officials and media have recently spoken out against the
decision to place the golden capstone made of light metal on the
Pyramid, saying it would tamper with a great historical monument
and might damage it forever.
</P>
<P>
Antiquities officials, however, have argued that the crowning of
the pyramid mirrored an ancient Egyptian rite that marked the
completion of the building of the pyramid 4,500 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Major Projects Ready for Macao's Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Three major projects have been
completed in Zhuhai of south China's Guangdong Province to herald
the return of Macao to China on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The three major projects -- a new joint-check terminal at
Gongbei Customs Outlet, an expressway connecting Zhuhai to Beijing,
and the Lotus Bridge, the second land passage linking Macao to
China's interior areas, were selected and approved by the State as
projects to celebrate Macao's return.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai is the nearest to the interior city to Macao. Due to
their close geographic ties, Macao and Zhuhai have maintained
frequent contacts and exchanges for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
The joint-check terminal and other auxiliary works took seven
years to complete, going into service on October 2.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the completion of the new facilities, Gongbei Customs
Outlet is capable of handling the exit and entry of up to 200,000
passengers and more than 8,000 motor vehicles a day, which will
facilitate exchanges of materials and personnel between China's
interior areas and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou-Zhuhai section of Beijing-Zhuhai expressway was
completed and open for traffic on December 6. The 53.8-km stretch,
which cost 4.6 million yuan starts at Panyu of Guangzhou Province
and ends at Jinding Town of Zhuhai, and is connected to the
Guangzhou-Shenzhen expressway.
</P>
<P>
The bridge of over 1,700 mters long connects Hengqin Island of
the neighboring Zhuhai City with land reclaimed from the sea
between the Coloane and Taipa Islands.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the bridge began in 1998 with an investment of
some 200 million yuan from Zhuhai and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The six-lane bridge serves as another major land passage which
links interior areas of China with Macao through National Highway
No.105 and the Beijing-Zhuhai expressway, following the Gongbei
Customs Outlet.
</P>
<P>
The new bridge will greatly ease the traffic tension at the
Gongbei Border Outlet and promote Macao's economic and cultural
exchanges with the interior areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
reiterated that his administration would help push the Palestinian-
Israeli negotiations forward, the "Voice of Palestine" radio
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the pledge in a telephone call Thursday to Chairman
of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat. He said
this endeavor is with the view to achieving real peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Addressing concerns by the Palestinians that the resumption of
the Israeli-Syrian talks would push them aside, Clinton has
repeatedly assured the Palestinians that the talks would not hinder
their efforts to strike a final peace deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians are continuing their negotiations
despite ups and downs, and would thrash out a framework agreement
by February and a final accord by September.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed their peace talks after a 45-month
suspension in Washington Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on four key issues, including the return of
the Golan Heights, the timing of an Israeli withdrawal, the nature
of peace that would result in and security arrangements along
borders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Arafat called Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak Thursday evening for further coordination and consultations
on the latest developments in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Undertake N-250 Aircraft Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 17, (Xinhua) -- The state-run PT Industry
Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN), Indonesia's aircraft maker,
would continue its project to develop the N-250 plane, a daily
Friday reported.
</P>
<P>
"The IPTN has opened opportunities for foreign investors to
invest in the N-250 project. IPTN also opened opportunity to a U.S.
international broker George Soros to take a part in this
investment," the Bisnis Indonesia daily reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that at least 11 foreign investors had been submitting
proposals for taking part in the N-250 investment.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now 11 foreign investors have been interested in
investing in the N-250 plane project. If George Soros group wants
to invest in the project, we will accept warmly," the daily quoted
IPTN Director for Human Resources and Administration Djusman SD as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the project now had been halted for lack of
money.
</P>
<P>
"So there is no problem if Soros has an ability in developing
the N-250 production," he said.
</P>
<P>
But foreign investors have to get permission from the Ministry
of state-owned companies first, Djusman said.
</P>
<P>
Djusman added that the company needs at least 250 million U.S.
dollars to continue the N-250 project.
</P>
<P>
PT IPTN is a state-run company which is located in Bandung,
West Java Province.
</P>
<P>
Under former president Baharuddin Jusuf Habibie leadership, the
company had succeeded in producing CN-235 type. The company also
has exported a lot of craft components and spare-parts.
</P>
<P>
But since the economic crisis, many planned craft projects have
been halted for the lack of fund.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Loses Suit Against Beijing Company (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The accusation of piracy made
by Microsoft against China's Beijing Yadu Science and Technology
Group was rejected today, and the computer software giant is
required to pay the trial fee of 500 yuan under the verdict of the
Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
The court concluded after a series of investigations that no
direct evidence was found proving that the engineers who admitted
pirating Microsoft products were actually employed by the Yadu
Group. It turned out that these engineers were employed by the
Yadu Science and Technology Co., Ltd., also located in the Yadu
Building, where the Yadu Group operates as well. The two are
independent companies owned by one individual.
</P>
<P>
Agents for Microsoft expressed their disappointment over the
final result, and said they will continue their efforts to protect
their legal rights through legal means and bring another action
according to law.
</P>
<P>
The Yadu Group was accused of using computer software developed
and owned by Microsoft by copying them from pirated discs.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in China that a final user was sued for
pirating software, the copyright of which belongs to Microsoft.
The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court began an open trial
of this case on November 18.
</P>
<P>
According to Microsoft's accusation, law enforcement officers
from Beijing's Haidian District Administration for Industry and
Commerce found 37 sets of various Microsoft computer software that
were illegally copied and used in the office building, known as
Yadu Building, which houses the Beijing Yadu Science and
Technology Group.
</P>
<P>
Engineers at the Yadu Building admitted that about 50 computers
of the Yadu Group were installed with pirated Microsoft software.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft therefore appealed to the court to force the Yadu
Group to immediately stop this piracy, make a public apology to
Microsoft, and pay 1.5 million yuan (about 180,700 U.S. dollars)
for losses suffered by Microsoft.

The Yadu Group, the accused, claimed that neither the computers
installed with pirated software nor the witnesses are part of it.
Rather, the accused said both were part of the Beijing Yadu
Science and Technology Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The accused also said that the Beijing Yadu Science and
Technology Group and Beijing Yadu Science and Technology Co., Ltd.
were two different companies, though their legal representative is
one person, He Lumin.
</P>
<P>
The accused said it reserved the right to lodge an appeal for
the damage to its credit and profit.
</P>
<P>
The piracy of computer software falls into four categories: by
final users, by hardware producers or dealers, sales of illegally
copied discs, and by free-will downloading from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
In May 1998, Microsoft succeeded in suing two other Chinese
companies, Beijing Hai Si Da Science and Technology Development
Company, and Beijing Min An Investment Consulting Company, for
copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
The two companies paid Microsoft a total compensation of some
790,000 yuan (about 95,000 U.S. dollars) and made public apologies
in designated publications.

BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo today
encouraged joint automobile ventures in China to explore new
products, improve technologies, and lower prices in order to
become more competitive in China's growing market.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Paolo Cantarella, president and chief
executive officer of Italy's Fiat Group, and his party, Wu said
that foreign auto firms should further increase cooperation with
Chinese enterprises to prepare themselves for the challenges which
will arise after China's accession into the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Fiat was one of the first multinational companies to invest in
China and has extensive relations with Chinese auto ventures, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Since China's automobile industry is geared to embrace a big
leap forward in the next century, foreign automobile firms should
enhance their cooperation with their Chinese partners to gain even
larger market shares, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Paolo Cantarella and his party have come to visit China as
guests of the China Council for the Promotion of International
Trade.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian International
Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz Friday asked small and

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Macro-control of Petrochemical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China will maintain its macro-
control of the petroleum and chemical industries next year, said
Li Yongwu, director of the State Administration of Petroleum and
Chemical Industries (SAPCI), at today's SAPCI working conference.
</P>
<P>
Li said the SAPCI will place great emphasis on controlling
crude processing and the production of benzosulfimide and soda ash
next year.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, crude to be processed will be no more than 183
million tons, while the output of benzosulfimide will be limited
within 16,000 tons with domestic sales not to exceed 3,000 tons.
The national output ceilings on soda ash and caustic soda are
planned at seven million tons and 5.2 million tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The petrochemical industry will move to optimize product mix
and step up industrial upgrading next year, Li pointed out.
Efforts will be continued to close down small oil refineries, each
of which with an annual capacity of less than one million tons. By
the end of the first quarter of next year, the total number of
shut-down small refineries is expected to grow to 100 from the
current 56.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, the SAPCI will also hammer out relevant policies
concerning small plants producing caustic soda, tires, dyestuffs,
pesticide, and calcium carbide, Li added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the SAPCI is poised to further promote the reform
of state-owned petrochemical enterprises in 2000, and make every
effort to fulfill the target of turning the loss incurring
enterprises into profit making ones within three years.
</P>
<P>
The administration is attempting to secure six of the eight
phosphate fertilizer plants which have implemented the debt-to-
equity program this year, to turn losses into profits next year so
that they can produce one million tons more phosphamidon and two
million tons more three-nutrient compound fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the SAPCI should wind up drafting the tenth
five-year (2001-2005) plan next year and make preparations for
China's accession to the World Trade Organization. In the meantime,
the administration will map out long-term development plans from
now to 2015 for the petrochemical industry, he added.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Oilfield to Increase Crude Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The crude oil output of the
Qinghai Oilfield in the Qaidam Basin of northwestern China's
Qinghai Province is expected to top 1.9 million tons at the end of
this year, 130,000 tons more than the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua was told today by the Qinghai Petroleum Administration
that the oilfield's gas and oil output had reached 2.05 million
tons by the end of November.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, earlier this year, oilfield production was
affected to some extent by the fluctuating international oil
market.
</P>
<P>
Now the oilfield's daily output has risen from 4,500 tons at
the end of 1998 to the present 5,300 tons thanks to advanced
technologies and techniques adopted by the oilfield this year.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of this year, the oilfield invested nearly
200 million yuan (24 million US dollars) in oil prospecting and
exploration.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield aims to increase crude oil output to 2 million
tons and natural gas output to 400 million cubic meters next year
so as to contribute to the development of mid-western China.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield, in the northern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
has produced a total of more than 20 million tons of crude and
refined an additional 8 million tons since it began operation in
1954.

JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa promised Israel in
the first round of negotiations not to allow "any element in
Lebanon to disrupt the peace process," the first clear indication
that Syria is willing to rein in Hezbollah activities as part of a
peace accord, a senior Israeli official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But tension remained high in northern Israel Thursday after at
least 14 Lebanese school children were injured by mortar shells
fired by the pro-Israeli militia South Lebanese Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman Thursday brushed aside
criticism of his vocal support for concessions on the Golan Heights
as part of a peace accord with Syria, but invited leading opponents
of a Golan withdrawal to meet with him next week.
</P>
<P>
Weizman has rejected criticism from opposition parties by
insisting that his activities are not politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Hailing the first round of peace negotiations as a "new
beginning in the effort to achieve a comprehensive peace," U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced Thursday that Israel and Syria
will resume their negotiations on January 3 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said after the Israeli and Syrian teams ended their two-
day talks that both sides have "agreed to take steps to ensure that
these negotiations will be conducted in a productive and positive
atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Many residents in northern Israel spent Thursday night in
bomb shelters for fear that the Hezbollah would retaliate for the
wounding of the Lebanese children by SLA mortar shells.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation to the peace talks in Washington
explained to the Syrians that the incident was an unfortunate
mistake and asked Damascus to ensure that Hezbollah will not fire
Katyusha rockets into Israel in retaliation.

<HEADLINE> Macao Coma Patient Recovers in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A 23-year-old Macao man, who
recently emerged from a two-year coma, has been released from the
hospital and will be enjoying Monday's return of Macao to the
motherland and the comforts of his home.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to celebrate Macao's return at home," said Huang
Jun, who spent two years in the Nanfang Hospital under the No.1
Medical University in Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, which neighbors Macao.
</P>
<P>
Huang was left unconscious from a head-on car collision in
Macao in 1997. He was sent to a local hospital, where he remained
comatose for two years.
</P>
<P>
His family then considered sending him to the United States for
medical care, when they heard that the Nanfang Hospital in
Guangzhou had developed a successful treatment for the condition.
Afterwards, Huang was sent to that hospital, where Chinese doctors
prescribed both traditional and Western therapies for him, which
proved quite effective in the first week of trial use.
</P>
<P>
Huang has now basically restored his speaking, walking and
other essential functions, and left the hospital on Thursday.
While in hospital, he undergoes at least six hours of physical
therapy a day, and doctors expect him to recover better still and
take care of himself within six months.
</P>
<P>
To date, Huang has been transferred to his home in Macao for
further recovery.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Bridge Starts In Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Construction has started on
another bridge over the Jialing River, a major tributary on the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The total investment for the bridge is 750 million yuan (90
million US dollars), 75 percent of which is supplied by Portugal
and the rest shared by China and Macao. Work on the 4.3-km bridge
is expected to be completed and become operational by the end of
2001.
</P>
<P>
The Jialing River, which flows across Chongqing, the largest
municipality in southwest China's Sichuan Province, is already
spanned by two bridges, one built in the 1960s and the other in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
But traffic jams still remain very serious due to the city's
huge population and bustling economic development.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive-designate of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the initiator of the
project, sent a telegram on Thursday to congratulate the start of
the project.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Macao Residents Stay Home for Holidays, Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of Macao residents
who travel to other places for the Christmas season is
significantly lower this year because many choose to stay home and
see the handover ceremony, the establishment of the Macao Special
Administrative Region and other celebration activities.
</P>
<P>
Macao residents love to join various tour packages during the
holiday season, but this year they are eager to participate in the
upcoming festivities to mark Macao's return to China and the
establishment of the Macao SAR. Many plan to take to the street to
welcome the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops to Macao.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Travel Agency of Macao, most Macao
residents will stay home to see the handover ceremony and other
celebration activities.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the handover triggered the incoming flow of
tourists to Macao.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures of the Macao Censors and
Statistics Department, the number of tourists coming to Macao in
October was 640,000, up 16 percent over the same period of
previous year. The number of visitors from the Chinese mainland
increased by 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
On December 4, the border checkpoint between Macao and Zhuhai,
Guangdong Province, registered a record high of 154,000 entries.
</P>
<P>
A three-day Macao tour package for the mainlanders will be
suspended on the three days around the day of handover. And a new
peak of incoming visitors to Macao is expected shortly after
Macao's return.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Export Negatively Affected by Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's export has
been negatively affected by the developments in the global economy
during the last one and half years, said a Bank of Tanzania report
available here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Economic and Operations Report of the
central bank, a slowdown in the global economy has led to low
demand for exports in Tanzania's major trading partners.
Meanwhile, low commodity prices have further eroded the value of
Tanzania's export earnings.
</P>
<P>
During the year ending September 1999, the annual trade account
deficit of Tanzania widened by 23.5 percent to 880.8 million U.S.
dollars, compared with that of 713.2 million U.S. dollars recorded
during the corresponding previous year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the trade deficit widened due to a
7.9-percent decline in exports, accompanied with a 9.3-percent
increase in imports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said, the world market commodity prices
have generally declined, particularly for Tanzania's main export
commodities such as coffee, tea, cotton and sisal.

<HEADLINE> NPC to Enhance Supervision on State Council's Economic Work (1) </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The National People's Congress
and its Standing Committee are expected to enhance supervision of
the State Council's economic work in a bid to ensure the sustained,
rapid and healthy development of China's national economy.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guangyi, chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee
of the NPC Standing Committee, made this remark in his explanation
of the draft decision for strengthening the work of economic
supervision to the 13th session of the NPC Standing Committee,
which opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the NPC and its Standing Committee are
enshrined by the Constitution to supervise the work of the State
Council, China's cabinet, which also demonstrates that the people
are exercising their rights as masters of the state.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing supervision of economic work facilitates government
departments to listen to public opinions, improve efficiency,
administer state affairs in accordance with law, and fully
implement the Party's lines, principles, and policies," he said.

The chairman noted that under the socialist market economy,
plans for the national economy and social development are still
regarded as a crucial part in the macroeconomic control of the
state, although changes have taken place in the contents and
methods of the plans.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the state's key projects, Chen said that, in the
first place, the State Council must submit bills to the NPC for
approval, and the NPC should exercise its right of supervision
very carefully and cautiously, as those projects usually involve
huge investments and have a wide and profound impact.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Financial and Economic Committee began outlining the
draft decision at the beginning of this year, and has taken into
consideration related laws and regulations on economic supervision,
and consulted with certain departments of the State Council and
committees under the NPC before finally completing the draft
decision, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> China Amends Corporate Law for Hi-tech Ventures (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature will
amend the country's corporate law in a new move to support the
development of high-tech ventures and facilitate their listings on
stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jingyu, director of the Legal Affairs Office of the State
Council, presented today to the ongoing 13th session of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee an explanation
on the draft amendment.
</P>
<P>
The current law stipulates that the establishment of joint
stock companies and the issuance of new stocks and their listings
depend on their capital mix, profits, and existing equity capital.
</P>
<P>
New and high-tech ventures are noted for their advantages in
turning scientific and technological achievements into productive
forces, and they are usually young, promising, and relatively
small.
</P>
<P>
"Under the present law, start-up high-tech ventures find it
extremely difficult to gain investment directly from the stocks
market," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
This makes it all the more necessary to amend related articles
in the corporate law for the nurturing of a capital market
conducive to the development of China's high-tech industries, Yang
noted.
</P>
<P>
Recent months have witnessed stepped-up efforts by the Chinese
government to provide further support to new and high-tech
companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
China's central authorities in August called for technical
renovation to create a capital market friendly to new and high-
tech industries.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to give new incentives for
high-tech companies to enter into domestic and world capital
markets, and suggested that the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock
Exchanges offer special trading for high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft amendment, the State Council will decide
on the ratio between the share of the company initiators who
contribute their industrial property rights and the registered
capital, and on criteria for new issues of stocks and their
listings.
</P>
<P>
Yang listed several reasons for the amendment, one of them
being that the present ratio of 20 percent is not sufficient to
encourage more commercialization and industrialization of
scientific results.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to lower the criteria for high-tech
companies to issue new stocks and list them on the securities
market, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
As the country still lacks experience in this respect, it will
be better for the State Council rather than a law to decide on and
readjust detailed policies on some specific issues, Yang added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Singapore Prepared for a Knowledge Boom (Part 1)                   By Wang Xiangjiang, Zhu Changdu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 17 (Xinhua) - The year of 1999 has
witnessed a series of crucial initiatives and reforms enacted by
the Singapore government to facilitate the city state's transition
into a knowledge-based economy in the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
These efforts, mainly in financial, legal,technology and
manpower sectors, reflected the government's thorough but gradual
approach to realizing the country's third historic economic
transformation since its independence in 1965.
</P>
<P>
The previous economic transitions included the first in the
1960s and 70s from a trading economy to a labor intensive, low-
wage manufacturing economy and the second, in the 80s and 90s to a
capital-intensive manufacturing and services economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is more than a tweaking," Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien
Loong said. "What we want is a series of adjustments which will be
cumulatively significant, but not an overnight change."
</P>
<P>
In February 1999, Economy Development Board (EDB) launched
Industry 21 (I21) as a new initiative to develop Singapore as a
vibrant and robust global hub of knowledge-driven industries, with
manufacturing and exportable services sectors serving as "two
engines" of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The I21 initiative aims to have manufacturing and services
sectors to contribute to at least 40 percent of Singapore's Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) and create 20,000 to 25,000 jobs annually.
</P>
<P>
As part of its restructuring in the services sector, Singapore
announced in May this year sweeping measures to open up the
domestic banking sector to foreign institutions.
</P>
<P>
Foreign players are now allowed to set up more branches and to
acquire local Singapore banks long-accustomed to a cozy protective
environment.
</P>
<P>
In a more liberalized market, the government hoped to see
mergers and takeovers among the nine local banks which finally
lead to the formation of only two major banks capable of world-
wide competition.
</P>
<P>
The deregulation soon resulted in the partial acquisition of
Keppel Tat Lee Bank by Allied Irish Bank, and other local banks,
like the top player Development Bank of Singapore, also responded
by accelerating their regionalization efforts or setting up
strategic links with foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
More mergers and takeovers will likely follow, said Lee, who
also led the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to enforce a
lot of other liberalization measures in the capital and insurance
markets.
</P>
<P>
In the technology industry, Singapore recently launched the
Info-Communications Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), a
new statutory board formed on the basis of National Computer Board
and Telecommunication Authority of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The formation of IDA reflects the government's emphasis on
developing the country into one of the world's leading centers for
Information Communications Technology (ICT) in light of the fast-
changing telecommunications, information, and media technologies.

<HEADLINE> Tense Situation Returns In Northern Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua)-- Many residents in northern
Israel spent Thursday night in their bomb shelters for fear that
Hezbollah would retaliate for Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
(SLA) shelling of a Lebanese school and wounding school children.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 24 Lebanese school children were wounded
Thursday morning when two bombs, fired by the SLA, slammed into
their schoolyard in the village of Arab Salim, just north of the
Israeli-controlled security zone.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Israel Defense Force (IDF) decided not
to instruct the residents in the north to take cover in their
shelters and security rooms, but many did so nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
A situation appraisal carried out in the IDF's Northern Command
concluded that Hezbollah, the Party of God, would probably not
retaliate, but might open fire at IDF's outposts along the border,
the same kind of action that Hezbollah has shown in the past when
Lebanese civilians were hurt or wounded by Israeli or SLA fire.
</P>
<P>
The heavy exchange of gun fire began early Thursday morning,
the IDF said, when Hezbollah and Amal, another Lebanese guerrilla
group, opened fire and hit the SLA's Broth outpost, in the eastern
sector of the security zone.
</P>
<P>
The SLA then shelled the village of Arab Salim, which the IDF
said was the sources of barrage. Up to three mortar shells landed
in the schoolyard, wounding 24 children aged 5 to 13, several of
them
seriously.
</P>
<P>
IDF said later the shelling of the school and wounding of
children was a mistake and expressed its regret for that.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Yossi Sarid also expressed his "deep regret"
at the wounding of the Lebanese school children, saying children in
the region must not fall victim to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The wounding of Lebanese school children is widely condemned.
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss called it a crime against the
Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation to peace talks in Washington explained
to the Syrians that the incident was an unfortunate mistake, and
asked Damascus to ensure that Hezbollah will not fire Katyusha
rockets into Israel in reaction to the accident, a member of the
Israeli delegation told the Israel Radio.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Free West Papua Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Government
would release all the political detainees, who were imprisoned for
carrying out a separatist movement in Indonesia's Irian Jaya
province, by Christmas, a senior official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We manage to release all of political detainees who were
involved in West Papua movement, by Christmas," Minister of Law
and Legislation Yusril Ihza Mahendra told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
West Papua movement is a name used by separatist group in Irian
Jaya province to demand for independence and a separate state from
the unitary state of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The group has been launching a gun-fighting against central
government over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Mahendra said the planned-release was a part of government
effort to launch a new policy to give special amnesty, abolition
and remission for all prisoners by religious celebration.
</P>
<P>
"Later, the government will give special amnesty, abolition and
remission to all of prisoners (not only political prisoners) by
religious celebration. This will be a new government policy,"
Mahendra added.
</P>
<P>
"There will not be a discrimination, of course, and all
religions in the country will be covered by the new policy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said, in a bid to uphold democratic
values and respect human rights, Indonesia plans to free all of
its political detainees nationwide. President Abdurrahman Wahid
had agreed on the policy.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the new government has released more than 100
political prisoners who were detained by the former regime headed
by Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wahid has also invited all those Indonesians who
have been living in exile to return home.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Government Helicopter Shot Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan air force MI24
helicopter was shot down Friday morning by Tamil rebels in the
north of the country, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said two pilots and two gunners aboard the
helicopter are feared dead in the crash.
</P>
<P>
They said the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
rebels shot down the helicopter around 10 a.m. local time over the
Jaffna lagoon near the Elephant Pass, some 290 km north of the
capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Since last Saturday, LTTE rebels have launched repeated attacks
in a bid to overrun the Elephant Pass military complex, the first
line of defense protecting Jaffna, the former stronghold of LTTE
that the government retook in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the Defense Ministry said government troops have
repulsed all the attempts by the LTTE rebels who have been
fighting for a separate Tamil state in Sri Lanka's north and east
since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah: No Fresh Attack on Northern Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's leading anti-Israeli
guerrilla group Hezbollah has said that it would not attack
northern Israel in retaliation for an Israeli bomb attack which
wounded 15 Lebanese children, the Daily Star newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"In our opinion it is worth this kind of reply but we are going
to settle for a warning addressed to the Zionists," said Hezbollah
Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah at a dinner to break the
day-long Ramadan fast late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the pro-Israeli militia South Lebanon Army (SLA)
fired three mortar shells on the Arab Salim village, which faces
the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A bomb hit the village's schoolyard and injured at least 15
students.
</P>
<P>
Israel had confirmed that the shelling was mounted by its ally
SLA to take revenge on earlier attacks from the same village by
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
But the Iranian-backed Hezbollah denied that its fighters had
launched any operations against Israelis or SLA militiamen on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Hezbollah always launched Katyusha rockets into
northern Israel once Lebanese civilians were killed or wounded in
the clash.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said Hezbollah this time exercised self-
restraint so as not to harm progress in the current Syrian-Israeli
talks which were revived after a 45-month break by the United
States on Wednesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by Hezbollah, or Party
of God, has Since been fighting to oust the Israeli forces.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Government Foreign Debt Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The foreign debt of the
Indonesian government has increased by 15.8 billion U.S. dollars
over the past two years, bringing the total of government debt to
146 billion U.S. dollars, a business daily Friday reported.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign debt of the government has risen 15.8 billion U.S.
dollars over the past two years so that the total government debt
(domestic and foreign) has reached 146 billion U.S. dollars," the
Bisnis Indonesia daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted a senior official as saying that government
debt increased from 52.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1996/1997 fiscal
year to 68.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1998/1999 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
"Entering 1999/2000, the total of government foreign debt is
predicted to reach 71.9 billion U.S. dollars or equivalent with 45
percent of the country's GDP (Gross Domestic Brutto)," the daily
quoted Chairman of The Board of National Development Planning,
Djunaedi Hadisumarto as saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1998/1999 fiscal year, internal debt of government was 21.9
billion U.S. dollars and the figure will reach 74.7 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999/2000, Hadisumarto said.
</P>
<P>
"And in 1998/1999, the government has started to organize its
internal debt in the form of bond to finance the banking
restructuring program, so that in 1999/2000 it (govt's internal
debt) is expected to reach 74.7 billion U.S dollars or 51 percent
of the total government debt," he said.
</P>
<P>
The daily wrote that most of the government foreign borrowings
were used to finance development projects, but at the time of
economic crisis it had been used to finance poverty eradication,
social safety net and subsidy program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie insisted that Indonesia would not seek debt
relief as such a move could even deteriorate the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"We will not ask for hair cut, but rescheduling," he said,
referring to the upcoming agenda of CGI (the Consultative Group
for Indonesia) meeting which was set for early February.

<HEADLINE> EU Confident About Macao's Future: Envoy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Representative of the
European Commission in Hong Kong and Macao Etienne Reuter said
here Friday that the European Union (EU) supports China's "one
country, two systems" policy on Macao and is committed to further
EU-Macao relations after Macao's return to China.
</P>
<P>
"The concept of 'One country, two systems' has worked well in
Hong Kong and must be considered a success, and I believe this
concept will also work smoothly in Macao," Reuter told Xinhua on
the eve of Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old diplomat from Luxembourg believed that the
establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China will "signal a new departure of, and give a boost to, Macao'
s economic development."
</P>
<P>
As a EU envoy to Hong Kong and Macao, Reuter travels between
the two cities frequently every year and devotes his efforts to
bringing closer the economic relations between EU and Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Macao is of economic potential since it has the tradition of
an open and tolerant society and costs there are low and its
infrastructures are generally good, though it is geographically
small," Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
Macao has also market potential in the service sector and will
be a tourist destination, he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Confident About Macao's Future: Envoy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As for EU-Macao relations, Reuter said that " EU attaches great
importance to the preservation of Macao's special identity and
cultural legacy as well as of its historical links with Europe."
</P>
<P>
"Over the past decade, the bilateral relations between Macao
and EU have been strengthened in a steady way," he said, adding
that the strong personal ties between the two places make Macao "a
natural springboard "for EU into the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
According to him, EU is Macao's second largest trading partner,
absorbing roughly 30 percent of its total annual export, and it
also ranked the third largest investor in Macao after China's
Mainland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal have agreed that the Trade and Cooperation
Agreement Macao concluded with EU in 1992 will continue after
Macao's return to the motherland, and the European Commission
intends to further develop and strengthen this cooperation,
according to Reuter.
</P>
<P>
Under this cooperation, a well-known vocational training center
in the hotel industry and a highly-regarded institute of European
studies have been set up in Macao, Reuter added.
</P>
<P>
"We will work together with the newly-born Macao SAR government
to identify the specific needs and work on programs for Macao's
economic growth in a bid to help Macao become a regional center
for training and cultural exchanges," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reuter believed that Macao will remain a special partner for EU
in the region and fulfill its potential as a regional center for
cultural and economic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that we will witness a smooth transfer in
Macao and that the new team under Macao SAR Chief Executive Ho Hau
Wah has the ability to cope with all kinds of challenges they may
face," Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's accession to the World Trade Organization (
WTO), Reuter believed that it will benefit the Chinese mainland
and Macao in many respects. The same rule for trade will apply to
both Macao and China's interior area, and Macao's experience of
the WTO membership will also be helpful to partners from the
mainland, Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
Basically, China's entry into the WTO will mean more trade and
more exchanges, and Macao, as an entrepot for Chinese exports as
well as a service provider, will benefit a lot, he said.

<HEADLINE> 43 Countries to Retain Consulates in Post-Return Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Forty-three countries will be
able to retain their consular representations in Macao after China
resume the exercise of sovereignty over the region on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Shi Yuegen, director of the Visa Office of Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of China in Macao, told Xinhua today that the Foreign
Ministry has already reached understanding with 43 countries on
the status of their consular representations in Macao after the
region returns to China on December 20.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China to be established on the
early morning of December 20, the countries that have consular or
other official representations here but no diplomatic relations
with China will, depending on specific conditions, be able to
either retain the existing consular representations or change them
into semiofficial institutions.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that those regions that China has not recognized
as sovereignties will only be allowed to set up non-official
institutions here.
</P>
<P>
Shi made the remarks as the Visa Office concluded its work
today.
</P>
<P>
Now 53 countries have sent consul generals, consuls or honorary
consuls to Macao. Forty-three of them are consul generals and
consuls who are stationed in Hong Kong. The other dozen are
honorary consuls.
</P>
<P>
"The issues of consul representations of most of the countries
in Macao have already been settled," Shi said, noting that consul
representations of the remaining countries are still under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
The Visa Office will be turned into the Consular Department of
the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
China in Macao on December 20. It will open on December 23. Since
the Visa Office was set up on December 12, 1991, it has issued
travel documents to over 100,000 entries into the Chinese mainland
for compatriots from Macao, Hong Kong and Taiwan, overseas Chinese
and foreigners in the past eight years.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Alarmed Over Fake Medical Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Ministry of Health has
 expressed serious concern over the mushrooming of illegal private
medical training institutions, saying that only the degrees
granted by authorized universities will be recognized.
</P>
<P>
Mere pursuit of money and low level of academic performance
determine that the graduates of these illegal institutions are
less qualified, the ministry was quoted by Friday's East African
Standard newspaper as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued Thursday warned the public against
advertisements made by these institutions in the media.
</P>
<P>
Qualifications of pharmacy personnel awarded by medical
institutions abroad must be recognized only by the ministry,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the ministry prohibited nurses or
pharmacists without proper certificates from working in an effort
to boost health service.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Seeds Calls for Tough Action Against Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The first draft law on seeds
submitted to the China's top legislative body here today calls for
tough punishment of those who produce or sell shoddy seeds to
protect the farmers' interests.
</P>
<P>
Gao Dezhan, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee, put forward the proposal
on the draft law on seeds today at the 13th meeting of the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said the healthy development of the seed industry is of
great importance for safeguarding the interests of farmers, the
farming industry, and agricultural modernization.
</P>
<P>
Gao described seeds as the most basic means of production for
farming and forestry, and a special commodity reflecting
technological progress.
</P>
<P>
Seeds have a direct impact on the quality and output of farm
products and play a great role in human health and the safety of
the environment, he added.
</P>
<P>
The guiding principle for drafting the law is to conserve and
properly utilize the seed resources, and regulate seed breeding,
manufacturing and utilization, the lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
Gao added that the law is also designed to safeguard the
interests of breeders, producers and traders of seeds, ensure seed
quality, and facilitate the utilization of improved varieties of
seeds and their commercialization process.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Return of Historic Significance: Singaporean Envoy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- "As an individual, it is a
very special opportunity to witness two major events in history,"
said Chan Heng Wing, Singaporean consul-general to the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Chan voiced his confidence in the successful practice of the
concept in Macao, saying that "One Country, Two Systems" is a
unique concept and something historic.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old diplomat will attend the ceremony of Macao's
return to the motherland on December 20, about 29 months after
witnessing the historical event of China's resumption of its
sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chan, who assumed office in Hong Kong four months before its
return to China, said that Singapore, which also experienced
colonial rule in history, is well aware of the influence the
European powers imposed on itself in the past.
</P>
<P>
"China also had undergone a painful history, especially in the
past 100 years. The return of Macao marks an end of an era in
which our life was ruled by European powers," Chan told Xinhua in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
"The concept of 'One Country, Two Systems' will be put into
practice in Macao as in Hong Kong, though it may be implemented
differently in the two places with different economic fundamentals
and different historical backgrounds," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the historic significance of the idea of "One
Country, Two Systems", saying that it is not only very important
for China but also for other parts of the world because "if it
works well, it can bring peace and stability to China, which will
contribute to the peace and stability of Asia."

<P>
"If all of us can have a stable environment, we can focus on
development," he noted.
</P>
<P>
As a representative to Hong Kong, and also to Macao, he
observes with interest how these things develop, said Chan, who
shuttles between the two places quite often and has met with
senior officials who will serve in the government of the Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of Macao, including Edmund Ho Hau Wah,
chief executive-designate of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
"The future of Macao is very bright. The officials I have
talked with have great confidence and I was very heartened by
listening to them, not only Ho, but also other senior officials,"
Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore would be happy to work with the government of the
Macao SAR government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Both Singapore and Macao are very small places and the volume
of trade between the two places is not large, but "Singapore
Airlines is one of the few airlines in the world that actually has
direct flight to Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's trade with Macao was 44.7 million Singaporean
dollars (about 26.6 million U.S. dollars) in 1998. For the period
of the first 10 months of 1999, the total volume of the trade was
66.4 million Singaporean dollars (39.5 million U.S. dollars),
according to the consul-general.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are looking for a greater trade in the future since
Macao's return to China will open still greater opportunities,"
Chan said.

LUSAKA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) has said the implementation of the
Free Trade Area (FTA) in October 2000 will contribute to the
development of Zambia's economy, Times of Zambia newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Erastus Mwencha, Secretary General of COMESA, was quoted as
saying here on Thursday that Zambian business community should not
fear FTA but rather use it to improve the production of the
country.
</P>
<P>
It will not have a major negative impact on the economy of the
African country, he said, citing that a COMESA study shows that
about 90 percent of Zambia's imports are from non-COMESA
countries, as such the FTA will have little impact on its
industry.
</P>
<P>
Some Zambian businessmen fear that the FTA will put Zambia's
economy at a disadvantage because of its poor performance compared
with other COMESA members.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Return of Historic Significance: Singaporean Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- "As an individual, it is a
very special opportunity to witness two important events in
history," said Chan Heng Wing, Consul-General of Singapore in the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Chan expressed his confidence in the successful practice of the
concept in Macao, saying that "One Country, Two Systems" is a
unique concept and something historic.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old diplomat will attend the ceremony of Macao's
return to China on December 20, about 29 months after he witnessed
the historical event of China's resumption of the sovereignty over
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chan, who assumed office in Hong Kong four months before the
handover of Hong Kong, said that Singapore, which also experienced
colonial rule in history, is well aware of the influence that the
European powers exercised.
</P>
<P>
"China went through a lot of painful history, especially in the
last one hundred years. The return of Macao marks an end of an era
when our life was ruled by European powers," Chan told Xinhua in
an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
"The concept of `One Country, Two Systems` will be well
implemented in Macao as in Hong Kong, although it may be
implemented differently in the two places with different economic
fundamentals and different historical backgrounds," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the historic significance of the idea of "One
Country, Two Systems", saying that it is not only very important
for China but also for other parts of the world because "if it
works well, it can bring peace and stability to China, which will
contribute to the peace and stability of Asia."
</P>
<P>
"If all of us can have a stable environment, we can focus on
development," he noted.
</P>
<P>
As a representative to Hong Kong, and also to Macao, he
observes with interest how these things develop, said Chan, who
shuttles between the two places quite often and has met with
senior officials who will serve in the government of the Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of Macao, including Edmund Ho Hau Wah,
chief executive-designate of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
"The future of Macao is very bright. The officials I have
talked with have great confidence and I was very heartened by
listening to them, not only Ho, but also other senior officials,"
Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore would be happy to work with the government of the
Macao SAR government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Both Singapore and Macao are very small places and the volume
of trade between the two places is not large, but "Singapore
Airlines is one of the few airlines in the world that actually has
direct flight into Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's trade with Macao was 44.7 million Singaporean
dollars (about 26.6 million U.S. dollars) in 1998. For the period
of the first 10 months of 1999, the total volume of the trade was
66.4 million Singaporean dollars (about 39.5 million U.S. dollars),
according to the consul-general.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are looking at a greater trade in the future since
Macao's return to China will open greater opportunities," Chan
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Most filling stations in
Zambia's capital Lusaka ran out of petrol Friday morning and the
few outlets still operating had to ration because of limited
stocks.
</P>
<P>
According to fuel attendants in the city, where long queues
formed Thursday, the shortage was caused by fluctuations in oil
prices on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Others attributed the shortage to petrol hoarding in
anticipation of the price hike. Zambian Energy and Water
Development Minister David Saviye confirmed here on Thursday that
the fuel prices in the country will go up by more than 26 percent
next week.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second time for Zambia to increase its fuel
prices in six months. The first took place in May when the prices
went up by five percent.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Gears up for 15 Pct Share of Thai Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Japanese automobile giant
Nissan hopes to gain the third place in total vehicle sales in
Thailand next year, up from the fifth place this year, the Bangkok
Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nissan hoped to make 40,000 sales next year, increasing its
share to 15 percent from nine percent this year, Phornthep
Phornprapha, president of Siam Motor and Nissan Sales Co., was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the targeted sales, 24,600 vehicles would be Cefiro, Sunny
and NV models, and 15,400 would be Big M one-ton pickups,
Phornthep predicted.
</P>
<P>
He said industry-wide auto sales in Thailand should total 260,
000 next year, up from an anticipated 200,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased with Nissan's doubling of car sales year-
on-year to 9,180 between January and November this year.
</P>
<P>
Including other vehicles, Nissan's total sales for the period
were 17,510, up by 48 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Phornthep said one reason for the improvement in local sales
was assistance provided to Nissan dealers nationwide during the
recession to ensure they stayed afloat, which included financial
support, easier terms for debt repayment and the waiving of sales
targets.
</P>
<P>
Nissan has 95 dealers who run 176 showrooms all around
Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Australian Food Exports to Asia Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The value of Australian food
exports is growing at a rate mirroring the economic recovery of
Asian countries, Australian Associated Press (AAP) said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
AAP quoted the Supermarket to Asia Council as saying that the
figures of the third quarter, 1999, revealed an increase of 16
percent of the exports over the same quarter in 1998, and a 12.5
percent increase on the 1997 quarter figures.
</P>
<P>
Seafood, dairy, meat, horticulture and general grocery exports
rose significantly, the council said.
</P>
<P>
The Council was set up by Australian Prime Minister John Howard
to monitor and perpetuate the growth of the country's food exports
to Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Two years after the crash, our food sales to Asia have entered
a new growth phase," the council's Executive Director Jim Kennedy
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Comparing the September 1999 quarter to the September 1997
quarter, most food export sectors show continued signs of recovery,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Exports are growing most in the Japanese market, where
Australian mango growers are set for a 10-million-Australian
dollar (6.6 million U.S. dollars) earnings boost, the council said.
</P>
<P>
Some smaller markets fell during the quarter, including
Cambodia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam,
indicating consumers in some countries could still not afford
imported food.

<HEADLINE> EU Confident About Macao's Future: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Representative of the
European Commission in Hong Kong and Macao Etienne Reuter said
Friday that the European Union (EU) supports China's "one country,
two systems" policy on Macao and is committed to further EU-Macao
relations after Macao's return to China.
</P>
<P>
"The concept of 'One country, two systems' has worked well in
Hong Kong and must be considered a success, and I believe this
concept will also work smoothly in Macao," Reuter told Xinhua on
the eve of Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old diplomat from Luxembourg believed the
establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China will "signal a new departure of, and give a boost to, Macao'
s economic development."
</P>
<P>
As an EU envoy to Hong Kong and Macao, Reuter travels between
the two cities frequently every year and devotes his efforts to
bring closer the economic relation between EU and Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Macao is of economic potential since it has the tradition of
an open and tolerant society and costs there are low and its
infrastructures are generally good, though it is geographically
small," Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
Macao has also market potential in service sectors and will be
a tourist destination, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for EU-Macao relations, Reuter said that " EU attaches great
importance to the preservation of Macao's special identity and
cultural legacy as well as of its historical links with Europe."
</P>
<P>
"Over the past decade, the bilateral relations between Macao
and EU have been strengthened in a steady way," he said, adding
that the strong personal ties between the two places make Macao "a
natural springboard "for EU into the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
According to him, EU is Macao's second largest trading partner,
absorbing roughly 30 percent of its total annual export, and it is
also ranked the third largest investor in Macao after China's
Mainland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal have agreed that the Trade and Cooperation
Agreement Macao concluded with EU in 1992 will continue after
Macao's return, and the European Commission intends to further
develop and strengthen this cooperation, according to Reuter.
</P>
<P>
Under this cooperation, a well-known vocational training center
in hotel industry and a highly-regarded institute of European
studies have been set up in Macao, Reuter added.
</P>
<P>
"We will work together with the newly-born Macao SAR government
to identify the specific needs and work on programs for Macao's
economic development in a bid to help Macao become a regional
center for training and cultural exchanges," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reuter believed that Macao will remain a special partner for EU
in the region and fulfill its potential as a regional center for
cultural and economic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that we will witness a smooth transfer in
Macao and that the new team under Macao SAR Chief Executive Ho Hau
Wah has the ability to cope with all kinds of challenges they may
face." Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's accession to the World Trade Organization (
WTO), Reuter believed it will benefit China and Macao in many
respects. The same rule for trade will apply to both Macao and the
Chinese mainland, and Macao's experience of WTO membership will
also be helpful to partners from the mainland, Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
Basically, China's entry into the WTO will mean more trade and
more exchanges, and Macao, as an entrepot for Chinese exports as
well as a service provider, will benefit a lot, he said.

<HEADLINE> Survey Reveals Significant Increase in E-mail Use Among U.S. Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 16 (Xinhua) -- American lawyers are
getting customed to contact their clients via e-mail, according to
a survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight percent of attorneys surveyed are sending
electronic messages to clients at least daily, and more than half
say they are willing to include sensitive information in e-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 200 attorneys among 1,200 largest law firms in the
United States was developed by the Affiliates, a U.S. staffing
service specializing in project attorneys and legal support
personnel.
</P>
<P>
In a survey conducted last year, 42 percent of respondents said
they communicated with clients at least daily via e-mail, yet
three out of five were unwilling to send confidential information.
</P>
<P>
This year, 57 percent of attorneys said they send e-mail to
their clients several times daily.
</P>
<P>
"Greater dependence by businesses on electronic communication,
along with more reliable network security systems that protect
privileged attorney-client information, are among several factors
contributing to increase e-mail use," the Affiliates said.
</P>
<P>
Clients like e-mail reports, the Affiliates added, because they
are immediate and informative, yet do not require as many
resources to produce as do formal written memos. Attorneys are
also able to update clients, while leaving more time for key cases
and projects.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Hails Macao's Handover to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Scretary-General Kofi Annan hailed here Thursday the upcoming
handover of Macao to China, praising China and Portugal for the
successfully negotiated settlement of the long-standing issue of
Macao's status.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome most warmly China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao. I wish to also praise the fact that the
handover has been agreed through dialogue and negotiation," said
the U.N. chief in a written statement to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal have agreed that a handover ceremony will be
held in Macao on Monday. Presidents Jiang Zemin of China and
Jorge Sampaio of Portugal will be present at the ceremony and
Under Secretary-General of the United Nation Sergio de Mello will
also be there on Annan's behalf.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return to China signifies an end to the more than 100
years of Portuguese colonial rule over the region. In April 1987,
China and Portugal signed the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on
the Question of Macao, which set the date for the handover.
</P>
<P>
As the agreement was reached through dialogue and negotiation,
China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Macao "
enjoys the full support and respect of the international community,
" the secretary-general commented.
</P>
<P>
"On this historic occasion, I address my heartfelt
congratulations to the Governments of the People's Republic of
China and of Portugal," Annan said, praising the two countries'
leaders for demonstrating "vision and determination."
</P>
<P>
Annan's comment came at a time when the Chinese people both at
home and abroad are prepared to celebrate the historic and festive
event on Monday. The outgoing Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Viera
delivered his farewell speech Tuesday and the 23-year-old
Legislative Assembly held its last session the next day.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah will be Macao's first chief executive after
the handover and the Legislative Assembly will be replaced by the
first Legislative Council of the Macao Special Administrative
Region Monday.
</P>
<P>
"My warmest wishes are addressed to all the people of China,
but in particular to the people of Macao. I feel confident that
under the principle of 'one country, two systems' and the
important commitments that have been made, Macao will preserve its
way of life to the benefit of all," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" principle reflects the vision of
China's late leader Deng Xiaoping. It has been applied in Hong
Kong since its return to China in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
"On the eve of the 21st century, I wish Edmund Ho Hau Wah, its
first Chief Executive-designate, every success in making Macao,
together with its legislature and all its people, a prosperous and
vigorous society, where the rule of law and respect for human
dignity prevail," said the U.N. Chief.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that Annan would send a message to President
Jiang Zemin, congratulating him for the handover. He paid a visit
last month to China, the second leg of his Asian tour.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton Association Urged to Court Young Talent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Former badminton queen Susi
Susanti has urged the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) to
seek younger talented players, especially women, and not to
pigeonhole them in one event during their early years of national
training.
</P>
<P>
"I think PBSI must look for younger talent, players who are
about 14 years old, to be admitted to the Indonesian Badminton
Center," Susi was quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The recently retired Susi was commenting on the poor
performance of Indonesian women shuttlers. No player has replaced
her in the world's top rankings and Mia Audina, formerly Indonesia
's second best player, moved to the Netherlands with her Dutch
husband in May.
</P>
<P>
Susi, whose slew of career titles included gold in the 1992
Olympics, said the recruitment system of selecting winners of
national tournaments was good, but PBSI still needed to admit
younger players who displayed talent.
</P>
<P>
"I experienced myself that by recruiting 14-year-old girls,
coaches still can improve their skills, and physical and mental
conditioning,"she said.
</P>
<P>
"Tournament winners who are more than 18 years old still can be
recruited as sparring partners for younger players. They should
have an internal selection to decide the ranking," she added.
</P>
<P>
It was up to the coaches to impart their training and knowledge
to the players.
</P>
<P>
"Players must have the initiative to increase their training
sessions if they're physically strong enough. Only by hard work
can they reach international standards," she said.
</P>
<P>
Susi faulted PBSI's training program which put players in an
event specialty of either singles or doubles.
</P>
<P>
"Those young girls must play singles, women's doubles and mixed
doubles during their early years in the center. They must also
compete in those three events in national tournaments. When they
reach the senior level, PBSI can determine which event is best for
them," she said.
</P>
<P>
Susi said PBSI should not expect great achievements from
younger players for at least the first three years of training.
</P>
<P>
"We can't expect them to win a title in three years. But later
on,I believe we can count on them," she said.
</P>
<P>
Susi named Singapore and Malaysia as examples of countries who
were endeavouring to pick talented younger players. The
neighbouring countries have lacked top-ranked women's shuttlers
for nearly a decade but are grooming teenagers now.

<HEADLINE> Solution of Transition-Related Issues Essential to Sino-Portuguese Cooperation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the efforts of the Chinese side in the past ten years,
localization of laws has almost been completed. Amendments of the
five major laws, namely the Criminal Code, Criminal Procedure Code,
the Civil Code, the Commercial Code and the Civil Procedure Code,
have been finished.
</P>
<P>
Copies in Chinese are available for most of the laws formulated
since 1990 and the Legislative Assembly of Macao began to use the
Chinese language in legislation.
</P>
<P>
Since the first Chinese judge assumed office in 1996, the
judicial officer team of Macao has now more than 20 Chinese judges
and 5 Chinese lawyers, who have paved the way for the transition
of law professionals in Macao.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and the
Macao SAR Basic Law, the Chinese language, whose legal status will
be above the Portuguese, will be the main official language of the
Macao SAR, after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over
Macao.
</P>
<P>
It is thus an imperative task in the transitional period to
change the status of Portuguese as the sole official language in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of China and Portugal reached agreement on
the official status of the Chinese language in 1991 in Lisbon. A
code on the official status of the Chinese language in Macao was
also adopted and promulgated by Portugal's ministerial meeting in
December 1991. Chinese began to become an official language in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Bilingual forms closely related to the daily life of Macao
residents have been almost adopted by the Portuguese Macao
government. New laws and codes have been worked out in Chinese and
Portuguese by the legislature. Simultaneous interpretation of
Chinese and Portuguese have been gradually taken by the judiciary
in trying a case. The Chinese judges began to try cases in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Joaquim Pina Moura, Minister of Finance and Economy of Portugal,
said the transfer of power of Macao was a new challenge to
Portugal, that is seeking ways under new circumstance to develop
ties with China, and it is of great importance to the economic
sector and enterprises in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Experts held that a closer tie between Macao and the Chinese
mainland is expected after the return of Macao, and the "elements
of China" will be more prominent to the economic growth of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Portugal will obtain a favorable situation to extend
cooperation with China in various fields through the future Macao
SAR, by making use of Macao's free economic system, extensive
international links and preferential economic policy, as well as
various advantages of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The return of Macao to China, which will take place just before
Portugal take its return as president of the European Union in
January 1, 2000, will bring opportunities for Europe and Asia,
for Portugal and China in particular, to develop cooperation among
enterprises and in the scientific and technological fields, said
experts.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Education to Benefit from Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Macao's return to China will not
only create opportunities for economic recovery but give new
impetus to education of the region, a local scholar said.
</P>
<P>
After the handover the exchange between institutes of higher
learning of the mainland and Macao will be increasing further,
said Professor Li Xiangyu, dean of the Macao Polytechnic Institute.
</P>
<P>
With the advanced facilities and capable faculties, Macao's
colleges can provide Portuguese language training while the
mainland can supply more talents to Macao, Li said in a recent
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Macao and mainland colleges also can exchange visit, share
information and do research together, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li said his institute plans to offer bachelor and master
programs in Chinese for a group of government employees of Macao,
with the purpose of raising their Chinese language ability and
managerial and professional quality. The programs will be jointly
sponsored by Beijing Language and Culture University.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1991, Macao Polytechnic Institute is one of the two
prestigious higher learning institutions in the region. It is now
the biggest Chinese language (Mandarin) training and testing
center as well as the biggest Portuguese language training center
in Macao.
</P>
<P>
As the new Macao Special Administrative Region government
attaches importance to education, it will spend great time and
effort in raising Macao's educational level, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, the first Chief Executive-designate of Macao
SAR, proposed in his election platform that education is essential
to Macao. This demonstrates the importance he attaches to
education, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li said he believes the Macao SAR government will begin to
reform the much debated educational system of Macao after it is in
power, creating new opportunities for future development of
education.
</P>
<P>
After the handover, both Portuguese and Chinese will be used as
official languages. Li said Macao's government and academic
circles will make effort to protect the use of Portuguese, a
language bridging China with Europe, Latin America and Portuguese-
speaking African countries.

<HEADLINE> Moldova's New Prime Minister Candidate Nominated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Moldovan President Petr
Luchinsky on Thursday nominated the country's third prime minister
candidate in five weeks and authorized him to form a new cabinet
as soon as possible, said reports reaching here from the Moldovan
capital Kishinev.
</P>
<P>
At a parliament meeting, Luchinsky said he hoped Dumitru
Braghis to complete both the cabinet makeup and the administrative
program by next Tuesday, though the country's constitution allows
15 days for the premier nominee to finish the job before taking
office with parliament approval.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Luchinsky urged the country's political
groups to cease dispute and abandon partisan politics in the
interest of the voters and of the nation, which, he said, is
suffering in a severe economic situation expected to be worsened
by the continuation of the current government crisis.
</P>
<P>
The current government crisis has been the second so far this
year, coming after the last government led by Ion Sturza failed in
a parliamentary vote of confidence on November 9 after seven
months in power.
</P>
<P>
Braghis, 42, an engineer and Deputy Minister of Economy and
Reform in the last two governments, said that he will form a
cabinet of experts, excluding parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts believe that his cabinet plan will likely be
passed by the parliament.

has been fired for using public funds to buy a larger house than
he was allowed and home furnishings to put in it.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Discover Cause of Death Among Women in Childbirth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prof. Wang Dezhi, expert in obstetrics and gynecology at CMSU,
said that according to a series of random sample tests, about 46.7
percent of the women died of post parturition flooding, that is,
the violent outpouring of blood after giving birth.
</P>
<P>
The investigation, sponsored by the Ministry of Health and the
World Children's Fund, covered 58 villages in six undeveloped
counties of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that high blood pressure and heart disease were
also contributing factors in death among these women.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been making great efforts to improve
medical treatment for rural residents, though it is still not
adequate, especially in some undeveloped villages.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in early 1980s, mortality
among women in childbirth was 61 out of 100,000 cases in the
villages of Liaoning Province, but by the end of 1998, it is was
less than 40 out of 100,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that experts have created simple but scientific
and quite workable methods to prevent the flooding. The Ministry
of Health and the Chinese Medical Association are making
preparations to spread this method as part of measures to improve
medical care in China's rural areas, especially for women and
children.

<HEADLINE> More Banks To Be Set Up in West, Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 17 (Xinhua)-- Five new branches of China
Development Bank (CDB) will be officially established in west and
central China in response to the central government's recent
strategy to spur the economic development of the vast area.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, CDB
will set up its branches in Urumqi, Hohhot, Lanzhou, Taiyuan and
Kunming, five capital cities of Xinjiang Uygur and Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Regions and Gansu, Shanxi and Yunnan Provinces by the
end of this year. By that time, the number of CDB branches in the
region will increase to 19, according to Chen Jianying, who is in
charge of the preparatory work of Urumqi branch.
</P>
<P>
CDB is a policy lending bank established in 1994 by the Chinese
government to strengthen infrastructure construction and set up
mechanisms for investment risk control. With 50 billion yuan (
about six billion U.S. dollars) of equity capital, the bank mainly
provides medium and long-term fixed asset loans.
</P>
<P>
CDB has provided some 380 billion yuan (about 43 billion U.S.
dollars), 70 percent of its total loans, to the west and central
China regions.
</P>
<P>
The west and central China region covers some 87 percent of
China's territory and accounts for about 58 percent of its total
population. It has abundant natural resources and biological
species, and also plays a important role in economic exchanges
with countries that border China.

<HEADLINE> Solution of Transition-Related Issues Essential to Sino-Portuguese Cooperation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The solution of major transition-
related issues of Macao, especially the substantial progress made
in solving the three major ones left over by history, the
localization of civil servants, the localization of laws and the
status of Chinese as an official language, has laid a solid basis
for the friendly cooperation between China and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Under the rule of Portuguese government, the Chinese people
have been long excluded from the medium- and high level official
posts of the Macao government. The laws enacted in Macao are those
drawn up especially for Macao by Portugal or those Portuguese laws
extended to the region.
</P>
<P>
Legislation of Macao is made in Portuguese, and judicial system
of Macao is incomplete. The Chinese language used by Macao's
Chinese residents that constitute 96 percent of the local
population has been deprived of legal recognition for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The three issues, which are important in the transition period,
have a bearing on the smooth transition and the normal operation
of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) after its
establishment on December 20, 1999. The Chinese side has attached
much importance to these issues, which have also drawn great
concern from various communities of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration in
1987, the solution of the three major transition-related issues
have been in progress at various degrees with the concerted
efforts of both China and Portugal and the active participation of
the various communities of Macao.
</P>
<P>
A special work group responsible for handling the three issues
was set up by the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG). A
total of 27 meetings were held from December 13, 1990 to March 23,
1999. Both sides held that China and Portugal had made sound
cooperation at the work group, which yielded noted achievements.
</P>
<P>
Localization of the civil servants has witnessed considerable
progress, especially in 1999. At present, the civil servants at
the medium- and grassroots levels are almost Macao residents,
while more than half of the high-ranking civil servants are Macao
residents.
</P>
<P>
After the Macao SAR government swears in on December 20, five
secretaries appointed by the Central Government will assume office
to ultimately realize the localization of civil servants at policy-
making level in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Pataca to Stay as Official Currency in Post-Handover Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- After Macao bids farewell to
more than 100 years of Portuguese rule on December 20, the century-
old pataca will remain in circulation as the official, convertible
currency in the region, according to the Basic Law of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR) and China's "one country, two
systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
However, few people know that the pataca is not of Portuguese
origin. For a long period, Chinese and foreign currencies had been
in circulation in Macao. The pataca, which the Portuguese had
previously called "the Mexican pataca," was first used by Spanish
merchants in the Philippines and went into use in Macao in 1901.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Government had pushed hard to make the pataca
acceptable to local people as the official currency, but the money
did not take root in the region until 1929, when a government ban
on the use of other currencies was imposed.
</P>
<P>
The Macao pataca was tied up with Escudo, the Portuguese
currency, at 1:5, but the link was abolished in the mid-1970s due
to a severe recession in Portugal. Since then, the pataca has been
linked directly with the Hong Kong dollar and, thus, indirectly
with the U.S. dollar. This has resulted in a stable pataca.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Bank of China and Banco Nacional Ultramarino began to
jointly issue the pataca and the two banks plan to put a new set
of the pataca into circulation in commemoration of the upcoming
return of Macao to China on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Will the pataca become another hotly sought-after item for
collectors, like Hong Kong coins bearing the image of the British
Queen around its handover?
</P>
<P>
"Not likely, " replied Herculano J. Sousa, general manager of
Banco Nacional Ultramarino. The pataca is not likely to be as
attractive to collectors as its Hong Kong counterpart, he said,
adding the Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority of Macao has
had a sufficient stock to cope with market demands.
</P>
<P>
In fact, local business people are not concerned about what
kind of money is in use. The pataca, the HK dollar and the Chinese
renminbi are all acceptable in this small but free international
metropolis.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Hope to Settle Trade, Political Issues at Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
the United States will seek ways to settle trade disputes and some
political issues at their summit meeting in Washington on Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton is scheduled to meet with European
Commission President Romano Prodi, Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari and Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen. Finland holds the
current EU presidency and will hand over the status to Portugal
from the beginning of the next year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to issue a statement reaffirming
their faith in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and expressing
their hope that a new and broad agenda for the trade body can be
agreed shortly, according to EU officials.
</P>
<P>
The European and American leaders will also talk about trade
disputes, such as bananas, hormone-treated beef, aircraft hushkits
and data privacy rules, in addition to political hot-spots like
Chechnya and Kosovo, the EU sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, it will be hard for the leaders to pave the way in
solving trans-Atlantic trade disputes at the one-day summit,
observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Before the WTO's Seattle ministerial meeting ended earlier this
month, the EU and the United States were blaming each other for
the deadlock in negotiations. Although both sides pointed out
that the talks were merely suspended and an agenda for a new round
of global trade negotiations could still be launched, there was
feeling that "the positions are too entrenched for such an
agreement within the next few months."
</P>
<P>
"If they are unable to agree on a common statement on that,
then there is a real problem," EU official said.
</P>
<P>
Now, the two sides have to deal with some issues which have
caused certain trade battles. One is data privacy as well as a
plan to help U.S. companies comply with a new EU law that sets
strict rules about how they use personal information about
customers or other individuals. The United States has no general
data protection law, but wants a system of industry self-
regulation.
</P>
<P>
Another pending issue is the dispute over hormone-treated beef.
However, it seems that hopes of an agreement have faded as the EU'
s Standing Veterinary Committee has said the U.S. needs more time
to improve controls on red meat intended for export to the EU
market, the EU sources said.
</P>
<P>
The EU-U.S. summit is held every six months in the United
States or a EU member state. The last summit was held in June in
Germany, the previous EU presidency holder.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Economy Should Go Digital: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Extensive application of the
digital technology is the key to vitalizing Macao's economy and
brightening its economic prospects, economists here said at a
recent seminar as Macao is ready to revert to Chinese rule on
December 20.
</P>
<P>
At the special seminar held at the Macao Government Palace,
experts proposed in unison, largely to the soon-to-be-established
government of the Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR),
that a digital-technology-based economy be developed to make Macao
economically competitive in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the seminar maintained that Macao has various
advantages in developing an economy with an extensive application
of the digital technology: its cultural diversity, its openness to
the rest of the world, its free trade policies, the free flow of
capital into and out of its boundaries, and its geographical
location. These, they said, combine to make Macao a bridge between
the Chinese mainland and the outside world. Macao's comfortable
living environment is attractive to talent -- the most important
asset for developing a digital technology-based economy. In
addition, Macao has had the necessary infrastructure in terms of
technology and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Economic restructuring has been a challenge for Macao, whose
economy is heavily dependent on the tourism and gaming industry,
export-oriented processing, real estate and finance. Macao's
economy has slowed down since the early 1990s due to the Asian
financial crisis and internal economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Going digital, therefore, is particularly important for Macao's
economy. This is regarded as an important factor in enhancing the
competitive edge of the region's industrial sector and
diversifying its economy.
</P>
<P>
The government should encourage the use of digital technology
in public institutions, grant policy incentives to the research of
related technologies, and formulate regulations concerning
industries that are heavily dependent on digital technology,
including the telecom sector, a speaker from the Macao
Productivity and Technology Transfer Center said.
</P>
<P>
Official guidance for the information industry is necessary and
a special committee also needs to be established to spread the use
of digital technology, according to speakers.
</P>
<P>
"Our package of proposals for developing a digital economy in
Macao is a present of the Portuguese Macao government for the
incoming Macao SAR government," said Dr. Eric T.M. Yueung,
chairman of the Macao Productivity and Technology Transfer Center.
</P>
<P>
Extensive use of the digital technology will enable Macao to
cement its role as a bridge between the Chinese mainland and the
outside world and, at the same time, serve to brighten its own
economic prospects, he said.

PANAMA CITY, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States is

He said that under the Treaty of Neutrality he signed with
General Omar Torrijos in 1977, the United States will maintain an
alert against any danger the canal might be threatened after its
handover to Panamanian sovereignty on December 31.

<P>
MACAO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The ruins of St. Paul Cathedral,
a landmark in Macao, is to witness the territory's return to China
prior to the upcoming new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The 300-year-old relic, together with the Goddess A-Ma Temple,
lotus, bridges and waters, have been most frequently used to
represent Macao in books, newspapers, TV programs, posters,
commemorative coins and badges.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Portuguese Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira posed
for a last and historic picture in front of the ruins of St. Paul
together with over 600 civil servants.
</P>
<P>
For several hundred years, the cathedral has witnessed many
historic moments. The fortress nearby once repulsed the Dutch
colonialists who had coveted Macao.
</P>
<P>
At the foot of the nearby Mong Ha Hill lies the stone table
where the humiliating Treaty of Wang Hsia was signed. Within sight
is the hospital where Dr. Sun Yat-sen sought for the truth to save
the country and people.
</P>
<P>
Now the ruins of the cathedral will witness the beginning of a
new era. When the flag of Portugal is lowered at mid-night of
December 19, the cathedral will see another success of the "one
country, two systems" principle proposed by the late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
For years, the cathedral accompanied the Macao people at their
joyous moments and recorded the mixture of two different cultures.
It is attracting more and more tourists as well.
</P>
<P>
A lady from Beijing, who only gave her surname as Zhang, said
the cathedral is more magnificent than what she saw on TV. She
said she was amazed by the delicacy of the sculptures on the wall.
</P>
<P>
An officer with the tourism department said that she expects
more tourists after the return since Macao will have more and
closer ties with the inland areas of China.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Many Restaurants in Fujian Serving State-Protected Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Despite persistent efforts to
make people aware of wild life protection, many state-protected
animals are still being served in restaurants in southeast China's
Fujian Province, according to a survey released by the provincial
Association for Wildlife Protection.
</P>
<P>
Of the 223 restaurants surveyed, 120 were found to be serving
these animals, some of which are under state protection.
</P>
<P>
The survey randomly selected 2,195 people from six cities in
the province, soldiers, local officials, businessmen, workers,
farmers and students, to answer the question -- "Have you eaten a
wild animal?" Sixty percent responded, "yes," they had.
</P>
<P>
Of this group, 3.7 percent said they regularly eat wild animals
and don't see anything wrong with it. Some 58.2 percent said that
they were not sure which animals are protected.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six percent of those surveyed said they did not know
there was a national law protecting wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Among the most popular wildlife dishes are , ostrich, frog,
crocodile, spotted deer, and eel, all under state protection, and
cobra and other snakes under local protection.
</P>
<P>
Authorities here are calling for stricter punishment for the
killing of endangered wildlife, more comprehensive laws and
regulations, and more effective law enforcement measures to halt
this illicit market.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Testifies Against Tripp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky appeared Thursday in a court in Maryland state of
the United States and testified against his former confidant Linda
Tripp.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky testified that she felt violated to learn Tripp had
secretly recorded her intimate conversations about her affair with
President Bill Clinton and the telephone talks appeared in a
magazine.
</P>
<P>
"It terrified me," Lewinsky said at a pretrial hearing for
Tripp. "I was concerned about the privacy of my relationship being
revealed."
</P>
<P>
The tapes that revealed her relationship with Clinton had led
to the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's testimony will determine whether Tripp stands trial
on state wiretapping charges.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky said she was sure the taped conversation actually took
place on December 22, 1997. The date is crucial to the case
against Tripp as she is charged only with making the tape on that
date and allowing it to be played for Newsweek magazine although
she made more than 20 hours of tapes.
</P>
<P>
Tripp is charged with one count of making a tape recording of
conversation with Lewinsky on December 22 after she had been
informed that it was illegal to do so in Maryland and another
count of turning that tape to a Newsweek reporter.
</P>
<P>
If convicted on the two criminal charges, Tripp could face a
maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of 20,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's testimony was Lewinsky's opportunity to get back at
her former friend Tripp. As the investigation of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr on Cliton's sex scandal wrapped up in 1998,
Lewinsky said tearfully that "I hate Linda Tripp" at a federal
grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
Tripp, a Pentagon employee, did not appear at the hearing but
her son, Ryan Tripp, watched Lewinsky testify.

LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United are set to
offer 33-year-old striker Teddy Sheringham a new contract in an
attempt to pursuade him not to seek more regular football
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Sheringham is out of contract at the end of the season, when he

<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Middlesbrough manager Bryan
Robson has hit back at calls for his dismissal by insisting: "I
don't see any reason why I should get the sack."
</P>
<P>
Second Division Wrexham beat the Premiership side in the FA Cup
on Saturday and First Division Tranmere Rovers piled on the agony
on Tuesday night by eliminating Robson's charges in the
Worthington Cup.
</P>
<P>
Robson, determined to battle through the mid-season crisis,
said: "I don't see any reason why I should get the sack. Boro have
come on leaps and bounds since I joined them. If we were in the
bottom three or four the views of some fans and the press would be
justified."
</P>
<P>
He added: "A faction of the fans are not happy, and some of the
press are backing that faction, because it is an easy story.
</P>
<P>
"But I can tell those fans that I am not happy and neither are
the players. The players were gutted after the cup defeats. I don'
t want to make excuses but we got some diabolical refereeing
decisions at Tranmere.
</P>
<P>
"We were missing several key players but still dominated the
game. Under the circumstances, the players could not have given
more for the club or the fans.
</P>
<P>
"It is now my job to lift the players for the Premiership game
against Spurs on Saturday. Our aim is to finish in a top six
position and to qualify for Europe."
</P>

Robson has the unswerving support of chairman Steve Gibson, who
gave him his chance in management five years ago.

LAGOS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's former rebels
Thursday freed two European aid workers and handed them over to
the West Africa Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG) stationed in the
country after holding them hostage for a week.
</P>
<P>
General Gabriel Kpamber, commander of the Nigerian-dominated
ECOMOG, announced the release in Sierra Leone capital Freetown and
warned that his forces would retaliate if they "continue to
attack both vehicles and passengers on the highway", according to
reports reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two aid workers of the France-based international group
Doctors without Frontiers (MSF) was seized last Tuesday by
hard-line fighters of Foday Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) in the country's eastern Kailahun district.
</P>
<P>
Kpamber told a press conference that the two hostages, a German

<P>
Sankoh's intervention as well as the ECOMOG' s pressure are

<HEADLINE> Demand for Emergency Food Up in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Requests for emergency
food assistance in the United States increased by 18 percent over
the past year, the highest rate of increase since the recession of
the early 1990s, said the nation's largest domestic hunger-relief
organization Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Low-paying jobs, unemployment, high housing costs, poverty,
food stamp cuts and substance abuse are the leading causes of
hunger in the country, said America's Second Harvest, quoting a
new 26-city survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that 58 percent of the people requesting
emergency food were members of families -- children and their
parents, while 67 percent of the adults requesting food assistance
were employed.
</P>
<P>
On average, 21 percent of the requests for emergency food
assistance are estimated to have gone unmet during the last year,
according to the survey, which included such big cities as Los
Angeles, Phoenix, Portland, Detroit, Philadelphia, Boston and
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The number of elderly persons requesting food assistance
increased by 60 percent in the surveyed cities. Although food,
funds or volunteers available to emergency food assistance
facilities increased last year, 73 percent of the surveyed cities
reported decreased quantity of food provided or the number of time
families or individuals could come to get food.
</P>
<P>
America's Second Harvest has a national network of nearly 200
regional food banks, distributing one billion pounds of donated
food and grocery products annually. The network supports
approximately 50,000 local charitable agencies that provide food

<P>
BRUSSELS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment rate in the
Netherlands fell to a record low in November as an accelerating
national economy pushed companies to hire, the Dutch Central
Bureau for Statistics said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate declined to 3.0 percent for the three months
ended in November, the government bureau said, from 3.1 percent in
October, the lowest in the 18 years the monthly figures have been
published. The number of unemployed people fell 7,000, to 207,000.
</P>
<P>
Under the initial estimates, joblessness is seen falling
through next year because of the rapidly growing Dutch economy,
which expanded an annual 4.0 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Central Bank revised its forecast Wednesday for
growth in 2000 to 3.0 percent from 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands holds the second-lowest jobless rate among the
11 euro zone countries. Luxemborg has the lowest rate at 2.7
percent, according to the data from the European Union's
statistical office.

<P>
LAGOS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's former rebels
Thursday freed two European aid workers and handed them over to
the West Africa Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG) stationed in the
country after holding them hostage for a week.
</P>
<P>
General Gabriel Kpamber, commander of the Nigerian-dominated
ECOMOG, announced the release in Sierra Leone capital Freetown and
warned that his forces would retaliate if they "continue to
attack both vehicles and passengers on the highway", according to
reports reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two aid workers of the France-based international group
Doctors without Frontiers (MSF) was seized last Tuesday by
hard-line fighters of Foday Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) in the country's eastern Kailahun district.
</P>
<P>
Kpamber told a press conference that the two hostages, a German
and a Belgian, were now in a ECOMOG camp, ready to be escorted to
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh's intervention as well as the ECOMOG' s pressure are
believed to ensure the release.
</P>
<P>
The Lome peace accord signed on July 7 this year provides for
the disarmament of 45,000 former fighters and deployment of a
6000-strong UN peacekeeping force in the war-torn country.
</P>

The UN force is expected to gradually replace the ECOMOG,
which currently has 10,000 soldiers in the western African
country.

ABUJA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has set
up a rapid response police force for its troubled Niger Delta to
quell disturbances and protect oil companies there, Vice President
Atiku Abubakar revealed here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The vice president revealed this in meeting with a visiting
delegation led by American Mobil Chief Executive Paul Caldwell. He
did not give the size of the force but said it has been equipped
to quell disturbances in the oil-rich area.
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta area is the major oil base of the western
African country producing some 1.82 million barrels a day, but
the restive youths, who are protesting the marginalization of the
area, have caused a major trouble to the industry.
</P>
<P>
The protesting youths killed 12 policemen in a recent riot and
the government has deployed troops in the area since last month.

<P>
SANTIAGO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Trade deficit shrank because
of the drop in imports due to income stagnation, that discouraged
purchases in general and the devaluation of currencies.
</P>
<P>
Exports diminished in many countries. With the exception of
Mexico, the reduction of exports was three percent.
</P>
<P>
The result was a lower deficit in current account, which went
from 87 billion dollars (4.5 percent of the GDP) in 1998, to 56
billion dollars (3.2 percent) in 1999, explained the document.
</P>
<P>
The regional average inflation rate in 1999 will be about 10
percent, similar to that of the two previous years, whose levels
had been the lowest in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Price increase diminished or kept low in most of the regional
countries. Only in two of them there were significant increases:
Brazil where it rose from 2.5 percent in 1998, to almost nine
percent in 1999, and Ecuador, with a rise from 43 to 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
As an effect of the low economic growth, unemployment rose from
8 to 8.7 percent in the region, the highest in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 closes with positive signals for the near future.
The U.S. economy continues rising at a relatively high rate, while
Japan and the rest of Asia are recovering.
</P>
<P>
This permits to suppose that the situation will improve in
almost all the countries in the region in the year 2000. The ECLA
forecasts a regional growth rate of 3.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> IFC Makes First Investment in Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) approved Thursday its first project in Syria in
an irrigation technology company which designs and manufactures
systems that address the critical problem of water scarcity in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, will make an equity
investment of 1 million U.S. dollars in Arab Drip Irrigation
Technology Company Ltd., an affiliate of Adritec Group
International, a regional holding company with affiliates in
several Arab countries that specializes in the production and
supply of irrigation equipment and systems.
</P>
<P>
The project marks the beginning of the IFC's investment
operations in Syria, and is the first World Bank Group project
there in 13 years. The Syrian government agreed in 1997 to repay
its arrears to the World Bank, opening the way for the World Bank
Group activities to resume.
</P>
<P>
The investment in Adritec will finance new production
facilities at the company's site in Latakia, expanding and
upgrading water-conserving irrigation products and systems, and
extending the reach of the company into agricultural markets
across the region.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Khalil, director of the IFC's Central Asia, Middle East
and North Africa Department, said that Thursday's approval paves
the way for a broader IFC program to promote the role of the
private sector in Syria by demonstrating the benefits of a
conducive environment for private investments.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Vice Minister
Mariano Fernandez said Thursday that the return of Macao in
foreign powers hands to the People's Republic of China is the last
important political fact of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez called the fact in an exclusive interview for Xinhua
before traveling to China to attend the ceremony of the delivery
of Macao "a political result satisfactory for everybody."
</P>
<P>
The interesting point of Macao, he said, is that it also
becomes "a country, two systems." The experience in Hong Kong
continues to be very good and that is a very good signal for
international trade.
</P>
<P>
Chile has very good relations with China. "I am very satisfied
with taking part in the ceremony and we expect to take advantage
of this opportunity to contact the Chinese authorities. I will
relay to President Jiang Zemin the greetings of President Eduardo
Frei," said Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said that his country acknowledges the idea of a
single China that has the seat of its government in Beijing. "We
have very good economic relations with Taiwan, but in political
issues, Chile has a very clear opinion: one China with one
government and one capital."
</P>
<P>
The foreign vice minister also said that there are plans for
the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic relations between China and Chile.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua -- U.S. Democrat Bill Bradley
and Republican John McCain joined hands Thursday to pursue "
campaign finance reform" to boost their second-place bids in
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
In a rare bipartisan appearance at Claremont, New Hampshire
State, Bradley said, "We believe that money is eating away at the
core of our democracy, like acid eating away at cloth."
</P>
<P>
"I believe there have been times when I believe I have been
influenced because the big donor buys access to my office and we
all know that access buys influence," McCain said. "That taints
all of us. It taints me."
</P>
<P>
"We pledge that as the nominees for the office of president of
the United States we will not allow our political parties to spend
soft money for our presidential campaigns, and we commit to
working together toward genuine campaign finance reform,'' McCain
and Bradley said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
"Soft money" refers to unlimited, unregulated donations that
are supposed to be used for party-building activities, but the
money has increasingly been used to indirectly aid presidential
and congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
McCain, an Arizona senator, and Bradley, a former New Jersey
Senator, are mounting increasingly strong challenges to their
parties' presidential front-runners, Vice President Al Gore for
the Democrats and Texas Governor George W. Bush for the
Republicans.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Assembly Thursday demanded that all parties in Bosnia and
Herzegovina facilitate the full implementation of all aspects of
the New York Declaration, adopted on November 15, 1999, in
particular the principles on the establishment of a State Border
Service in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
In that declaration, the Joint Presidency of Bosnia and
Herzegovina agreed to important steps for improving forward the
process to fully implement the Peace Agreement, including improved
military cooperation, steps to improve the functioning of common
State institutions, the creation of a Permanent Secretariat for
the Joint Presidency under one roof, the establishment of a joint
commission on refugee returns and the creation of a single
national passport.
</P>
<P>
Acting without a vote, the Assembly adopted a text on Bosnia and
Herzegovina in which it stressed the need for a more comprehensive
approach to economic reform, which should contribute to a more
homogeneous development of the economy and trade in the two
entities and across the inter-entity boundary line.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed the importance of establishing an economic
program which should include the creation of a framework for
private-sector development, including privatization and
improvement of foreign investment conditions, the restructuring of
banking and capital markets, the reform of the financial system
and adequate social protection.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 19.57 at 11,244.89,

Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'

<HEADLINE> Beckham Wins Driving Ban Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United and England
midfield football player David Beckham won his appeal against an
eight-month driving ban on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the sentence after he was convicted of driving
his 150,000 pounds Ferrari at 76mph in a 50mph zone.
</P>
<P>
Beckham said he was trying to escape a paparazzi photographer
who had tailed him for 10 miles from his home in Alderley Edge,
Cheshire.
</P>
<P>
Judge Barry Woodward, at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown
Court, returned the 24-year-old star's driving licence, ruling
there were "special circumstances" that had caused him to break
the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
But he upheld the footballer's speeding conviction.
</P>
<P>
Beckham, who already had 10 points on his licence, had been
fined 800 apounds and ordered to pay 190 pounds costs in addition
to the driving ban.
</P>
<P>
Beckham's solicitor, Nicholas Freeman, told the court his
client admitted speeding but had done so because he was frightened
he would be hurt in a serious accident.
</P>
<P>
The footballer told the court a white car, which he thought was
a Ford Fiesta, had followed him for 10 miles from his home and
along the A34.
</P>
<P>
He said he became frightened when the photographer veered into
his lane and forced him to swerve on two occasions.
</P>
<P>
The millionaire midfielder said: "I thought if I didn't put my
foot down it would cause an accident.
</P>
<P>
"At the time I didn't know what I was doing - I was just trying
to get away from his car."
</P>
<P>
But the judge ruled he had other options to speeding - such as
slowing down or changing lane.
</P>
<P>
Beckham also told the court of two other occasions when he
feared for his safety and that of his family.
</P>
<P>
He referred to an incident outside Harrods in central London on
Wednesday when a fan tried to grab his baby son Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
He also described how police had given him and his wife
Victoria a police escort last June when they were pursued by
paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
Revoking the driving ban, Judge Woodward said: "We must
consider this case for its own particular merits rather than on
the person of Mr Beckham himself."
</P>
<P>
Following the verdict, Mr Freeman said Beckham was "delighted
with the result".
