<HEADLINE> Enlarging Caspian Eats Away Kazakh Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The expanding Caspian Sea has
flooded a large stretch of farmland in Kazakhstan and poses
serious threats to the country's ports, power and oil industries.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, two million hectares of farmland in
Kazakhstan had been submerged by the Caspian Sea whose water level
has been rising at the rate of 13 centimeters a year since 1978,
local press reports say.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the level of the Sea had lowering since the 1930s,
and it reached its lowest in 500 years in 1977. But then it began
rising.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978 the level has risen by 2.5 meters and the sea has
bitten into the coast by 20 to 40 kilometers, and by as much as
more than 70 kilometers in some areas. The regions of Atyauskaya
and Mangistauskaya are the worst hit by the enlarging Sea.
</P>
<P>
In Atyauskaya, seven residential areas and 600,000 hectares of
farmland have been inundated along with 127 oil-wells and 510
kilometers of transportation lines.
</P>
<P>
In Mangistauskaya, two of Kazakhstan's largest ports are
menaced by the advancing Sea.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict the Caspian Sea will continue to grow in the
future and its present level will increase by one meter before the
year 2005.
</P>
<P>
To minimize the damage, the Kazakh government has spent a lot
of money building dikes, resettling residents displaced by the
Caspian and repairing water-damaged infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea also threatens its four other littoral
countries -- Azerbaijan, Iran, Russia and Turkmenistan.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Post Ranks Among Top 10 in World: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's post ranked among
the top 10 for the most efficient and responsible postal services
in the world, a Pakistani official said today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen in Lahore, the capital of Punjab province of
Pakistan, Director General of Pakistan Post Offices (PPO) Amir
Nawaz Khan said the PPO's position in the world has been
acknowledged by the Universal Postal Union (UPU).
</P>
<P>
On the basis of high quality performance, PPO has recently been
elected as the chairman of the "Strategic Planning Working Party,"
the most important elected committee of the UPU, Khan added.
</P>
<P>
But he gave no more details.
</P>
<P>
He said the PPO has acquired greater responsibility and
significance in the eyes of the World Bank due to the deregulation
policy adopted by the Pakistani government in running the affairs
of the post in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest international trends in postal
management, corporatism was definitely a step forward to the
provision of better postal services, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The UPU and the World Bank have been advocating a corporate
management structure for the post, he added.
</P>
<P>
Khan also stressed the need for carrying out thorough a study
for the formulation of a national postal policy.
</P>
<P>
The policy should provide clear indicators as to whether the
postal services in the country are to be operated as a social
obligation of the government or as a commercial proposition, or a
blend of the two positions.

<HEADLINE> Greek Student Charged for Murdering Family Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A 24-year-old Greek student
arrested by police Thursday was today formally charged with the
murder of his mother, father, sister, grandmother and uncle on the
Aegean island of Thassos in May.
</P>
<P>
Theophilos Sehidis, who studied law in university, was also
charged with illegal possession and use of firearms by a local
public prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
Sehidis has reportedly told police he used a chain saw to
dismember the bodies before throwing the parts of four of them
onto a rubbish dump.
</P>
<P>
The decapitated body of his 57-year-old uncle was found buried
near the archaeological site about 700 meters from the house where
the law student has confessed to committing the murders.
</P>
<P>
Sehidis, the worst self-confessed mass murderer in Greek
criminal history, will appear before a local investigating
magistrate Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After the re-enactment of the murders Friday, Sehidis appeared
cynical and showed no signs of remorse, claiming at one point that
he had killed his family in order to "cure" them because they were
all sick.

<HEADLINE> Pro-British Marchers Abandon Walls Walk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Londonderry's
Catholic Bogsiade area have called off a protest rally planned
today as pro-British protestant marchers postponed a walk along
the city's walls, according to reports from Londonderry this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The move followed an announcement that the Apprentice Boys had
abandoned the walk today. But a march through the city by around
l0,000 Apprentice Boys and l80 bands was going ahead as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of police lined the route as the main parade got under
way in the city center with thousands of members of the Protestant
Apprentice Boys association wearing traditional crimson-colored
collars and bowler hats marching to the sounds of flutes and
drums.
</P>
<P>
The annual parade celebrates the victory over Roman Catholics
who besieged the city for months after 13 apprentice boys shut the
city gates on the advancing army of King James ll. Londonderry was
freed in August l689.
</P>
<P>
Police had blocked off a large section of the city walls
earlier in the week, fearing violence after Catholics living
nearby threatened rival demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The Apprentice Boys had been expected to protest at the
rerouting of the march. But their leaders said they would not walk
the city walls today, although they left open the possibility of
another march at any time of a later date.
</P>
<P>
Martin Maguinness, the Sinn Fein leader in Londonderry,
welcomed the Apprentice Boys' decision not to walk the walls of
Londonderry. But he added, "The threat still remains they will do
it at some stage."
</P>
<P>
There is widespread dismay among both Catholic and Protestant
communities that Londonderry, which has been a model for the
regeneration of other towns in Northern Ireland, is now the focal
point for sectarianism.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- French police investigating the
murder of 13-year-old British girl Caroline Dickinson last month
plan to go to Britain to question some of the English companions
of Dickinson during her stay in France.
</P>
<P>
Dickinson was found strangled and raped in a country inn on
July 18 in Pleine-Fougeres, Ille-et-Vilaine in northwest France.
Police arrested Patrice Pade, a 39-year-old homeless man, two days
later as the number-one suspect of the murder.
</P>
<P>
But two genetic analyses showed that Pade, who confessed the
act of murder, was not the one who raped Caroline. Pade was
released Wednesday but is still under judicial control.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports quoted French police as saying that they
must act with extreme prudence in the case, and will not let go
one trail by questioning several youths from Lanceston, England,
who accompanied Dickinson to France.
</P>
<P>
French police will obtain the DNA samples from the youths to
compare them with the fingerprints on the body of Dickinson, said
judicial sources.

<HEADLINE> New Way of Commemorating Heroes' Day Advocated in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean university students
today appealed for the government to explore new ways of
commemorating heroes day to encourage people and the youth in
particular, to attach more meaning to the event.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on the eve of the Heroes Day, Publicity
Secretary of the Students Representative Council of the National
University of Science and Technology (NUST), Eric Zinyengere,
said many Zimbabweans preferred to go away at the Heroes' Day and
attend weddings and parties because the way the day was
remembered had becomed monotonous especially among the youth.
</P>
<P>
August 11 is a national holiday when Zimbabweans gather
together and honour thousands of freedom fighters who died in the
liberation war which brought independence of the country in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Zinyengere urged the government to research on the true heroes
of the liberation war and produce educational textbooks that
would give meaning and educate the youth on the ''creators'' of
Zimbabwse.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Official: Iran in Process of Normalizing Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian official said today
that Tehran is in the process of normalizing its relations with
its former enemy of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific
Affairs, told the Persian evening paper Kayhan that "there have
been agreements on the opening of the Iraqi city of Karbella to
the Iranian people."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that Iran can not completely normalize its ties
with Iraq as long as the fate of the remaining Iranian Prisoners
of Wars (POWs) is shrugged in ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
"If the question of the remaining POWs are not resolved
satisfactory, Iraq's expectation of a complete normalization of
relations with Iran would be in vain," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq have been steadily releasing each other's POWs
captured in the 1980-1988 war. But both countries reportedly are
still holding hundreds of them in their territories.
</P>
<P>
As to the opening of Iraqi city Karbella, Iran would not accept
certain conditions put forward by Iraq, he said without specifying.
</P>
<P>
The city of Karbella is the third most important religious holy
place to the Iranian Shia people following the Saudi Arabian
cities of Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian efforts to normalize the relations with Iraq are
seen here as a move to confront the dual containment policy of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Facing economic sanctions and threats of military attacks by
the United States, Iran Thursday expressed its wishes to improve
its relations with neighboring countries such as Iraq, Turkey and
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, accusing Iran of supporting
international terrorism, signed a bill into law Monday to punish
non-American companies investing more than 40 million U.S. dollars
in Iran and Libya's oil industries.

HARARE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Confederation of Agricultural Unions (SACAU) today expressed its
support for South Africa's agricultural sector in resisting the
proposed South Africa-European Union (EU) free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a one-day SACAU meeting on trade

Development Community (SADC) member states to investigate the
mandate publicized by the commission of the EU so they become
aware of its implications.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the agreement will result in unfair cometition.
</P>
<P>
The SACAU believes that the current European Union mandate, if
effectively implemented, will have a significant, if not
devastating, effect upon the beef production sector in southern
Africa, Hasluch said.
</P>
<P>
He said any agreement which allows subsidized agricultural
production in developed countries to supplant commercial
agricultural production in southern Africa should be construed as
being contrary to the interests of agricultural development in
the region.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Firm to Help Troubled Greek Shipyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Hellenic Shipyard in Skaramanga
near Athens has finalized negotiations with foreign management
consultancy firm Brown and Root in a deal giving the latter
management duties at the troubled shipyard.
</P>
<P>
Following the agreement, the state-run Hellenic Industrial
Development Bank, which holds a majority 51 percent stake in
Hellenic Shipyard, characterized the deal as a vital move
connected with the shpyard's future operation.
</P>
<P>
In allocating management duties to an experienced management
team culled by Brown and Root, and combined with an anticipated
five-year investment program budgeted at 12 billion drachmas (52
million U.S. dollars), efforts will be made to put Hellenic
Shipyard back on the positive track, the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The management deal will have a five-year duration and is
scheduled to commerce on September 1.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Brown and Root will be paid 2.09
million dollars annually for its services and will also receive a
25 percent share of the shipyard's net profits each year. In
addition, Brown and Root will receive additional payments should
profits at Hellenic Shipyard exceed target figures.
</P>
<P>
Hellenic Shipyard, the largest in the eastern Mediterannean,
had been placed under liquidation-in-operation for more than one
year. The Greek government had been subject to severe pressure by
European Union competition commissioner Karel van Miert to
privatize Hellenic Shipyard or else close the yard down.
</P>
<P>
The decision to appoint a foreign management team at the
shipyard has been viewed as a move made to further consolidate the
EU's approval of Hellenic Shipyard's privatization program.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda Urges Zambians To Work To Maintain Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's former
state president and leader of the opposition United National
Independence Party, has urged all Zambians to work to maintain
peace at all times as the country is running towards the general
elections later this year.
</P>
<P>
It would take Zambians themselves, if not careful, to destroy
their own country, Kaunda said in Choma, Southern Province on
Friday, according to a report of Zambia News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Political strife has gotten intensified since late May when a
controversial constitution amendment bill was adopted in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution stipulates that only second indigenous
generation Zambians are qualified to be president of the country.
This actually bars Kaunda from running the presidency in the
coming general elections as his parents immigrated from
neighboring Malawi before the independence of the country.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy maintains that
the constitution amendment is a law since it is passed in
parliament and signed by the president and every one should abide
by it.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties, however, argue that the constitution
amendment is not just and should be repealed while this year's
elections should be conducted according to the original relevant
regulations.

<HEADLINE> France to Reduce Tax on Small, Medium-Sized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The French government will reduce
tax for reinvestment profits on small and medium-sized enterprises
(PME) by 33.33-19 percent from January 1, 1997, said French
Minister of Commerce, Craft Industry and PME Jean-Pierre Raffarin
today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Journal du Dimanche in its August 11
edition, Raffarin said that the government will also bring about a
charter between banks and the PME to remove some of the principal
guarantees required by banks for the creation of such enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"One of the difficulties of PME is notably the absence of
proper funds, particularly for the youngest ones among them," said
Raffarin. "We are going to, from January 1, 1997, reduce the tax
rate on these companies by from 33.33 percent to 19 percent for
reinvestments profits in shareholders' fund."
</P>
<P>
He said that President Jacques Chirac is right to say that
there lacks an understanding between banks and enterprises in
France, "with the former saying that they don't have good projects
and the latter saying that they don't have financings."
</P>
<P>
He said the government is studying a project of a charter
between banks and PME enterprises "to bring about a better trust
and bigger loyalty between them."

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 10 (Xinhua) -- As many as 480 expatriates
were deported from Kuwait during the first seven months of this
year after medical tests revealed that they were suffering
infectious diseases, according to a latest official report.
</P>
<P>
A report from Kuwaiti Medical Test Center for Foreign Workers
said medical tests were conducted on 89,123 expatriates brought in
by the private sector during the first seven months of the current
year and 480 persons were found suffering from AIDS, tuberculosis
and filaria which resulted in their repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The report did not give a breakdown of the persons suffering
from different contagious diseases, neither did it give details
about their nationalities.
</P>
<P>
There are more than one million foreign nationals coming from
about 130 countries now living in Kuwait, amounting to about 60
percent of the whole population of 1.9 million in the small Gulf
emirate which depends mainly on foreign labourers in its economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti authorities implement very strict regulations on health
test for the foreign nationals who apply for long term stay in the
country and whoever failed to pass tests on contagious diseases
would be deported from the country immediately.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Kuwaiti Health Ministry said Kuwait would show
no leniency to foreign carriers of infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 40 cases of AIDS carriers have been reported
in the country.
</P>
<P>
A health official said Kuwait has established a lab for
testing the specimen blood samples of expatriate work force to
ensure that they are free of AIDS and malaria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the first line of defense in protecting the
country against contagious diseases, branches of the Medical
Test Center were set up in each of the five governorates
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Group Denounces Embargo on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Paris-based humanitarian
group, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), today denounced the
economic embargo imposed by some African countries on Burundi. It
said the embargo blocked primary necessities from entering the
country.
</P>
<P>
``This embargo, which also includes medical products, is
helping worsen a health situation already strongly degraded by a
two-and-a half-years war,'' said the MSF.
</P>
<P>
The 54 MSF doctors now working in Burundi fear they cannot
continue to work there long since their drug-stocks, medical
supplies and equipment can no longer be obtained from neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The MSF called on Burundi's neighbors to let products of
primary necessities enter Burundi and stop holding the stocks of
humanitarian groups bound for the country.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Cameroon
decided on July 31, in the Tanzanian town of Arusha bordering
Burundi, to impose the embargo on Burundi in protest over the
military putsch in that country.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Radio Burundi reported today that Hutu
rebels killed at least 22 people in an attack Friday night near
Cibitoke, in northwest Burundi near the Zaire border.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports quoted Radio Burundi as saying that the
rebels attacked a school and a center for Tutsi refugees, killing
12 people belonging to one family. The number of victims was
expected to rise, said the reports.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Economy Grows 8 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese economy grew 8
percent in 1995, compared with 7 percent in the previous year,
according to statistics published by the Arab Organization for
Investment Guarantee.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural output rose from 9 percent in 1994 to 10
percent in 1995 and the industrial output went up from 18 percent
to 20 percent, while the building and real estate sector expanded
by 53.8 percent in 1995, against 29 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that Lebanon attracted investments
valuing 6.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1995, while its debts rose to
7.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The exports in Lebanon increased by 24 percent in 1995 against
14 percent in 1994, while imports jumped to 20 percent in 1995,
against 10 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's public revenues rose remarkably in 1995 thanks to
the levying of extra customs duties on gasoline, luxuries and
alcoholic drinks, which brought the customs revenues to 830
million dollars in 1995, against 470 million dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese lira exchange rate improved in 1995 because of
the political stability and the inflow of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that the economic growth in 1995 was
accompanied with some negative indicators, including a rise in the
government debt, inflation and trade deficit.

<HEADLINE> S.African Police Announce Foreign Tourists' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The alleged hijacking of
three foreign visitors on Thursday night and their subsequent
abduction did not occur, police source said today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, police spokesman Jan Combrinck
said the case of the missing foreign tourists, formerly believed
to be diplomats, had been solved, in fact they never existed.
</P>
<P>
After an intensive around-the-clock investigation at huge
cost, police finally established that the vehicle, which
supposedly carried the three white men, was in fact hijacked but
the original account of the event was a figment of the driver's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the vehicle, Peter Manyekane, 42, claimed on
Thursday night that he was forced out of the minibus on a highway
near Johannesburg when five gunmen hijacked his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
When questioned by the police, the driver said there were
three foreign tourists in the minibus at the time of the
hijacking.
</P>
<P>
Combrinck said the police had worked around the clock to solve
the case and arrested two men in connection with the hijacking in
early hours of Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, Manyekane changed his story and admitted there
were no foreign tourists as he originally claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, three men had so far been arrested
for the hijacking, which did occur. There were passengers in the
minibus, but they were not the foreigners as claimed by the
driver. None were abducted.
</P>
<P>
Charges of defeating the ends of justice were being
investigated against the driver of the vehicle, said the police.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the PLO's
mainstream Fatah movement opened a meeting here tonight to review
the Middle East peace process and discuss domestic issues of the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, presided over by Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat, is held in Cairo to enable some committee members
who live outside the Palestinian self-rule areas to attend.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah meeting is the first attended by all 18 committee
members since the PLO signed the Oslo peace accord with Israel in
1993.
</P>
<P>
The members would focus their discussion on the recent Israeli
measures which constitute obstacles to the resumption of the
final-stage talks between the Palestinians and the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel has decided to build more Jewish settlements in
Palestinian territories and close Palestinian offices in
Jerusalem, the moves over which Arafat and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak expressed great concern during their talks here
earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The committee meeting would also deal with Israel's failure to
redeploy its troops in Hebron, the last West Bank town still under
the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> French Scientist Positive on US Discovery Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- French Medical Professor Luc
Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris has positively
recognized the latest discovery by a group of American-European
scientists on a human resistance genetic system against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Montagnier said the outcome of these researches is "highly
interesting" and "offers new and very important arguments which
will lead to new advances" in researches on AIDS, according to
the local daily Le Monde today.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. scientific periodicals, Cell and Nature, in their
newest editions published the results of two researches which
claim that some people possess an inherited genetic system highly
resistant to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Cell published a report in its August 9 edition signed by a
group of scientists from California and New York, led by Nathaniel
R. Landau of the Aaron Diamonds AIDS Research Center of Rockfeller
University in New York City, have found the reasons why some
people frequently exposed to HIV virus -- which could lead to AIDS
-- are not infected.
</P>
<P>
The cells within the immunity system which are the prior
targets of HIV virus, the lymphocytes CD4, are highly resistant to
AIDS virus in these people, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Doctor William A. Paxton, one of the signatories of the report,
found a group of some 15 people who, in spite of being repeatedly
exposed to HIV virus, remain HIV negative and healthy.
</P>
<P>
After studying the blood of two homosexual men among the group,
who volunteered to give their blood, scientists found that they
are protected by a specific alteration of genetic heritage which
does not produce a special substance essential for the penetration
of HIV virus -- CCR-5, or CKR-5.
</P>
<P>
The periodical Nature published in its August 22 edition --
pre-published no doubt due to commercial reasons -- a report
signed by a group of Belgian, American and French scientists led
by Marc Parmentier of the Universite Libre of Brussels, which
confirmed the findings of the Cell report.
</P>
<P>
This group of scientists also pointed out that the genetic
disorder which protects human being against HIV virus is more
frequently found among the white Caucasian race than Africans and
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Professor Montagnier said that the genetic alteration found by
the two groups of scientists cannot be "the unique form possible
of resistance against AIDS, which in its turn can no doubt foil
the resistances in numerous ways."
</P>
<P>
He suggested that one can from now on track down on the people
who have this kind of genetic system and produce vaccines from the
genetic substances obtained from these people.
</P>
<P>
He said that this will "open passionate perspectives" for
carrying out vaccination programs and offering therapeutics to
infected people.

<HEADLINE> Major, Blair Urged to Make Quick Decision on EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
and opposition Labor Party leader Tony Blair have been urged to
decide now on whether they will take Britain into the European
Monetary Union (EMU), according to a report from the influential
Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee.
</P>
<P>
The report on the Intergovernmental Conference, due to be
published later next week, issued a stark warning on Major and
Blair that Germany and France are expected to join the single
European currency in 1999 despite Britain's strong reservations on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
A Committee source is quoted as saying: "The Germans and the
French are determined to push ahead with the EMU' 1999 time-table.
We draw attention to the fact that legislation would have to be
put before Parliament in early 1997 if Britain wants to join the
first wave of the EMU."
</P>
<P>
The report, which was agreed unanimously by 11 Tory and Labor
members, aims to pressure the party leaders into taking a quick
decision on EMU before the general election, which is very much
likely to be held next May.
</P>
<P>
Euro-sceptics in both Conservative and Labor parties have
repeatedly made it clear that the first party to rule out joining
a single currency in 1999 would gain favor with the electorate.
</P>
<P>
The Committee stressed in the report that Britain can not rely
on its European Union (EU) partners and must stand up for the
national interest.
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion is that we are on our own and optimistic
expectations that we can find alliances with the French and
Germans are erroneous, " the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report concludes that Britain has fundamental differences
with the other EU members over the future of the community and
"the whole thrust is different."
</P>
<P>
"There is a continental will to establish a federal European
super-state which we do not share in Britain," it added.

ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari said here today that Pakistan wants a peaceful, political
solution to the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting U.S. Senator Hank Brown, Leghari
said Pakistan wants to resolve the Kashmir issue in accordance
with the relevant United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He also said Pakistan wants peace and development and is
against an arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
Leghari praised the efforts of Brown to create a better
environment for improving the Pakistani-US relationship.
</P>
<P>
Brown said the United States supports a political solution to
the Kashmir problem and believes that the return of peace in
Afghanistan will greatly benefit all the people living in the
entire region.
</P>
<P>
Brown arrived here on Thursday for a three-day visit to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He had visited India and the Indian-held Kashmir before coming
to Pakistan, and is scheduled to go to the Pakistan-held Kashmir
and also to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Brown held talks with Pakistani Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, Defense Minister Aftab Shaban Mirani and
other government officials.
</P>
<P>
Brown initiated the Brown Amendment, which allows Pakistan to
get back its paid military equipment held up in the US due to the
US government's suspicion about the country's nuclear program.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
today in Beijing urged religious groups to improve the quality and
performance of their organizations.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of the
United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China, told the country's religious leaders
that the religious bodies can be more patriotic and unified only
if they improve the building of religion and train a younger
generation of professional workers in religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that the central government has said that the
religious policies must be carried out correctly and
comprehensively, and religious affairs be administered in
accordance with the law and be actively guided to fit into the
socialist society.
</P>
<P>
The religious situation is stable overall, Wang Zhaoguo pointed
out, adding that problems have arisen in recent years due to
changes in both domestic and international situations.
</P>
<P>
Hostile international forces resort to ethnic and religious
issues to "westernize" and "split" socialist countries and step up
religious infiltration, he said.
</P>
<P>
In some places in China, the rampant construction of temples
and churches has exerted heavy economic burdens on local religious
believers, he added, and in some places, religions are used to
intervene in the administration, legislature, education and
marriages.
</P>
<P>
The gathering of the religous leaders to discuss how to
strengthen the building of religions is imperative to resolving
these problems and promoting the coordination between religions
and the socialist society, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Successful efforts to improve
its environment have transformed a former one-factory town in
south China's Guangdong Province into a tourist attraction that
catered to 50,000 visitors and brought in nearly 10 million yuan
from tourism last year.
</P>
<P>
He Lianming, a local official, said Hengmen once was one of the
poorest towns in the province: in 1989, it had only one small
factory. But businesses were flourishing in surrounding areas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
When given opportunities to engage in business that polluted
the environment, local leaders refused, He Lianming said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot make money at the cost of people's lives and
health," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In addition to construction of basic facilities, Hengmen
residents have worked to protect the environment by planting
trees, reclaiming wasteland, and refusing projects which might
pollute the environment.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have paid off. In 1995, Hengmen reported 236
million yuan in industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ministry of Power Industry has invested 150
million yuan to set up a transformer plant in the town, and
several other enterprises, including some from Canada and Hong
Kong, have invested in Hengmen because of its clean environment.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Bikers' Anti-Turkish Protest Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The anti-Turkish demonstration
by motorcyclists along the buffer zone in Cyprus, scheduled for
today, has been canceled for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced here today by President of the
Cyprus Motorcyclists Federation George Hadjicostas at Makarios
Stadium in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after the federation met with Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides, Minister of Foreign Affairs Alecos
Michaelides and Minister of Justice and Public Order Alecos Evangelou
at one session.
</P>
<P>
Hadjicostas called on all his federation members to gather in
Nicosia instead of going to Dherynia village, on the eastern end
of the dividing line, from where the bikers were originally
scheduled to start their demonstration.
</P>
<P>
He told hundreds of motorcyclists that "security and
political reasons" made it necessary to cancel the rally.
</P>
<P>
"We were told that the rally would have harmed the government
efforts to solve the Cyprus question and we are here to
offer support to the state, not antagonize it," Hadjicostas
said.
</P>
<P>
"I would have been happier if the ride were to finish
in Kyrenia but I also believe we have brought the Cyprus
problem into the limelight in a positive manner," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has expressed welcome to the cancellation
of the motorcyclists' ride.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP) Waldemar Rokoszewski said "we are happy with every
step which defuses the situation."
</P>
<P>
The bikers' ride began on August 2 from the once-divided
city of Berlin and has proceeded through various European
capitals, before the motorcyclists reached Cyprus Saturday for
the final stage of the ride.
</P>
<P>
Today, about 7,000 motorcyclists are scheduled to ride along
the buffer zone from Dherynia to Nicosia, where they will
attempt to cross the Turkish-controlled areas and complete
their ride to the northern coastal town of Kyrenia.
</P>
<P>
Both the Cyprus government and the U.N. have warned against
possible trouble in the buffer zone during the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Local police are using all available means to avert any
incidents and to ensure the status of the U.N.-controlled buffer
zone is not violated.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Saturday night, U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali expressed his concern at reports that the
Greek Cypriot Motorcycle Federation was planning to break the
cease-fire lines as well as the U.N. buffer zone in Cyprus
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali hoped that the organizers of this event would
avoid a course of action that could only harm efforts to
resolve the long standing Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary-general called on the government of Cyprus to
take effective measures, in exercise of its responsibilities, to
prevent any unauthorized entry into the U.N. buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops took
control 37 percent of the island following an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-strong U.N. peace-keeping force has been patrolling
along the 180-kilometer-long buffer zone separating the Turkish
troops from the Greek Cypriot National Guards.

<HEADLINE> Cultural Relics Protection Enhanced in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Work to inventory and protect
cultural relics in the Three Gorges area is increasing as time
draws nearer to the damming of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the Culture Department of Hubei Province and the
State Bureau of Cultural Relics have invested funds and manpower
to account for and preserve cultural relics in the
soon-to-be-inundated four counties of the dam area.
</P>
<P>
The preservation work is divided into two parts: underground
archaeological digging and the protection of surface relics.
</P>
<P>
So far, digging has been completed to recover pieces from the
Shang Dynasty (1600 -- 1100 B.C.), those from the Longshan Culture
(a late neolithic culture and named after Longshan, Shandong
province), and from a tomb built during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty
(770 -- 256 B.C.), according to an official source.
</P>
<P>
The surface work includes photographing and videotaping items,
as well as collecting rubbings from stone tablets in the gorges
area.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 groups of stone tablets have been inventoried, and
some have been removed.

<HEADLINE> Violent Crimes Reach Record High In Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Violent crimes like street
robberies, assaults and sex attacks in Britain have hit record
levels, said a Sunday Times survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on reported crime figures covering nearly 70
percent of the population in England and Wales, showed that a
three-year falling trend of overall crime rates has ground to a
halt and violent crimes are up by more than 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Robberies were up by an average of 9 percent, assaults by 8
percent and sex offenses by 2 percent in the past 12 months to the
end of June, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
It added that violent crime is rising in almost every area.
</P>
<P>
As for violent offenses, the survey said that the total number,
which fell in the previous year, rose by an average of 8 percent,
the highest increase for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Car crime also appears to be rising again, but burglaries are
continuing to fall, down by an average of 13 percent, the survey
added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Water Sharing Issue Testing Dhaka-Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Although Bangladesh and India have
made headway in their talks on Ganges water sharing, a final
solution is still not in the offing and is putting improved
Dhaka-Delhi relations to the test.
</P>
<P>
After a 3-day foreign secretary level meeting on the issue in
Delhi recently, both sides expressed their willingness for a
permanent sharing arrangement of the Ganges water.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the water sharing agreement will be signed between the
two countries before the onset of the next dry season,"
Bangladeshi Foreign Secretary Farooq Sobhan said. Indian External
Affairs Minister I.K. Gujral will visit Dhaka early next month for
higher level talks.
</P>
<P>
The Ganges, originating from the Gangotri Glacier in the
Himalayan Ranges, flows through Nepal, India and Bangladesh. Being
in the lower Riparian, Bangladesh has been deprived of its
legitimate share of the river water due to the construction of the
Farakka Barrage in the upper stream by India in the mid-1970s,
which the Bangladeshi side blamed for disrupting the historical
and normal flow of the international river.
</P>
<P>
The water discharge at Bangladesh's Hardinge Bridge has come
down gradually to only 9,000 cubic feet per second (cusec) in
April 1995 from the original 62,128 to 74,836 cusec before the
commissioning of the Farakka Barrage, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
During the lean period beginning March, rivers, ponds, wells
and other water resources are drying in the affected areas while
the ground water level is gradually going down.
</P>
<P>
Clouded some other outstanding issues between the two close
neighbors, their bilateral relations have been bumpy. There is no
water sharing agreement between them since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Following the formation of new governments in both countries
earlier this year, the Bangladeshis are hopeful of a permanent
sharing arrangement of Ganges water with India soon as the ruling
Awami League (AL) has been described as the "pro-India" force in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The AL has maintained traditionally good relations with India.
Supported by India, Bangladeshis led by the AL won their
independence from the then Pakistan in 1971 and the AL became the
first ruling party of the independent Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the late father of
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, signed a 25-year friendship treaty
with India at the time.
</P>
<P>
But the Indo-Bangladesh relations were affected in 1975 when
the AL fell out of power and Rahman was killed in a military coup.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the assumption of power by winning the June
12 parliamentary elections, the AL government has pledged to
resolve the outstanding issue of water sharing and has started
discussion with India both in open talks and by behind-the-scenes
contacts.
</P>
<P>
After receiving a letter from his Bangladeshi counterpart
Hasina last Wednesday, Indian Prime Minister Deve Gowda has
promised to settle outstanding issues with Bangladesh in the
shortest possible time. If required, he added, there could be a
meeting between the heads of government of the two countries to
settle the water sharing problem permanently.
</P>
<P>
The promise has brought a ray of hope for solving the problem,
observers here said.
</P>
<P>
During its 5-year rule, the previous administration led by
Begum Khaleda Zia had talks at different levels with the India
government on the issue. The Indian side did make some promises
from time to time, but a settlement remains elusive as ever.
</P>
<P>
India, on the other side, insists that it would not be proper
to blame India for the problem.
</P>
<P>
Since a solution depends to much extent on the Indian side over
the upper stream of the Ganges, it may be difficult to solve the
problem in a short period, some Bangladeshis said. India has
never abided by its former water sharing deals with Bangladesh,
they noted.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Firms Boost Motorcycle Making, Marketing in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-invested motorcycle plants
are mushrooming around Vietnam, increasing the marketing of the
vehicles by one-fifth annually on the average in the last five
years in the country.
</P>
<P>
The number of motorbikes will reach 10 million by 2005 from
currently four million in Vietnam, local press predicted today.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 70 motorbike making and assembling plants
in the country, with a designed capacity of more than 500,000
units per year altogether but most not in full operation due to
limited quota on imported parts.
</P>
<P>
Currently Japan-based Honda Motor company accounts for 80
percent of Vietnam's motorcycle market, while other Japanese,
German and Taiwanese firms altogether hold four to seven percent
of the market shares.
</P>
<P>
Honda recently has reached a deal with the Vietnamese
Engineering and Agricultural Machinery Corp. over building a
motorcycle joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Asian Honda Motor company in Thailand has also
decided to build a motorcycle plant in the northern province of
Vinh Phu.
</P>
<P>
The plant, planned to open in 1997 with an original capacity of
200,000 units annually, will localize 10 percent of motor parts
during the first seven years then 75 percent from the eighth year
onwards.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Yamaha motorbike maker now is waiting anxiously to get
license from the Vietnamese government for building a motorbike
factory worth 100 million U.S. dollars, with a target to sell
200,000 units annually there by 2006.
</P>
<P>
Yamaha was expected to sell about 5,000 sport models in Vietnam
this year, raising its market shares to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-based Vmep motorcycles are also fairly popular in
Vietnam due to its special design and cheaper price. Vmep has
invested 100 million dollars in building two motorcycle projects
in the northern Ha Tay province and the southern Dong Nai province.
</P>
<P>
The two projects will produce 80 percent of motorcycle parts
locally by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government stipulates that all foreign-invested
motorcycle firms should produce five to 10 percent of parts
locally in their first five years of running, then raise the
proportion to 60 percent from the sixth year onwards.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Sees No Immediate Need To Meet Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated that time has not yet come for
him to consider meeting with Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the statement in an interview with Al-Quds, an
East Jerusalem-based Palestinian Arabic daily, which was
published today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said: "I have said that when the conditions require
such a meeting, I will not hesitate to hold such a meeting. Right
now I have other important issues, and that's on the PM's level.
</P>
<P>
"But on the ministerial level, Israeli FM (David) Levy met with
Mr. Arafat, and the meeting was very constructive; another meeting
will be held between Mr. Arafat and Defense Minister (Yitzhak)
Modechai very soon, and an Israeli-Palestinian Guidance Committee
will be formed. There are many issues to be discussed with the
Palestinian side," he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu dismissed a suggestion that he is ignoring a meeting
with Arafat to discuss crucial issues, arguing "I am not ignoring
such a meeting. I said I will discuss the possibility of meeting
with Mr. Arafat when I feel it necessary."
</P>
<P>
"I repeat that we will not freeze talks with the
Palestinians. Of course we have certain questions and some
concerns related to the PA's implementing its part of the
commitments as I understand that the Palestinians have their
concerns too. I am trying through different ways to resolve all
disputes between us and the Palestinians until we reach a stage
where both sides abide by the commitments they made," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's recent decision to lift the freeze on Jewish
settlement activity, the right-wing Likud leader said that "there
are three basic issues related to settlements: the first deals
with building new settlements and we have not decided on this;
the second issue deals with the settlement natural growth, and we
decided to lift all restrictions on settlements expansion but
under the supervision of the government, and I am working with
the Defense Minister to set up a certain mechanism to be followed
in the area of expanding settlements; the third point deals with
opening new bypass roads which we will discuss within two
weeks. The latest Israeli decision deals with the second issue
only."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Jerusalem, the premier repeated his hardline
position saying "There is no possibility that we can agree with
the Palestinians on the issue of Jerusalem. It seems that this is
one of the unresolved issues. There is an agreement in the
transitional period that the PA committed itself not to hold any
related activities in Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
"We do not intend to delay the peace process but we expect
the Palestinians to abide by their commitments, and opening PA
offices in Jerusalem is not part of the deal," he argued.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made it clear that he will not agree with the idea
of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We Israelis, all agree that the Palestinians should run their
lives by themselves next to an Israeli state with no security
threats to any Israeli individual," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier explained: "We can work something out like a
self-rule arrangement but we will have the upper hand in
everything related to security making sure that the Jewish state
will continue to exist."

<HEADLINE> UK Banks Start Preparing for Effect of Euro Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- British banks are beginning to
make preparations for the prospect of having to deal with the Euro
as a parallel local currency even if Britain stays outside the
European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
British bankers have always recognized that even outside EMU
they would have to make some changes to their systems to cope with
the introduction of the single currency at the start of 1999, but
most believed that they would be able to simply treat the Euro as
one more foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
However, financial experts say the idea is gaining ground that
customer demand will make the Euro a very different animal from
the German Mark and U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
A committee of the London Investment Banking Association (LIBA)
warned on Saturday that London financial institutions would need a
Euro payments system even if Britain does not take part in the
first wave of EMU.
</P>
<P>
"We are not convinced that the Euro can simply be treated as an
additional foreign currency without raising potential competitive
implications for the city," a LIBA report said.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike any other foreign currency, the Euro would, even as a
non-participant, represent perhaps the future currency of
Britain," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that the argument reflects the belief that
many British companies which already do a lot of their business in
continental Europe will inevitably have to price their products
and invoice their customer in Euros.
</P>
<P>
The LIBA report also suggests that pressure may build from
both companies and investors for the development of a single
Euro-denominated market for the largest and most widely traded
European shares.
</P>
<P>
"Large British corporates who conduct the majority of their
business in Europe may prefer to be quoted on a European Euro
stock exchange," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, London financial markets will also want to be able
to compete for Euro business rather than risk seeing Frankfurt and
Paris develop as the dominant European financial centers.
</P>
<P>
The LIBA report stressed that so long as this demand for Euros
remains at the high value end of the market, EMU is something the
London banks ought to be able to handle.
</P>
<P>
The British government remains undecided on whether to take the
country into the single European currency, while Germany and
France are determined to push ahead with the 1999 time-table for
the single currency.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners' Interests in Chinese Learning Changing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- More foreigners are studying
Chinese, and their motives vary greatly for learning the
4,000-year-old pictographic language.
</P>
<P>
Scholars attending the on-going fifth international symposium
on Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language said that in recent
years, foreigners have shown a desire to learn to speak Chinese
and write the Chinese characters -- "picture words" -- because the
skills satisfy a wide range of personal interests.
</P>
<P>
Professor Hasegawa Ryoichi of Waseda University in Japan said
that most of his students choose to learn Chinese so they can find
a job that relates to China.
</P>
<P>
Learning Chinese in Japan is no longer for self-satisfaction,
as it was in the 1950s and 1960s, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are so many opportunities for people who speak Chinese,
and we lack enough teachers and graduates in Chinese," he said.
</P>
<P>
The same situation occurs in France, said Joel Bellassen, a
Chinese language scholar from the University of Paris. Students
there generally consider the Chinese language to be "very
practical," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bellassen became interested in the Chinese language" in the
1950s. "I was attracted to it because it is exotic and mysterious,
and at that time, I even thought of going to China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many of his students now are in business or working as
diplomats in China.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, college and university students usually
take one foreign language course, said Richard Simmons, a Chinese
language professor from Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the number of the students who study Asian
languages has risen, he said, adding that the increase of business
contacts with China has aroused the students' interests in
learning Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the Chinese language is providing more and more job
opportunities for foreigners," said Zhao Lijiang, a Chinese
language teacher from Beijing Language and Culture University.
</P>
<P>
With China's sustained economic growth and long-term social
stability, more people will take an interest in the Chinese
language, Hasegawa Ryoichi explained.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 universities overseas have Chinese language
classes. The number of the foreign students, who studied Chinese
in China last year, jumped to 37,000, twice the amount in the
early 1990s.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Important Document of Far-Reaching Significance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Work to form the Selection
Committee for setting up the first government of the Hong Kong
Special Administration Region (SAR) has gone beyond the
preparatory phase and is now fully underway.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of a document that governs the formation of the
committee was approved Saturday at the closing ceremony of the
fourth plenary session of the Preparatory Committee in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The plan is described as a very important one that has
far-reaching significance.
</P>
<P>
It is a result of combined efforts of all members of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR and the Hong Kong
residents.
</P>
<P>
The way in which the Selection Committee is formed is closely
connected to the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR. In accordance
with stipulations by the Basic Law for the Hong Kong SAR and the
National People's Congress (NPC), the Preparatory Committee will
form a Selection Committee composed of 400 permanent Hong Kong
residents.
</P>
<P>
The task for the Selection Committee is to choose the first
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR and to elect the provisional
Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The method used to form the Selection Committee is of vital
importance to the completion of the task, the realization of Hong
Kong's smooth transition and the safeguarding of its residents'
personal interests.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding at the end of January, the Selection
Committee Panel under the Preparatory Committee has adhered to the
working policy of "catering to Hong Kong people" and "relying on
Hong Kong people," and the principles of caution, steadiness,
democracy and openness.
</P>
<P>
Based on opinions solicited from Hong Kong residents in April,
the method was formulated after several consultations at the five
panel meetings, and discussions by the two plenary sessions of the
Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
The resulting document fully reflects the Hong Kong people's
aspirations and is believed to be acceptable to them.
</P>
<P>
The method stipulates in detail the make-up of the Selection
Committee, rules for choosing candidates, and guidelines for their
election.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to the document, committee members should meet all of
 the following three requirements:
</P>
<P>
-- They should be permanent Hong Kong residents as stated in
Article 24 of the Basic Law;
</P>
<P>
-- They should support the principle of "one country, two
systems";
</P>
<P>
-- They should be willing to carry out the committee's duties
of selecting the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR and
electing the provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
There will be no other restrictions on any groups or persons in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In order to reflect its broad representation, the 400 committee
members should be permanent Hong Kong residents from four
sectors: the industrial, commercial and financial sector;
professionals; labor, grass-roots, religious, and other sectors;
and former political figures, Hong Kong deputies to the NPC, and
Hong Kong members of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
There will be 100 Selection Committee members from each sector.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six Hong Kong deputies to the NPC who are permanent Hong
Kong residents will be appointed to the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
Forty members of the Selection Committee will be former
political figures; 34 will be Hong Kong members of the CPPCC
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
The election quota in every sector has been stipulated
according to the Basic Law and a decision by the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that as long as the specific method is carried
out in full, the Selection Committee will be formed smoothly, and
the selection of the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR
and the provisional legislature will be successful.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Leaves for Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan left here
today for Saudi Arabia for talks with King Fahd on bilateral ties,
ways to boost Arab solidarity and means to revive the stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also discuss a proposal to hold a
mini-summit of Arab leaders to be attended by Saudi Arabia,
Syria, Palestine, Egypt and Jordan to strengthen the Arab front
in peace negotiations with Israel and closely study ways and
means to unlock the stalled peace process, sources here told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Marwan Muasher said Saturday after a
cabinet meeting that the king's visit is "very important" for
both sides, adding that the bilateral relations between the two
kingdoms are "satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
On the political front, the king is expected to brief King
Fahd and other Saudi leaders on the status of the peace process,
the outcome of his talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu here last Monday and with Palestinian leaders Yasser
Arafat in Aqaba last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral level, the king is expected to discuss with
the Saudi leadership further means to boost Jordanian- Saudi
economic cooperation and coordination of positions on various
related issues.
</P>
<P>
Tension in the Gulf following two bombings in Saudi Arabia
targetting U.S. troops in November last year and this June and the
ongoing U.S.-Iran tug-of-war are also expected to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein did not meet King Fahd during a visit he paid to
Saudi Arabia in February as the Saudi monarch was recovering from
an ailment.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the two monarchs will be the first after
the 1991 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
The king's planned meeting with the Saudi leaders is the
latest in a series of intense diplomatic contacts after Netanyahu
made an overture to Syrian President Hafez Al Assad to break the
deadlock in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations by suggesting the
so-called "Lebanon-First" option.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein held talks with President Assad in Damascus on
August 3 and Israel's "Lebanon-first" offer was believed to have
been discussed during the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president, after talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in Alexandria last week, publicly rejected the proposal,
saying that it did not include a framework for peace.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian side insisted on the linkage between the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks of negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether the king's visit to Saudi Arabia
is also aimed at seeking Saudi weight behind the ongoing
efforts to convince the Syrian leader to consider the Israeli
offer.

<HEADLINE> Oil Firms in Nigeria Decry Budget Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Oil companies in joint venture
partnership with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC) demand the federal government rescind its decision to cut
joint venture budget for this year by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chief executives of the companies have met with top government
officials on the issue, and "what is left now is to await
government decision after all these efforts," said one industry
official, quoted by the newspaper Sunday Times today.
</P>
<P>
The federal government approved in June this year a joint
venture cash call of 1.75 billion U.S. Dollars and 20 billion
Naira (about 235 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the joint venture partners, including Shell, Mobil, Elf,
Chevron, Agip and Texaca Overseas, with eyes on an over two
billion Dollars budget, believe the government slash in budget
(compared with that of last year" would affect their exploration
and production plan.
</P>
<P>
Fred Nelson, project manager for the NNPC/Chevron Escravos gas
gathering project, said the budget cut might delay the May 1997
take-off date of the project, which is aimed at exporting natural
gas to other west African countries.
</P>
<P>
The slim NNPC budget might not be enough for the corporation
to finance its cash call contribution to the project, he warned.

<HEADLINE> Labor Shortage Delays HK New Airport Link Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Due to labor shortage,
construction work on a number of key projects along the railway
line connecting Hong Kong's new airport with downtown area is
running behind schedule, according to a report in today's Sunday
Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The report said that three stations along the line have been
seriously affected, which are lagging behind schedule from six
weeks to three months.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Mass Transit Railway Corp (MTRC) was quoted
as saying that "the shortage of labor is the only problem
affecting these stations. There are no problems on the technical
or construction side."
</P>
<P>
Many other new airport-related projects, large and small, have
also had delays of different degrees, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the difficulties are due to a variety of factors,
including staff shortages, poor ground conditions and delays
caused by the government's bureaucratic labor importation scheme.
</P>
<P>
Russell Black, airport railway project director, said that
5,000 imported workers are needed to ensure that the 35 billion HK
dollar (4.49 billion US dollars) airport railway will be
completed by the June 1988 deadline.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Premier: Turkey Determined to Sign Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan vowed here today to make a multi-billion dollar gas deal
with Iran despite U.S. opposition.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is determined to pursue the matter and buy natural gas,
oil and electricity from Iran," said the pro-Islamic prime
minister who is here on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Turkey will officially sign the 20 billion
U.S. dollar gas deal under which Iran will export gas to Turkey
for 22 years beginning from 1999.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also decided to purchase 30,000 kilowatts of electricity
from Iran. Besides, the two countries have announced that they
would connect their electricity networks.
</P>
<P>
The United States has expressed its anger over the ongoing
visit by the Turkish prime minister and the multi-billion dollar
gas deal.
</P>
<P>
Washington warned Turkey Friday that it may face sanctions
under the new Iran-Libya sanctions law if it signs the multi-
billion dollar gas deal with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a bill into law
to punish non-American companies investing more than 40 million
dollars per year in Iran and Libya's oil industries.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey will not allow any third country to interfere in
expansion of cooperation between Iran and Turkey," said the
visiting Turkish premier during his meeting today with Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders even talked about military cooperation between
the two neighbors in a bid to promote peace, security and
tranquility in the common border.
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old prime minister stressed the importance of
preserving peace and tranquility for expanding cooperation in
political and economic fields.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister assured the Iranian president that
Turkey will not allow any individual faction to undertake any
political activities against the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, he added, cooperation between the two armed
forces at their common border are very important.
</P>
<P>
Repudiating international media propaganda on rivalry between
Iran and Turkey in Central Asian Republics and Caucasus, he called
for implementation of joint economic policies.
</P>
<P>
He also called on closer cooperation among the Economic
Cooperation Organization (ECO) countries to reduce reliance on
foreign sources.
</P>
<P>
The ECO was founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan and Turkey. It
also groups Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzystan
and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, on his part, expressed his thanks to Erbakan for
his visit to Iran, particularly at a time when U.S. President Bill
Clinton signed the D'Amato bill to punish non-U.S. companies
investing in oil and gas industries in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are brought together because of their deep
religious, historical and cultural ties, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the peace and tranquility in the common
border in line with their common interest.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old president said "Iran has demonstrated its
political and military will to confront any attempt to violate
peace at the border, and will not allow any group to sabotage
security in Turkish border via Iran."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Iranian president was referring
to the accusation that Iran supports PKK's activities inside
Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
"The existing trust, confidence and independence has laid a
solid foundation for expanding exchanges between the two
countries," Rafsanjani claimed.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, "some foreign forces are not willing to see
expansion and enhancement of cooperation between the two
neighbors and they are making suggestion and interpretation in a
bid to weaken the relations of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
He warned that "officials of the two countries should keep an
open eye on the hostile measures and try to neutralize them."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also called on its neighbor to raise the level
of their cooperation among ECO members by rolling back tariffs,
offering custom facilities, creating Islamic bank insurance
institution as well as shipping and airlines.

LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 50 people have died as a
result of oil spillage in April this year in Ilaje-ese-odo,

HONG KONG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Engineers have begun their
studies on building a 10-km cable car system from Sai Kung to High
Island Reservoir in the New Territories of Hong Kong, today's
Sunday Morning Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the proposed cable car would connect Sharp
Island, Kau Sai Chau, Urn Island and Tiu Chung Chau to the
mainland of the New Territories.
</P>
<P>
The Sai Kung District Development Foundation wants to turn the
relatively uninhabited islands into a three billion HK dollars
(0.38 billion US dollars) tourist center featuring theme parks,
aquariums, zoos and marinas.
</P>
<P>
The foundation said that the development would revitalize Sai
Kung economically and culturally, but many local residents have
voiced fears that their relatively peaceful district would be
ruined by the work.
</P>
<P>
A Home Affairs Department spokesman was quoted as saying that
several departments had to study final plans for the development
before any approval was given.

<HEADLINE> No Politics, Says Zimbabwe's New First Lady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's new first lady,
31-year-old Grace Marufu, has no love for politics and would
rather devote her time to playing the role of housewife, looking
after the children and working for charity.
</P>
<P>
Marufu will formally become Mrs Mugabe after the wedding
scheduled for August 17 at President Robert Mugabe's country
residence at Kutama, 80 km west of Harare.
</P>
<P>
She told the Zimbabwe National News Agency on Saturday she was
thrilled at the prospect of being Zimbabwe's first lady.
</P>
<P>
"It's actually the greatest honour my husband has bestowed on
me. There can only be one first lady and one president at a
time," she said.
</P>
<P>
But the lady, who has already undergone traditional marriage
rites with President Mugabe, will not complement her husband on
the political front.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I want to become a politician at all," she
was responding to a question. "I think I have my duties as a wife. I
have children to look after. So I would rather be more at home with
my kids."
</P>
<P>
"I actually look forward to working with various charitable
organizations," she added.
</P>
<P>
Born in South Africa when her Zimbabwean parents were working
there, Marufu comes to State House four years after President
Mugabe's first wife, Sally, died after a long struggle with a
kidney ailment.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Marufu's parents returned to Zimbabwe from South
Africa. She received primary education in Harare and then went to
Christe Mambo Girls High School.
</P>
<P>
Later she took a secretarial course at the Christian College
of Southern Africa and joined the office of the president as a
secretary after graduation..
</P>
<P>
She resigned from the public service in 1994 and is currently
taking a degree course with the University of London.
</P>
<P>
Marufu said she does her own make-up and designs her own
clothses and likes rural life. She already has two children with
Mugabe.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Poverty Cuts Into British Children's Growth, IQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Malnutrition is stunting the
physical growth and mental development of British children living
in poverty, according to a report published today.
</P>
<P>
The report, carried by the Observer, sited the results of a
survery of 179 local authorities and 36 health authorities by the
School Milk Campaign to elaborate on the effects of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Details of the survey, yet to be formally released, have
provided evidence of poor nutrition and poor growth rates in
children from nearly all low-income families.
</P>
<P>
The study is expected to confirm previous findings that these
children will have intelligence quotient (IQ) deficiencies of
between five and 20 points at the age of six.
</P>
<P>
It also adds weight to the findings of earlier nationwide
long-term studies which have placed the most deprived 11-year-olds
at up to 13 centimeters shorter than their peers.
</P>
<P>
Deprivation and poor nutrition in Britain is now on a scale
unseen since the 1930's and is threatening the health and
well-being of millions of children, said the Observer report.
</P>
<P>
Although the British government has refused to define an
official poverty line, one in three British children is now born
into deprivation and decay under European Union (EU) criteria.
</P>
<P>
Tony Waterston, of the British Association for Community Child
Health, said the government has not taken on the severity of the
problem and "this is indefensible in a country like Britain."

QUITO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's reappointed Foreign
Minister Galo Leoro Franco said here today that the country's new
government will support the peace process with Peru.
</P>
<P>
Franco made the remarks at a working session of representatives
from the Rio de Janeiro Protocol Guarantor Countries, which
included Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador is trying to find a definitive solution through
conversations to its border conflict with Peru on the basis of
firness and justice, said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The new Ecuadoran government was led by Abdala Bucaram, who was
elected as the country's president in the second round of
presidential elections in July.
</P>
<P>
The government, sworn in today, considered the support of the
four guarantor countries as a good help for obtaining valuable
bridges toward peace, the foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador were locked in a large-scale border conflict
in January 1995. Ceasefire was achieved 50 days later through the
mediation of the Rio De Janeiro Protocol Countries.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Wants External Debts Scrapped Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is calling on
donor countries and international monetary institutions to reduce
or write-off the country's 7.5 billion U.S. Dollar external debt,
which consumes more than 25 percent of its annual budget.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a new community development policy in Parliament on
Friday in Dodoma, Central Tanzania, Minister for Community
Development, Women and Children Affairs Mary Nagu said such a
huge debt is weakening the government's efforts in implementing
its socio-economic development projects.
</P>
<P>
Since the government was forced to spend a big portion of its
budget on debt repayment, she said, it was obvious that it could
not effectively and satisfactoraily render vital socio-economic
services.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure production efforts by farmers are successful, there
is need to persuade donors to reduce external debts," she added.

<HEADLINE> Juvenile Delinquency Declines In India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Cases of juvenile delinquency
in India have dropped markedly in recent years, the Press Trust of
India said today.
</P>
<P>
According to an annual report of the National Crime Records
Bureau, the number of crimes committed by boys below 16 years or
girls below 18 years stood at 158,700 in 1981 and but it came down
to 18,600 in 1992 and further down to 16,000 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Despite an increase in population, the share of juvenile crimes
to total crimes registered under the Indian penal code has also
shown a declining trend since 1988 when it was 1.7 percent. It
came down to 0.6 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, the bureau said the declining trend was noticed only
in cases of theft, burglary and culpable homicide not amounting to
murder while cases of kidnapping and abduction had increased by
132.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bureau did not explain why juvenile delinquency had dropped
sharply in the years under review.
</P>
<P>
The Indian law defines "juvenile" as a male below 16 years and
a female below 18 years of age.

<HEADLINE> Syria: "Lebanon First" Proposal Is Israeli Trap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Syria's government-run
newspaper "Al-Baath" said in its editorial today that the "Lebanon
first" proposal is an "Israeli trap."
</P>
<P>
The paper said that "Lebanon first," raised by Israel, is
intended to shake the stability of Lebanon and isolate it, to
"beat Lebanon's patriotic resistance movement in the south," to
separate the Syrian and Lebanese tracks and to evade the
requirements for a fair and overall peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Al-Baath" pointed out that Syria and Lebanon will enter the
peace negotiations with a unified stand, but absolutely refusing
the so-called "Lebanon first" proposal, because it is the unity of
Syrian and Lebanese stances that will enable the two countries to
achieve their objective of liberation and peace.
</P>
<P>
"Damascus and Beirut", the paper continued, "have reiterated
their adherence to the peace process and its authority,
emphasizing that it is impossible to separate the Syrian and
Lebanese peace tracks."
</P>
<P>
The paper dismissed the propagated Natanyahu government's
readiness for resuming the peace process as "no more than mere
talk based on none of requisites of genuine peace."
</P>
<P>
"It has become quite clear that the Israel proposal handed over
to the Clinton Administration has nothing to do with peace," it
added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firms Likely to invest in Jordan Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Several U.S. major multinationals
are planning to invest in Jordan's energy and power projects and
discussions are under way between the two sides, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
At least six American companies have expressed their interest
in setting a 250-megawatt power plan in southern Jordan at an
estimated cost of more than 350 million dollars, the sources told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The project could be on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) or
build-own-operate (BOO) basis and the entire investment will come
from the private sector, both Jordanian and foreign.
</P>
<P>
Additional part of the plant's output after meeting the local
needs is expected to be bought by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary of the U.S. Department of
Commerce, confirmed here last week during his talks with
Jordanian officials that Israeli Infrastructure Minister Ariel
Sharon had expressed keen interest in buying the output of the
plant.
</P>
<P>
He also said American firms were interested in the project
and serious discussions were under way.
</P>
<P>
Another proposed project is a 2.2-billion-dollar refinery with
an installed capacity to process 25,000 barrels of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
An American company, Corporated Holdings of America (CHA),
signed a letter of intent in Jordan to undertake the project, but
it failed to meet a contract obligation to provide a bank
guarantee as precondition before being granted the project.
</P>
<P>
Reports of the failure of the company dismayed many
Jordanians, but officials and diplomats here said another U.S.
firm had proposed to take the project and several other
options were also available to the government.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat brushed aside the failure of the first company and
said that the project is expected to be finalized soon.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to generate 7,000 to 10,000 direct
and another 10,000 indirect job opportunities for Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
Another major infrastructure project in Aqaba is the proposed
expansion of the airport there to serve as a regional facility
that will initially serve Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Trade and Development Agency, an arm of the U.S.
government, financed a feasibility study on the expansion of the
airport with a 500,000-dollar grant.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports here said Israeli minister Sharon opposed the
project which was agreed upon by the previous Labor- party
government.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied the
reports after his talks with King Hussein last Monday here in
Amman, saying that the project had the support of Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Sources also said Jordan and the U.S. are discussing a
terminal at Aqaba to store liquefied gas.
</P>
<P>
The 300-million-dollar terminal will be built by the U.S.
Enron Corporation to store gas shipped from Qatar and sent to
Israel through a pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Qatar had signed separate agreements with Enron in
this regard.

The State Duma, Russian parliament's lower house, voted
Saturday to give Chernomyrdin another term as the country's prime
minister with 314 for, 85 against and three abstentions.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Palestinians Sign Interline Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Royal Jordanian (RJ) and the
Palestine Airline signed here Saturday an interline agreement
which allows the Palestinians to issue tickets to passengers
flying by RJ planes to all destinations.
</P>
<P>
Fayez Zeidan, director-general of the Palestine Civil Aviation
Authority, said following the signing ceremony that the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) attaches particular attention
to the training of Palestinian civil aviation personnel in Jordan,
Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that Amman will not be the only place
for training Palestinian civil aviation pilots and technicians
noting that even many of the RJ personnel receive training in
other countries too.
</P>
<P>
RJ's President Nader Dahbi said the agreement allows the
Palestine Airline to issue tickets on behalf of RJ, a move
that would secure additional numbers of Palestinian passengers to
fly by RJ through the Queen Alia International Airport and the
Amman Marka Airport to various RJ destinations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Palestinian personnel will be able to
get training on weather forecasting for aviation purposes and
for training Palestinian pilots in simulators operated by the
RJ's training unit.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, Royal Wings, Jordan's second airline designed
 for shorthaul flights owned by the national carrier RJ,
announced plans to operate flights between the Egyptian resort of
Sharm Al Sheikh and Jordan's south port city of Aqaba beginning on
August 24.
</P>
<P>
The airline, which began operating international flights in
March with five weekly flights to Tel Aviv, will expand its
schedule to include a weekly round trip to Sharm Al Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
The airline is also negotiating with Jordanian travel agents
and tour operators in order to organize three weekly flights
between Egypt and Jordan with a view to increasing tourism to the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Royal Wings' future plans include flights to Damascus, Beirut,
Alexandria, Larnaka and Ghardaqa.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany will begin to send the
320,000 Bosnian refugees in Germany back to home from October 1,
German Red Cross President Knut Ipsen said.
</P>
<P>
The decision, the newspaper "the Neuen Osnabruecker Zeitung"
published today quoted Ipsen as saying, was made by Germany's
national and state interior ministers.
</P>
<P>
Among the Bosnian refugees, those without families, childless
couples and people whose children are in Bosnia will be the first
to leave Germany, he told the paper in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Moslem refugees from Serb-controlled territories could not be
given asylum in Germany, as it would go against the aims of the
Dayton peace accords signed, the Red Cross president added.
</P>
<P>
Warring parties in Bosnia signed an agreement at the Dayton
Air Force Base in the United States last December to end the
Bosnian war that had lasted nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
During fierce fightings, more than 2.4 million people were

<HEADLINE> HIV, AIDS Cases Increase in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of HIV and AIDS
cases is rising fast in Malaysia with 300 new HIV cases detected
every month throughout the country, according to Deputy Health
Minister Zaharah Sulaiman today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 448 AIDS cases and 16,349 HIV cases were reported up
to June 30 this year since the first AIDS case was detected in the
country in December 1986, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The government concerned over the increase in the number of HIV
cases seeks to ensure that the HIV carriers receive the best
treatment and do not pose a threat to other," Zaharah was quoted
by Malaysian news agency Bernama as saying in Kota Bahru, Kelantan
State.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet itself approved an allocation of 120 million
ringgit (about 48 million U.S. dollars) to cover the cost of
treating AIDS patients between 1993 and 1995," the minister said,
adding that "additional allocations are needed because figures
show that 300 new HIV cases are detected every month throughout
the country."
</P>
<P>
However, the official sources said the figures did not reflect
the actual number because many cases are still to be reported or
not reported at all.
</P>
<P>
Most of the HIV carriers are youths aged between 20 and 39 who
form 83.58 percent of the total cases and Another 4.21 percent of
them aged between 13 and 19, the sources said.

issues of the Palestinian self-rule areas of the West Bank and
Gaza, according to sources close to the meeting, which opened

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Thailand, Tin Giant's Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, a tin producing giant
in the 1970s, has finally proposed to pull out of the Association
of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) by the end of the year, which
Thailand helped found a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
For centuries, tin was the biggest money maker among Thai
minerals. Nearly two decades ago, Thailand was the world's third
largest tin exporter after Bolivia and Malaysia. But over the
past two years, Thailand has become a net tin importer.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Thailand's fast-growing economy has absorbed all
its local tin production, mostly by the automobile and electronic
industries.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Thailand's tin production was 14,471 tons, against a
consumption of 2,743 tons.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the tin production in the country plummeted
drastically while demand rose sharply, until 1993 when production
and demand stood at a break-even level of 4,700 tons.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thailand's production further dropped to 1,587 tons
while demand soared to 5,447 tons, a shortfall of 3,860 tons.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the country's demand in the year 2000 will
reach 8,000 tons and the Department of Mineral Resources has no
figures on projected domestic tin production for years to come,
saying only that it has been on a downward trend.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend has resulted from low tin prices, high labor
and mining costs.
</P>
<P>
In the tin-producing southern part of Thailand, tin mines are
hardly seen on land, and a few mines are seen off shore. People
in that part of Thailand choose to work in the tourism industry
which brings them easy and fast money. Even working in rubber
plantation is less toiling and more worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
As a result, most of the tin concentrate delivered to the
country's only remaining smelter, belonging to Thailand Smelting
and Refining Co (Thaisarco) in Phuket, south Thailand, comes from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Tin Producing Countries was founded for the
purpose of establishing tin export quotas among member countries
with a view to shore up tin prices.
</P>
<P>
With Thailand as a net importer, it would not be happy to see
tin price high and therefore it is not fit any more for it to stay
in the organization.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the association are China, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Bolivia, Nigeria, Zaire and Australia.

<HEADLINE> Earthquakes Shake Northeastern Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Three earthquakes, including one
measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale, hit an area around the
Akita-Miyagi prefectural border in northeastern Japan this morning.
</P>
<P>
However, police was quoted by local news media as saying that
no serious human injuries or property damage were immediately
reported after the strong earth-shaking tremors.
</P>
<P>
The first quake, with a magnitude of 5.9, struck at 3:12
a.m. local time in the ward of Numakura in the town of Kurikoma,
Miyagi Prefecture, said the Sendai Meteorological Observatory.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by the second one at 3:54 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The quakes, said the Sendai Meteorological Observatory that has
been monitoring the area closely with a newly installed
seismometer, focused about 10 kilometers underground.
</P>
<P>
Numakura has had frequent earthquakes since last April, and
therefore has put seismological researchers at high alert.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the latest quakes, a woman reportedly had the
artery of her right arm cut by broken glass and a 10-year-old boy
was hurt in the head by a falling object.
</P>
<P>
And in addition, the quakes temporarily suspended railway
services in northern Japan.

<HEADLINE> Iran Dismisses US Sanction as "Banana Skin" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran today dismissed the latest
tough U.S. sanction against Iran as "a banana skin" for
U.S. President Bill Clinton, as it would not decrease Iran's oil
revenues, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
English daily Tehran Times said that "U.S. President Bill
Clinton is seeking in vain to universalize his country's domestic
rules and make the world obey them."
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi as saying that the prevalent situation in the United
States on the verge of the next presidential elections suggests
that "the sanctions have proved a banana skin for the Clinton
administration."
</P>
<P>
In other words, he said, "the Republicans helped to create the
situation so as to take the lead in the next presidential
elections."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Clinton signed the D'Amato bill into law to punish
non-American companies investing 40 million dollars or more in
Iranian oil and gas industries.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened to punish Turkey under the new
Iran-Libya sanctions law if it signs multi-billion dollar gas
purchase deal with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman noted that the U.S. must realize that
internationally accepted laws related to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) are independent from the domestic rules and
regulations adopted by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Through the tightening of sanctions against Iran, Washington
intended to exert influence over other countries and make them
bow to its political hegemony in the aftermath of the Cold War,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the U.S. was doing all it could to
control the world's strategic energy resources and use them as a
leverage against its rivals, the European Union (EU) and Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. was well aware that its accusations were
unfounded and that the sanctions would not decrease Iran's oil
revenues.

</P>
<P>
Of 3,335 mothers interviewed from August 1 to 9 by Suan Dusit

China has a long tradition of South-South cooperation, or
cooperation between developing countries, especially with Africa,
the director added.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Takes on Chang Again in ATP Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Agassi outpowered Thomas
Muster in the semifinal to set up another clash with Michael Chang
in the ATP championships final in Mason of Ohio on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Agassi handled Austria Thomas Muster 6-4, 6-1 in the
afternoon's semifinal. Chang advanced to his fourth straight ATP
Championship final by finally outlasted Thomas Enqvist 6-1, 2-6,
6-2. It was the first time Chang beat the Swede after three losses.
</P>
<P>
That set up a rematch of last year's championship, won by
Agassi 7-5, 6-2. Chang won the ATP title the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
Agassi handled Muster's serves and dictated a hectic pace with
his variety of bullet-like ground strokes and slow-motion drop
shots.
</P>
<P>
Muster had won four of seven meetings with Agassi, although
Agassi had taken the last two in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Chang swept the first six points _ including all the points in
Enqvist's opening serve _ in cruising through the first set. In
the second set, Enqvist started getting more first serves in and
began handling Chang's service. Then Chang took over again in the
final set.
</P>
<P>
Agassi holds a 10-6 lead in meetings against Chang, although
Chang has won two of three this year. Agassi has a 10-match
winning streak in ATP events, while Chang has won his last 14.

<HEADLINE> Moftec Promotes Inland Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign governments may make
soft loans available not only for environmental-protection
projects but also for the various agricultural and industrial
sectors that can promote the economic development of recipient
countries, a Chinese trade Official suggested.
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, improved national strength is the fundamental
means to care for the environment and we think the destination of
soft loans should be extended to cover commercially viable
projects," the official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation (Moftec), who declined to be named, was
quoted in today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Restricted coverage of soft loans, earmarked for
"non-commercially viable" projects, has resulted in a dilemma for
China's poverty-stricken areas. Either they are refused access if
applicant projects are profitable, or the areas will have
difficulty repaying commercial loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 800 million-US-dollar soft loans to China by foreign
governments this year, only 16 percent went to poor inland
provinces, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the utilization of foreign investment is a
useful means to overcome the capital shortages in central and
western China's development strategies, citing soft loan as the
most favorable option to ease the strain due to its low interest
rate.
</P>
<P>
As part of a strategy to bridge the wealth gap between China's
affluent coastal areas and its underdeveloped interior, Moftec
wouldn't impose export quotas on the inland manufacturers if they
remain self-sufficient in foreign exchange supply, said Wang
Liaoping, deputy director-general of Moftec's foreign investment
administration.
</P>
<P>
He also said Moftec has proposed to the State Council that
inland provinces should be granted the right to approve all
foreign-investment of 30 million US dollars or less.
</P>
<P>
At present, provincial governments can only approve projects up
to 10 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
More state funds will be provided for inland areas, in
consideration of their inability to raise share capital in
implementing foreign-investment projects, and the state will give
them more options for fund-raising, according to Yu Xiaosong,
vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Purchase Gas, Oil, Electricity from Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan said that Turkey is interested in purchasing 5 million
barrels of oil from Iran annually, the state-run Tehran Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement during the first round of talks held
Saturday night with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Habibi, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Turkey is expected to sign a 20 billion dollar gas
deal with Iran, under which Iran will export gas to Turkey for 22
years beginning from 1999.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the Turkish premier said Turkey also
decided to purchase 30,000 kilowatts of electricity from Iran.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the two countries' electricity networks are also
to be connected.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said that trade exchange between the two countries was
2 billion dollars last year, expressing disappointment that the
business exchange dropped considerably in the current year.
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old premier said that as the two nations shared
common religious background and had long common borders, there was
a need to make use of the available potentiality and exploit the
natural talents and resources to the fullest.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the two Islamic countries can set an
example for the Islamic world in the new era of cooperation,
bilateral relations, especially relations among the Economic
Cooperation Organization (ECO) countries.
</P>
<P>
The ECO was founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan and Turkey. It
also groups Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzystan
and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides will further discuss setting up of an ECO
bank and an Islamic development bank, creation of a common Islamic
market and establishment of closer cooperation between the ECO and
ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the need to promote cooperation in the two
countries' defense area, and in supply and exchange of the needed
raw material.
</P>
<P>
Habibi in response said that the common border of the two
countries should be "the border of peace, friendship and
brotherhood."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that he would not allow any group or faction
to make use of Iranian territory to endanger the security of the
Turkish border region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the same commitment was expected of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Habibi finally stressed the political and economic importance
of the Central Asian and Caucasus Republics, adding that
instability and differences in the region is not to the benefit
of any country, hoping that the basis of peace and stability will
be strengthened.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is considering a
plan to privatize its national flag carrier Kuwait Airways
Corporation (KAC), local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) is considering this
issue," KAC Chairman Ahmad Al-Meshari was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said this move is a part of the comprehensive privatization
plan launched by the government in 1994.
</P>
<P>
KIA, Kuwait's investment arm, is supervising a plan to shed
Kuwait's stake in some 60 local firms and later to privatize
government holdings in services such as electricity, water and
telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
The program is meant to increase the private sector's role in
the state-orchestrated economy and refill state coffers depleted
by war costs and reconstruction projects.
</P>
<P>
KAC has four airbus 340-300s, three airbus 310-300s, three
airbus 320-200s, five airbus 300-600s and four Boeing 747-200s. A
delivery of two Boeing 777s is expected in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The airline operates flights to 49 international destinations.
Nationals of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which groups Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and
Bahrain, are allowed to take part in the privatization program.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Threatens Street Agitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has threatened street agitation against
the government if "repression and conspiracy against the party
were not stopped."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a BNP district meeting Saturday, the party's
Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan reiterated his allegations
against the government for, what he said, unleashing of repression
against BNP leaders and activists throughout the country and
warned that "don't force the BNP to take to the streets."
</P>
<P>
These were nothing but a deep-rooted conspiracy to destroy the
party, the BNP leader said, adding that the rulers are more
interested in making derogatory remarks against the BNP inside
parliament by passing important national issues and BNP is not
allowed to refute the motivated and false statements against it on
the floor of the house.
</P>
<P>
Bhuiyan called for maintaining unity and discipline in the
party and its front organizations along with the professionals and
directed the party activists to build strong organizational base
at the grassroots levels.

<HEADLINE> Crisis Deepen in India's Ruling United Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Crisis in India's 13-party
United Front government deepened after a crucial meeting on a
controversial dam project ended in a stalemate on Saturday night,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and
Maharashtra was convened by Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda in a
bid to settle the dispute over the Krishna river water sharing.
</P>
<P>
The Almatti dam project, undertaken by the Karnataka state
government with financial assistance from the central government,
is designed to raise the height of the dam to impound more water
in favor of Karnataka.
</P>
<P>
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, who played
a crucial role in the formation of the United Front, has
threatened that his party, the Telugu Desam Party, will withdraw
from the front unless the dam project is immediately halted.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour long meeting on the Almatti dam issue on
Saturday ended with Prime Minister Deve Gowda failing to bring
about a rapprochement between the two warring states of Andhra
Pradesh and Karnataka.
</P>
<P>
Chief Minister Naidu and his delegation boycotted the dinner
hosted by Gowda after the meeting, in protest over the prime
minister's refusal to direct Karnataka to halt work on the dam.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the meeting, he and other Telugu Desam Party
leaders went into a huddle to discuss their future course of
action. They plan to raise the issue in the meeting of the United
Front Steering Committee scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
In response to Naidu's demand during the meeting, Gowda, who
used to be Karnataka chief minister, pleaded helplessness, saying
he could not issue any unilateral directions to any state.
</P>
<P>
"I am the prime minister of the entire country and not of any
one state," he told Naidu, requesting him not to politicize the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, Gowda told reporters that he did not
have any objections to convening another meeting of the chief
ministers.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Recommend Fresh Aid for Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has said it will
recommend to the aid group of western donors for committing 2
billion U.S. dollars in fresh aid to Bangladesh for the current
1996-97 fiscal year beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources today, the indication was given
in the bank's memorandum prepared for the aid group meeting
scheduled for September 9-11 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, titled "Bangladesh: economic update, recent
economic development and medium term reform agenda," has already
been presented to the Bangladeshi government and the cabinet is
likely to discuss it on Monday.
</P>
<P>
While signaling a larger aid commitment in 1996-97, the World
Bank has cautioned that the fate of external support for
Bangladesh would be linked to the government's clear-cut
commitment on reforms and radical improvement in the quality of
public spending.

<HEADLINE> India Cancels Passport of Hawala Operator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
canceled the Indian passport of Amir Bhai, a key suspect in the
18-million-U.S. dollar hawala bribery scandal, to secure his
return to India, the Sunday Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government move came after a Hong Kong court had
earlier rejected an Indian request for extradition of the suspect
and was designed to pursue the suspect's deportation by the Hong
Kong authorities.
</P>
<P>
Bhai was released by the Hong Kong court on Thursday when the
court rejected the extradition plea because of lack of compelling
evidence provided by the Indian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Hawala is an illegal foreign exchange trade network bypassing
India's official foreign exchange regime.
</P>
<P>
Bhai is a hawala operator. His return to India is crucial for
the investigation of the hawala bribery scandal in which more than
20 leading Indian politicians were charged of receiving money
through hawala dealers.

<P>
KATHMANDU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Two Nepali groups of disabled
people ended their hunger strike here demanding welfare when Prime
Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba feed the strikers with fruit juice
Saturday, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a three-point agreement was signed Saturday between
the Social Welfare Ministry and the two protesting groups, the
Nepal National Federation of the Disabled and the Nepal
Association of the Blind on their welfare demands.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the government will introduce a 1996
national policy on disabled service, speed up the process of
making temporary disabled government employees and school teachers
permanent, and providing 100 disabled people including 50 blind
with jobs.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 members of the two disabled groups began a hunger
strike last Monday about 500 meters in front of the government
office compound, pressing the government to fulfill their earlier
welfare demands.
</P>
<P>
Separate press releases issued Saturday by the two groups said
they ended their protest program as their genuine demands have
been fulfilled.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Power outage today struck six
Western states of the U.S., blackening traffic signals and forcing
hospitals to resort to emergency power generators, local media
said.
</P>
<P>
The outage began around 16:00 local time (23:00 GMT), affecting
vast areas from Oregon to California, and then southeastward to
Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and other regions.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, police were called to be on alert in response
to the emergency while in San Francisco police were dispatched
around to help out people stranded in elevators.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Gas and Electric Company told reporters that there was
a "frequency disruption" in the Pacific Interconnect, a 500,000
volt electric grid that runs from Canada to the Mexican border,
knocking out three of the utility's plants.
</P>
<P>
The company blamed heat wave for the failure as it pushed up
demand for electricity. In mid California, the temperature hit 38
degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
It was the second major power outage in a little more than one
month in the region. On July 2, an outage on an Idaho
transmission line caused a ripple effect that cut power supply to
15 Western states and parts of Canada and Mexico, affecting life
of some 2 million people.

TOKYO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Frequent earthquakes, including
one measured 5.9 on the Richter scale, attacked northeastern Japan
early today, the Kyodo News Service quoted the Sendai
Meteorological Observatory as saying.
</P>
<P>
No serious injuries or damages were immediately reported, but
railway services on three JR lines there have been suspended.
</P>

them registering 5 on the Japanese scale and others 3 or above,
the observatory said.
</P>
<P>
Tremors also shook Shinjo, Yamagata Prefecture and Ichinoseki,
Iwate Prefecture, respectively registered 4 and 3 on the Japanese

TOKYO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan's male wage earners differ
in opinions over the introduction of personnel promotion policies
based on managers' appraisal of their ability and performance,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
About 54 percent of the wage earners support the policies,
according to a survey by the Research Institute for Advancement of
Living Standards, a think tank affiliated with the Japanese Trade
Union Confederation (JTUC), Japan's largest trade union, the Kyodo

</P>
<P>
However, 45 percent of the wage earners are opposed to such
policies, saying it is hard to accurately appraise one's ability

</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted on 2,000 male wage earners, 1,000 from
JTUC-affiliated trade unions and 1,000 from major financial

<HEADLINE> Ecological Work Spells Business Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Overseas businesses interested
in the environmental-protection sector are to find good
opportunities in China, according to an official with the National
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA).
</P>
<P>
Guo Xiaomin, deputy director-general of NEPA's planning and
finance department made the prediction on the ground that China
will launch a great number of environmental protection projects in
the coming few years, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
To meet the government goal of stemming pollution and
ecological devastation by the end of this century, China is
carrying out a "Green Project", a long-term package mainly
focusing on water-pollution treatment, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
During the first phase of the Green Project (1996-2000), around
1,500 projects will be under construction across the country,
needing a total investment of 190 billion yuan, and overall
spending for environmental protection during the coming five years
is estimated at 450 billion yuan, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the large-scale projects, Guo said:"We'll seek to
pursue various financing channels."
</P>
<P>
Although provincial governments and local enterprises will
undoubtedly contribute most of the investment - and the central
government will offer support through loans and special policies -
overseas investment is also expected to play an important role,
the official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
During the five years, overseas loans on environmental
protection in China - mainly from the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, other international financial institutions and
government loans - could reach three to four billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"At least we hope so," Guo said, adding,"We are discussing the
possibility of introducing overseas capital in other channels such
as investment funds and application of BOT
(build-operate-transfer) in the bidding for environmental
projects."
</P>
<P>
He admitted direct overseas investment in the
environmental-protection industry so far is relatively
insignificant. However, he pointed out that the potential is high
in the future.

<HEADLINE> Canlaon Volcano in Philippines May Exhibit More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Canlaon volcano in Negros
island, the central Philippines, may exhibit more small explosions
without showing any forewarning sign after its eruption Saturday
which killed four foreigners, the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology warned here today.
</P>
<P>
In its observation report, the institute said that the volcano
exhibited a small ash ejection at 14:31 (06:31 GMT) Saturday and
lasted 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"The explosion produced voluminous dirty-white steam which was
expelled from the central crater and attained a maximum height of
about 1,500 meters and was drifted to the northeast," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the institute, the seismograph at Cabagnaan
station has recorded a total of 22 low frequency volcanic quake,
13 quake of local tectonic in origin and one tectonic quake since
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the previous character of ash ejection of Canlaon,
these vent tends to cluster in time and therefore, the volcano may
exhibit more small explosions without showing any forewarning
sign," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that a quick response team was already sent to the
volcano to set up additional seismic instrument, conduct ground
deformation and closely monitor its present activity.

<HEADLINE> First Cuba-Mexico Inter-Parliamentary Meeting Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The first Cuba-Mexico
Inter-Parliamentary Meeting started here today with a rebuke to
the U.S. Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
At the inaugural session, President of the Cuban National
Assembly of the People's Power Ricardo Alarcon and head of the
Mexican legislative delegation, Senator Jose Murat, both reproved
the extraterritorial character of the U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
"We are not meeting against anybody, but as representatives of
our peoples to discuss themes of universal relevance and common
interest," said Alarcon.
</P>
<P>
The two-day annual meeting, which will be held in Cuba and
Mexico alternatively, is aimed at strengthening links between the
legislative organs of the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban parliamentary leader also stressed the importance of
preserving the independence and sovereignty of his country,
despite the U.S. anti-Cuba blockade imposed in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Murat expressed desire to expand political
dialogue and exchange of experiences with the Cuban parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is interested in contributing to Cuba's closer contact
with other states in the region and to protecting the principles
of national sovereignty, people's self-determination,
non-interference in internal affairs and solution of controversies
through dialogue, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, legislators of both countries will discuss the
situation created by the Helms-Burton law, the commercial and
economic relations of the two countries, and the cooperation
between the two legislative organs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress passed the Helms-Burton law in March after
two small aircrafts piloted by an anti-Cuban group based in the
U.S. were shot down in February.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. legislation has outraged many countries, including its
European allies, by seeking to isolate Cuba by penalizing foreign
companies investing in and trading with the Caribbean country.

<HEADLINE> Special Team To Adjust China's Silk Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Lack of regulation has been the
catalyst for a drop in china's silk trade and a special
supervision team mandated by the State Council has now begun its
urgent work to remedy the situation.
</P>
<P>
Known as the State Cocoon, Silk and Satin Co-ordination Team,
the body is intended to exercise unified control over the whole
process from raising silk worms to selling silk garments abroad,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, China's silk exports dropped by
over 20 percent from the same period last year, while 80 percent
of enterprises in the sector are losing money and frustrated
cocoon-raisers have chopped down about 30 percent of the mulberry
trees they used to keep.
</P>
<P>
The silk trade is so important both for China and the world
that its rescue is imperative, the paper quoted Yi Hui, office
director of the team as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of silk supply and over 45 percent of the
world's silk clothes come from China, while more than 20 million
farming families and one million workers in China earn their
living from cocoon raising or silk processing, Yi said.
</P>
<P>
He described the three stages of the imminent campaign to
rescue the silk sector: reforming management, regrouping mills
with trading firms, and redirecting the sector's mode of growth.
</P>
<P>
With the ultimate goal of establishing a national group company
in charge of cocoon raising, silk processing and export, the
office will first endeavor to introduce overall control in major
cocoon-producing provinces and cities including Shandong, Anhui,
Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Sichuan and Chongqing, Yi elaborated.
</P>
<P>
He added policies will also be finalized in the fourth quarter
of this year to purge unqualified reeling and spinning mills,
which have used many quality cocoons to produce poor-quality silk
while a shortage of cocoons has forced established state-owned
mills to partially shut down.
</P>
<P>
High technology is also planned to give the sector a helping
hand, Yi said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers will be taught the world's latest ways of raising
cocoons, and enterprises will use high technology to improve
downstream silk processing, said the official.

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Market Continues to Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The domestic consumer market
will grow steadily in the second half of this year thanks to
increasing supply and purchasing power as a result of some major
reforms carried out earlier this year, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Some experts have predicted that total sales volume of consumer
commodities, a major reflection of the domestic market, will grow
10 percent for the whole year, based on the 13 percent growth rate
in the first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Market supply will be backed up strongly by increasing imports
and domestically made commodities, said an official with the
Ministry of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
China's tariff cut and removal on import licences and quota
limits will boost the import business, which in turn will help
control the price rises, he added.
</P>
<P>
Good harvest in farm products, a major inflationary force, and
growth in light industry will guarantee a sufficient market supply
for the coming months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The government also reformed the distribution systems of some
major farm products, setting up state and local reserves, to
stabilize the market.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Ministry of Internal Trade said supply and
demand of nearly 75 percent of commodities was balanced in the
first half of this year, up 7 percentage points from the 1995
figure.
</P>
<P>
Commodities in short supply decreased to 10 percent, while
oversupplied commodities accounted for 15 percent of the total,
compared with more than 18 percent of the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's interest rate cut earlier this year will
turn part of the personal savings into purchasing power, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Mountain Merapi Spews Hot Air Waves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Mountain Merapi, looming on the
central Java-Yogjakarta border, about 1,200 kilometers east of
Jakarta, has spewed hot air waves on 27 occasions from 2:17 p.m.
Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday, down the upper reaches of Boyong,
Bebeng and Krasak rivers.
</P>
<P>
The hot air streaks were accompanied by the flow of molten lava
as far as 3.5 kilometers, Antara news agency quoted the
Directorate of Volcanology in Yogjakarta as saying today.
</P>
<P>
This new threat has prompted the local volcanological
authorities to warn the people living close to the active volcano
to step up their alertness and prepare for evacuation.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Disaster Task Forces of Boyolali and
Magelang regencies said on Saturday they have prepared the
necessary means of evacuation.
</P>
<P>
The Merapi volcano is classified by volcanologists as an
"explosive" type, similar to the volcano which devastated the
Caribbean island of Martinique at the turn of century, and left
29,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
Merapi rises to a height of 2,962 meters. To the East it
overlooks the most famous Indonesian monument, the Buddhist temple
of Borobodur, and 30 kilometers to the South the university city
of Yogjakarta, where one million people live.
</P>
<P>
Around 50,000 people live in the immediate vicinity of the
volcano, one of 127 active volcanoes out of 500 catalogued in the
Indonesian archipelago.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Reports Sharp Rise in Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's foreign trade grew
dramatically in the first six months of the year to 12.19
billion U.S. dollars, the Statistics Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It stood at only 7.43 billion dollars in the first five months
of 1995, when the country was plunged into an economic crisis with
a significant GNP fall of more than 10 percent over the year
before.
</P>
<P>
In the six months, its exports registered 5.86 billion dollars
and imports 6.34 billion dollars, showing a deficit of 480.5
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Russia is by far the biggest trade partner of Ukraine, buying
more than one third of its exports and selling more than two
fifths of its imports in the period.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the second largest partner, chalked up only
5.4 percent of Ukraine's exports in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Kiev has trade links with about 150 countries and territories.
China, after Russia, the United States, Belarus and Germany, is
its fifth largest partner.

<HEADLINE> Mothers in Indonesia Urged to Stop Bottle-Feeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister of Women
Affairs Mrs. Mien Sugandhi called on all mothers in the country to
breast-feed their babies, saying that the practice of
bottle-feeding babies must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
"Let us not bring up our children with the bottle anymore," she
told transmigrant wives in Kotawaringing district, central
Kalimantan on Saturday, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
Sugandhi, speaking on the occasion of the International
Breast-Feeding Week, noted that many young mothers who had just
given birth were reluctant to breast-feed their newborn babies on
the pretext that they needed to keep their breasts in attractive
shape.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Indonesian Consumers Protection
Foundation (YLKI) said bottle-fed babies were twice more prone to
cancer than breast-fed ones.
</P>
<P>
Bottle-fed babies were also 14.2 percent more likely to die of
diarrhea than breast-fed ones, it said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of a study by Cambridge University's child
health department, the foundation said breast-fed children had IQs
8.3 points higher than those bottle-fed.

BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- A roundup on the front page says that China's financial
situation in the first half of this year was generally healthy
with revenue surpassing expenditure, but problems still exist, as
the growth of revenue slowed down, expenditure increased, tax
defaults were serious, and economic efficiency in enterprises
declined.
</P>
<P>
-- Northwest China's arid and poverty-stricken Gansu Province
benefited greatly from the rain water-collection project,
resulting in good grain harvest and helping tens of thousands of
rural families get out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- China's most advanced warship, missile destroyer 112, was
featured in a front-page story in the daily. The naval vessel was
a product that combines hundreds of most advanced technologies
from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
-- Technology is playing an increasingly important role
in the agricultural sector in East China's Zhejiang Province, with
tens of thousands of its farmers having been trained in
agricultural technologies.
</P>
<P>
 "China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- China is opposing new US regulations on the origin of
production of textiles and garments, and has requested the United
States to pay for losses incurred to Chinese exporters as a result
of the action.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Property Prices Falling In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The real estate market continued
to slump in the second quarter of this year in Shanghai, China's
biggest economic center, with property prices hitting an 18-month
low, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing-based China Real Estate Index System
Office (CREI), Shanghai sub-index stood at 900 in the April-June
period, 11 points lower than in the first three months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai index has been in continuous decline since the
first quarter of 1995, when it stood at 942 points.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted CREI analysts as saying that too many
properties had been built during the early 1990s, leading to an
overstocked market.
</P>
<P>
The government's anti-inflationary policy of tight credit
control has also prevented companies from buying property, they
added.
</P>
<P>
CREI's statistics show prices dived most sharply for luxury
office buildings and apartments aimed at overseas buyers, followed
by villas.
</P>
<P>
The fall in prices of residential properties for Chinese buyers
has slowed - and may even be beginning to rise in some
developments.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are pinning their hopes for a recovery on the Shanghai
municipal government's measures to boost the property sector,
especially measures which promote sales of flats to local people.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Shanghai's lethargic and still-falling market,
property prices in some big cities seem to have bottomed out, the
office said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Sub-index of CREI rose by six points to stand at
1090 in the second quarter of 1996. Indices for Dalian in Liaoning
Province and Shenzhen in Guangdong Province also rose.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 11 cities making up CREI's index posted slight
falls, except for Changzhou in Jiangsu Province, which remained
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Banana Growers Call for Government Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Growers in the major banana
exporting area of southern Costa Rica are calling for government
help after hurricane Cesar's hit the area in late July.
</P>
<P>
In a report recently submitted to President Jose Maria
Figueres, the growers said they are now unable to honor their
long-term commitments to the banks and instead need new money to
restart production.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains and floods in the area have lately destroyed
some 2,000 hectares of bananas, a loss of 240,000 boxes of the
fruit while the growers face high bank interest rates and
inefficient marketing systems, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Banana planting in the areas can usually bring about 3,000
direct and 12,000 indirect jobs.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica exported 290 million U.S. dollars of bananas in the
first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Government Official Chosen By Public Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A doctor of economic management
in south China's Hainan Province has been named director of the
provincial social security bureau after having been choen from
about 50 candidates.
</P>
<P>
The province, China's largest special economic zone, is taking
the lead in calling for applications for official positions in key
government posts.
</P>
<P>
The first provincial attempt of its kind was to find a director
to take charge of its social security bureau.
</P>
<P>
It is common practice for officials of government departments
to be appointed by higher ups.
</P>
<P>
Applications were accepted by May 27 of this year, and 50
people had been trying for the position, which finally went to
Wang Yipin, a 43-year-old doctor of economic management, who used
to be deputy mayor of Qionghai City, a well-known hometown of
overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is China's only province to develop an overall social
security system, covering pensions, job-related injuries,
unemployment, and medical care.
</P>
<P>
But the new system has been rather hard to adjust to the
interests of different social sectors.

<HEADLINE> Tax Fraud Case Leads to 18 Arrests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Police in northwest China's
Gansu Province have arrested 18 people involved in reselling blank
value-added tax receipts, which could cost the state 1.66 billion
yuan in tax losses.
</P>
<P>
In February of this year, police in Tianshui City got a tip on
two businessmen, Chen Qingguo and Duan Zhengguo, who were
suspected of reselling value-added tax receipts, and that they
were going to flee.
</P>
<P>
The police lost no time in searching the residence of the two,
where they found 120 books of receipt stubs, which had had a total
value of 9.77 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The two were from southern China's Guangdong Province. Between
June of last year and January this year, they managed to obtain a
certificate to purchase receipts for value-added tax using fake ID
cards, saying that they were running companies.
</P>
<P>
They then sold the receipts to people in Gansu, Guangdong,
Hunan and Jiangxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Others involved in the fraud case, including tax officials in
Tianshui City, have also been arrested.

MONTREAL, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of
Spain entered the final after beating Kimberly Po 6-0, 6-4 at the
950,000 U.S. dollar du Maurier Open tennis championships here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's final, Sanchez Vicario's will take on the winner of
another semifinal between the top-ranked Monica Seles and unseeded
Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
After her singles win, Sanchez Vicario and partner Larisa
Neiland of Latvia captured their berth in the doubles final with a
7-5, 6-2 victory over Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina and Brenda
Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Po, ranked 90th, was the first qualifer to reach the du Maurier
semifinals and matched her previous best performance, when she
made the semis at Philadelphia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Seles won the du Maurier last year in Toronto in her first
tournament following a 27-month layoff after being stabbed in the
back by a spectator during a match in Hamburg, Germany on April
30, 1993.
</P>
<P>
If she gets by Basuki, Seles would have her first match against
Sanchez Vicario since the return and it has the makings of a hotly
contested match.
</P>
<P>
Seles holds a 10-1 career edge over Sanchez Vicario, with a win
in their last match in the 1992 U.S. Open final. However, Sanchez
Vicario won in their previous meeting, the 1992 du Maurier final.

SARAJEVO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslims and Croats
traded attacks with sticks and stones near the central Bosnian
town of Maglaj today, with no casualties reported, according to
the local press.
</P>
<P>
The conflict erupted when Croats prevented a group of Muslims,
led by Bosnia's senior Muslim cleric, Rais-l-Ulema Mustafa Ceric,
from traveling to Novi Seher to celebrate a religious festival and
to visit grave sites.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Muslims retaliated by blocking the main highway
between Muslim-controlled Zenica and Croat-controlled Zepce,
obstructing the movement of Croats.
</P>
<P>
U.N. police and troops from the NATO-led Implementation Force
in Bosnia were rushed to the scene and NATO helicopters reportedly
flew over the area.

<HEADLINE> US Sets Deadline for New Muslim-Croat Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 10 (Xinhua) - A senior U.S. official said today
that Bosnian Muslims and Croats must complete a plan to strengthen
their shaky federation before next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
John Kornblum, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Europe,
made the appeal during his talks with Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman on the Adritic island of Brijuni, said a Croatian
presidential statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Kornblum was disappointed that
agreement failed to come out of the latest session of the
Muslim-Croat federation forum in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday session, which was attended by Kornblum as well as
senior Muslim and Croat officials, was aimed at thrashing out a
detailed plan to abolish Croats' mini-state "Herzeg-Bosnia," while
obliging a Muslim-led republic government to transfer certain
authority to the federation.
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted Kornblum as saying it was important that
documents on the federation be drawn up before U.S. secretary of
state Warren Christopher meets Balkan state leaders in Geneva on
August 14.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the Geneva meeting "was to confirm the decisiveness
of the United States for the elections to pass successfully and
for the authorities to be established after the elections,"
Kornblum was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Tudjman expressed Croatia's full
support for the implementation of the Washington and Dayton
agreements, especially the agreement on the Bosnian Federation so
that there would be equality between the federal partners of
Moslems and Croats.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman also briefed Kornblum on his latest meeting with
Serbian President Slobodan Milosvic, saying that Croatia was ready
for normalization of relations because "it was a prerequisite for
the creation of the new international order" in the Balkan region.

<HEADLINE> Election Date in Bosnia Not to Be Changed: OSCE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission in Bosnia Robert
Frowick said today the election date, scheduled for September 14,
will not be changed.
</P>
<P>
Frowick told the press in Sarajevo that all activities of the
OSCE, which is in charge of organizing Bosnia's elections, were
geared for that date, although the conditions for their holding
were far from ideal.
</P>
<P>
Over 500,000 refugees in 28 countries have so far registered as
voters, Frowick noted.
</P>
<P>
Three million Bosnian people may be eligible to vote, including
more than 800,000 residing abroad as refugees and another 850,000
displaced persons who remain in Bosnia but have been forced from
the place of their origin.
</P>
<P>
"The freedom of movement has not been ensured yet, but things
are moving in a good direction as 28,000 people crossed the line
of separation between the two entities in a single day," the
Tanjug news agency quoted him as saying in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the OSCE was wrong to allow the refugees to
exercise their right to choose where they will vote -- in their
old or new places of residence -- in line with the Dayton
agreement.
</P>
<P>
If that right was used for manipulation purposes by some
authorities, it is then a cause for concern, Frowick said in
reaction to reports that about 300,000 refugees had requested
voting in their present place of residence.
</P>
<P>
OSCE officials in Sarajevo have shown concern over the voter
registration fraud recently, criticizing nationalist parties in
Bosnia for using the voter registration process to coerce
displaced persons and refugees into voting in "strategic
municipalities."

<HEADLINE> Irregularities Exist in Registration of Voters: Rehn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Special U.N. rapporteur for
human rights in the former Yugoslavia Elisabeth Rehn said today
that there were irregularities in the registration of voters for
Bosnia's elections.
</P>
<P>
Rehn told the press in Sarajevo she had presented to the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe evidence on
the attempts of dominant political parties of all three sides in
Bosnia to manipulate the voters, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some acts of pressure during registration were a specific form
of ethnic cleansing, Rehn said, adding that voters were threatened
with loss of humanitarian aid unless they registered according to
instructions by local power holders.
</P>
<P>
The first post-war election scheduled for September 14 is
regarded by the international community as crucial for the future
reunification and reconciliation in the war-torn country after
three and half years of bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
"Enough time remains to resolve this problem," Rehn said. She
also advised voters who believe they were registered on wrong
lists to request re-registration.
</P>
<P>
In line with the election law, voters in Bosnia's elections
were offered a choice of registering either in their 1991 place of
residence, in their present place of residence or in places where
they wish to live in the future.
</P>
<P>
Rehn requested the police to investigate all reported cases of
pressure, harassment or irregularities during registration.
