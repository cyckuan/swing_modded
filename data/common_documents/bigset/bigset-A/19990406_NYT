   WASHINGTON _ The Agency for International Development has
established a toll-free telephone number and Internet site to
encourage charitable donations to private groups helping to feed
and shelter the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have streamed
out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Callers to the telephone number (1-800-USAID-RELIEF, or
1-800-872-4373) and visitors to the site (www.info.usaid.gov) are
provided with a list of charitable organizations working along
Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, the lead government organization in the humanitarian
aid effort for the refugees, is encouraging donors to offer money
to the groups, rather than collecting clothing or food.

EDITORIAL: RUSSIA'S ROLE IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 6:
</P>
<P>
   The road to peace in Kosovo may yet run through Moscow. Despite
Russia's rhetorical belligerence about the NATO air campaign and
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's failed diplomatic mission to
Belgrade last week, Russia has the credentials and motivation to
play a constructive role in ending the conflict. Doing so will
require some straight talking by the Russians to their Serbian
cousins, and a degree of cooperation with Washington that may be
awkward for the Kremlin, but Russia could greatly enhance its
international stature by brokering a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Slobodan Milosevic may think he has little reason to
consider a diplomatic solution, and he did not seriously entertain
one in his talks with Primakov. The Serbian assault on Kosovo has
driven a million ethnic Albanians from their homes, and NATO air
attacks have so far done little to impede the Serbian brutality in
Kosovo or diminish Milosevic's military forces.
</P>
<P>
   But this conflict, as President Clinton declared yesterday, must
not end with Kosovo permanently emptied of its citizens. With
improving weather and additional aircraft, NATO air power will
eventually begin to hobble the Serbian military and weaken
Milosevic's stranglehold on Kosovo. If Milosevic concludes that the
balance of power is shifting in NATO's favor, he will doubtless
start looking for a deal that allows him to remain in power. If
Clinton and NATO stick with their wise decision not to commit
troops to a potentially costly ground war in Kosovo, they too will
be looking for a negotiated resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Russia's longstanding friendship with Serbia,
Primakov is among the few world leaders who has the standing in
Belgrade to tell Milosevic he must end his subjugation of Kosovo,
withdraw all his forces and permit the repatriation of the ethnic
Albanians. Kosovo must also be granted at least the same degree of
political autonomy it enjoyed until 1989. All this would be easier
for Milosevic to accept if it were endorsed by the Russian
government, and came with a promise that Russian troops would
participate in an international peacekeeping force that would
assure the safe return of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow favored most of the elements of this plan before the NATO
air offensive commenced, and ought to overcome its resistance to
the peacekeeping force now that Serbia has demonstrated such
savagery in Kosovo. The NATO air strikes have stirred anti-Western
sentiment in Russia, limiting Primakov's latitude as he looks ahead
to parliamentary elections in December and a possible presidential
race next year. But both Primakov and his patron, President Boris
Yeltsin, well understand that Russia's long-term economic and
diplomatic interests are better served by working with the United
States and Europe rather than by cultivating Slobodan Milosevic.
The White House should be working behind the scenes to encourage a
constructive Russian role.

OFFICER CHARGED IN DIALLO SHOOTING IS CLEARED IN A '97 KILLING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn district attorney said Monday that one
of the police officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo in the
Bronx two months ago had acted properly when he fatally shot
another man in Brooklyn in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he was closing the investigation of Officer Kenneth
Boss' shooting of Patrick Bailey without presenting the case to a
grand jury, District Attorney Charles J. Hynes said that ``the
facts of this case demonstrate it was reasonable'' for Boss and
other officers at the scene ``to believe that Bailey posed an
imminent threat to them and to others.''
</P>
<P>
   This was so, Hynes said, because Bailey, who was 22 and was shot
in a hallway of his building in East New York, pointed a shotgun at
a civilian witness and the police.
</P>
<P>
   The shotgun turned out to be unloaded and inoperable, but those
facts ``could not have been known to the police officers'' in their
confrontation with Bailey in October 1997, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes' conclusions, after a long-delayed investigation, were
denounced by a spokesman for Bailey's family. The spokesman,
Charles Barron, a community organizer in Brooklyn, said the
prosecutor's decision not to present the case to a grand jury was a
``gross miscarriage of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To have District Attorney Hynes act as prosecutor, grand jury
and determinator is insane,'' Barron said. He said Hynes' report of
the investigation contained contradictions that Bailey's family _
whom Barron described as ``outraged'' _ would point out at a news
conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Boss' lawyer, Steven Brounstein, said Hynes' action ``was
expected, and we're pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All along we were aware that my client acted in a reasonable
manner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of Bailey took place on the night of Oct. 31, 1997,
when Boss was among four officers approached by a man who said
Bailey had menaced him with a shotgun during a dispute, according
to Hynes' report.
</P>
<P>
   When the officers went with the man to the front of Bailey's
building, they saw Bailey ``holding a shotgun in his hand'' and
followed him when he ran into the building, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the officers with Boss said they saw Bailey point the
26-inch sawed-off shotgun at the officers. The report quotes Boss
as saying that he fired three shots after he saw Bailey ``pausing
in the hallway of the house with the shotgun still in his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the shots struck and killed Bailey; the third missed.
</P>
<P>
   Boss and three other officers are charged with murder in the
death of Diallo, a 22-year-old unarmed immigrant who was killed in
the lobby of his building in early February.

SUBWAY DEATH MAY PUSH NEW YORK TO MANDATORY MEASURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-SUBWAY-ATTACK) 
(mk) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The case of a schizophrenic man who is accused of
pushing a woman to her death under a subway train in January has
generated new interest in proposals authorizing involuntary
treatment for mental patients in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The measures include one initiated by Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer, who took office immediately after the Jan. 3 incident in
which Kendra Webdale, 32, was pushed off a subway platform.
</P>
<P>
   On videotape and in written statements, Andrew Goldstein, 29,
confessed to having pushed Ms. Webdale. Goldstein told police that
a psychotic episode caused him to believe that a ``spirit or
ghost'' had entered his body and forced him to commit the act.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, Goldstein was
found competent to stand trial on a charge of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's proposal would enable relatives and doctors to compel
the mentally ill to receive treatment and medication. As state laws
stand now, involuntary treatment is largely limited to patients who
are considered a threat to themselves or others.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Connelly, an Assembly member from Staten Island, has
introduced a bill to extend and expand a five-year-old pilot
program at Bellevue Hospital Center for involuntary outpatient
treatment. The state Legislature is not likely to embrace changes
in the system fully during this session, lawmakers say. But there
is support for extending the Bellevue program.
</P>
<P>
   James Brennan, a Democrat from Brooklyn who is chairman of the
Assembly's Committee on Mental Health, said the Bellevue program
had not demonstrated that it was necessary now to authorize
statewide involuntary treatment for mental patients.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the Bellevue program did provide one important
lesson: that mentally ill patients, once released from hospitals,
would maintain their treatment regimen so long as they have support
services, like intensive case management and occasional home visits
by a nurse. ``So my position is that it should be incrementally
expanded to see if there is further value to it,'' he said. Brennan
said he has proposed legislation that in addition to extending the
Bellevue program by a few years would start similar programs at
four unspecified institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is also being carefully considered by Gov. George
Pataki. Chuck Deister, a spokesman for the governor, said the
administration was in the midst of drafting a proposal but offered
no details other than to say it was intended to provide a sound
approach to involuntary treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to change state laws is strongly supported by many
mental patients' families, who now are powerless to initiate
treatment for relatives too ill to recognize they need it. The
proposals are fiercely opposed by a small but vocal number who see
any enforced treatment as a violation of fundamental civil rights
and a regression to the thinking that fostered the insane asylums
of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the new measures invoke images of people like
Goldstein, who drifted from treatment to treatment until a ``ghost
or spirit or something like that,'' as police reported he said, led
him to push a total stranger to her death. In the parlance of
mental treatment, Goldstein was noncompliant: He did not stay on
his medication.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters include an unlikely combination of psychiatrists
who believe in the efficacy of new medications, and law-and-order
conservatives who want to get the mentally ill off the streets.
Their group also points to the large number of people with mental
disorders among prison inmates and the homeless, arguing that many
of them might be safer if they were compelled to take medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past 10 years, it's been firmly established that mental
disease is a neurobiological condition,'' said Carla Jacobs, a
director of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the largest
group advocating involuntary commitment. ``So we have to start
looking at mental illness like any other disorder. If I have a high
fever, people would take me to the hospital and give me medication
until I could continue or discontinue it on my own. But we don't do
that in mental illness. We put a special shroud on the ill, we
treat them like lepers, and we cloak inaction with false ideas of
human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponents invoke the images of the cruel asylums of the past
_ images that generated a powerful movement in the 1960s against
the enforced institutionalization of the mentally ill and emptied
many state institutions. Many also cite reports of patients who
suffered terrible side effects from medications, or were abused in
public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an assumption on the part of psychiatrists and the
mainstream and family members that if a person doesn't take
medication, they `decompensate,''' said Rosary Marinaro, mocking
the term used in psychiatric treatment to describe patients who
revert to unstable behavior. Miss Marinaro, a woman with
schizophrenia, has campaigned against the proposed laws, and is a
leader of the Coalition to Stop Outpatient Commitment
</P>
<P>
   ``There are alternatives,'' she said. ``But the alternatives
challenge the medical professions _ things like peer support,
peer-run services. I have chosen not to take medication. They told
me to take lithium. But my friend is dead, she went into renal
failure, she died last year. I choose. That's the point. I
choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1970s, 37 states have enacted widely varying laws
on involuntary treatment. But New York has remained without one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason people reacted against institutionalization of the
mentally ill in the 1960s was the realization that you want to be
compassionate,'' said Brian Stettin, the assistant attorney general
who drafted the law proposed by Spitzer. ``But it's a heck of lot
more compassionate to realize their need for treatment, rather than
the `freedom' to destroy themselves. What we're trying to find is a
common-sense happy medium.''

EDITORIAL: DELIVERING THE LOCKERBIE DEFENDANTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 6:
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's surrender of two Libyan intelligence agents brings
the long and frustrating search for justice in the Lockerbie case
near an acceptable end. It is more than 10 years since a bomb
concealed in luggage brought down Pan Am Flight 103 in Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing 270 people, and more than eight years since a
U.S. grand jury indicted the two men on charges of having
personally planted the explosive. They will now be tried in the
Netherlands under Scottish law, in a diplomatic compromise that
satisfies all essential American and British requirements.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. sanctions played a large part in forcing Col. Moammar
Gadhafi to yield the two suspects. So did the agreement last year
by Britain and the United States, after Libya urged that the men be
tried in a neutral country, to accept a trial in the Netherlands.
But Washington and London rightly insisted on the use of Scottish
law.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the compromise, Libya has gained provisional relief
from U.N. sanctions against Libyan air travel and imports of
industrial equipment, and from a partial freeze on Libyan assets
abroad. These will be fully lifted in 90 days if the U.N. secretary
general, Kofi Annan, can certify that Libya has agreed both to stop
sponsoring terrorism and to compensate the families of Lockerbie
victims if the two men are convicted. Separate American sanctions
against Libya remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Annan, with American approval, assured Gadhafi
that only the two suspects, not the Libyan government, would be put
on trial. In a literal sense, that is as it should be. But Annan's
assurance should not preclude questioning about who might have
ordered the suspects to carry out the bombing. There remain many
unanswered questions about the Lockerbie case, including whether
Syria or Iran may also have played a role. The trial should be used
to establish a fuller picture of this criminal enterprise than is
now available.

WILLIAM J. DE LANCY, 82; HEADED REPUBLIC STEEL
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ohio, Ill., Mich.)  (nk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William J. De Lancy, who ran the Republic Steel Corp. during
some of its toughest times, died from complications of Parkinson's
disease Friday at his home in Shaker Heights, Ohio, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Chicago in 1916, De Lancy earned both bachelor's and law
degrees from the University of Michigan. After graduation in 1940,
he was hired by the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore.
He served as a Naval intelligence officer on the aircraft carrier
Bennington in World War II, and returned to the firm after the war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, he joined Republic Steel in Cleveland as assistant
counsel. He rose through several positions including general
counsel, and became the company's president in 1973 and its chief
executive in 1974. He added the title of chairman in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Republic, then the fifth-largest steelmaker, suffered, as did
the entire steel industry, from heightened competition from more
efficient producers abroad at a time of weak demand induced by the
recession and high interest rates in the late 1970s and early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   By 1980, for example, the industry was operating at little more
than half of capacity, and shipped only 84 million tons of steel,
down from 100 million tons the year before. Steel industry
employment was at its lowest level since 1933.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, De Lancy became president of the industry's trade
group, the American Iron and Steel Institute, and he led a lobbying
effort aimed at strengthening the existing government restrictions
on imports of steel.
</P>
<P>
   The industry contended that European and Asian steelmakers were
``dumping'' steel in the United States; that is they were selling
the steel at artificially low prices, possibly for less than their
cost of production.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, De Lancy turned 65, and he retired both from Republic
and the steel institute.
</P>
<P>
   The company and industry continued to suffer. Steel production
hit a postwar low of 75 million tons in 1982, and production did
not return to 1980 levels until 1994. In 1984, Republic merged with
Jones &AMP; Laughlin Steel to form the LTV Corp.
</P>
<P>
   De Lancy is survived by his wife, the former Sally Roe, and his
children, Ann of Seattle and Mark of Chicago.

BUOYED BY STOCKS, FOUNDATIONS INCREASE THEIR GIVING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The nation's foundations, reaping the benefits of a
robust stock market, gave away a record amount of money last year,
according to a recent study.
</P>
<P>
   Foundations made an estimated $19.5 billion in grants in 1998 to
not-for-profit organizations, up from $16 billion in 1997,
according to the Foundation Center, a New York group that tracks
foundation giving.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, giving has climbed by about 41 percent,
resulting in an additional $5.6 billion in grants, according to
Foundation Center estimates. The center, which follows more than
44,000 grant-making foundations, based its 1998 estimates on survey
responses from about 1,000 foundations. The figures from 1997 and
earlier are based on all of the foundations' financial records.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in giving is largely a result of the huge growth in
the stock market over the last few years, which has fattened
foundation assets and made donors increasingly generous, according
to Sara Engelhardt, the president of the Foundation Center.
Foundation assets reached a record $329.9 billion in 1997, while
gifts and bequests from donors were at near-record levels of $15.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   While foundations have been criticized for not spending enough
of their money, they are starting to give away their new-found
gains, Ms. Engelhardt said. ``This is the money that is not just
being stockpiled,'' she said. ``This is money that is being turned
around to benefit society.''
</P>
<P>
   By law, most foundations must give away at least 5 percent of
their assets, and they are giving away slightly more than that, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest foundation is the Lilly Endowment, whose
assets have soared to $11.5 billion in 1997 from $6.8 billion in
1996 with the rising price of Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. stock. The
endowment's giving climbed to $254 million in 1997, an increase of
about half over the previous year. In 1998, its beneficiaries
included the United Negro College Fund, which received $41.7
million, and an assortment of private colleges in Indiana, which
received $90.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Community foundations, which give money at the local level, are
also ``gaining a lot of steam,'' Ms. Engelhardt said. In 1998, they
gave away about $1.5 billion, compared with $1 billion two years
ago. They, too, have benefited as donors have felt more generous
and have been able to pass on that largess. ``It is being spread
out to more communities,'' Ms. Engelhardt said.

MONDESI SAVES DAY FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ More than three months of anticipation collided
with the start of six months of expectations on a made-for-baseball
afternoon Monday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The impact produced a stirring opening day, and to everyone's
surprise, it had nothing to do with Kevin Brown or Randy Johnson.
Instead, it was Dodgers right fielder Raul Mondesi reminding
everyone just how talented he can be and how quickly he can change
a game.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi homered with two outs in the ninth inning to tie the
score, then smashed a two-run homer with two outs in the 11th to
give the Dodgers an 8-6 win against the Arizona Diamondbacks before
a sellout crowd of 53,109. Mondesi tied a career-high with six RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect us to win,'' Dodgers second baseman Eric Young
said. ``To come out and win in that fashion, it's a big thing for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   For a day, at least, the momentum the Dodgers began building
when they inked Devon White on the first day of the free-agent
signing period last November continued.
</P>
<P>
   They have Mondesi to thank for that. ``This is about as good a
game you're going to have on opening day,'' Dodgers first baseman
Eric Karros said. ``The hype, the expectations, the pitching
matchup _ it's about as good as opening day can be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks talked all spring about their own offseason
acquisitions and how they will contend for the NL West Division
crown. So much so that Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Arizona
was ``cocky'' about its chances.
</P>
<P>
   In rallying from a 6-2 deficit in the eighth inning, the Dodgers
landed the first blow of what could be many exchanges between the
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback began on Karros' RBI single in the eighth that made
it 6-3. It picked up steam an inning later when Jose Vizcaino led
off with an infield single and pinch-hitter Dave Hansen singled
with one out. That's when Diamondbacks closer Gregg Olson, who was
30 of 34 in save opportunities last season, was summoned.
</P>
<P>
   Though he struck out Gary Sheffield, Olson's inability to throw
strikes to Mondesi cost him the game. Awaiting to unload on a 3-0
fastball anywhere near the plate, Mondesi smashed the high pitch he
later called ball four into the Dodgers' bullpen to tie it at 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Manager Davey Johnson) gave me the green light, but I didn't
see the sign,'' said Mondesi, who was 4 for 5. ``If it was close, I
was going to try to hit it. Anything close to the zone, I was going
to take a swing. First game, we're losing by three runs, to hit a
home run, it's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later the excitement reached euphoria. Mondesi ended
the game when he drove John Frascatore's 1-0 fastball into the
left-field bleachers. Frascatore (0-1) took the loss; the Dodgers'
Jeff Shaw (1-0) pitched two perfect innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came back from the dead,'' Johnson said. ``Both (homers)
were crushed. I started shaking hands when he hit (the second one).
It's a great way to get out of the chute in front of a full
house.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also something the Dodgers needed. In the scope of a
162-game season, one game might not seem like a big deal. But with
the expectations placed on the Dodgers _ by themselves, the fans
and the media _ it was certainly a good way to begin their 41st
season in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since their $105 million free-agent signing, a.k.a.
Kevin Brown, was booed after giving up his third homer and being
yanked in the sixth inning. Brown allowed five runs _ on a pair of
solo homers by Bernard Gilkey and a three-run shot by Jay Bell _ on
10 hits in 52/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this team loses, it's really difficult because I didn't do
my job,'' Brown said. ``You never want to pitch bad, but it's a lot
easier to swallow if you come back and win.''

PALESTINIANS PLANNING TO OFFER BONDS ON EUROPEAN MARKETS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ The Palestinian Authority hopes to cover
part of a $150 million budget deficit this year by selling the
first Palestinian bonds, the authority's financial affairs chief
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the so-called sovereign debt markets would represent a
breakthrough for the Palestinian Authority, which has been unable
to raise money on the markets with its ambiguous status as a
semiautonomous territory controlled militarily by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The finance official, Mohammed al-Nashashibi, said the
Palestinian Authority expected to pay most of its bills with tax
revenue, including income from official import monopolies that had
gone unreported in previous budgets. Nashashibi spoke as he
submitted his 1999 budget to the legislative council here Monday.
But a projected 10 percent increase in tax revenue is not keeping
up with a 25 percent jump in the state payroll this year, and
foreign donors are no longer willing to bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Nashashibi said in an interview that governments, which he would
not name, were prepared to provide backing for Palestinian bonds,
which would be sold in European financial markets. He said he was
now negotiating the size and pricing of a bond issue with major
investment banks that are prepared to serve as underwriters. The
bonds, to be denominated in either dollars or euros, could be
issued as soon as June, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority's leader, Yasser Arafat, is expected
to postpone a long-discussed declaration of independence from May
4, which falls in the closing weeks of an unanticipated Israeli
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Routine expenses in the Palestinian region are met largely from
sales taxes and customs levies collected by Israel but passed on to
the Palestinian treasury under an agreement. But the authority,
with no uncontested claim on sovereign property or financial
assets, cannot provide collateral for a commercially viable bond
issue on its own.
</P>
<P>
   There is some precedent for securities from poor nations to be
backed by wealthier creditors, such as the Brady bonds from Brazil
and Mexico, which carried repayment guarantees from the U.S.
Treasury. But these were still bonds issued by independent states,
with their own national assets and formal standing in the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians face several hurdles to selling bonds,
including getting a credit rating and ironing out all the legal
complications of a bond issue. An emerging markets analyst in
London, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that if these
problems were overcome, it was possible there might be a group of
Middle Eastern investors interested in buying such an issue,
despite the risks involved.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Lebanon has sold small Eurobond issues at more
favorable interest rates than many Latin American countries because
there is a large number of Lebanese and other Middle East
expatriates willing to buy such debt securities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the way to a bond issue would presumably be eased
if the United States or other countries decided to offer
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian critics, echoed by overseers from Western aid
donors, have demanded a public accounting of hitherto-undisclosed
revenue from state agencies with exclusive rights to import and
distribute fuel, cement, tobacco and other goods. ``There is a
serious problem with fiscal transparency, or rather the lack of
it,'' said an expert with an international financial institution,
who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Nashashibi did not mention plans for a foreign bond issue in his
address to legislators, who have two weeks to review the budget
plan. Arafat has already approved the spending plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Arafat's supporters holding a solid majority on the
legislative council, approval is expected.

EDITORIAL: A STIFF AND PROPER SENTENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wyo.)  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, April 6:
</P>
<P>
   Russell Henderson's decision to plead guilty to the kidnapping
and murder of Matthew Shepard is little consolation to the Shepard
family, but it provides an appropriately severe sentence for one
whose apparent anti-gay hatred led him to destroy a young life. The
sentence of two consecutive life terms saves Henderson from the
possibility of the death penalty but makes it virtually certain he
will spend the rest of his life in prison. It is not yet clear
whether he will have to testify against Aaron McKinney, the
co-defendant who will be tried for capital murder this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jeffrey Donnell said in court Monday, as he dismissed the
defendant's weak apology, that ``The pain you have caused here,
Henderson, will never go away.'' Unfortunately, lawmakers in
Wyoming and in other states seem quite willing to forget what
happened. In the days and weeks after the murder, it seemed that
the nation would be awakened to the virulence of anti-gay beliefs
that partly propelled this murder. Matthew Shepard's youth, and the
horrific way he died _ tied to a fence, beaten and left to die in
the cold _ made many realize that homosexuals need protection from
the kinds of hate crimes that have caused other groups in this
nation's history to live in fear.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a very short time, the old prejudice that homosexuals are
not discriminated against and do not warrant ``special'' protection
has resurfaced in a backlash. The Wyoming Legislature this winter
killed an effort to pass the state's first hate-crimes bill. The
bill would have increased penalties for those convicted of crimes
motivated by bias. Anti-gay bias measures also died in other
mountain states. In an appallingly callous explanation of the
defeat, one Republican leader in the Wyoming Senate said, ``My
feeling right now is that the committee is tired of discussing bias
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that anti-gay violence accounted for more than
1,100 reported hate crimes in this country in 1997, according to
the latest FBI figures. Matthew Shepard is just one more grim
statistic. The conviction of one man and the trial of another for
his murder are appropriate responses to this criminal act. But
state and national officials must still show leadership in creating
laws that send an unmistakable message that such hatred will not be
tolerated in this society.

A MAZING FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CECILIA CHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ A four-acre plot of dirt will soon sprout a
maze of corn the likes of which the West Coast has never seen: two
miles of brain-teasing pathways designed to bring game-playing to a
new height.
</P>
<P>
   A former entertainment-industry producer knows that if he builds
it, they will come, as visitors have come to his Amazing Maize Maze
installations that have cropped up around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cross-generational,'' said Don Frantz, president and
creative director of The Amazing Maze Co., from his Manhattan
office. ``Kids treat it like a great video game, and seniors like
to walk through a cornfield like the one they grew up in.''
</P>
<P>
   Corny? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   But it is likely to be welcome in a county where agriculture is
still king.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like an intriguing, interesting and different,
unique type of environment,'' said Tony Prater, marketing manager
for Pacific Earth Resources Inc., which commissioned Frantz to
build the maze.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it will get people back to nature and (they will)
learn something about the farming community. ... It's actually an
interactive type of maze with various learning centers as you go
through it,'' Prater said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Earth Resources is a company based in the Ventura County
community of Camarillo northwest of Los Angeles, owned by the
Rogers family, whose ancestors started farming in the area a
century ago. The company will plant the corn and use a 10-acre
portion of its property for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Planting is scheduled for April 19. And by mid-May, there should
be about 100,000 stalks of corn as high as an elephant's eye _ or,
as Prater puts it, 6 feet to 8 feet tall at maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the handiwork will begin. The result won't be just a maze,
because from a bird's-eye view, the field will take the shape of a
California mission.
</P>
<P>
   When the maze opens June 26, the public will see what Frantz
said many describe as an interactive, three-dimensional puzzle to
be solved by players expected to pay $5 each for children 4 to 12
and $8 each for those 12 and older.
</P>
<P>
   As they wade through the stalks, participants will collect
puzzle pieces that will provide clues needed to navigate their way.
The fastest will finish in about 30 minutes, and the rest will take
about 1 1-2 (one-half) hours to find their way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will also have theatrical elements with scripts and maps,''
Frantz said. ``Music will sweep through the four acres with 40
speakers (mounted) throughout the maze.''
</P>
<P>
   Frantz, who grew up around farming and went on to produce
theater shows for Disney, created the idea of The Amazing Maize
Maze in 1993 in Pennsylvania. His idea became a 3.3-acre dinosaur
maze at Lebanon Valley College and garnered the distinction of
being identified in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's
largest maze ever built.
</P>
<P>
   ``This started out as a family get-together,'' he said. ``I
would do it on my vacation while working for the Disney company the
last eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, his company has completed 13 mazes from New
York to Iowa, including one depicting George Washington crossing
the Delaware River in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we found was a way to make a trip to the farm not
only accessible, but exciting,'' he said. ``It's a low-tech family
outing where everybody feels comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Frantz estimated it will take four days to create the maze in
Camarillo _ one day to design the landscape and three days to cut
the stalks by hand.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will have a clearer picture of the cost for the
project in May.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are to replant the field every year and etch a new art
design through the rows of corn, he said. The corn will be
harvested, but not for consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Corn is not a major crop in Ventura County, but some is grown
from spring through fall for sale at roadside stands and for
shipping to supermarket chains. The maize maze crop shouldn't have
trouble taking root, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County Agricultural Commissioner W. Earl McPhail is
intrigued by the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite interesting,'' said McPhail, who has read about the
mazes. ``I've never seen one, but it seems to be quite interesting,
and people seem to really like walking the maze. I hope it
succeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, critics told Frantz his maze was too large and that
people would die inside, but McPhail believes a corn maze would be
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone felt they were in trouble, they can walk through the
corn and back into the field,'' McPhail said. ``So I don't see it
as a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsors of the project are working with farm groups, such as
the California Foundation for Ag in the Classrooms, to develop
educational aspects, said Nancy Mayerson, a spokeswoman for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say a journey through the maze could teach a range of
skills _ from elements of logic and math for schoolchildren to
team-building for corporations as employees rely on each for clues
to get out.
</P>
<P>
   On the 10-acre site, six acres will be used for parking and
vendors. Charity organizations will be able to rent the maze for
fund-raising purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a lot of fun with friends and family and want to
know more about them,'' said Frantz, ``get them in a maze.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 6,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   If the 1998 season proved anything, it is that good baseball can
erase a lot of bad feelings. When the season began, the sport
seemed adrift, torn from its old moorings by too many labor
disputes, too many greedy owners, too many inflated salaries. Then
came the thrilling late-summer home run duel between Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa and the magisterial performance by the New York
Yankees, and all of a sudden baseball's disaffected fans came back.
</P>
<P>
   The new season that began in earnest Monday will not easily
replicate last year's heroics. Still, there are good young players
everywhere, a raft of slick-fielding shortstops and maybe a dozen
or so sluggers not named McGwire or Sosa capable of hitting 40 home
runs. For New Yorkers, there is at least a plausible chance of a
city series.
</P>
<P>
   If baseball has any problem that needs prompt attention, it is
the growing disparity between the rich and poor teams. Of the 13
teams with payrolls above $48 million last year, only one had a
losing record. Of the 17 teams below $48 million, only two had
winning records. Something is clearly amiss when the Los Angeles
Dodgers are paying one player, Kevin Brown, $15 million _ just
slightly less than the $17 million Montreal is paying its entire
team.
</P>
<P>
   The highest payroll, not surprisingly, belongs to the Yankees,
who are paying $85 million to a supremely talented group of players
who are early favorites to repeat as World Champions. The only
question mark surrounding the Yankees is whether their unflappable
manager, Joe Torre, can recuperate quickly enough from cancer
surgery to rescue the team from a nasty feud between the crusty
interim manager, Don Zimmer, and the volatile owner, George
Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, after a spring training game, Steinbrenner called
one of Zimmer's pitchers, Hideki Irabu, a ``fat toad,'' then
reversed himself and brazenly suggested that Irabu start the
Yankees' third game in Oakland Wednesday night. Zimmer exploded,
telling Steinbrenner to stop the ``double talk'' while insisting
that he would run the team the way he wanted to. Nobody could
remember anyone challenging Steinbrenner like that before.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner's meddling has distracted the Yankees before. The
rest of the league should hope that he keeps it up. The Yankees
must hope for Torre's early return.

MONDESI SENDS BALL FOUR A LONG WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the first home run, the one that tied the game,
the fastball was up around the chest, at best a marginal strike.
Which is right where Raul Mondesi likes it.
</P>
<P>
   On the second homer, the one that ended the game, the fastball
was on the inside corner, a pull-hitter's pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Which, as it happens, also is right where Raul Mondesi likes it.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, hell, ``I like anything,'' the right fielder admitted after
rescuing the Dodgers in an 8-6, 11-inning victory over the Arizona
Diamondbacks on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   That has long been the Mondesi story _ he's just a hitter who
can't say no.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers coaches have tried to train his eye for a pitch, to
teach this five-tool talent a little patience, but he has remained
a free swinger, theoretically to his detriment. In six major-league
seasons, Mondesi has drawn fewer walks (159) than Mark McGwire drew
last year alone (162).
</P>
<P>
   The team has lately seen progress. Mondesi did walk more
frequently this spring in Florida. And Monday afternoon he had
moments that suggested a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   In his very first plate appearance of the season, Mondesi worked
Randy Johnson to a full count, fouled off a pitch to stay alive,
then grounded an RBI single to left. In his third time up _
hallelujah! _ he walked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood there and made people throw strikes,'' Dodgers bench
coach Jim Tracy said later. ``If he does that, he's one of the most
dangerous hitters in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   So must it not be a trifle disconcerting to the club braintrust
to know that Mondesi hit the big home run of the game _ which could
be as big a home run as any Dodger hits all season _ on ball four?
</P>
<P>
   It was the ninth inning, two out, runners on first and second,
Dodgers down 6-3. Arizona closer Gregg Olson had just struck out
Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi took, took, took. A 3-0 count.
</P>
<P>
   In the dugout, manager Davey Johnson, the man Mondesi calls
``(begin ital)Jefe(end ital) (Chief),'' twice flashed the
swing-away sign to third-base coach Rick Dempsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then,'' Johnson recounted, ``I turned and said, `Watch
this bomb.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If Mondesi had taken the letter-high pitch, he probably could
have walked to first base, and maybe Devon White would have been
the hero. But Mondesi swung and clubbed the pitch into the
left-field bullpen. After trailing 6-2, the Dodgers had made it
6-6.
</P>
<P>
   Only later did Mondesi reveal that he hadn't seen Dempsey's
sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it (the pitch) was anything close, I was going to swing,''
said the 28-year-old Dominican, who hit 30 home runs each of the
past two seasons and went 4 for 5 with six RBI Monday. ``I was
looking for something to hit hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with two out and Sheffield on first in the 11th inning,
Mondesi yanked a 1-0 pitch from John Frascatore halfway up the
left-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi was greeted at home plate by everybody in a Dodgers
uniform. Nobody, presumably, was there to congratulate him on that
sixth-inning walk.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to belittle the Dodgers' effort to drum patience
into the 1994 National League Rookie of the Year. Look what
selective hitting did for the New York Yankees last year. More to
the point, perhaps, look what it did for Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   There are some in the Dodgers camp who believe if Mondesi does
finally take the advice to heart, it will be because of the example
set in '98 by Sosa, a fellow Dominican.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of similarities between the two players,'' Tracy
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, before Sosa's 66-homer season, asking which of the two
was the better ballplayer was a good way to start an argument in
the Dominican Republic. Of that subject, Mondesi has heard just
about enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to think about Sammy,'' he said. ``I have my job
to do. He has his job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And for most of the spring, Mondesi was plenty worried about
exactly what his job would be. Johnson _ (begin ital)El Jefe(end
ital) _ tried batting him third; but Mondesi's low on-base
percentage made such a spot so high in the order impractical. So
Johnson dropped him to fifth, with Sheffield third, Devon White
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi lobbied against fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Davey, `I want to hit third or fourth, because I want
to drive in runs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, before the Dodgers faced the St. Louis Cardinals in
an exhibition at Jupiter, Fla., Mondesi got the good word: cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   It just might work.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by opening day, he should be under strict orders: Swing
at nothing but strikes _ or, if you prefer, swing at anything
close. &QL;

DODGER FANS HAVE A BALL IN OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fidel Plascencia was tied up in court all day
Monday, fighting a traffic ticket. Victor Martinez flew up to Santa
Rosa in Northern California for a wedding. Karina LaFarga fell
gravely ill.
</P>
<P>
   At least their bosses thought so.
</P>
<P>
   All three were actually among tens of thousands of enthusiastic
Dodgers fans attending the sold-out opening game of the baseball
season at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta come up with your excuses ahead of time,'' said a
grinning Plascencia, of Whittier, 14 miles east of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of 53,109 fans in attendance, the Dodgers needed
no excuses. Although the expected pitching duel didn't develop
between superstars Kevin Brown and Randy Johnson, outfielder Raul
Mondesi's two-out, three-run homer in the ninth and two-run homer
in the 11th carried the Dodgers to a dramatic 8-6 victory over the
Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   For Plascencia and hundreds of other fans enjoying tailgate
parties in Lot 37 east of the stadium, getting to the game way
ahead of time was part of the fun.
</P>
<P>
   Year after year, Dodgers die-hards gather in Lot 37 to toss back
a few beers before the first game, munch on food, reminisce about
seasons past and talk about the team's pennant chances.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's tailgaters were eager to catch the beginning of a
season they hope will end with the Dodgers in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the year they are going to go all the way,'' said Pico
Rivera resident LaFarga, who wore a Dodgers shirt, as did many in
the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Salazar of San Gabriel, east of Los Angeles, said the
team owes a pennant to the fans this year, after several years of
less than optimal performance. ``They gotta be in the World Series
_ and they got a good chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While some truant workers had to lie to see the game, many
didn't, including Krista Ebrecht of neighboring Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   ``My supervisor wanted to come with me,'' she said, standing
near a group of friends playing cards around an ice chest. But her
boss was unable to come. ``Couldn't get the day off,'' Ebrecht said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   While signs in the stadium parking lots prohibit tailgate
parties, security officers cruising Lot 37 didn't enforce the
prohibition. But they did keep the partying within limits, which
annoyed some fans.
</P>
<P>
   Tailgate beer-drinking before games is an American tradition at
every other stadium, said longtime fan Ed Stone. ``Out here it's
all Perrier,'' he sneered.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they hid their beer bottles, fans still managed to cook
up a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Savory smoke drifted skyward from a truck's tailgate as Adonis
Belt of Azusa barbecued about 10 lobsters as well as marinated
chicken and beef for 20 to 30 friends from the San Gabriel Valley.
They cut the meat up into chunks and rolled it into tacos with
lettuce, tomato and avocado.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food is too expensive inside the stadium,'' groused Jaime
Quintero of Rowland Heights. ``They're trying to price us out of
the games.''
</P>
<P>
   David Moreno of Yorba Linda said since Fox bought the Dodgers,
the team has been looking for any and every way to make an extra
buck while forgetting the loyal fans. ``It's a business, but still
...,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other fans expressed dismay that the Dodgers signed opening-day
pitcher Kevin Brown to a major league record $105 million,
seven-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's worth that,'' said Steve Martinez of La Verne.
``However, that's the way things are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a plastic chair with another group, Victor Martinez
saw it differently, saying, ``As long as he can get the job done
...''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the job done for his friends meant no beer drinking _
cigar smoking only _ for Chuck Argelander of Glendora, who would be
driving home 13 other men in a friend's motor home. His
beer-chugging buddies said they forgave Argelander his rooting for
Arizona, as well as for the time after last year's first game of
the season when he sent about eight of his friends into the front
windshield when he braked suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck's the designated driver _ we gotta be tolerant,'' said
Ron Weyant of Alta Loma.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his unhappiness over food prices and stadium security
officers, Jaime Quintero ultimately was tolerant of the Dodgers _
remaining a fan even though his family was forced out of Chavez
Ravine to make way for Dodger Stadium. And he loves opening day, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can take our hill,'' said Quintero, ``but they can't take
our partying.''

DODGERS OPENING-DAY DIARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dodger opening day diary:
</P>
<P>
   11:30 a.m:
</P>
<P>
   I'm introduced to the new Dodgers manager, Davey Johnson, and he
tells me he and his wife are living in the hills above La Canada.
``The first thing I did when I started house-hunting in L.A. was
ask what were the busiest freeways,'' he confided. ``I was told the
busiest were the 5, the 10, the 101 and the 405. So I picked La
Canada, and it takes me only 15 minutes to get to Dodger Stadium on
the 134.''
</P>
<P>
   11:33:
</P>
<P>
   Another reporter walks in, and wonders if he can ask Johnson a
few questions. ``It's my policy to deal with the press while we are
out taking batting practice and even before that,'' says Johnson.
``But once I come back into the clubhouse, I gotta concentrate on
lineups and scouting reports.'' ``We used to talk to Tom Lasorda
almost up until the game started,'' someone said. ``I'm not as
smart as Lasorda,'' cracked Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   11:50:
</P>
<P>
   I run into my brand new pal, Kevin Malone now don't get mad,
Fred Claire and he admits to me that what I wrote several months
ago about Kevin Kennedy being his choice to be Dodgers manager
ahead of Davey Johnson was true. ``But I also wanted Felipe Alou,''
acknowledged the Dodgers general manager. As you might know, Alou
didn't want the Dodgers and Bob (Don't Call Me Rocky) Graziano, the
Dodgers president, didn't want Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Noon:
</P>
<P>
   Malone gives me a brief spiel on the glories of God, and how he
has been devoted to Him since 1979. The Dodgers are so different
now under Fox with World Wrestling Association music interspersed
with Nancy Bea Hefley's classic organ standards and the outfield
signage. But they also just might have a closer connection with
Somebody Up There because of the divine presence of the God-fearing
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   12:20:
</P>
<P>
   I chow down, but not exactly with ravenous delight. I've blown
five dollars on a lot of useless things in my life, but never on
food that was as nauseously bad as that chicken sandwich they were
serving in the pressbox Monday that, for sheer skimpiness and
putridness, is truly unrivaled in culinary history. How bad was it?
I would have a crisis of conscience feeding it to one of my
neighbors' dogs, much less a sportswriter.
</P>
<P>
   12:55:
</P>
<P>
   Someone purportedly named Randy Newman sings the National
Anthem. Alas, he sounds more like Kermit the Frog. The Randy Newman
I remember sang ``I Love L.A.'' with style and enthusiasm. This guy
impersonating Newman sounded as though he were auditioning for a
Godfather role on ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   1:05:
</P>
<P>
   The old left-hander, Vin Scully, throws out the ceremonial first
pitch. Eric Karros, standing with teammates along the third-base
line, charges out and intercepts Scully's toss halfway to home
plate. It's one of the nimblest defensive plays I've seen Karros,
not exactly Mr. Twinkle toes, make.
</P>
<P>
   1:14:
</P>
<P>
   Play ball!
</P>
<P>
   1:16:
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown falls behind 3-0 on Steve Finley, but gets his
former San Diego Padre teammate on a fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   1:21:
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young works Randy Johnson for a walk to become the first
Dodgers base runner of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   1:22:
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young promptly steals second base, putting him on a pace to
break Maury Wills' team record of 104.
</P>
<P>
   1:28:
</P>
<P>
   Two outs later, Raul Mondesi smokes a single to left to make it
1-0 and make Davey Johnson look like a genius batting Mondesi
cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   1:30:
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. Diamondbacks seriously threatening against the $105
Million Man after Luis Gonzalez doubles, Bernard Gilkey singles and
Tony Batista walks to fill the bases with one out.
</P>
<P>
   1:34:
</P>
<P>
   No problem for a sinkerball master like Brown, who induces a
double play grounder out of the Arizona catcher, Kelly Stinnett.
</P>
<P>
   1:41:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened to Tom Lasorda?'' the venerable pressbox
wise guy, Joe (The Big Nasty) McDonnell, cracks. Reportedly,
Lasorda was seen on the field before the game, but there was no
independent confirmation of such a sighting.
</P>
<P>
   1:47:
</P>
<P>
   Still another rare phenomenon. With two outs, Eric Karros steals
second against Johnson. And beats the throw easily! And you must
not forget I can out-run Karros. Rupert Murdoch can out-run Karros.
Why, that old codger Stu Nahan can out-run Karros!
</P>
<P>
   1:58:
</P>
<P>
   The $105 Million Man isn't exactly fooling the Diamondbacks.
After Jay Bell singles, Travis Lee rips a double that should score
Bell, but the team's super cautious third base coach, Brian
Butterfield, holds him up for reasons not discernible to the naked
eye. But Brown once again escapes a crisis by getting Gonzalez on a
groundout.
</P>
<P>
   2:00:
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young, who had walked, steals third base, putting him only
102 behind Wills. Gary Sheffield ends third inning Dodger threat by
grounding into double play.
</P>
<P>
   2:07:
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gilkey rips one into the left-field pavilion to tie up
matters in the top of the fourth. In three plus innings, the $105
Million Man already has been touched for five hits.
</P>
<P>
   2:19:
</P>
<P>
   Who said that Devon White is old and washed up and not worth all
those millions the Dodgers showered on him in the off-season? Not
Randy Johnson after White touches him for a fourth-inning homer to
make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   2:33:
</P>
<P>
   Brown is under duress once again with two base runners on for
the Diamondbacks, but once again gets Gonzalez this time on a popup
to catcher Todd Hundley to escape trouble.
</P>
<P>
   2:39:
</P>
<P>
   The first reverberating boos of the season are heard when
Johnson plunks Young. Alas, Young's drive to overtake Wills is
stymied momentarily when he's finally caught stealing by the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   2:43:
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey hits another one off Brown, who's not exactly bewildering
the mighty Diamondbacks, only in their second season of existence.
</P>
<P>
   2:47:
</P>
<P>
   First beach ball hits the field. It lands in rightfield.
</P>
<P>
   2:53:
</P>
<P>
   Brown is in trouble again and this is a recording. He's facing
the dangerous Jay Bell with two runners on base. How long can he
keep walking such a tightrope without falling off?
</P>
<P>
   2:57:
</P>
<P>
   Not long. Jay Bell sends a towering fly ball into the left-field
pavilion for his team's third home run against Brown, and the $5
Million Dollar Man is gone to his $3.8 million Beverly Hills
mansion, having given up 10 hits in 5fr 2/3 innings of forgettable
work. The score is 5-2 when the new Dodger stopper makes his
ignoble exit.
</P>
<P>
   3:04:
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield grounds into his second double play of the
afternoon. Obviously, Sheffield hits better playing in right field
instead of left, which he detests.
</P>
<P>
   3:23:
</P>
<P>
   Seventh-inning stretch time. Many in the crowd of 53,109 head
for the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   3:25:
</P>
<P>
   With the count 1-1 against Hundley, Randy Johnson suddenly calls
a timeout, and repairs to the dugout for a few minutes to have his
strained groin re-tapped. I can't recall a baseball game ever being
interrupted for such a reason.
</P>
<P>
   3:28:
</P>
<P>
   Natch, Johnson strikes out Hundley when play finally resumes.
It's the third time in the game that Hundley has gone down
swinging.
</P>
<P>
   And we were all worried about his arm.
</P>
<P>
   3:56:
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers catch a huge break. Randy Johnson is pulled after seven
innings. Johnson's relieved troops quickly pull to within three
(6-3) on Eric Karros' one-out single against Darren Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   4:00:
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? Todd Hundley strikes out yet another time. I'm
wondering if Todd's dad, Randy Hundley, has been up there doing the
swinging for him. One thing already is apparent Todd Hundley is no
Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   4:24:
</P>
<P>
   What a cleanup hitter Raul Mondesi is! His dramatic two-out,
three-run homer ties the game at 6, much to the delight of the
25,000 or so fans who are still in the stands and much to the
distress of those of us who've been pounding on computer keys for
more than four hours.
</P>
<P>
   4:30:
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Todd Hundley actually can put his bat on a
baseball. He loops a single into left field, to avoid striking out
for the fifth time.
</P>
<P>
   4:58:
</P>
<P>
   Please, Raul, do it again.
</P>
<P>
   4:59:
</P>
<P>
   He does! Raaaoooooooool!

NEW DODGERS, OLD DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 53,109 who came out to see what's new at Dodger Stadium on
Opening Day on Monday went home talking about what's old.
</P>
<P>
   There was Kevin Brown to see, the free agent pitcher the
Dodgers' signed in the offseason to a baseball-record $105 million
contract. He showed enough to warrant a second look at his pay
rate, Dodger management is counting on it but left in the sixth
inning after allowing his third home run.
</P>
<P>
   There was Todd Hundley, the latest replacement for Mike Piazza.
The catcher struck out swinging four times in five at-bats. That
was one more strikeout than gangly, 6-foot-10-inch Randy Johnson,
Arizona's free agent answer to Brown, who handles a bat as if it
has thorns. One Johnson swing sent the bat flying foul over third,
but that was one swing better than Hundley had in his first four
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   There was the new manager to see, Davey Johnson, who ran four
new relief pitchers to the mound after Brown, all of them
successful. There were the new murals of old Dodgers on the
outfield walls, strategically positioned to make the advertising
signage less noticeable. After the game, the song blaring in the
home locker room even had the refrain ``Change.''
</P>
<P>
   But at day's end, the fans were cheering one of the two lineup
regulars left over from days of yore, 1997. Raul Mondesi hit a
three-run home run with two outs in the ninth inning to tie the
game, then won it 8-6 with a two-run home run in the 11th inning.
</P>
<P>
   With Piazza the new Cover Boy for the Mets (a smoldering GQ
shot, presumably leading to many insightful articles in the New
Yorker) and Tommy Lasorda shoved so far in the background that you
can't even hear him (now that's deep background), (set ital) new
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   has become the operative word Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   subu UF7 Old school
</P>
<P>
   So Mondesi's home run heroism was a pleasant reminder that new
doesn't necessarily mean improved, and that old isn't necessarily
bad.
</P>
<P>
   His game-tying home run in the ninth came on a 3-0 pitch. As any
regular fan of the Dodgers know, Mondesi has never been on speaking
terms with the base on balls. He has averaged one every five games
in his career. He was the Dodger least likely to leave the bat on
his shoulder in such a situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to wonder what (Arizona reliever Greg Olson) was
thinking,'' said first baseman Eric Karros, the other leftover.
``How many times have you seen Mondy take a walk? I think everyone
in the park except Olson knew he was swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good pitch to swing on,'' said Mondesi. ``In that
situation, 3-0, two outs, it was my only chance to hit a home run
(in that at-bat). I was looking for the kind of pitch I could hit
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even amid this nostalgia, there were new interpretations.
Mondesi has been so impatient and aggressive in the past that
managers like Lasorda and Bill Russell often forced him to take a
3-0 pitch, fearful he'd swing at any pitch in the same ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson does not agree with this strategy. Having grown up
learning baseball from Hall of Fame manager Earl Weaver, whose
favorite strategy was the three-run homer, Johnson has instructed
his power hitters Mondesi, Karros, Gary Sheffield to be selectively
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flashed the swing sign twice to (third-base coach Rick)
Dempsey so he'd be sure to see it,'' said Johnson. ``And I told
someone in the dugout `watch this bomb.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mondy said he didn't even look at Dempsey, he was swinging if it
was anywhere close. ``If they gave it (the hit sign) to me, I
didn't see it,'' he said. Whatever. Olson's pitch was a high
fastball, and Mondesi crushed it into the back of the Dodgers'
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   subu UF7 Come from behind
</P>
<P>
   The other point is that the Dodgers rallied from a 6-2 deficit,
the kind of deficit which has dogged them the last few years (as in
rolling over like a dog). Whether it was Johnson giving Mondy the
hit sign or Mondy's own initiative, the Dodger rally was, well,
new.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Johnson) is the type of manager who will not take the bat out
of your hands,'' said Karros, who had an important RBI single in
the eighth. ``He's offensive-minded. And Mondy's an aggressive
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Karros cautioned everyone to take a deep breath and
remember that there are 161 games left in the season. To go with
any hype that one rally is a trend would also force one to say the
Dodgers misspent on Brown.
</P>
<P>
   subu UF7 Not all bad
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' new ace had his moments in his debut, working his
way out of bases-loaded jams in the second and third innings. He
was an out away from working out of another in the sixth when Jay
Bell hit a wind-aided fly ball just over Duke Snider's picture on
the outfield mural for a three-run home run.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Brown allowed just eight home runs in 257 innings.
Bernard Gilkey's two solo home runs impressed Brown more than
Bell's. ``I made a couple of bad pitches to Bernard,'' Brown said.
``I didn't think (Bell's) was a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the few boos that met his departure bothered him, Brown
said he would have booed himself. Beyond that, there was no insight
to be learned. ``The pitches weren't winding up in the (catcher's)
glove as much as I wanted them to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown isn't very tolerant of the deeply meaningful, wide-angle
question, those that try to wrap heavy fiscal pressure around a
couple of fast balls that stayed up on opening day. Frankly,
everyone, those asking and those answering, are a bit tired of
them.
</P>
<P>
   From diversity to global expansion to Iron John-type of manly
reflection on the essence teamwork and The Dodger Way, the Dodgers
have spent way too much time on the shrink couch the last few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Better that the effort speaks for itself. ``I've had bad days
before,'' Brown said, ``and I'll probably have another down the
line.'' The Dodgers didn't sign Brown for his quotability. They
signed him because he's mean on the mound and he wins.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years removed from their last World Series, that may be
all anyone cares about around Dodger Stadium. That goes for new
players and old players, new manager and old manager, old fan who
hates the rock music between innings or new fan who has no idea who
Duke Snider is.

RANGERS TOP FLYERS, 5-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The New York Rangers are not out of the playoff
picture, not just yet. They eluded elimination on Monday night with
a 5-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers, who were playing
without several star players and in front of one shaky goalie.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got goals from Kevin Stevens, Chris Tamer, Mathieu
Schneider, Adam Graves and Brian Leetch against Ron Hextall, who
backs up John Vanbiesbrouck and sometimes plays poorly against the
Rangers. The victory, breaking a two-game losing streak, left the
Rangers at 32-35-10, good for ninth place in the Eastern Conference
of the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   With 74 points and 5 games remaining in the regular season, the
Rangers trail both Boston and Buffalo by 9 points in the race for
the last two playoff berths in the East. Those two teams are tied
for seventh. Because the Rangers could finish with a maximum of 84
points, one more defeat would eliminate them, as would one more
victory by both the Bruins and the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to win every game,'' said Stevens, who
opened the scoring in the opening minute with his 23rd goal of the
season. ``We hope some teams help us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Mikael Renberg ruined Mike Richter's shutout bid
with a power-play goal at 12 minutes 55 seconds of the third
period. Richter stopped the other 36 Flyer shots.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky of the Rangers got two assists but was knocked
down hard by a big check into the boards from Luke Richardson late
in the game. Gretzky was not available for comment afterward, but
John Rosasco, a team spokesman, said Gretzky felt soreness near the
protruding disk in his neck that caused him to miss 12 games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries and missing players were a big theme on Monday night.
Petr Nedved of the Rangers missed his second consecutive game with
a strained rib cage muscle. Nedved's injury came against the New
York Islanders last Monday, one game after Eric Lindros and other
Flyers had worked him over with several hard hits before Lindros
cut Nedved with a high stick and earned a two-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   After serving his suspension, Lindros returned for only one game
and sustained a collapsed lung that has left him in a Nashville
hospital since Friday. Lindros might be released on Wednesday, the
Flyers said, but he is out for the rest of the regular season, and
the playoffs are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Also missing for the Flyers was Mark Recchi, a forward who
played one game after returning from post-concussion syndrome. He
was out with a headache, the Flyers said. Eric Desjardins, their
top defenseman, was out with a left knee sprain. John LeClair, left
wing on the Lindros line, was out with a sore back.
</P>
<P>
   John Muckler, the Ranger coach, seemed irked when someone
suggested the Rangers had taken advantage of Philadelphia's
injuries. ``Our best player wasn't in the lineup,'' he said,
referring to Nedved. ``Their best player wasn't in the lineup,'' he
said, referring to Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Dorshimer of the Flyers' staff said on Monday that he
had spoken by telephone with both Lindros and the doctor in
Nashville who is treating him. Lindros slept about five hours
Sunday night, Dorshimer said, and his pain is ``well controlled''
with medication. Although Lindros became ill in his hotel room
after the game in Nashville, it was unclear what caused the injury
or when it occurred. Dorshimer said Lindros may have had a broken
rib that went undetected and caused the bleeding in the chest
cavity that led to the collapse of the lung.
</P>
<P>
   ``His blood count continued to remain stable,'' Dorshimer said
in Monday's medical update, ``telling us any active bleeding is no
longer present.'' Lindros still has a tube in his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they were capitalizing on the Flyer injuries or not, the
Rangers held a 2-0 lead after one period on two fluke goals, the
first by Stevens, the second by Tamer. Stevens scored with a
backhander from the right-wing corner at the 32-second mark after a
poor clear by Hextall, who could not get back to his line in time
to set up properly.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous appearance here, Stevens scored over the
shoulder of Vanbiesbrouck with a deflected blooper that the goalie
did not see until he fished it out of the net. ``I've had some
beauties here,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers made it 2-0 at 4:27 on Tamer's first goal of the
season, a long backhander from the center red line that Hextall
touched with the catching glove on his left hand but failed to
stop. ``I flipped it up in the air and got a little lucky,'' Tamer
said. ``Ten years from now, I'll embellish the story a little bit.
They're all pretty, as long as you get to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   New York made it 3-0 at 10:14 of the second when Schneider
converted a rebound of a Gretzky shot. Graves made it 4-0 at 15:07
on the power play with his 37th goal of the season, most on the
team, off a rebound of Leetch's shot. Leetch scored his 11th, on
the power play at 16:18 of the third, his second goal in two games
after not scoring in the previous 23.

IN L.A., GORE ASSAILS HEAD OF YUGOSLAVIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore brought his presidential
campaign to California on Monday, offering strong words for
Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and sympathy to Albanians and
the East Los Angeles family of POW Andy Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's 10th visit to the state as a presidential candidate also
found him announcing with Gov. Gray Davis that waivers will free up
$129 million in federal money to reduce high school math and
English class sizes in California.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the crisis in Kosovo that drew most of Gore's
attention during a day where he met with a dozen reporters in
round-table discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to imagine in the closing years of the 20th century
that we would see this level of misery and evil,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy (Milosevic) cannot begin to imagine what we will do
to destroy his dictatorship. These crimes against humanity cannot
be allowed to stand. We will make sure they aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the Clinton Administration has no plans to send ground
troops into the troubled region that has been beset by hundreds of
thousands of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Gore met Monday with Albanian-Americans to offer assurances the
United States is doing all it can to provide relief and is
committed to making sure the refugees are allowed to return to
their homes once the war is concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Gore talked with the family of Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez
in East Los Angeles. Gore said he wanted to protect the family's
privacy and would not disclose any details other than to say the
government is doing all it can to ensure his safety and that of two
other POWs and seek their early return.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also mixed in some presidential politics
during his visit with a $1,000-a-person fund-raiser at the Beverly
Hills Hotel on Monday night prior to similar events scheduled today
in the Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore fended off a question regarding criticism of him for
continuing to raise money for his campaign during the Kosovo
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am out here meeting with people, talking to reporters, to
discuss our goals in Kosovo and explain why this is so important,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore picked up the endorsement of Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Los
Angeles, who said: ``The vice president has led California into the
good times. More importantly, during the rough times, he has been
at our side.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged the importance of an endorsement from Becerra
and his effort to reach into the Latino community _ particularly
with the possible opposition of Republican Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, who has strong support from Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking into Spanish for various phrases, Gore said he believes
he will be able to keep Latino voters in the Democratic Party based
on the administration's efforts to improve the economy and steer
money to Latino entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who joined Gore at an event at Hamilton High School, said
the waivers announced by Gore will allow California more leeway in
determining where and how to reduce 10th-grade class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am frankly amazed at people who say we should eliminate the
Department of Education or that the federal government has no role
in education,'' Gore said. ``I believe that we should not have a
top-down approach with the federal government telling states how to
spend their money. You should have the leeway to decide how it is
best spent.''

IMMIGRATION SERVICE BLOCKS JUDGE'S ORDER TO RELEASE A PALESTINIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Palestinian man who federal officials have been trying to
deport for the past year was ordered released by an immigration
judge who said the government had failed to prove that he had any
links to terrorist organizations, the authorities said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But before the man, Hany Kiareldeen, could be freed from a New
Jersey jail on $1,500 bond, immigration authorities appealed the
decision on Friday and blocked his release.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his yearlong detention, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service has maintained that Kiareldeen associated
with those convicted of bombing the World Trade Center in Manhattan
and that he had once threatened to assassinate Attorney General
Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen's lawyers said that his ex-wife, Amal Mohamed, was
the source of the allegations, which they said are baseless. They
said that Mrs. Mohamed was bitter over the couple's divorce and
motivated by vengeance. The authorities have refused to disclose
details of the accusations, citing national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, an immigration judge ruled that Kiareldeen was not a
national security risk and ordered his release. Calling the
evidence ``meager,'' the judge, Daniel Meisner, said that the
government had failed to prove any links between Kiareldeen and the
terrorists behind the Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, the judge cited a recent immigration hearing in
which federal officials failed to present a single witness. During
the hearing, Dr. Laurie Mylorie, an expert on the bombing,
testified for the defendant, saying that Kiareldeen's telephone
records did not link him to any of the four defendants convicted in
the Trade Center attack.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Gaza, Kiareldeen, 31, came to the United States in
1990 to study mechanical engineering. He was arrested in March
1998, one of two dozen people of Arab descent who are being
detained largely on the basis of secret information from
unidentified informers. His lawyer, Houeida Saad, said she would
file a motion on Tuesday to expedite his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that they haven't presented any evidence, we don't
understand why the INS won't back off,'' she said. ``This man has
been needlessly incarcerated for a year in what is essentially a
family law matter.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the immigration service, Russ Bergeron, said the
agency would continue to press for Kiareldeen's deportation. ``We
believe the judge erred in his interpretation of the law,'' he
said.

SHAQ PUTS IT ON THE LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Shaquille O'Neal has no illusions about the state of
his free-throw shooting and understands why his coach is concerned
about opponents sending him to the foul line in the fourth quarter
of a tight game. But he wants badly to overcome both his deficiency
and his coach's worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like the chance to prove myself,'' O'Neal said Monday.
``I've been in that situation before, and I've knocked 'em down. If
I miss a shot and we lose, I'll take the blame. And I'll come back
and try to do better the next game. But I'd like to be put in that
position.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an issue because O'Neal, a career 53.5 percent shooter from
the line (53.9 percent this season), has been left on the bench
twice recently down the stretch of close games _ against Sacramento
on March 26 and Friday at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   After the Phoenix game, coach Kurt Rambis said he pulled O'Neal
partly for defensive purposes but also because he feared the Suns
would try to send O'Neal to the line. O'Neal openly questioned the
decision, saying, ``it shows what type of confidence people have in
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two chatted afterward and cleared the air, and the next
day Rambis said he had changed his mind _ O'Neal would play down
the stretch from now on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine, he's fine. I know where he's coming from, he knows
where I'm coming from,'' Rambis said. ``I've got no problems
talking to my ballplayers. They know they have the freedom to speak
their mind with me. We'll work through any differences or
difficulties we might have....
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be in the game. He's the star of this ballclub,''
Rambis said. ``We're not gonna go anywhere without him. He's gotta
step up and deliver. And I have to put him in that environment
where he feels secure that he can and will deliver.... He knows he
has a challenge in front of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis believes O'Neal is ``capable of being between 65 and 70''
percent from the line. O'Neal says he's working on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to shoot 70 percent. But... one game, I just
want to be down by one, shoot 'em both and make 'em, flip the crowd
off, get a tech (technical foul) and go into overtime,'' he said,
then added on a more serious note, ``I realize I have to step that
part of my game up, and I will.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for Rambis' decisions, O'Neal said, ``Whatever he decides
to do, I'm always going to be behind it. In any relationship you're
going to have arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcements: In an anticipated move, the Lakers activated
rookie point guard Tyronn Lue from the injured list Monday. The
transaction bolsters a thin backcourt _ only three guards were on
the active roster _ and provides an instant infusion of quickness
from the speedy Lue.
</P>
<P>
   To make room, the Lakers placed forward Travis Knight on the
injured list with a sudden onset of left Achilles tendinitis. The
Lakers are overloaded with big men, and Knight hadn't played in
four of the last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Lue had been on the injured list since Feb. 19 because of a
lower back strain.

BURNED RUSSIAN BOY GOES THROUGH FIRST SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The composure Denis Nefedova showed in previous
days melted away before dawn Monday, as the hour neared for the
first in a yearlong series of operations on his burned skin.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year-old Russian boy was sobbing as he shuffled into the
operating room at the Grossman Burn Center in suburban Sherman
Oaks. Denis suffered severe scarring in a household accident last
year, when a gasoline explosion disfigured his face and hands.
</P>
<P>
   Draped in a bedsheet and small blanket Monday, he called for his
mother while Dr. A. Richard Grossman held his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything will be all right,'' his mother told him. ``If you
don't want to, we won't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the boy said he was scared, said he wanted his mother,
the pleas coming out in sorrowful hiccups. A few minutes later he
was unconscious on the operating table, and Grossman was cutting
away a flap of scar tissue from his right cheek about the size of a
slice of bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was much easier than I thought it was going to be,''
Grossman told the boy's mother after the operation. Tears in her
eyes, Janna Nefedova thanked him.
</P>
<P>
   Denis was alone at his family home on Sakhalin Island, just
north of Japan, when a candle he lit tipped over and ignited fumes
from gasoline being stored in the apartment. The blast engulfed his
head and hands, and the scar tissue that grew from his burns
constricted his face and left his hands gnarled.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Pomo, a North Hollywood physician volunteering on
Sakhalin Island, heard about Denis' case and contacted his longtime
colleague, Grossman, the renowned burn specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman is donating his services, and the Children's Burn
Foundation of Sherman Oaks is contributing $50,000 to cover other
expenses related to his treatment. Armed with a newfound hope,
Denis and his mother came to America two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She spent probably a good nine months to a year trying to get
him some help in Russia,'' said Diane Barackman, Pomo's sister and
a surgical technology director at Concorde Career Institute in
North Hollywood. ``She was pretty much hopeless he was going to be
like that forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Grossman assured her the treatment and expertise available
in the United States will surpass the best Russian doctors could
do. Monday's surgery at the burn center began a series of a dozen
or more operations on his seared face and hands that will take
about a year.
</P>
<P>
   During the 90-minute operation, Grossman stitched cadaver skin
onto the boy's exposed cheek, to serve as a natural bandage and
stimulate new cell growth.
</P>
<P>
   In his next procedure, Thursday morning, Grossman will take skin
from the boy's thigh and graft it onto his cheek, then cover the
exposed thigh with a thin layer of skin from the other side of his
thigh. In about six weeks, if the work on his right cheek is
successful, doctors will repeat the procedure on his left side.
Reconstruction of his hands and nose will come in the following
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he's going to get better,'' said Nefedova. ``He's not
scared of the surgeon. He's scared of the anesthesia and the
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Barackman added, ``He's just been through so much. He just
figures this is going to be more pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said removing the scar tissue on the boy's cheek and
around his mouth will return flexibility to his face, and enable
him to eat more normally. Denis could barely fit a spoon in his
mouth before.
</P>
<P>
   In the recovery room, he lurched upright and complained of the
pain in his face when he awoke from the anesthesia. He called again
for his mother and she clucked her tongue to soothe him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like a snowman,'' Grossman said of the large bandage
cradling Denis' head. A moment later, after the translation,
Nefedova smiled.
</P>
<P>
   In her dreams, she said she sees her son's face restored, with
only small scars on his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's dreaming all the time he'll have a normal face,'' said
volunteer translator Tamara Sokoloff, a retired nurse from Culver
City. ``She hopes that's how it's going to be. She's hoping for the
best.''

MAGIC BEAT CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-CELTICS-MAGIC-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Rick Pitino stood against a wall Monday night
and smiled. He said he loved the way the Celtics played against the
Magic. If his team continues to play as it did at Orlando Arena,
the coach predicted, several wins will emerge from the 18 games
left on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Since we have told you that, you naturally want to know how the
Celtics beat the Magic. You want to know the key stretch that
enabled them to defeat the top team in the Eastern Conference. Did
they hold Penny Hardaway scoreless again? And how did the 17,248
people in the building react to losing to a team without its
starting point guard?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Celtics didn't actually win. They lost their 22d game
of the season, 106-99. The last time they played the Magic, Feb.
24, they pounded them at the FleetCenter. It was a win that had
fans talking playoffs. Not now.
</P>
<P>
   This loss pushes them even closer to the NBA's unwanted May
vacation spot, Secaucus, N.J., and the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   But with the way the Celtics were talking Monday night, that
won't happen. Why? Because, they say, they're going to win a lot if
they keep playing like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with as much heart as I've seen all season long,''
Pitino said. ``I loved the way we played. I loved the style. I
loved the ferociousness of both teams. I liked the fact that it was
a high-pitch game. If we can get after it like that all the time,
we'll be good.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the ``if'' that has the Celtics scarcely floating above
the basement of the Atlantic Division. Pitino certainly had reason
to be pleased with the play of Ron Mercer, who had 29 points, 7
assists, and 6 steals. ``That's the player I want to see,'' the
coach said. He also got a strong game from Paul Pierce (23 points
and 6 rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   Magic players said the big lineup the Celtics started _ in the
absence of Kenny Anderson _ surprised them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they got out to that big lead,'' Horace Grant said,
referring to a 12-point Boston advantage in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise wore off in the second quarter, when the Magic made
68 percent of their field goals. You might be telling yourself that
no one makes 68 percent of their shots, even when they are standing
alone in gyms shooting 15-footers. You're right. The Magic were no
exception. They mixed dunks and layups with open 3-pointers by
6-foot-1-inch guard Darrell Armstrong. That led to a 60-49 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few years ago that Armstrong played in the United
States Basketball League and the Spanish League. Now he is the
leading candidate for the NBA's Most Improved Player award after a
19-point second quarter and a career-high tying 28 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love his game,'' Mercer said.
</P>
<P>
   And Hardaway? The last time he saw the Celtics, he spent most of
his time sitting on the bench with ice packs on his knees. He
didn't score a point and said afterward that he couldn't seem to
find any fire against them. He sat for only six minutes Monday
night and produced 24 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Pitino see that he liked so much?
</P>
<P>
   You can start with the way the team handled not having Anderson.
The plan was for Antoine Walker to be a ``point forward,'' bringing
the ball up most of the time with relief off the bench from Dana
Barros. But Walker got into foul trouble, picking up three
first-half fouls and getting a technical. He was whistled for his
fourth barely three minutes into the third and the Celtics were
quickly down by 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see what a great job my teammates did during that
time?'' Walker said. ``I was out of the game for, like, nine
minutes and they did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   What they did was slice a 14-point deficit to 5, 79-74, entering
the fourth quarter. Mercer had 10 points in the quarter. That gave
the Celtics a chance in the final 12 minutes. Barros was passing
well (nine assists) and Walker had come back in to help the Celtics
go up, 86-83, with 8:40 left.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the best the Celtics could do. Hardaway made a
20-footer, Armstrong made a three and Grant put in a layup. A
3-point lead had become a 5-point deficit in 90 seconds. It was
obvious another loss was coming. Later, the only consolation would
be that they played well.

writing grew out of the pieces of clay that Sumerian accountants
had used to keep track of livestock and stores of grain. Scholars
assembled also conceded that they had no definitive answer to the
question of whether writing was invented only once and spread

LAKERS WITHSTAND VAN EXEL EXCELLENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Nick Van Exel and Lakers turmoil seem always to go
hand-in-hand, even with the feisty point guard playing in Nuggets
gear and even though the coach he feuded with has also been removed
from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   So it was only natural that Van Exel arrived in Los Angeles with
the Lakers still reeling from their abomination against Golden
State, wading ankle-deep in self-doubt, and Nick the Quick aiming
to stick another pin in their sinking raft.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum not-so-faithful almost seemed to root for it. Van Exel
was greeted with warm cheers and a ``We Miss U Nick'' sign, while
the Lakers were again doused with a round of boos in a raggedy
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Nick and turmoil, turmoil and Nick.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Exel couldn't single-handedly continue the Lakers'
misery, though he tried his darndest. Just shy of a triple-double,
Van Exel scored a career-high 41 points, but the Lakers withstood
the onslaught behind Kobe Bryant's 26-point effort in a 117-104
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel had already embarrassed his ex-mates once this season,
leading a Nuggets overtime victory in late February that helped
hasten the dismissal of his nemesis, coach Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   A sequel seemed to be in the works, as Van Exel got loose for 18
points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he admitted, it was ``weird'' to be in the visiting locker
room for the first time, but he seemed perfectly comfortable on the
court, adding seven assists and five rebounds in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The always-direct Van Exel was equally comfortable diagnosing
the Lakers' illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the pieces to win and keep winning. I think a lot of
it has to do with individual things,'' he said. ``They need to put
individual things aside and just everybody accept their roles....
Until they realize that, they're gonna have nights where they
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   And struggle they did in another blase first quarter, falling to
a 36-29 deficit. Shaquille O'Neal picked up two fouls in the first
five minutes and the Nuggets shot 63.2 percent in the opening
period.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers rallied behind Glen Rice, who rediscovered his
touch in a 20-point, 8-for-12 first half, leading the Lakers to a
62-60 advantage at the intermission. Rice and Bryant both snapped
out of recent shooting slumps. Rice finished with 26 points on
9-of-19 shooting, and Bryant hit 8 of 12 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel, meanwhile, showed no signs of the sore left knee that
caused him to sit out most of Sunday night's game against the
Clippers. Or was he just resting up for his big return to the
Forum?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a little bit,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets, winless in 17 road games this season and 24 in a
row dating back to last year, weren't necessarily a barometer of
the Lakers' progress, but after losing to the Warriors two days
earlier, all coach Kurt Rambis wanted was a solid victory.
</P>
<P>
   No one game, however, will turn around the Lakers' fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it happens in one game,'' Rambis said. ``It's a
team involvement, it's an evolution that a team has to go through.
There's gonna be huge bumps in the road, there's peaks, there's
valleys, and once you go through that rough period, then you're
looking at some consistency of play from everybody at both ends of
the court. The light's not on in one game, and that's it _ it just
doesn't happen that way.''

BRUINS BEAT CANADIENS 
</HEADLINE>
 HKN-BRUINS-CANADIENS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was something he'd never had happen to him. He'd heard it in
other rinks, in other years, but for other players. For the first
time Monday night, the fans were chanting his name, over and over
in the third period as the seconds ticked away.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe was so moved and so excited that with
14.7 seconds remaining, he fired the puck into the FleetCenter
stands and received a penalty for delay of game. It was Boston's
first and only penalty of the game, but it didn't hurt as Dafoe
smothered the Montreal Canadiens, 3-0, to earn his league-leading
10th shutout of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty touched,'' said Dafoe. ``In all my years of
playing hockey, whether it be the minors or whatever, I've never
had a whole building saying my name at once. It got me so jazzed up
that when I got the puck I wanted to fire it down and I fired it
into the stands. It's really special. The fans, that was
unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, winning is the bottom line. The shutouts are great
but the wins are more important. To get my 10th . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had more than two or three in my entire life in a
season. I credit the guys in front of me. I didn't get a lot of
tough shots but they played so well in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, who was making his 20th straight start, is the first
Bruins goalie to post 10 shutouts since Frank Brimsek in 1938-39.
It was the second time Dafoe has posted consecutive shutouts this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, who had 25 saves in earning victory No. 29, has a shutout
streak of 160 minutes 11 seconds. The last goal he gave up was
Thursday in Montreal to Brian Savage at 19:49 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe doesn't expect to receive much consideration for the
Vezina Trophy, much the way he was overlooked at All-Star time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost the same as the All-Star thing,'' said Dafoe. ``If
I get a chance to win it, that's even better. But just the fact
that people mention my name around, that's good enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much went right for the fading Canadiens, and for the
Bruins, nothing seemed to go wrong. The loss to Boston, coupled
with a Buffalo victory, eliminated the Canadiens from making it to
the postseason. Boston finished the season series with a 4-0-1
record against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe received a lot of help from his teammates Monday night.
Sergei Samsonov, who has scored decisive goals in the past two
games, tallied the only offense Boston would need at 15:08 of the
first period during a power play.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Ray Bourque started the action with a shot from the
point that caromed off a couple of sticks. Center Joe Thornton took
a whack at it and Samsonov was there to bang in the rebound for his
24th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Boston added two more. Don Sweeney set up the
score perfectly with a pass to Rob DiMaio in the slot. DiMaio, who
missed the last game because of a forearm injury suffered in
warmups, fired a wrister over the glove of goalie Frederic Chabot
for his sixth of the year at 6:17.
</P>
<P>
   Carter made it a three-goal cushion with his 18th of the year at
15:43 as Boston converted on a three-on-two. Center Jason Allison
dished the puck from the right side to Carter in the slot. Carter
one-timed a shot past Chabot to the stick side.
</P>
<P>
   The Habs had chances, especially early in the period. Center
Saku Koivu had a good one with a backhand shot about three minutes
in. But after Dafoe made the initial save and the rebound sat
there, Bourque cleared it before any Hab could get to it. During
that same shift, Bourque delivered three punishing hits to Koivu,
knocking him to the ice. When Koivu went to the bench, he slammed
the door and banged his stick in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some of the Montreal media picked us to finish dead
last in our division and not make the playoffs,'' said Burns. ``So
obviously it backfired in their face a little bit. That probably
makes me happy more than anything else.''

TOUGH TIMES FOR PREKI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems so long ago, but it has been just a year since the U.S.
faced Yugoslavia in the first round of the 1998 World Cup in
France.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more pleasant stories of that tournament centered
around U.S. midfielder Preki Radosavljevic. His father -- still
living in Belgrade, where Radosavljevic was born -- was profiled in
an ABC interview featuring the pair before the U.S.-Yugsolavia
match.
</P>
<P>
   Radosavljevic, once a member of the Yugoslavian Army, arrived in
the U.S. in 1985 and recently received his U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Radosavljevic, known simply as Preki to those who saw him dazzle
fans with his fancy footwork for the MLS Kansas City franchise, is
constantly checking the internet these days and keeping a close eye
on his television set as NATO bombs continue to fall on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of Preki's friends and MLS teammates, Refik
Sabanadzovic, is a Muslim who also was born in Belgrade. He has
family and friends who live in the Yugoslavian province of
Montenegro, which borders Kosovo to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Preki, a Serb, has family in the Serbian capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   If these two were still at home, there's a good chance they
would be bitter enemies. In their current situation, they are left
to pray for their families while B-2 Bombers are launched daily
from Whitman Air Force Base, just a short drive from where they
train in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preki is a Serb, I am a Muslim,'' Sabanadzovic told
Cybersoccer. ``It's not a problem between us.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time Preki or Refik (as he's commonly known) get a
chance to take their minds off their families is while they're
training or playing. Other than that, life is difficult these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been following the situation very closely and I'm on the
internet all day,'' said Preki, constantly worrying about his
parents and sister. ``It's always on my mind. When I come to
practice it somewhat slips away, but as soon as you mention it, I
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Refik, who played for Red Star Belgrade during the 1980s, was a
member of Yugoslavia's 1990 World Cup team. He had the tough task
of marking Argentina's Diego Maradona during the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Refik tells of horror stories when he calls home to check on his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``After every game I call my family to ask if everything is
okay,'' said Refik. ``Many people are leaving Yugoslavia. They have
no money, no food. It is difficult for kids. Many kids are getting
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the civil wars, Refik said he had friendships throughout
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends from Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia ... before (the
civil wars) it was never a problem,'' Refik said. ``I played for
Red Star Belgrade in the 80's for four years. Now it is a problem
after the change of leadership from Tito to president-for-life
Slobodan Milosevic. It changed the people. We all used to have the
same passport. Now there are five or six passports.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo region, despite its large Ethnic Albanian and Muslim
population, holds a strong significance for the Serbs. Any talk of
autonomy for the Kosovo region prompts strong feelings from Preki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, that's always been ours, so why should we give
that up?'' Preki said. ``We are allowing terrorists to basically
take a part of the country away, and this whole country (USA) is
supporting that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine if Miami wanted to become part of Cuba? What
would the U.S. government say about that? The bombing is not going
to help. Serbia will never give up that part of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the last thing Preki and Refik are worried about is
Kansas City's 0-3 start. The team is yet to score a goal this
season -- but that is certainly understandable under the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rose Bowl loses the Galaxy as a tenant, don't blame the
Los Angeles franchise for leaving town. Under the direction of new
owner Philip F. Anschutz, the Galaxy spent $500,000 to build a
weight room and new offices and rebuild the locker room -- all
luxuries the Rose Bowl will keep should the Galaxy leave.
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz was also willing to spend $300,000 to build a new
practice facility in a parking lot on the Rose Bowl grounds.
Apparently, the Rose Bowl wanted the Galaxy to spend an additional
$250,000 to replace parking stalls lost for UCLA football. The
practice site would have been used for youth soccer tournaments and
teams participating in the Rose Bowl as well as local high schools.

 ON BASEBALL: McGUIRE LOOKS AHEAD 
 (sw) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The cheers for him rock the stadium. It is opening
day of the baseball season here, and there is always a full house
for this event, but this one is special. Because of him, because of
what he has done. And on Monday night in Mark McGwire's first time
at bat this season, he received a standing ovation from the 47,806
fans, with flashbulbs sparkling in a drizzle, and the fans remained
standing as he walked on a 3-2 pitch from the Milwaukee left-hander
Rafael Roque. Then they booed the pitcher for his, to them, lack of
fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire struck out in the third inning, but all was back to
normal in the fifth when he parked one off David Weathers into the
right-center-field seats _ his first home run of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Between seasons, McGwire had been as much in demand as if he had
discovered some great medical cure. He was ushered in to kiss the
pope's ring when the holy father visited here over the winter. He
even got a cameo on a television sit-com. He is rich, he is famous,
he is adored. One might imagine that he needs a psychiatrist like a
hole in the head. Not true. He sees one regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone does'' need one, he said before the game. ``Just some
people don't want to admit it. Everyone has problems _ maybe not
problems, but issues.''
</P>
<P>
   To the question _ the most asked question in sports at this
moment _ ``Can you top last year?'' McGwire has a reply, one that
presumably grew out of therapy. ``That's living in the past, it's
what's been done,'' he said. ``Last year means nothing. You have to
turn the page.'' It is a way of relieving whatever psychological
burdens one may place on oneself.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, 35, is huge _ 6 feet 5inches, 250 pounds, 17{-inch
biceps. He is our Atlas, our Tarzan, our Captain Marvel, our Sultan
of Swat. He is the guy who did the unthinkable, bashing 70 home
runs for the Cardinals last season _ breaking Roger Maris'
sanctified record by nine homers, beating Babe Ruth's by a big, fat
10.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look in awe at Mac in batting practice,'' said the veteran
outfielder Darren Bragg, who joined the Cardinals as a free agent
from Boston this spring. ``We're all men, but he's five or six
levels beyond the rest of us. When we try to hit a homer, we try to
hit it over the fence. When he tries to hit a homer, he tries to
hit it out of the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his conventional flyouts _ his last two at-bats on Monday
night were just those in the Cards' 10-8 loss _ are towering.
</P>
<P>
   But appearances, and statistics, can be deceiving. In a society
in which some still perceive it a weakness of some kind to seek
help or support mentally, McGwire has been up front about visiting
a psychiatrist. ``I've been seeing somebody since November of
'91,'' he said. He looks at a visitor directly, no pretense in his
blue eyes, an easy smile glimpsed within his red goatee.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1991, McGwire was not on top of the world. In
fact, he felt as if he was sinking deep into it. In his fifth full
season in the big leagues, with Oakland, he had batted .201 and had
fallen to 22 homers, well down from his league-leading 49 as a
rookie. His marriage was falling apart, and he was separated from
his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt I needed help then,'' he said, ``and I felt I
couldn't get out of this by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The next season McGwire improved to a .268 batting average and
42 homers. Then he suffered debilitating injuries and got down
again. ``I thought about giving up baseball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire talked with his psychiatrist and eventually decided not
to leave baseball.
</P>
<P>
   His physical health improved and so, apparently, did his mental
health. ``His concentration and intensity grew stronger,'' said
Tony LaRussa, the Cardinal manager who also managed McGwire in
Oakland. ``I watch him in the dugout as he gets ready to go to the
on-deck circle. He's focusing, he's grinding. He seems oblivious to
anything else that's going on. You can actually see the power of
his mind rippling.''
</P>
<P>
   And what issues, as McGwire termed them, might be bothering him
at other times? Personal ones, he says, ``like everybody else.''
Business? Family? Pressure? ``Sure,'' he said. He has said that if
he doesn't hit 70 homers this season ``some people will say I
failed.'' He won't, he said. To hit 50 or more, that's his goal.
</P>
<P>
   He says he can handle whatever pressures might develop. ``My
mind is too strong _ nothing is going to get in my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he continue to see a psychiatrist? McGwire nodded. ``The
day you stop learning,'' he said, ``is the day you're six feet
under.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKS PLAY AGAINST 125 ALL SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It's nice to be king.
</P>
<P>
   While baseball's underclass trudges hopelessly in small
television markets, the Yankees and a few select franchises
actually have aspirations for this new season.
</P>
<P>
   The soft underbelly of baseball has to answer questions like:
``Do you think you'll open the upper deck at all this season?'' and
``Will you sell your best player in June or July?''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, on the other hand, have to deal with the weighty
issue of whether they can win 125 games all over again this season.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the youthful general manager, has said he hopes
Roger Clemens will take the Yankees to ``the next level.'' One
could only fear what the next level might entail, but Cashman
explained it all before Clemens opened the season here on Monday
night against the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won't win them all, after Clemens pitched
satisfactorily but the bullpen lost the game, 5-3. Clemens threw
107 pitches before and after a 47-minute rain delay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year is history,'' Cashman said. ``We won the 1998 World
Series, but this is 1999. We hope Roger can take us to the next
level this year, which is winning this year's Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yankees ask the world not to be obsessed with the
number 125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it takes,'' said Don Zimmer, who was still the
interim manager despite having issued a transcontinental bark at
George Steinbrenner last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer just wanted to preside over a few victories before his
pal Joe Torre comes back from cancer surgery and takes over the
terrible burden of managing for Mr. Mood Swing.
</P>
<P>
   There were flashbacks for Zimmer of just how crazy it can get
for Yankee managers. Last year the Yankees won only one of their
first five games on their opening West Coast swing, and the
tabloids were already listing Torre's replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't lose four out of five on the West Coast this time,''
Zimmer predicted. ``We only play three games.''
</P>
<P>
   This is true. By some quirk in the schedule, the Yankees play
three games in Oakland before heading home. Plus, they had the
strapping Clemens, who sought the pressure by lusting after the
Yankees, after being one of their major enemies of this generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're either a hero or a dog,'' Clemens said, ``but you can't
come back the next day and get two hits. You have to wait. I don't
know if you can ever expect 125 again. If 95 wins is the ticket, so
be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five victories will not win a World Series, not in this
triple-tiered playoff era, but the Yankees are not asking Clemens
to carry them to any specific total.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep hearing the Yankees are a cinch,'' Zimmer said
Sunday. ``There is no such thing. We're just trying to go out and
win the Eastern Division. That's our first goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good bunch of guys last year. The way Joe handled
three left fielders was great. You know if you have three guys all
wanting to play, something's going to get said, sooner or later,
but with Joe, it never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Yankees had five left fielders _ Darryl
Strawberry, Tim Raines, Ricky Ledee, Chad Curtis and Shane Spencer,
in no particular order. They got to play more because Chili Davis
missed most of the season at designated hitter, but Torre still
defused any potential squawking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is Joe; you wouldn't have to write all these stories if
Joe were here,'' Zimmer added, referring to the delightful
man-bites-Boss stories over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good team, it will win a lot of games,'' Zimmer
said. ``I don't project championships. That's not me. We did
something last year that was never done before, but nobody is going
to give you anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, it's not the same ball club. Everybody says, `Well,
you traded David Wells for Roger Clemens,' but have you looked at
our roster? This is not the same ball club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how many times last year we were in a tie game in
the eighth inning and we sent Homer Bush in to run and we said,
`Homer, steal second base?' Homer Bush helped us win a lot of
games. Tim Raines is still a professional hitter. Straw used to
pinch-hit for Girardi and hit home runs. Last year we had two
left-handers in the bullpen, this year we have one. Andy Pettitte
is on the disabled list. We're still a good ball club, but we're
not the same one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Wells and Graeme Lloyd are in Toronto. Raines is with
these very Athletics. Pettitte and Strawberry are recuperating.
Doesn't matter. The Yankees will be measured against 125 victories.
Such a problem.  &QL;

LAKERS WITHSTAND VAN EXEL'S BIG NIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Nick Van Exel and Lakers turmoil go together like
Bill and Monica _ even with the feisty point guard playing in
Nuggets gear and even though the coach he feuded with was impeached
several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   So it was only natural that Van Exel arrived in Los Angeles with
the Lakers reeling from their abomination against Golden State,
wading ankle-deep in self-doubt, and Nick the Quick aiming to stick
another pin in their sinking raft.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum not-so-faithful almost seemed to root for it. Van Exel
was greeted with warm cheers and a ``We Miss U Nick'' sign. The
Lakers were again doused with a round of boos in a raggedy first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Nick and turmoil, turmoil and Nick.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Exel couldn't single-handedly prolong the Lakers'
misery, though he tried his darndest. Just shy of a triple-double,
Van Exel scored a career-high 41 points, but the Lakers rode
resurgent shooting from Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice to take a 117-104
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel had already embarrassed his ex-mates once this season,
leading a Nuggets overtime victory in late February that helped
hasten the dismissal of his nemesis, coach Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   A sequel seemed to be in the works when Van Exel got loose for
18 points in the first half and the foul-stricken Shaquille O'Neal
sat on the bench. But Rice kept the Lakers alive, scoring 20 of his
season-high 26 points in the first half, and Bryant finished it off
by scoring 20 of his 26 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel had to pack up his turmoil and go home with the
Nuggets' 0-17 road record, and 24th consecutive road loss, dating
back to last season. Any trash talking or message sending would be
moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get a win. What message can you send when
you've won 10 games and haven't won on the road all year?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So leave the barbs to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he always played like that,'' O'Neal said, ``he would still
be here.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers were willing to give up a career game to Van Exel
so long as they contained everyone else. Dennis Rodman, between
grabbing 17 rebounds, helped hold Antonio McDyess to 11 points on
4-of-14 shooting. And after a big first half, Chauncey Billups was
held to 15.
</P>
<P>
   As for Van Exel's replacements, the Dereks did their job _
Harper and Fisher combined for 17 points and 16 assists. The team's
33 assists were a season high, the eight turnovers a season low.
</P>
<P>
   And Van Exel's inspired performance, not at all unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he definitely enjoyed coming back,'' Fisher said.
``Nick, he thrives off of people not liking him or the odds being
against him. Tonight, it was him and the Nuggets against the
world.... He wanted to come out and put on a show.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the game, the fans had turned against Van Exel
again and in favor of the guys still wearing purple and gold,
alternately chanting for Rodman and especially Bryant, who saved
the Lakers from another Van Exel burst.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel's running jumper closed the gap to four points early in
the fourth, then Bryant got hot, scoring 17 points _ including 4 of
4 3-pointers _ in the final 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, for one, wasn't getting carried away with the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't pat ourselves on the back, because it is a bad team
we played tonight,'' he said.

AUDACIOUS MARINERS ASK FANS FOR PATIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball's opening night is all about freshness, renewal,
spring, all that giddy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But six rookies on the Mariner pitching staff? That's beyond
newness. That's an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward, dean of big-league GMs, says he doesn't think
he's ever opened a Mariner season with a half-dozen greenie
pitchers. Lou Piniella says he's never managed such a collection.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what was trotted out Monday through the fireworks
smoke at the Kingdome, on the day that the Public Facilities
District announced yet another leap in cost, to $517 million, of
the most expensive ballpark in U.S. history, and on the heels of
news the Mariners, because of the new park, had the steepest
one-year ticket price hike in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Audacious, these Mariners. If the team plays with half the guts
of management, the American League West race will be over by the
Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have put their money into stadiums and the starting
eight, leaving the exchequer empty for pitchers much beyond high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to be patient with the pitchers,''
Piniella said. ``We have to live with them and grow with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this was from a guy who last summer set a major league
record for cap kicking (distance as well as attempts).
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the capacity of his manager to handle the
assignment, Woodward stifled a quick smile and drew serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou and Stan (Williams, pitching coach) know they have a
teaching job to do,'' he said. ``I have complete confidence in them
to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had discussions and meetings on this topic. We let
everyone know we put our money into the starting lineup and we have
to work with young pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   How all these meetings will work out when one of the rooks walks
the bases full remains to be seen. Personally, I wouldn't want to
be Piniella's cap that day, but maybe Williams is under orders to
lock Piniella in the wine cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the first of the prodigies, Brett Hinchliffe, was
trotted out after starter Jeff Fassero put the Mariners in a 6-2
hole. Hinchliffe gave up two more runs, and the Mariners lost to
the Chicago White Sox 8-2. But hey, look at it this way _ it wasn't
the fault of the kids.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the preposterous preponderance of youth may not
last. Veteran relief pitcher Mark Leiter will return from the
disabled list soon, and Ken Cloude will be brought up from AAA
Tacoma once he finds his misplaced pitching brains.
</P>
<P>
   It also must be said that in Hinchliffe, Freddy Garcia, John
Halama, Jose Paniagua, Eric Weaver and Mac Suzuki, the Mariners
have a group with talent somewhat above the expansion line.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, let Ken Griffey Jr., something of an authority on
pitching, say it: ``These guys can throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, who was prevented from going after expensive, veteran
pitching this winter by ownership's insistence on making a profit
in 1999, said the Mariners have, apparently by luck as well as
skill, stumbled upon a handful of helpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the rookies we run out there will play in the major
leagues,'' he said firmly. ``From the standpoint of talent, I'm not
worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part you don't know about is how they'll respond by
pitching in the big leagues, on the road, things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The best news about this group is that none of them is Bobby
Ayala, traded Saturday to Montreal. Once our Canadian neighbors
multiply his ERA by the exchange rate, expect thousands of
Quebecois to storm over the U.S. border seeking revenge.
</P>
<P>
   But that's OK. Better to let them pillage some village in
upstate New York than have Ayala sent out to protect a 7-2 Mariner
lead in the Kingdome. Casualties will be fewer.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable thing about the young pitchers is that five of
them are in the bullpen, which has no one from last season's
debacle who pitched more than 25 innings. So none carry the
emotional scars of being booed merely for crossing their legs, a
visceral response by Mariner fans fearful of any movement along the
bullpen bench.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella said he made no requests of Woodward this spring to get
more veteran help, saying he's fully prepared to accept the hand
he's dealt, particularly since the key man in the pen, closer Jose
Mesa, is 32 and tougher than a sawdust candy bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is no surprise,'' he said. ``We started this
transition with the Randy Johnson trade, so we knew where we were
heading. Mesa is unequivocally the leader. He won't shy away from
the task.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward insisted that his volatile field boss, burned by the
charges he can't handle young pitchers, is capable of throttling
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou's a performance guy,'' he said. ``If you play well, he's
great to play for. But he knows this season will require
patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience.
</P>
<P>
   There's that word again. At one time there was a Mariner owner
who was condemned for the phrase, ``Patience is for losers.'' Now
it's the franchise watchword.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-billion dollar park funded mostly by the public, which
will also pay a hefty daily tab at the gate, the request is for
patience.
</P>
<P>
   As was said, an audacious enterprise, these Mariners.

MARINERS START OUT FLAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE -- When the all-time home run king throws out the first
pitch, long balls might be in the forecast.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was Monday night as the Mariners and Chicago White Sox
met in the last Kingdome opener. Ken Griffey Jr., the man Hank
Aaron thinks is most capable of breaking his record of 755 home
runs, dutifully delivered, crushing a James Baldwin pitch over the
scoreboard in right-center field to give the Mariners a lead in the
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't last long, because this home run derby was open to
all. Darrin Jackson and Paul Konerko slammed two-run homers off M's
starter Jeff Fassero, leading the White Sox to a 8-2 victory before
51,656.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was around the plate all night long, locating where I wanted
it except on maybe four or five pitches,'' said Fassero, who
allowed six runs on eight hits and a walk in six innings. ``Only
one of them hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the homer by Jackson, off a forkball Fassero left up in
the strike zone. Mechanically, he said he felt fine, altering his
delivery so he picked up the catcher's target immediately instead
of during the windup, which had caused him to tilt his front
shoulder and lose control in two rough spring outings.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart Monday night, Baldwin, was effective in escaping
trouble. He allowed solo homers to Griffey and second baseman
Carlos Guillen in the third, but left Mariners in scoring position
in four of his six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's homer was the seventh of his career on opening day, a
total reached only by Hall of Famers Frank Robinson (the
record-holder, with eight), Eddie Mathews, Willie Mays, Babe Ruth
and Carl Yastrzemski. It also was Griffey's 351st career homer,
lifting the center fielder to 50th on the all-time list, tied with
Dick Allen and Gary Gaetti.
</P>
<P>
   As for chipping away at Aaron's all-time mark, Griffey dismissed
such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still 404 behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But catching Aaron's first pitch was something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means something if I don't catch a lot of first
pitches,'' Griffey said afterward. ``If it weren't for guys like
him, would I be sitting here?''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen was the first Mariner to homer in '99, smacking a 3-2
pitch out to right for the first of his career. Guillen, a rookie
who drew raves by hitting .393 this spring, briefly raised his arm
in celebration as he slowed to a trot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can play,'' Piniella said. ``We're not worried about
Carlos. He's one of my least concerns here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buhner had been a major concern. At the end of last season,
Piniella figured Buhner would be playing first base Monday night.
Buhner was not expected to return to right field until the All-Star
break after having ``Tommy John'' elbow surgery last September 9.
</P>
<P>
   But he started there Monday night. During introductions, the
surgically repaired right fielder bounded toward third base to give
a bear hug to trainers Rick Griffin and Tom Newberg before taking
his place among the starters, lined up closer to home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys will tell you, `Thank you,' and say they
appreciate your help, but for him to do that meant a lot to us,''
said Griffin, who thought Buhner was simply starting at the back of
the line to high-five each member of the team. ``He went from
having surgery to playing in a big-league ballgame in less than
seven months. I don't think anybody else has done that, that I know
of. Whether it's a pitcher, outfielder or catcher, the fact that he
went out there and did it, made two throws and got a hit _ that's
pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball gods must have been watching, because the first
batter of the season, Ray Durham, lined one into Buhner's corner.
He slipped on the warning track going after it, and Durham had a
triple, scoring on a ground out by Mike Caruso.
</P>
<P>
   Durham, an All-Star in '98, is one of the few recognizable names
on the re-building White Sox. The biggest, of course, is Frank
Thomas, and the Big Hurt had a big hand in Monday night's game. He
had a single and two doubles, each hit factoring in a scoring
rally. The last, a two-run double, brought the Sox their final
runs, in the seventh off rookie reliever Brett Hinchliffe.

AN EARLY SEASON GUIDE TO TOP BASEBALL SITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so a look at the best major-league baseball sites might be a
day or two late. We're in agreement here.
</P>
<P>
   But, remember, it has been only a few days since entertainer
Garth Brooks was on the San Diego Padres' roster or actor Kevin
Costner was mishandling a big-league fly ball ... so it must not be
``that'' late for some serious baseball talk.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few early-season choices for the serious online
baseball fan:
</P>
<P>
   BEST OVERALL SITE: Fastball (www.fastball.com), produced by Cox
Interactive Media, is a very proactive site. It includes scores,
team-by-team updates, statistics, archives, interactivity,
fantasy-league help and information on minor leagues and
collectibles (lots of those bobbing-head players).
</P>
<P>
   And in case you're poring over all this stuff in the office
during working hours, the site even has a quick escape function _
the Boss! Button, which, at a click of a button, brings up a bogus
inventory report. Another off-best feature is the Foul Pole
section, which includes theme teams (such as the All-Body Parts
team) and always-a-hoot quotations from Casey Stengel and Yogi
Berra.
</P>
<P>
   BEST BIG-MEDIA SITE: It's tough to knock tradition; ``The
Sporting News'' has tracked baseball with detail, it seems, since
Abner Doubleday was playing T-ball. The St. Louis-based magazine
continues the tradition with an easy-to-navigate, content-rich site
(www.sportingnews.com/baseball). The Sporting News Online spreads
its reach on its MSNBC.com and America Online affiliations while
blanketing pro baseball with its vast network of correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   BEST GADGET: Hands down, the best gizmo on any baseball site is
Total Baseball's TotalCast (www.totalbaseball.com), which
replicates action from the real baseball field. Tiny electronic
players (note: they're physically incorrect, so none have oversized
Mark McGwire arms) reach base on a screen-sized field as
pitch-by-pitch charts are automatically updated every few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Other interesting stops:
</P>
<P>
   BEST SITE ABOUT BALLPARKS: Ballparks by Munsey and Suppes
(www.ballparks.com/baseball) puts users in selected baseball
stadiums and parks with images, seating charts and historical data.
You can almost smell the hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   BEST COLLECTION OF LINKS: John Skilton's Baseball Links
(www.baseball-links.com) is the standard. Skilton, a Swanwyck,
Del., baseball fan, has compiled, as of yesterday, 4,783 unique
links about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ALBERT BELLE NEWS: Hofstetter's Baseball Jerk of the Week
(www.jerkoftheweek.com/baseball), created by John and Steve
Hofstetter of New York, highlights the league's most embarrassing
representative each week.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MULTIMEDIA: Somewhere Major League Baseball's official site
(www.majorleaguebaseball.com) has to fit into the mix, and here it
does. The site's redeeming value is its exclusive audio and video
content. Overall, however, it's not much more than a site of
record.
</P>
<P>
   BEST INTERACTIVITY: Bigleaguers.com (www.bigleaguers.com) has a
page for ``every'' player in the big leagues. It also has chat
sessions, player diaries and interactive games.
</P>
<P>
   BEST HISTORICAL DATA: CNNSI.com's Historical Profiles section
(www.cnnsi.com/baseball/mlb/historical_profiles) includes rosters,
facts and career statistics of players from 1871-1996.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PLACE TO HEAR A GAME ONLINE: Duh. Broadcast.com
(www.broadcast.com/sports/baseball). The Dallas-based site includes
daily listings of games to be audiocast and archives of the weekly
news conferences by players. BYTES
</P>
<P>
   WEB MASTERS: The Masters Tournament is usually CNNSI.com's time
to shine. CNNSI.com will team with ``The Augusta'' (Ga.)
``Chronicle'' to provide real-time leader boards; player-by-player,
hole-by-hole scorecards; virtual-reality tours of the Augusta
National course; and lots of updates, multimedia, interactivity and
history. The tournament is scheduled to begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   CLEAR FORECAST: ESPN.com calls its 400,000 registrants for its
NCAA men's tournament interactive contest the largest of its kind
on the Internet. The winner was Sgt. Robert Segreti, a weather
forecaster at Vance Air Force Base in Enid, Okla., who correctly
predicted 46 of the 63 games in the NCAA men's tournament. Segreti
correctly predicted the tournament's final eight.
</P>
<P>
   POLL OF THE WEEK: It might work with NASCAR, but not with
baseball. Of 46,692 respondents, 94.7 percent (44,245) do not like
the idea of Major League Baseball putting ads on uniforms.

KINGDOME GETS CLOSURE IN OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A sentimental journey accelerated Monday night when
more than 50,000 Mariner fans watched the 23rd _ and last _ opening
night in Kingdome history.
</P>
<P>
   They came to say hello to a new baseball season. And to start
saying goodbye to a facility that has weathered an earthquake,
falling ceiling tiles and enough local and national criticism to
give it an inferiority complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Dome's $517 million replacement, standing tall and proud
only a Ken Griffey Jr. home run away, is the jewel the Dome never
was. Indeed, Safeco Field, which debuts on July 15, will have just
about everything the Kingdome doesn't, including real grass and a
roof that will let the sun and moon shine in.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, the Mariners' ballpark took its final opening
night bow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been the home to this organization since the beginning
and knowing that this is the last (opening night), it will be
nostalgic,'' said Mariner manager Lou Piniella before Monday
night's season opener against the Chicago White Sox. ``But like
every dinosaur, it's time for new and better things.''
</P>
<P>
   For its final opening night dance, the Kingdome was decked out
with red, white and blue bunting on the facades of all three
seating levels. The dirt cutouts around home plate, bases and
pitching mound were raked smooth, and the big screen in left field
displayed brilliant color.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official farewell party is being saved for the
team's final homestand in June _ prior to the All-Star break _
Monday night provided a chance to look back and reflect.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kindome could talk, what would it say?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have tears in its eyes and might be too choked up to
talk,'' said Mariner broadcaster Dave Niehaus, who has seen all 23
of the regular-season home openers. ``This has been a very good
place for the Seattle Mariners and the fans. We wouldn't have a
(major league) franchise if it wasn't for the Kingdome.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Piniella: ``It think it would say, `Enough! I'm worn
out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Keaton, the Kingdome public relations director, said,
``The purists say let's play ball (in an open-air stadium), but for
most of the kids, this is the biggest building they've ever been in
and it has been a fun place to watch the Mariners. Especially the
past few years.''
</P>
<P>
   But the purists are looking forward to mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't miss the Kingdome,'' said Frank Davidson, of Renton.
``I saw enough games here to make me a non-baseball fan.''
</P>
<P>
   He prefers fresh air, sun and natural turf.
</P>
<P>
   All three are coming and then the Kingdome becomes baseball
history.
</P>
<P>
   Regarded as a wart throughout the baseball fraternity for most
of its life, the Kingdome blossomed late in life to become one of
the best home-field advantages in the game. During the Mariners'
improbable late-season charge in 1995, which ended two wins shy of
the World Series, the noise generated during the month-long joy
ride drew favorable national attention.
</P>
<P>
   But prior to '95, most of the biggest crowds came on opening
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my first one, because it was my first one,'' said
Griffey, who debuted against the White Sox in 1989 with a home run
off Eric King.
</P>
<P>
   Other opening nights also stand out.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)In 1986, Jim Presley hit a two-run homer in the ninth
inning to tie the California Angels, and then won it in the 10th
with a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Last season, the M's gave ace left-hander Randy Johnson a
9-3 lead after five innings. But Cleveland came back to win 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The first opening night, in 1977, drew 57,762 fans _ the
largest regular-season crowd until 1994.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The '96 opener, when the franchise's first American League
West championship banner was hoisted to the rafters, is catcher Dan
Wilson's favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Kingdome would be appreciative of the fans and
their support over the years,'' Wilson said. ``The best times in
franchise history happened right here, but I think everyone is
looking forward to the move (into Safeco Field).''
</P>
<P>
   Fans agree.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Hopkins was 14 years old when she attented the first
opening night and returned Monday night with her husband, Hoover,
and 2-year-old son, Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted him to see his first Mariner game in the Kingdome,''
Hoover said. ``This is where all the history of the team is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of sad to see it go,'' said Jim Fursman of Burien,
``but I'm looking forward to the new stadium. I introduced my wife
(Barbara) to baseball at the Kingdome in '97.''

   &UR; AFFLICTION: FOR CHRONIC PAIN SUFFERERS, EVEN HOPE CAN HURT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARL T. HALL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly 28 years since Chris Ally rounded a blind
turn on his motorcycle and ran head-on into a delivery truck.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen days after the accident, when Ally, then 23, finally
came out of his coma, doctors and family members gathered around
his hospital bed told him how lucky he was to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he would begin to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Ally, son of the late New York advertising legend Carl Ally, was
six months out of college; he had been working in a motorcycle
dealership, making good money, riding high.
</P>
<P>
   The accident sent him hurtling into a new world: a place where
his body became the enemy and some malevolent power seemed to have
hijacked his brain.
</P>
<P>
   He was on a highway again. Twenty-eight years later, he is still
trying to get off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken my whole life from me,'' he said. ``After 28 years,
there's nothing left in my life but the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Chronic pain _ the kind that lasts longer than the injury that
may have caused it _ afflicts nearly 100 million people in the
United States, more than a third of the population, according to
the Society for Neuroscience, the world's largest organization of
brain researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The toll of the suffering is inexact, as are the methods used to
diagnose it. But pain that just will not go away is by far the most
common neurological disorder _ a $100 billion-a-year burden on
American society, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the burden is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Despite major advances in the science and practice of pain
control, studies consistently show chronic problems remain
misunderstood, misdiagnosed and mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   Research suggests that as many as half the nation's pain
patients are not being treated effectively.
</P>
<P>
   That puts millions of people ``in a terrible bind,'' said Skip
Baker, president of a militant grassroots organization, the
American Society for Action on Pain.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's Internet site (www.actiononpain.org) serves as a magnet
for desperate pain sufferers. The site includes a ``panic button''
for people on the verge of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the same way a few years ago,'' Baker said. But while
not all people can erase their pain, he learned, most can at least
reduce it to tolerable levels. ``I bought a shotgun after a doctor
said nothing could be done,'' said Baker. ``Then I saw a doctor who
would help.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics offer a hint of how widespread the problems are. In
the United States alone, according to the latest surveys and
estimates:
</P>
<P>
   -- Chronic headaches, including migraines, affect about 45
million people. The costs _ including lost productivity, medical
expenses and the estimated 157 million missed workdays _ add up to
$50 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   -- Arthritis affects more than 40 million people, and as the
population ages over the next two decades, that number is expected
to reach 60 million.
</P>
<P>
   -- Low back pain strikes two-thirds of adults. Problems usually
go away on their own, but chronic pain lingers in about 15 percent
of cases, leaving 7 million people partially or completely
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   -- At least 16,000 people die each year from gastrointestinal
problems caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
widely used pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin. Yet
physicians and patients alike are often reluctant to use narcotics,
the most potent alternative, because of the stigma surrounding
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a fear of opiates,'' said Allan Basbaum, a pain
expert at the University of California at San Francisco. ``The word
`morphine' scares the hell out of people. To many patients,
morphine either means death or addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in pain control are attempting to improve standards
of care, giving rise to such organizations as the 4,000-member
American Pain Society.
</P>
<P>
   Neuroscientists are piecing together the puzzle of how pain
signals are transmitted, how pain sensations affect different parts
of the brain and how chronic pain can detrimentally ``rewire'' the
nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   California and many other states have changed their laws to
encourage more physicians to prescribe morphine and other pain
medications in doses strong enough to be effective. New drugs have
been developed, drug delivery methods have been improved and
doctors today have better strategies for handling side effects.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite these advances, the medical system routinely
fails those living, and dying, in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Russell Portenoy, president of the American Pain Society and
head of the pain-management department at Beth Israel Medical
Center in New York, blames this failure on ``the culture of
medicine as it's practiced in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are well-trained to repair the human machine, he said,
but often fail to treat patients as human beings for whom there may
be no easy answers.
</P>
<P>
   In the era of managed care and cost-conscious medicine, problems
that resist treatment and do not seem life-threatening may also get
short shrift from doctors expected to devote no more than 15
minutes to the average patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain patients require a lot of talking and a lot of
listening,'' said Gerald Gebhart, a pharmacologist researching new
pain drugs at the University of Iowa. That takes patience and
sensitivity that not all doctors can, or care to, muster: finding
the right treatments can take months or years of experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Often, sufferers are forced to search for doctors willing to
prescribe powerful, closely regulated narcotics, a dicey enterprise
at best.
</P>
<P>
   Pain patients, though they may develop a physical dependence on
narcotics, rarely become psychologically addicted and suffer
negative consequences. But doctors are still reluctant to prescribe
controlled substances because they say they do not want to attract
the attention of drug-enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The California Medical Board has concluded that the fears are
overblown. In a formal policy statement, the board found
``systematic undertreatment of chronic pain,'' which it attributed
to ``low priority of pain management in our health care system,
incomplete integration of current knowledge into medical education
and clinical practice, lack of knowledge among consumers about pain
management, exaggerated fears of opioid side effects and addiction,
and fear of legal consequences when controlled substances are
used.''
</P>
<P>
   The consequences for patients can be tragic: If their pain goes
untreated, it can rage out of control. New research shows that
prolonged pain can cause lasting changes in the spinal column and
the brain stem, turning what had been side streets into roaring
freeways for pain signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to educate the public that `grin and bear it' is no
good,'' said Dr. Ronald Dubner, a pain expert at the University of
Maryland. ``Chronic pain is a disease in itself. If you don't treat
it, and the symptoms continue for too long, you can do some real
damage and make the problem worse.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chris Ally, the trouble started soon after he opened his
eyes after his 1971 motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
   His left arm felt dead. No movement, no feeling. Just stabbing
sensations deep in the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of his helmeted head slamming on the pavement must
have compressed the vertebrae in his upper back, damaging a group
of nerves called the brachial plexus, doctors told him.
</P>
<P>
   The pain that started in his shoulder and neck intensified after
he was discharged from the hospital. By 1975, he had concluded that
his damaged left arm was pulling on the traumatized nerve root at
the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   So in December of that year, he had his arm amputated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to get rid of it,'' said Ally, a San Francisco
resident since 1987 who lives alone in a Nob Hill studio. ``It was
deadweight anyway, and I thought it would end the pain problem,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He no longer needed to wear a sling to keep his limp arm from
flopping. His walk was steadier. But he had sacrificed a limb and
gained nothing in the way of pain relief.
</P>
<P>
   Pain is difficult to measure. Doctors use various scales, asking
people to rate their discomfort from 0 to 10, for example, or from
blue to red, signifying a range from nearly pain-free to the worst
pain imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   But a 10 is not the half of it for people like Ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I am in most danger of now,'' he said, ``is losing
my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Brain imaging has offered researchers a view of what happens in
the nervous system when pain persists, showing areas of the brain
involved in both the sensation and emotional dimensions of pain.
</P>
<P>
   If unrelieved, neuroscientists now say, pain can amplify the
body's ability to communicate pain signals.
</P>
<P>
   Some people can override the signals temporarily through
conscious effort or powerful distraction, a phenomenon that
explains why wounded soldiers may feel little pain on the
battlefield, and why injured athletes may not feel any pain until
the game is over.
</P>
<P>
   But for those in full retreat, chronic pain can be a daily,
24-hour ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ally calls them ``walkers'': rising bursts of overwhelming pain
that strike without warning, gripping him perhaps 100 times on bad
days, forcing him to get up and move around until the agony
subsides.
</P>
<P>
   Talking on the street one day outside his apartment, Ally
stopped abruptly and turned away, leaning into the building. Two
passers-by were startled by the suddenness of it, and seemed to
consider offering help, but they hurried past when it became clear
that he was used to this.
</P>
<P>
   He twisted his neck, stared into the distance, pressed his chin
to his chest. Then he reached across his chest with his right hand
and pulled down hard on the stump of his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   He let out a sound, heartbreaking, impossible to describe,
something between a groan and a lament. Sweat beaded on his
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   During several interviews and trips to the hospital and doctor's
office, he often seemed close to tears.
</P>
<P>
   He described the pain as ``a steady, strong, dull aching
presence that feels like someone has driven a hot railroad spike
into my shoulder with a hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   When the walkers first come on, he said, it feels as though
someone is twisting and turning the spike, driving it in deeper _
and then ``the spike starts getting hotter, and hotter, and
hotter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the pain had been getting much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Ally attributed this to a perverse side effect of his plan to
enroll in a clinical trial of ``an incredible new pain drug''
called ziconotide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of necessity, I have done my best to eliminate any memory
of what it felt like not to hurt all the time,'' he said. ``It's a
matter of trying to get acclimated to something I figured I could
do nothing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward to the drug trial seemed to put a crack in his
armor.

   ``It's amazing what the brain does,'' he said. ``The pain starts
talking: `You will do everything I say. You will do everything you
can to keep me at bay. You will have no room for anything else.'''

 AFFLICTION: FOR CHRONIC PAIN SUFFERERS, EVEN HOPE CAN HURT
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (2nd of 2 takes) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (CONT: his composure. Another walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been ugly this past couple of weeks,'' he said,
finally. ``This has been the first time in many, many years I have
been thinking there may actually be a way past this.''
</P>
<P>
   As chronic pain consumes people's lives, anxiety and depression
often close in. Ally, at least, benefited from good medical care
and an adequate arsenal of drugs, which can help keep despair at
bay.
</P>
<P>
   All too frequently, people have to settle for a lot less.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients _ suspected of faking symptoms to get drugs or
time off work, among other things _ spend years simply trying to
convince doctors that their troubles are real. Sufferers visit
doctor after doctor, their hopelessness building as they go.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst scenarios, lives fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen to me?'' said Jane Husman, sobbing in
her Marin County living room last fall, describing her failed
marriage, her arguments with the Social Security system, her
inability to loosen the grip that her wrecked vertebrae seem to
have on her life.
</P>
<P>
   After six years of trying to cope with a back problem and
jolting pains in her leg, stoicism no longer worked: her search for
relief became desperate. Since 1994, she has undergone multiple
unsuccessful surgeries and tried a surgically implanted pump, a
device that delivers pain relievers to the fluid-filled space
surrounding the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest gamble _ a second try at a pump _ didn't cause
allergic reactions like the first. Instead, it brought other
troubles: numbness in her leg that caused her to collapse and
repeated emergency room visits to change her medication. Then,
early this month, she felt a change.
</P>
<P>
   The pain went away. Her life returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am starting to feel like a human being again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ally's latest gamble, the new drug ziconotide, is one of several
experimental medications designed to take advantage of increasingly
sophisticated knowledge about pain's multiple pathways.
</P>
<P>
   A small Menlo Park company called Neurex, now a unit of Elan
Corp., the Ireland-based drugmaker, discovered the drug's active
ingredient in the venom of fish-eating sea snails, which use
elaborate chemical weaponry to stun swifter prey.
</P>
<P>
   Ziconotide, now being reviewed by the Food and Drug
Administration, alters the biochemistry that transmits pain signals
up the spinal cord to the brain _ reducing the flow of electrically
charged calcium atoms into nerve cells. In some cases, the drug can
apparently eliminate pain that other treatments can't touch.
</P>
<P>
   When pain goes on too long, calcium channels _ like a river that
carves a bed as it flows _ become increasingly efficient,
transmitting pain signals long after an injury has healed.
</P>
<P>
   Ziconotide, designed to block the calcium channels, is said to
be much more potent than morphine, but has to be administered with
care. Too little fails to do any good. Too much can disrupt brain
chemistry and cause side effects.
</P>
<P>
   To administer ziconotide, surgeons implant one end of a tube
into the spinal column and run the other end out the patient's
side, where it connects to an external pump held in place with a
shoulder strap.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of drug pumped through the tube is steadily increased
until an optimal dose is found. Patients who respond favorably are
fitted with an internal pump, the same device commonly used for
delivering spinal morphine.
</P>
<P>
   Ally has tried nearly everything.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, he had a surgical procedure known as a rhizotomy to
sever the nerves thought to be causing his difficulties. But it
accomplished little other than leaving a long scar at the back of
his neck.
</P>
<P>
   He gradually stepped up his use of pain drugs, something he had
resisted for fear he would eventually start popping them ``like
Cheerios.'' He also found some relief smoking marijuana, recently
shown to affect certain nerve cells in ways similar to morphine.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing really worked. Suicide began to loom as the only
solution. He stocked up long ago on the pills and paraphernalia to
do the job. He occasionally tries on the plastic bag he got from
the Hemlock Society in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Despairing, he began talking of ``checking out'' over the Labor
Day weekend last year. Then, a friend told him about ziconotide,
and after an Internet search, he contacted the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Neurex referred Ally to Dr. Robert Presley, a well-regarded pain
specialist with a clinic in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Ally was accepted into the Neurex clinical trial and scheduled
for surgery to put the drug-delivery system in place.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to let a reporter observe the procedure. Presley would
operate at 6 p.m. at Good Samaritan Medical Center in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   All afternoon, during the drive from San Francisco and the
preliminaries in Presley's clinic, Ally debated the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Walkers were coming hard and fast. His anxiety was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I know this will work?'' he kept asking at the clinic.
``Why do I feel so uncertain about this?'' If someone tried to
answer, he would only ask again, over and over.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse, Debbie Clay, patiently took him through the forms and
standard neurological tests. She reassured him that getting a pump
implanted was no big deal. She lifted her sweater to let him feel
hers, a lump the size of a hockey puck, just under the skin of her
abdomen. But when Ally reached over to touch it, his hand shook.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped outside for some air. He smoked a couple of
cigarettes. Nothing seemed to calm him. Clay's pump was ``a lot
bigger than I imagined it would be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the hospital, a nurse brought a sedative, but
when she drew the curtain to give the shot, Ally went into a panic,
yelling for help. Nobody had told him what the shot was for.
</P>
<P>
   He finally calmed down enough to allow the injection, but it had
little effect. He began to talk faster and faster, voicing his
doubts about whether he really wanted to participate in the drug
trial after all.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, no one had filled him in on some details, such as
the need to keep the external pump from getting wet when he
showered. ``How can I do that?'' he demanded to know. ``I have one
arm and I live alone!''
</P>
<P>
   When Presley arrived at the hospital, he found Ally beside
himself _ worried that a one-armed man who lived alone could not
cope with the technical aspects of an experimental drug that might
not work.
</P>
<P>
   Ally was on the gurney, ready to be wheeled into the surgical
suite. The hospital's patient advocate, who had come around to make
sure he had consented to the procedure, clearly had doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Ally grabbed the doctor's hand. Words came in a tumble. ``Every
bone in my body is telling me not to go through with this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Presley tried to reason with him. He assured him that lining up
a visiting nurse or arranging for an extended hospital stay would
not be a problem. ``This drug could really help you,'' Presley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ally would have none of it. After listening a few more minutes,
Presley told him he was starting to worry, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to do this procedure tonight,'' Presley said.
``We can try it again after you are comfortable that this is the
right thing to do. You haven't lost anything. We can still get the
drug for you.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be no second chance for Ally.
</P>
<P>
   The drugmaker was running the trial to determine side effects,
and patients experiencing extreme anxiety even before they started
would skew the results. So Ally was ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to see a psychiatrist. He takes Prozac for
depression and 200 milligrams of methadone daily, plus three or
four Percocets, for the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, Ally tries to find some project to keep his mind
occupied. He volunteers as a public school tutor. He ``adopted'' a
child through a charity, traveled to Indonesia to visit her and
plans to help support her through college. He used to play
one-handed keyboards in a pickup band with friends, clowning for
tips at a San Francisco cable-car turnaround. ``Excuse me if I
don't wave,'' he would tell tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the friends have drifted off and the isolation is
growing, a vast space occupied mostly by pain. He still hopes to
find a doctor willing to try something. Anything.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he fears the pain will win. ``I know it has the power
to kill me,'' he said, gritting his teeth, caught in another
walker.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as he has done every day for 28 years, he found a way
to get through it.

 &HT;     AFFLICTION: FOR CHRONIC PAIN SUFFERERS, EVEN HOPE CAN HURT 
 &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been nearly 28 years since Chris Ally rounded a blind
turn on his motorcycle and ran head-on into a delivery truck.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen days after the accident, when Ally, then 23, finally
came out of his coma, doctors and family members gathered around
his hospital bed told him how lucky he was to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he would begin to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Ally, son of the late New York advertising legend Carl Ally, was
six months out of college; he had been working in a motorcycle
dealership, making good money, riding high.
</P>
<P>
   The accident sent him hurtling into a new world: a place where
his body became the enemy and some malevolent power seemed to have
hijacked his brain.
</P>
<P>
   He was on a highway again. Twenty-eight years later, he is still
trying to get off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken my whole life from me,'' he said. ``After 28 years,
there's nothing left in my life but the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Chronic pain _ the kind that lasts longer than the injury that
may have caused it _ afflicts nearly 100 million people in the
United States, more than a third of the population, according to
the Society for Neuroscience, the world's largest organization of
brain researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The toll of the suffering is inexact, as are the methods used to
diagnose it. But pain that just will not go away is by far the most
common neurological disorder _ a $100 billion-a-year burden on
American society, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the burden is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Despite major advances in the science and practice of pain
control, studies consistently show chronic problems remain
misunderstood, misdiagnosed and mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   Research suggests that as many as half the nation's pain
patients are not being treated effectively.
</P>
<P>
   That puts millions of people ``in a terrible bind,'' said Skip
Baker, president of a militant grassroots organization, the
American Society for Action on Pain.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's Internet site (www.actiononpain.org) serves as a magnet
for desperate pain sufferers. The site includes a ``panic button''
for people on the verge of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the same way a few years ago,'' Baker said. But while
not all people can erase their pain, he learned, most can at least
reduce it to tolerable levels. ``I bought a shotgun after a doctor
said nothing could be done,'' said Baker. ``Then I saw a doctor who
would help.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics offer a hint of how widespread the problems are. In
the United States alone, according to the latest surveys and
estimates:
</P>
<P>
   -- Chronic headaches, including migraines, affect about 45
million people. The costs _ including lost productivity, medical
expenses and the estimated 157 million missed workdays _ add up to
$50 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   -- Arthritis affects more than 40 million people, and as the
population ages over the next two decades, that number is expected
to reach 60 million.
</P>
<P>
   -- Low back pain strikes two-thirds of adults. Problems usually
go away on their own, but chronic pain lingers in about 15 percent
of cases, leaving 7 million people partially or completely
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   -- At least 16,000 people die each year from gastrointestinal
problems caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
widely used pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin. Yet
physicians and patients alike are often reluctant to use narcotics,
the most potent alternative, because of the stigma surrounding
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a fear of opiates,'' said Allan Basbaum, a pain
expert at the University of California at San Francisco. ``The word
`morphine' scares the hell out of people. To many patients,
morphine either means death or addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in pain control are attempting to improve standards
of care, giving rise to such organizations as the 4,000-member
American Pain Society.
</P>
<P>
   Neuroscientists are piecing together the puzzle of how pain
signals are transmitted, how pain sensations affect different parts
of the brain and how chronic pain can detrimentally ``rewire'' the
nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   California and many other states have changed their laws to
encourage more physicians to prescribe morphine and other pain
medications in doses strong enough to be effective. New drugs have
been developed, drug delivery methods have been improved and
doctors today have better strategies for handling side effects.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite these advances, the medical system routinely
fails those living, and dying, in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Russell Portenoy, president of the American Pain Society and
head of the pain-management department at Beth Israel Medical
Center in New York, blames this failure on ``the culture of
medicine as it's practiced in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are well-trained to repair the human machine, he said,
but often fail to treat patients as human beings for whom there may
be no easy answers.
</P>
<P>
   In the era of managed care and cost-conscious medicine, problems
that resist treatment and do not seem life-threatening may also get
short shrift from doctors expected to devote no more than 15
minutes to the average patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain patients require a lot of talking and a lot of
listening,'' said Gerald Gebhart, a pharmacologist researching new
pain drugs at the University of Iowa. That takes patience and
sensitivity that not all doctors can, or care to, muster: finding
the right treatments can take months or years of experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Often, sufferers are forced to search for doctors willing to
prescribe powerful, closely regulated narcotics, a dicey enterprise
at best.
</P>
<P>
   Pain patients, though they may develop a physical dependence on
narcotics, rarely become psychologically addicted and suffer
negative consequences. But doctors are still reluctant to prescribe
controlled substances because they say they do not want to attract
the attention of drug-enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The California Medical Board has concluded that the fears are
overblown. In a formal policy statement, the board found
``systematic undertreatment of chronic pain,'' which it attributed
to ``low priority of pain management in our health care system,
incomplete integration of current knowledge into medical education
and clinical practice, lack of knowledge among consumers about pain
management, exaggerated fears of opioid side effects and addiction,
and fear of legal consequences when controlled substances are
used.''
</P>
<P>
   The consequences for patients can be tragic: If their pain goes
untreated, it can rage out of control. New research shows that
prolonged pain can cause lasting changes in the spinal column and
the brain stem, turning what had been side streets into roaring
freeways for pain signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to educate the public that `grin and bear it' is no
good,'' said Dr. Ronald Dubner, a pain expert at the University of
Maryland. ``Chronic pain is a disease in itself. If you don't treat
it, and the symptoms continue for too long, you can do some real
damage and make the problem worse.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chris Ally, the trouble started soon after he opened his
eyes after his 1971 motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
   His left arm felt dead. No movement, no feeling. Just stabbing
sensations deep in the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of his helmeted head slamming on the pavement must
have compressed the vertebrae in his upper back, damaging a group
of nerves called the brachial plexus, doctors told him.
</P>
<P>
   The pain that started in his shoulder and neck intensified after
he was discharged from the hospital. By 1975, he had concluded that
his damaged left arm was pulling on the traumatized nerve root at
the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   So in December of that year, he had his arm amputated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to get rid of it,'' said Ally, a San Francisco
resident since 1987 who lives alone in a Nob Hill studio. ``It was
deadweight anyway, and I thought it would end the pain problem,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He no longer needed to wear a sling to keep his limp arm from
flopping. His walk was steadier. But he had sacrificed a limb and
gained nothing in the way of pain relief.
</P>
<P>
   Pain is difficult to measure. Doctors use various scales, asking
people to rate their discomfort from 0 to 10, for example, or from
blue to red, signifying a range from nearly pain-free to the worst
pain imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   But a 10 is not the half of it for people like Ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I am in most danger of now,'' he said, ``is losing
my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Brain imaging has offered researchers a view of what happens in
the nervous system when pain persists, showing areas of the brain
involved in both the sensation and emotional dimensions of pain.
</P>
<P>
   If unrelieved, neuroscientists now say, pain can amplify the
body's ability to communicate pain signals.
</P>
<P>
   Some people can override the signals temporarily through
conscious effort or powerful distraction, a phenomenon that
explains why wounded soldiers may feel little pain on the
battlefield, and why injured athletes may not feel any pain until
the game is over.
</P>
<P>
   But for those in full retreat, chronic pain can be a daily,
24-hour ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ally calls them ``walkers'': rising bursts of overwhelming pain
that strike without warning, gripping him perhaps 100 times on bad
days, forcing him to get up and move around until the agony
subsides.
</P>
<P>
   Talking on the street one day outside his apartment, Ally
stopped abruptly and turned away, leaning into the building. Two
passers-by were startled by the suddenness of it, and seemed to
consider offering help, but they hurried past when it became clear
that he was used to this.
</P>
<P>
   He twisted his neck, stared into the distance, pressed his chin
to his chest. Then he reached across his chest with his right hand
and pulled down hard on the stump of his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   He let out a sound, heartbreaking, impossible to describe,
something between a groan and a lament. Sweat beaded on his
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   During several interviews and trips to the hospital and doctor's
office, he often seemed close to tears.
</P>
<P>
   He described the pain as ``a steady, strong, dull aching
presence that feels like someone has driven a hot railroad spike
into my shoulder with a hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   When the walkers first come on, he said, it feels as though
someone is twisting and turning the spike, driving it in deeper _
and then ``the spike starts getting hotter, and hotter, and
hotter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the pain had been getting much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Ally attributed this to a perverse side effect of his plan to
enroll in a clinical trial of ``an incredible new pain drug''
called ziconotide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of necessity, I have done my best to eliminate any memory
of what it felt like not to hurt all the time,'' he said. ``It's a
matter of trying to get acclimated to something I figured I could
do nothing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward to the drug trial seemed to put a crack in his
armor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what the brain does,'' he said. ``The pain starts
talking: `You will do everything I say. You will do everything you
can to keep me at bay. You will have no room for anything else.'''
</P>
<P>
   He had to stop for awhile to get his composure. Another walker.

 NEWEST DRUGS RELIEVE PAIN WITH LESS RISK  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  New insights into the biochemistry of pain are starting to pay
off in safer, and perhaps even more effective, treatment options
for chronic sufferers.
<P>
   One new type of painkiller, known as COX-2 inhibitors, just hit
pharmacy shelves. The drugs appear to be no more effective at
fighting pain than traditional anti-inflammatory medications such
as ibuprofen and aspirin, but offer the advantage of fewer side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   That is a major plus for people who must use pain relievers
long-term and risk such problems as stomach bleeding and ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the new drugs, Celebrex, developed by Monsanto's
G.D. Searle &AMP; Co. pharmaceutical unit and co-marketed by Pfizer
Inc., was launched commercially last month.
</P>
<P>
   A different drug of the same type, Merck &AMP; Co.'s Vioxx, is
awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration and could be
on the market by summer.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts view the drugs as potential blockbusters,
likely to command at least 10 percent of the market for common pain
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   COX-2 drugs are designed primarily for those with rheumatoid
arthritis, which afflicts about 2.1 million people in the United
States, and for painful flareups of osteoarthritis, the
``wear-and-tear'' form of the ailment, which affects an estimated
20.7 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, these patients and others in chronic pain have relied
mostly on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, sold
over-the-counter or at prescription strength under brand names such
as Advil, Daypro, Lodine and Naprosyn.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs are generally effective but can be harmful with
constant use. A 1997 study of arthritis patients showed at least
107,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths a year from
NSAID-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   COX-2 drugs block production of an enzyme called
cyclooxygenase-2, which produces painful inflammation. Unlike
NSAIDs, however, they do not interfere with the closely related
COX-1 enzyme, which helps build a protective lining in the stomach
and gastrointestinal tract.
</P>
<P>
   Searle began selling Celebrex for $2.42 per 200 milligram pill,
less than expected but still more than some HMOs might be willing
to pay, especially for patients without a demonstrated problem with
NSAIDs.
</P>
<P>
   The COX-2 inhibitors, meanwhile, are not the only new
possibilities for fighting pain:
</P>
<P>
   -- Ziconotide, awaiting FDA approval, has been touted as a
potent alternative to morphine in cases of severe pain. Derived
from sea snail venom, it is designed to block calcium channels in
nerve cells of the spine, interrupting the flow of pain signals to
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   -- Enbrel, first in a new class of rheumatoid arthritis
medicines called biologic response modifiers, soaks up excess
``tumor necrosis factor,'' a chemical secreted by immune cells
involved in joint inflammations.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, made by Immunex Corp. of Seattle, was approved by the
FDA last year1998cq &LR;  for use in adults. New studies show that it
may also be effective in childhood forms of arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   -- Neurontin, known generically as gabapentin, is an established
epilepsy drug that has been shown to work against hard-to-treat
nerve pain from shingles or diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tests are underway to establish whether memantine _ used in
Germany to treat Parkinson's disease _ can ease the pain of
diabetic neuropathy. The drug blocks NMDA receptors, nerve cell
sites that help relay pain signals.

 &HT;     IN SEARCH OF A GOOD DEATH 
 &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After four years and multiple rounds of chemotherapy, radiation
treatments and surgery, Sylvia Sharnoff's battle with cancer was
about to end.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old Berkeley, Calif., nature photographer and writer
was fresh out of options. One more trip to the oncologist only
confirmed the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer would have its way. It would not be long.
</P>
<P>
   But as one battle was ending, another was intensifying: the
struggle for a few good days, or hours, or even minutes. Now, the
enemy was pain _ and the terror of knowing it would not get any
better.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing more could be done, Sharnoff's pain specialist told her.
From now on, it was all up to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard message to hear,'' she said. ``That's it. I'm at
the end of the road. ... It's just something I have to get my mind
around.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same battle is being waged every day by untold
thousands of people struggling to hang on to life while dying in
pain. At home with her husband, Steve, Sharnoff described her fight
as one she was desperate to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some things I want to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Four out of 10 dying patients are in severe pain most of the
time, according to one recent survey. In another study, surviving
family members judged pain to have been ``moderate to severe''
during most of the dying person's last three days of life.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings come as no surprise to those hoping to improve the
quality of end-of-life medical care. And if the numbers paint a
grim picture of death in America, experts insist that the
statistics only mask the real tragedy: Most of the suffering can be
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than four or even five in 10 dying in pain, ``it should
be less than one in four,'' said Dr. Russell Portenoy, director of
pain management and palliative care at Beth Israel Medical Center
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He and other pain specialists have spent more than a decade
proselytizing for more effective treatments for pain sufferers.
Advocacy groups have also been established to promote the rights of
the dying to adequate pain relief.
</P>
<P>
   And the so-called pain movement in American medicine has
resulted in the passage of model legislation in California and
several other states that is designed to encourage more doctors to
prescribe strong opiates without fear of prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Research has led to more effective drugs and better ways of
delivering them through pumps, patches, candylike sticks and
sustained-release pills.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are being urged to take pain symptoms seriously. The
Veterans Administration, borrowing a long-standing slogan of pain
management specialists, recently elevated pain to the status of
``fifth vital sign.'' The idea is to gauge pain symptoms with the
same precision as temperature, respiration, blood pressure and
heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such advancements, four months of interviews and bedside
visits with people in terminal stages of illness revealed that
adequate pain relief remains an elusive goal _ an exception, rather
than the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we are making strides in end-of-life care,
especially in pain relief, the current care system still falls
short,'' said Dr. Joanne Lynn, director of the Center to Improve
Care of the Dying at George Washington University Medical Center in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for the failure.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the factor cited most often is that physicians are still
reluctant to prescribe strong pain medications for fear of running
afoul of drug-control authorities. If convicted for writing
``unwarranted'' prescriptions or overprescribing controlled drugs _
including Vicodin, Percocet, morphine and methadone _ they can lose
their licenses or even go to prison.
</P>
<P>
   And despite growing recognition that some patients require high
doses of narcotics _ drugs that are highly effective in treating
pain _ there is still a stigma attached to their use.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fear is based on mythic tales of overzealous
prosecutors, said Ann Alpers, a researcher at the University of
California at San Francisco. After an exhaustive nationwide search,
she found only five cases since 1990 of doctors charged with
overprescribing painkillers to dying patients.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there have been a few high-profile cases, said
Sandra Johnson, provost of Saint Louis University, who is doing
research sponsored by the Mayday Fund, a philanthropy seeking to
improve pain treatments. ``And a few high-profile cases are enough
to scare a lot of doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern California pain specialists said the recent arrest of
Dr. Frank Fisher in Shasta County _ on charges that included three
counts of murder _ will help fan the fears. Fisher, a chronic pain
doctor, denies wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-profile case involved Dr. William Hurwitz, a
pain-control specialist in McLean, Va., outside Washington, D.C.,
who lost his medical license for two years on charges of
overprescribing drugs for chronic pain sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   After winning back his right to practice medicine, Hurwitz, a
graduate of Stanford Medical School, said he now sees patients from
all over the country who are struggling with intractable pain and
spotty access to drugs. The problem is a ``Kafka-esque regulatory
environment,'' Hurwitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulties in obtaining medication are most common in chronic
cases, but even dying people sometimes find it hard to get adequate
amounts of medication.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, the California Medical Board, as far back as
1994, spelled out in detail how doctors could safely prescribe
opiates for those in need. Nevertheless, many physicians still
think investigators ``are lurking behind every gurney and office
wall,'' said Dale Ferranto, special agent in the Los Angeles region
for the state Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement. ``And basically, it's
just not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The fears, said researcher Alpers, may serve as a convenient
excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to mask a more subterranean practice of poor
management of pain for dying patients,'' she said. ``It's an easy
way to explain away our undertreatment of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the best treatments can fail, however. Sometimes, no amount
of help can make things better.
</P>
<P>
   In Sharnoff's case, doctors could not stop the cancer, or even
determine where it had started. But for her, there was no point in
worrying about any of that now.
</P>
<P>
   These days, what mattered most was the searing pain in her right
arm and shoulder. It had plagued her for a long time, but lately
was becoming so bad, she could barely concentrate on anything but
getting herself in just the right position, usually lying down,
while her husband helped adjust the pain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The pain was the byproduct of some of the cancer treatments, as
well as the effect of the advancing cancer invading sensitive
nerves. Now, as her time dwindled, the pain was sometimes beyond
the reach of drugs, or required such high doses that she feared
losing the precious few days she had left in an opiate fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrifying,'' she said. ``I don't have room for any more
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharnoffs, partners in photography, were in the final stages
of their masterwork, an obsession for the past eight years _ a
stunningly beautiful illustrated textbook on lichens.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, 28, in medical school in Chicago, was due to
visit soon for the holidays. Friends were calling and visiting. On
this particular day, rain was giving way to warm sunshine in
Berkeley, and the light streaming into the front room, where Sylvia
Sharnoff was resting, stirred her hope of witnessing another
spring-wildflower bloom in the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel depressed,'' she said. ``But I do feel this may
become intolerable pretty soon. Lately, it's been getting a lot
harder to be optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that bright day, Sharnoff was unable to speak
above a hoarse whisper. The cancer may have invaded her throat,
doctors said, and was pressing against the voice box.
</P>
<P>
   She had recently undergone a somewhat delicate procedure known
as a percutaneous partial cordotomy _ a last-ditch attempt to
surgically block the pain.
</P>
<P>
   During that procedure, she had stretched out on her back in the
operating room at UCSF, eyes closed to the bright lights and video
monitors. Neurosurgeon Nicholas Barbero injected a local anesthetic
into the left side of her neck, then inserted a long flexible
needle that would sheath the electrode needed to complete the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Sharnoff had to stay awake in order to help Barbero guide the
electrode to just the right spot, where a precise jolt of heat
would be applied. The goal was to scramble the nerve cells relaying
the pain without disrupting nearby spinal circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   Barbero watched on a video monitor, jiggled a bit on the wire
sticking into Sharnoff's neck, directed the technician to turn the
current up or down on the machine hooked to the electrode, asked
Sharnoff to report exactly what she felt, then did it all again,
dozens of times over the span of an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   For the neurosurgeon, it was like feeling his way in the dark,
with little besides his patient's words to guide him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel odd,'' Sharnoff said at one point, struggling to stay
focused but clearly growing weary of the ordeal. ``Like an
emptiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbero seemed frustrated, too. It was his second attempt at
producing a good result for her _ and it did not seem to be going
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Describe the pain, just what you are feeling right now,'' he
told her. ``I don't know what to do with `emptiness.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not pain exactly,'' she replied. ``More like a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went. After several more attempts at describing the
sensations triggered by small test jolts in her spine, the lesion
was made, and Barbero concluded that he had done all he could. He
judged the procedure to have eliminated at least some of the
heightened sensitivity in Sharnoff's arm.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Sharnoff was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   She found that the agony she had long been suffering in her arm
had, in fact, eased a bit. But now she realized that her fingers
were all but useless, the arm essentially paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the pain seemed to have jumped into her shoulder and
neck, and even seemed to be creeping across to her left side. The
tumor appeared to be advancing way ahead of the pain control. The
surgeon had done nothing wrong; the cancer was just too aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   It was now a matter of weighing the effectiveness of morphine
against its sedating side effects. For many patients, other drugs
can be used to lessen the grogginess, but none of these worked for
Sharnoff.
</P>
<P>
   Something else was bothering her as well.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said she was the type of person who wanted to be in
control: generous with others, solicitous of feelings, but
stubborn, too _ a perfectionist in her projects and many other
parts of her life. She was not one to leave anything to chance.
</P>
<P>
   Sharnoff hoped that others might benefit if her struggles with
pain were publicized. But she was concerned now about coming off as
a whiner.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to make it clear that she was struggling against the
pain while remaining at home with her family, trying to preserve
what counted in her life. ``I don't like feeling helpless,'' she
said. ``It would bother me if I were to come off as an idiot.''

 PAIN-DYING: IN SEARCH OF A GOOD DEATH(2ND OF TWO TAKES)

<P>
   bother me if I were to come off as an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was bothered by the fact that there was no resolution
in sight. She had agreed to allow a rare public glimpse into this
most private time, and despite everything that was tried _ even a
hypnotherapist was starting to come around _ the pain remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about your story,'' she said. ``I mean, how is
it going to come out? We've done all this stuff, and there's still
no ending.''
</P>
<P>
   It was after her last trip to the oncologist that everyone
decided it was pointless to continue trying to slow down Sharnoff's
cancer. Finally, she was able to qualify for home hospice care.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment tends to improve remarkably once a person makes it
into a program that emphasizes quality of life, rather than trying
to extend it. Whether at home or in a health care facility, hospice
programs typically provide a comprehensive, state-of-the-art plan
for pain control.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Medicare will not pay for hospice services unless
doctors affirm that death is imminent, no more than six months
away.
</P>
<P>
   These prognoses can be extended without much difficulty, but too
many extensions can raise questions about whether a physician is
acting in good faith. Some hospice doctors have been investigated
for Medicare fraud, although no criminal charges have yet resulted.
Others have been audited and forced to return the government money
they received.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, entry into hospice programs is often delayed until
there is very little doubt about a patient's condition being
terminal. Death frequently comes within a matter of weeks, often
days. The national average hospice stay is two weeks, but ``there's
no reason that number shouldn't be 180 days,'' said Dr. Kenneth
Pienta, who is leading a pilot program in Michigan that seeks to
bring people under hospice care much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Until such experiments become standard practice, most terminal
patients spend all but their final days supervised by doctors who
do not necessarily specialize in pain relief.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the pieces of lives being shattered by pain often
falls to people like Linda Blum, clinical supervisor in San Mateo
for the Emeryville-based Visiting Nurse Association and Hospice
Program, a regional nonprofit that cares for about 180 people on
any given day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually they're undertreated,'' she said. ``Occasionally,
they're overtreated. For almost every one of our patients coming
into our program, we have to make some kind of adjustment in the
treatment plan.''
</P>
<P>
   However, experts readily agree that no scientific breakthroughs
are needed to make a huge improvement in end-of-life care right
now. Some patients might not experience total relief, but almost
everyone can be made comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Counseling can help even those whose pain remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all there _ it's just getting physicians to use it,''
said Randolph Merrick, a Virginia physician who is part of a
national movement to improve the treatment of pain.
</P>
<P>
   What is lacking, he said, is the right attitude _ and the will
to put it into practice. The unfortunate result can be seen in
nursing homes throughout the country, where older people experience
the worst pain and generally receive the least effective drugs for
it, surveys show.
</P>
<P>
   Health providers do not always ask the right questions, Merrick
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to trust our patients, listen to them and believe what
they're telling us,'' he said, adding that pain relief should be
offered to every dying person.
</P>
<P>
   At the Center to Improve Care of the Dying, director Lynn said
it is a matter of changing the culture, convincing patients they
need not die in pain, educating families to be more alert to the
symptoms, and persuading caregivers to set aside their fears of
legal reprisals for aggressively treating pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been quite enamored of developing new breakthroughs in
medicine,'' Lynn said. ``That's not it here. It's a pervasive
blindness.''
</P>
<P>
   How often, she asked, does evening television portray ``someone
very sick, and staying sick for a very long time, and then dying?
We don't want to see it or think about it. We just haven't made the
changes in the culture necessary to support those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Sharnoff's husband and daughter were holding her hand.
</P>
<P>
   It was early afternoon, New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting to hang on to life, it seemed that Sylvia
Sharnoff had finally realized it was OK to let go, that her book
was as complete as she could make it, that now it was time for the
work of dying.
</P>
<P>
   Winning this fight, in the end, meant letting go of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to tell exactly what she was experiencing. She
did not speak. Her breathing slowed, and the spaces between each
breath grew longer. Finally, there were no more breaths.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Steve Sharnoff said he felt that she was comfortable the
last few hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very peaceful and natural,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she knew we were there. The pain medications had to be
increased considerably in the end, but she didn't appear to be in
any particular pain when she died.'`
</P>
<P>
   The pain was gone. Sylvia Sharnoff had won.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare death.

 TO PAIN-DYING-SFCHRON)  
 FOR OTHERS' SAKE, THE FACE OF TORMENT CAN BE HIDDEN  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pain was a private experience for Shirley Press.
</P>
<P>
   For those around her, it was hard to tell just what she was
going through _ she had grown accustomed to a level of torment few
people could fathom, let alone tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Hers was one of the many faces that pain takes, a common one, as
it happens: a facade to spare those around her. A determination to
somehow enjoy what little of life was left to her.
</P>
<P>
   Press suffered hundreds of broken bones, the result of an
inherited condition, osteogenesis imperfecta. Living alone in a San
Mateo, Calif., apartment, she used a walker to get around as best
she could, too frail to risk excursions outside. She read novels
and biographies when she could muster the strength, but now her
eyesight was failing. She was nearly deaf, a complication of her
bone condition, and communicated by reading the lips of people
whose speech patterns she had studied.
</P>
<P>
   She chatted this way for more than an hour one recent afternoon,
leaning back on her couch beside visiting nurse Diane Gillen, who
patiently repeated the questions Press could not understand.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the interpreter, Press had trouble describing the
pain. She seemed remarkably cheerful.
</P>
<P>
   Someone handed her a color-coded pain scale, ranging from benign
blues and greens to searing yellows and reds at the extreme of
agony. check against pic! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Right now,'' she said, pointing, ``it's about here.''
</P>
<P>
   She picked a color just past ``distressing'' at the edge of
``horrible,'' though her pain did not show. She smiled, giggled and
made gentle jokes about being awakened at dawn by her small army of
caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   It soon became clear that she agreed to be interviewed mainly to
sing the praises of Gillen and her colleagues _ how selfless they
were, how tenderly they cared for her. ``Put that in the story,''
she ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Relenting finally, she said that coping with pain her whole life
had set up an armor, an attitude that emphasized enjoying the good
things in life, which, she said, were many but fleeting, so you had
no choice but to make the most of them when you could.
</P>
<P>
   Many pain sufferers are similarly reluctant to complain, said
Kathryn Tucker, legal affairs director for Compassion in Dying, an
advocacy group based in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   They worry that family members will regard them as drug addicts
if they demand high doses of opiates, or are afraid that their
doctors will take offense if they speak up. They might also assume
there is just no way around the suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think they're supposed to be in pain when they're
dying,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Press, 72, was not much interested in discussing pain or death.
She spoke fondly of friends and family, the ones who came to visit,
including a nephew, and the ones who lived too far away, including
a daughter, who inherited Press' bone condition, and who, by strict
agreement with her mother, was staying away these days, for fear of
being overwhelmed by a darkening vision of her own last days on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The lovely little things that most people take for granted, such
as shopping and taking walks, were only memories now, but memories
are sweet, too, Press said.
</P>
<P>
   How had she found the strength for such a positive attitude?
Press looked puzzled. Gillen had to move in close and loudly repeat
the question. She pondered a moment before answering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' she said finally, ``for recognizing this hasn't
been easy. But I really don't think I had any choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, she coughed too hard and broke two ribs _
particularly painful fractures that caused agony with every breath.
Doctors briefly hospitalized her in the hope of bringing the pain
under control, but were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   She was sent back home, as she wanted. She was suffering from
pneumonia. She developed a fever, stopped eating, would not drink.
</P>
<P>
   She could not move. She could no longer even read lips.
</P>
<P>
   She died in her bed about 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon, two hours
after Gillen's last visit. She could no longer express what she was
feeling, but those closest to her feared it was not an easy end to
a difficult life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we ever got her pain under control,'' Gillen
said. ``We were never successful getting her comfortable.''

 U.S. CENSUS SEEKS MORE MINORITY DATA  &HT;     By RAMON G. MCLEOD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ The head of the Census Bureau said Monday
that he is going to set aside money to conduct a controversial
survey to correct for an expected minority undercount in the 2000
census, despite hostility from the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Prewitt, who was recently appointed director of the U.S.
Bureau of the Census, told a Stanford University audience that he
planned to include the $200 million cost of a sampling technique as
part of what is expected to be a budget topping $7 billion for the
2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   What was once a civic exercise done at the start of each decade
has evolved into a political volcano that involves high-stakes
issues of power, money and racial identity.
</P>
<P>
   Minority groups, he said, have been pushing hard for sampling
and adjustment because ``the statistical system is at the heart of
the politics of race and ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numbers determine who matters and who is visible,'' he said.
``The African American population is worried about becoming a
minority of the minorities when historically that community has
always been the largest minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you mix in the money involved and the power involved,
along with identity politics, that is something worth fighting
about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And at the center of the fight is sampling.
</P>
<P>
   All sides in the battle agree that adjustment would almost
certainly increase the number of minorities reported in the
official government statistics.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1990 census, using a statistical technique similar to
that proposed for the 2000 census, it was determined that about 4
million U.S. residents _ including 1 million in California _ were
not counted because they refused to cooperate, had moved, were
missed because of incompetence by census-takers and myriad other
reasons. An estimated two-thirds of those not counted were
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have opposed the technique because of concern that
it would result in fewer Republican seats in Congress and in state
houses because states heavy in minorities, who tend to vote
Democratic, would pick up seats. California would have gained an
extra congressional seat _ most likely in Riverside County _ had
the 1990 Census been adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, the Supreme Court sided with Republicans,
prohibiting sampling and census adjustment for the purpose of
congressional apportionment.
</P>
<P>
   But apportionment, which is the distribution of the 435 seats in
the House of Representatives, is not the only important use of the
Census.
</P>
<P>
   The government numbers are also used to decide how to split up
$180 billion a year in federal funds, and the Supreme Court left
open the question of whether sampling is appropriate for that
purpose.
</P>

   Prewitt said the bureau believed it could conduct its sampling
program _ called accuracy and coverage evaluation _ and come up
with adjusted numbers by April 1, 2001. That is the deadline to
provide states with what he called ``the official numbers.''

   ``Obviously, if we don't get the money to do the (sampling), we
can't do that, and we haven't got the money yet,'' he said.

 UNDATED: liver transplants.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Donald A. Young, a senior vice president for policy and
clinical services of the American Association of Health Plans, the
nation's largest trade and lobbying association for private managed
care companies, said health care providers had an obligation to
treat their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first rule _ the principle of beneficence _ says you have
the responsibility to provide the care needed to the individual
without regard to your own interest,'' including financial
interests, he said. But, he added, ``Second, the principle of
stewardship provides that justice must be done for all where you
have to allocate resources.'' He said it would be unethical to
spend so much time and money or resources in saving one patient
that it became impossible to save a group of others. Although the
two principles may be contradictory, Young said, the goal is to try
not to violate either.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean for Ralph Benedetto? In the past, it might
have meant that it would not be right to give him a liver in a
transplant doomed to fail, if the organ might save someone else's
life. But today, Young said, ``It seems to me the doctors and
hospitals and the state of Florida and the HMOs should all get
together and find a way to work something out.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day on which the American Association of Health
Plans discussed the ethical considerations in the Benedetto case,
March 4, its spokesman said it had pondered the question further.
``We found the question highly disturbing,'' the spokesman said.
``We will do something.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, on March 5, after probing questions had been raised
about Benedetto's case, Kate C. Morgan, chief of the Florida Agency
for Health-Care Administration's Bureau of Managed Health Care,
said the case had prompted senior agency officials to make an
immediate change in the agency's rule on hepatitis B. ``We have
relayed that information to the HMOs, and Staywell is going to move
forward with the transplant'' as long as Benedetto is still a
candidate, Ms. Morgan said. Staywell confirmed that this was the
case, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But now Benedetto may no longer be viable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When he was tested in June in an effort to appeal Staywell's
denial, he was found to have responded well to various medications.
But now, Dr. Enrique J. Martinez, his hepatologist, said, the virus
is renewing its attack.
</P>
<P>
   If events had been conspiring against Ralph Benedetto, now they
seemed to be mobilized on his behalf. On the afternoon of March 5,
Martinez's transplant center, Lifelink, a nonprofit institute
affiliated with Tampa General, was notified that it had just
received approval to use an experimental drug, adefovir, that was
not yet approved for general use but could be prescribed by
selected research centers on a compassionate-use basis. Preliminary
trials have found it to be 90 percent successful in controlling the
recurrence of hepatitis B viral attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he believed the chances were excellent now that
the adefovir would enable Benedetto to be put on the list to await
a transplant within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Several health care professionals said it was heartening to see
senior state health officials act so quickly in this case, but also
expressed concern. Vierling of the American Liver Foundation, said:
``Those recent developments are, of course, good news for the
Benedettos. But it is still disturbing that it took the fight and
persistence of a person like Theresa Benedetto and the action of a
few key people in the system before it could be spurred into
action. And it disturbs me that many dying patients with hepatitis
B still cannot get transplants.''

OF LIFE, DEATH AND THE RULES OF LIVER TRANSPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ralph Benedetto is dying in his mobile home in Clearwater, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Swirling around him is a debate over whether he and patients
like him should be denied liver transplants that might save their
lives _ specifically, whether the nation's health care system
denies transplants out of failure to keep abreast of medical and
technical advances or out of eagerness to save money.
</P>
<P>
   Benedetto, 44, a disabled Medicaid patient, contracted hepatitis
B 10 years ago from a blood transfusion he received after he was
struck by a drunken driver. Two years ago, his doctors said his
disease had progressed to the point where he could die at any
moment without a liver transplant. But his health maintenance
organization refused to pay for the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO, Staywell Health Care in Tampa, Fla., cited guidelines
issued by the state of Florida recommending against liver
transplants to hepatitis B patients on the ground that the virus
would destroy a replacement liver just as it did the original,
leaving the patient just as sick and wasting a scarce organ in a
transplant doomed to fail. The federal guidelines that apply to 39
million Medicare recipients say the same.
</P>
<P>
   But medical researchers and liver transplant surgeons said
advances in the treatment of hepatitis B had left the guidelines
outdated. Since the early 1990s, drugs started to become available
to better treat the disease and now, the researchers say, the drugs
appear to have blocked liver damage in more than 80 percent of the
thousands of hepatitis B patients who have received transplants in
states that allow them.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there is now wide agreement that hepatitis B, in and
of itself, is no longer a valid reason to deny someone a liver
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at the Florida Agency for Health-Care
Administration said it was the agency's policy not to discuss
guidelines in detail. Benedetto's condition changes from day to
day, making it difficult for him to be interviewed. But his former
wife, who is caring for him, said she was furious when the
transplant doctors had recommended was denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not believe Ralph would simply be allowed to die when
everybody knew successful treatments were available,'' Theresa
Benedetto said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dr. David R. Nelson, a professor of medicine and an expert
in hepatology at the Shands Hospital of the University of Florida
in Gainesville, and Dr. Scott E. Hallgren of the Florida Center for
Gastroenterology at Pinellas Park, had determined in June 1998 that
Benedetto was in danger of dying at any moment, but that he had an
excellent chance of regaining his health with a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO insisted that the sole reason for its denial was that
hepatitis B patients did not meet the state criteria for
transplants. Costs for the procedure are high, the company
acknowledged, with the average hospital bill for the operation in
Florida at $117,000, plus the costs of finding a suitable organ and
the subsequent costs of preventing rejection of the organ or
recurrence of viral infection, said Nancy Gareau, Staywell's vice
president for operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company, under contract with Florida to manage Medicaid
patient care, covers five or six transplants a month, Ms. Gareau
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the HMO refused to authorize a transplant, Mrs. Benedetto
said, Benedetto was turned away by three hospitals. Jackson
Memorial Medical Center, affiliated with University of Miami School
of Medicine, said it would not do the transplant unless Benedetto
produced a $150,000 down payment, Mrs. Benedetto said. Shands
Hospital required $136,000 down.
</P>
<P>
   Both hospitals confirmed Mrs. Benedetto's account and said the
total bills could run much higher. Benedetto, unemployed because of
his disability, could not begin to pay that cost. Tampa General
Hospital also turned him away, because it said its doctors were not
convinced that Benedetto would survive a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at several American medical centers, health care
experts and doctors do not fault hospitals that seek assurance they
will be reimbursed for transplants, whose high cost, if
uncompensated, would quickly drive them out of business. ``And if
it did one transplant free, wouldn't it be unjust to deny one to
someone else who also needed one,'' said Dr. John M. Vierling,
chairman of the American Liver Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   And while some doctors characterized Benedetto's experience as
yet another example of how tight-fisted HMOs harm patients, others
said that in their experience most HMOs were fully cooperative in
covering transplants where they were warranted.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Vierling said, the original decision in the 1980s
to exclude patients with hepatitis B from transplant rosters was
legitimate. The problem now, he said, is adapting the rules to
changing medical conditions. Once a procedure is excluded, he said,
it is often a long and tortuous process to get the rule changed.
That is true in the case of hepatitis B, he said, even though new
treatments have produced long-term success rates equal to overall
rates for liver transplants.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gloria Belisle is probably not the kind of patient doctors had
in mind when they first envisioned treating medically underserved
people from afar with high-technology diagnostic tools.
</P>
<P>
   Like any patient receiving such care in rural America, Mrs.
Belisle, who has congestive heart failure, does not generally see
the medical practitioners following her condition. Instead, twice a
day she sits in front of a computerized machine that asks, ``How
can I help you?'' It then proceeds to measure everything from her
blood pressure to her heart rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Belisle, 50, lives not on a farm in the outreaches of
rural America, but on the South Side of Chicago. To receive her
examination, she need only make her way to the dining room of her
two-story house.
</P>
<P>
   She is part of a trend in the practice of ``telemedicine.''
Increasingly, authorities say, telemedical equipment, from the most
basic to the most elaborate, is spreading from small medical
centers in the underserved parts of America that spurred its birth
several decades ago to homes in densely populated areas of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by health care providers who hope to cut costs and by
advocates who say the practice actually increases the attention
given to patients, electronic remote home care is being used to
monitor patients with widely diverse conditions including chronic
illnesses and high-risk pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The technology has also helped shorten hospital stays, because
patients can now be monitored at home. And doctors say it is
especially useful for homebound patients like the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have come to realize that it can be just as
hard to get across an urban area as it is to go 200 miles in a
rural area,'' said Dr. Ace Allen, a Kansas physician who edits
Telemedicine Today magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Allen and two colleagues reported a sharp increase
in the use of the remote equipment, both in and out of the home,
from 1,715 consultations in 1993 to a projected 90,000 last year.
In the last several years, the magazine reported, usage has doubled
each year, a trend that Dr. Allen said seemed to be holding true
for the remote care at home.
</P>
<P>
   And as high-capacity Internet lines spread to ordinary
households, allowing people to quickly transmit high quality video
images and other data, the practice is expected to become more
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few would suggest that this kind of home care will
overshadow the traditional role of the remote monitoring: treating
people in hard to reach places.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Belisle, who has been using the technology for about
two years, it has helped her control a condition for which her
doctors had considered a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Morning and evening, Mrs. Belisle sits in front of HANC, or
home-assisted nursing care. She attaches three electronic leads to
her chest so that the machine can check her heart with an
electrocardiogram. She slips her arm into a cuff so that her blood
pressure can be measured. She puts her finger in a small sleeve so
that her pulse and blood-oxygen level can be taken. And she enters
her weight. (The machine can also handle an electronic stethoscope,
allowing remote examination of the heart and lungs, and can move
video images in both directions.)
</P>
<P>
   The machine stores the information and relays it to nurses at
the home-care agency monitoring her condition _ immediately, if
there is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   By her own admission, before her machine arrived, when nurses
visited several times a week, Mrs. Belisle was not always the best
patient. During the day, her husband was at work and her son was at
school. Weakened by her illness, she did not always find the
strength to take her medicine.
</P>
<P>
   HANC, however, is not the type to be ignored. It tells Mrs.
Belisle when it is time to take her medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets louder and louder until you respond,'' she said.
Eventually, if his demand remains unsatisfied, the machine contacts
the nurses.
</P>
<P>
   While the machine Mrs. Belisle is using is top of the line,
costing about $12,000, doctors across the country say they have
been getting good results with equipment that costs far less, often
under $1,000. Dr. Allen sees a time when, even for patients with
only a short-term need, doctors will be able to phone in an order
for equipment to be delivered to the home. ``My personal image is
of the Domino's pizza-delivery model,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns remain over whether the remote equipment will strip
medical treatment of its human element. Advocates say that patients
and, over time, health providers have been generally positive about
the technology, won over by the machines' power to allow numerous
contacts with a doctor or nurse each day, instead of just several a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Belisle acknowledged she was concerned at first. ``I miss
my nurses,'' she said. ``When they first stopped coming, I didn't
know if I could cope without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, she said, her machine won her over, and now she has
nothing but praise for her caregiver _ or, almost. ``My only
complaint with HANC: I hate him on Sunday morning,'' Mrs. Belisle
said.
</P>
<P>
   For HANC, Sunday is just another day, which means that at 7:30
a.m. sharp, he starts calling his patient over for her first
checkup. She tries to ignore the demands, but eventually the
machine always wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like sleeping late on Sundays,'' Mrs. Belisle laments.

DISPENSING OF DRUGS ON INTERNET STIRS DEBATE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. James De Yarman specializes in performing hair transplants
at his clinic in San Diego. Last September, he took his expertise
online, setting up a site on the World Wide Web called
DrPropecia.com. There, he offers information about the drug
Propecia, which promotes hair growth in men. Prospective patients
can fill out an online medical history form, which De Yarman
reviews for a $50 fee. If he determines that the drug would be
useful for a patient, he then prescribes it and sells it to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to assume they're telling me the truth,'' he said.
``I'm not a drugstore. I look at this as providing a service, going
online to sell it. What would I do different if they were to come
into the office?''
</P>
<P>
   De Yarman and others, who essentially function as both physician
and pharmacist online, are just one example of the ways in which
the World Wide Web is changing how prescription drugs are changing
hands. In other cases, international pharmacies, which sell drugs
without prescriptions that may not be regulated in this country,
offer online signposts for their wares. And, in the freewheeling
climate of the Internet, patients are exchanging information and
selling leftover drugs to one another.
</P>
<P>
   These activities are raising questions about how drug
transactions should be regulated _ and about how, with the
borderless, seemingly infinite shape of the online medium, they can
be.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has leaped ahead of the agencies that govern
prescription drugs in the United States. Typically, drugs are
approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration, prescribed by
doctors who are licensed by state medical boards, and dispensed by
pharmacies licensed by state pharmaceutical boards. But by using
the Internet, people can often purchase drugs from sources not
licensed by these agencies. These activities have long gone on
off-line, but have been difficult to detect. Now these practices
seem to be booming online.
</P>
<P>
   One concern stems not from the well-advertised Internet
drugstores like Drugstore.com or Soma.com, both of which require a
patient to fax a prescription from a doctor to have it filled
online, but from sites like MDpharmacy.com, Net-Dr.com and
US-care.com. These sites, like De Yarman's, circumvent the
traditional medical relationships by allowing a patient without a
prescription to fill out a consultation form online, pay a fee for
its review and, if approved, receive drugs through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   While the American Medical Association said it was not a
violation of its code of ethics for a doctor to sell prescription
drugs, it is an ethical violation to sell drugs without a
face-to-face consultation. State law in California, where De Yarman
does business, prohibits the sale of drugs without an examination.
But most laws and codes which govern medicine were written before
the Internet, said Greg Abrams, legal counsel to the California
Medical Society, and do not factor in the questions raised by the
medium.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lamb, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, recently purchased
oxycodone, a potentially addictive pain reliever classified as a
controlled substance in the United States, from a Spanish pharmacy
he found over the Internet, because no doctor he visited locally
would prescribe the drug for his back pain. ``Foreign pharmacies
willing to ship without prescription are a growing source who has
seized on this gap because their countries do not regulate drugs
the way the U.S. does,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Randy Wykoff, the associate commissioner for operations at
the FDA, said the sale of illegal or unapproved products is, of all
the violations made possible by the Internet, of particular concern
to the agency. In recent years, he said, several staff members who
would typically investigate medical fraud have been redeployed to
look for fraudulent practices online.
</P>
<P>
   Besides buying from foreign-operated Web sites, some Internet
users swap drugs, facilitated by bulletin boards and other Web
areas that foster a flea market environment online. One participant
in an online infertility group, for example, offered to sell
``leftover'' drugs she had purchased from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Determining which actions to take and which policies to rewrite
to acknowledge the vast impact of the Internet on the sale of
pharmaceuticals will take time. The House Commerce Committee last
month commissioned the General Accounting Office to conduct a study
on the scope of the prescription drug trade online.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, the trade group
for pharmacies, announced last month that it is developing a seal
of approval for online pharmacies to help customers determine which
ones are legitimate. The first seals are expected to be issued by
May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not concerned about the economics, but about patient
safety,'' said Carmen Catizone, the executive director of the
pharmacy association.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Dr. De Yarman sees more benefits than pitfalls in
extending his medical practice online. ``This is the future of
medicine,'' he said.

   Look inside the machinery of a human cell, and you would see
that its working parts are composed largely of proteins and its
data storage is handled by DNA. But look a little closer, and a
third agent seems to be running many of the trickiest parts of the
show.
</P>
<P>
   That agent is a stubby tangle of a molecule, bristling with
curlicues and gnarled as a coelacanth. Like that ancient fish, it
is a living relic, yet its roots stretch deeper than the oldest
fossils. There are many reasons to suppose that RNA, short for
ribonucleic acid, lies tantalizingly close to the origin of life.
</P>
<P>
   RNA handles much of the information processing of cells, even
though its better known chemical cousin, DNA, has been assigned the
chore of archive management. The machine tools that build cell's
proteins are also made largely of RNA. To those who wonder how the
system got to be that way, a compelling thought is that RNA must be
the most ancient part of the system, and everything else accreted
around it. If so, the best chance of understanding how life first
arose on earth may be to understand RNA.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The RNA World,'' a book whose second edition was published
recently by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.,
some leading experts on RNA peer as deeply as they can into the
events of some 4 billion years ago when a bunch of molecules seem
to have dropped through the wormhole between two universes, from
chemistry to life. Much has been learned about RNA since the book's
first edition in 1993, yet the new knowledge, rather than
bolstering the theory of RNA's leading role, seems just as much to
accentuate its difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago the full chemical structure of the DNA of a
bacterium was determined for the first time. The microbe, known as
Haemophilus influenzae, turned out to have 1,830,137 units of DNA,
coding for 1,743 working parts, most of them proteins. That is a
complex system, but it depends, like all today's living organisms,
on just three principal kinds of chemical: DNA and RNA for data
processing, and proteins to catalyze the required chemical
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of how life got started on earth, it seems
dauntingly unlikely that information-carrying molecules and
reaction-catalyzing molecules would emerge at the same time and
place. That impasse seemed to have been bridged with the discovery
in 1982 that certain kinds of RNA have catalytic properties. It
followed that a single RNA molecule could in principle both carry
information and catalyze reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the RNA world, a phrase coined by Walter Gilbert
of Harvard, held that in the beginning there were no proteins and
no DNA, just RNA molecules that constructed more RNA molecules from
chemical subunits known as nucleotides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first stage of evolution proceeds, then, by RNA molecules
performing the catalytic activities necessary to assemble
themselves from a nucleotide soup,'' Gilbert wrote in an essay of
1986. ``The RNA molecules evolve in self-replicating patterns,
using recombination and mutation to explore new functions and to
adapt to new niches.''
</P>
<P>
   As the RNA molecules grew more capable, according to apostles of
the RNA theory, they deployed their catalytic properties to direct
the synthesis of proteins. The proteins, being more efficient
catalysts, took over the housework of the cell, and DNA, a
longer-lived molecule, assumed the role of hard disk drive. If this
conjecture is correct, almost all that is left to explain about the
origin of life is how the first RNA molecules arose from the
chemicals likely to have existed on the primitive earth.
</P>
<P>
   Nucleotides, the components from which RNA is made, consist of
three simple chemical units strung together _ a phosphate group, a
sugar known as ribose, and a sidechain ring of atoms known as a
base. The phosphates and bases are reasonably likely to have been
present among the chemicals on the early earth. For example
adenine, one of the four kinds of base, can be formed naturally
from two common chemicals, ammonia and hydrogen cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   Ribose is more problematic. When formaldehyde, the simple
chemical from which sugars are likely to have been made, is brewed
in suitable conditions, it makes a syrup of sugars, only 2 percent
of which is ribose, an unpromising route to ribose nucleotides. But
Albert Eschenmoser, the chemist, recently found that if phosphate
is added to the mix, the outcome is quite different: the major
product of the brew is ribose phosphate.
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists hope that with only a few more chemical
surprises like this, the problem of the origin of life will go
away. But many chemists are unconvinced. No one has yet figured out
a plausible way of loading the bases onto ribose or ribose
phosphate under the circumstances likely to have prevailed four
billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald F. Joyce of the Scripps Research Institute and Leslie E.
Orgel of the Salk Institute write in ``The RNA World'' that they
believe the appearance of small RNA molecules ``would have been a
near miracle.'' And Thomas R. Cech, an RNA expert at the University
of Colorado, said in an interview that RNA ``is far too complex to
have been the first self-replicating molecule, as if it emerged
like Athena from Zeus' head.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Cech and Orgel, a leading authority on the origin of life,
suggest that there was a pre-RNA world, in which the starring role
was played by some other self-replicating, catalytic molecule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what it was but we are looking,'' Orgel said.
</P>
<P>
   Several alternative genetic systems are now being studied. One,
known as pyranosyl-RNA, has a six-atom ring in place of the
five-atom ring of ordinary ribose. Another, called peptide nucleic
acid, has the same chemical backbone as proteins but with nucleic
acid bases in place of protein's usual amino acid side-chains.
</P>
<P>
   Both pyranosyl-RNA and peptide nucleic acid display the behavior
to be expected of a genetic molecule, such as linking together in
double chains like the double helix of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want DNA-like double helices, there are probably
scores'' of molecules that would serve as genetic systems, Orgel
said. ``It raises the question of why we have RNA and DNA instead
of others that are equally good.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a pre-RNA world creates many possibilities for
researchers exploring prebiotic reactions, the chemistry that led
to the first living entities. But in some ways it sets the search
for the origin of life back to square one. Pyranosyl-RNA and
peptide nucleic acid may be promising candidates, but no one yet
knows if their spontaneous formation is any more plausible than
that of RNA.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the RNA world is also unproven in its central
assertion, that an RNA molecule could catalyze its own replication.
The natural RNA catalysts found today sponsor quite simple chemical
reactions. Chemists like David P. Bartel of the Whitehead Institute
in Cambridge, Mass., have been trying to construct RNA molecules
with a more extensive repertoire. Some RNAs show promising behavior
such as being able to make copies of a short stretch of another
RNA. But that is a far cry from a self-copying molecule.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has come close to getting a self-replicating RNA,''
Bartel said. ``It's a long road. It would be exciting to get an RNA
that can copy a complete turn of the helix.''

   The Breitling Orbiter 3, the first manned balloon ever to make a
non-stop trip around the earth, will be permanently housed at the
Air and Space Museum in Washington, its owners have announced.
</P>
<P>
   The big balloon, which completed its epochal flight on March 21,
has been offered a berth at the museum, taking its place with a
host of other famous aircraft, including the Voyager airplane,
which in 1986 completed the first unrefueled nonstop flight ever
made around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Breitling was built in England, financed and registered in
Switzerland and piloted by Dr. Bertrand Piccard, who is Swiss, and
Brian Jones, who is British. The pilots completed their three-week
trip when they landed in Egypt on March 21, after flying 29,055
miles. No previous attempts came even close.
</P>
<P>
   Walton Ferrell, a spokesman for the Air and Space Museum, said
the balloon would arrive in Washington this autumn. ``The Breitling
Orbiter 3 will take its place with the Voyager aircraft and with
the Winnie May, the airplane in which Wiley Post made a series of
solo flights taking him completely around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For their feat, Piccard, a psychiatrist, and Jones, a ballooning
expert, will be awarded a cup and a $1 million prize from the
Anheuser-Busch Corporation, half of which will be donated to
charities.
</P>
<P>
   The Breitling company, a maker of specialty watches, announced
that the balloon and its crew capsule would be exhibited in
Switzerland until mid-July at the Lucerne Transport Museum.
Thereafter, the capsule and most of the balloon will be presented
to the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum. Parts of the
balloon envelope will be kept in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   A Breitling spokesman said the entire balloon crew, including
the pilots and Alan Noble, the mission director, would arrive in
New York City Tuesday to begin a tour of the United States.

PHILADELPHIA: in Mesoamerica. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Archeologists have thought that the undeciphered Indus script,
which seemed to appear first around 2500, may have been inspired in
part from trade contacts with Mesopotamia. But new excavations in
the ruins of the ancient city of Harappa suggest an earlier and
presumably independent origin of Indus writing.
</P>
<P>
   In a report from the field, distributed on the Internet, Dr.
Jonathan Mark Kenoyer of the University of Wisconsin and Dr.
Richard H. Meadow of Harvard University showed pictures of marks
incised on potshards that they interpreted as evidence for the use
of writing signs by Indus people as early as 3300 B.C. If these are
indeed proto-writing examples, the discovery indicates an
independent origin of Indus writing contemporary with the Sumerian
and Egyptian inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Meadow, using e-mail, the electronic age's version of the king
of Uruk's clay tablet, confirmed that the inscribed marks were
``similar in some respects to those later used in the Indus
script.'' The current excavations, he added, were uncovering ``very
significant findings at Harappa with respect to the Indus script.''
</P>
<P>
   At the symposium, though, Dr. Gregory Possehl, a Pennsylvania
archeologist who specializes in the Indus civilization and had
examined the pictures, cautioned against jumping to such
conclusions. One had to be careful, he said, not to confuse
potter's marks, graffiti and fingernail marks with symbols of
nascent writing.
</P>
<P>
   Of the earliest writing systems, scholars said, only the
Sumerian, Chinese and Mesoamerican ones seemed clearly to be
independent inventions. Reviewing the relationship between early
Chinese bronze art, ``oracle bones'' and writing, Dr. Louisa Huber,
a researcher at Harvard's Fairbanks Center for East Asian Research,
concluded, ``Chinese writing looks to be pristine.''
</P>
<P>
   But few pronouncements about early writing go undisputed. Dr.
Victor Mair, a professor of Chinese language at Penn, offered
evidence indicating, he said, that ``the Chinese writing system may
well have received vital inputs from West Asian and European
systems of writing and proto-writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mair cited an intriguing correspondence between the Chinese
script and 22 Phoenician letters and also Western-like symbols on
pottery and the bodies of mummies found in the western desert of
China. The recent discoveries of the mummies, wearing garments of
Western weaves and having Caucasoid facial features, have prompted
theories of foreign influences on Chinese culture in the first and
second millennia B.C. It had already been established that the
chariot and bronze metallurgy reached China from the West.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one seemed ready to endorse his thesis, Mair said,
``We simply do not know for certain whether the Chinese script was
or was not independently created.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Damerow, a specialist in Sumerian cuneiform at the Max
Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, said,
``Whatever the mutual influences of writing systems of different
cultures may be, their great variety shows, at least, that the
development of writing, once it is initiated, attains a
considerable degree of independence and flexibility to adapt a
coding system to specific characteristics of the language to be
represented.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he accepted the conventional view that writing
necessarily started as some kind of representation of words by
pictures. New studies of Sumerian proto-cuneiform, he said,
challenge this intepretation. The structures of this earliest
writing, for example, did not match the syntax of a language.
Proto-cuneiform seemed severely restricted, compared with spoken
language, dealing mainly in lists and categories, not in sentences
and narrative.
</P>
<P>
   This presumably reflects writing's origins and first
applications in economic administration in a growing, increasingly
complex society, scholars said. Most of the Uruk tablets were
documents about property, inventory, and, even then, taxes. The
only texts that do not concern administrative activities, Damerow
said, were cuneiform lexicons that were apparently written as
school exercises by scribes in training.
</P>
<P>
   For at least two decades, in fact, Dr. Denise Schmandt-Besserat,
a University of Texas archeologist, has argued that the first
writing grew directly out of a counting system practiced by
Sumerian accountants. They used molded clay ``tokens,'' each one
specially shaped to represent a jar of oil, a large or small
container of grain, or a particular kind of livestock. When the
tokens were placed inside hollow clay spheres, the number and type
of tokens inside was recorded on the ball with impressions
resembling the tokens. Finally, simplifying matters, the token
impressions were replaced with inscribed signs, and writing was
invented.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dr. Schmandt-Besserat has won wide support, some
linguists question her thesis and other scholars, like Dr. Pittman
of Penn, think it too narrow an interpretation. They emphasized
that pictorial representation and writing evolved together, part of
the same cultural context that fostered experimentation in
communication through symbols.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the token system is a forerunner of
writing, and really important,'' Dr. Pittman said in an interview.
``But I have an argument with her evidence for a link between
tokens and signs, and she doesn't open up the process to include
picture-making and all other kinds of information-storage practices
that are as important as the tokens.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Schmandt-Besserat, who did not attend the symposium,
vigorously defended herself in a telephone interview. ``My
colleagues say the signs on seals were a beginning of writing, but
show me a single sign on a seal that becomes a sign in writing,''
she said. ``They say that designs on pottery were a beginning of
writing, but show me a single sign of writing you can trace back to
a pot _ it doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   In its first 500 years, she asserted, cuneiform writing was used
almost solely for recording economic information. ``The first
information that writing gives you is only the same information the
tokens were dealing with,'' she said. ``When you start putting more
on the tablets, products plus the name of who has delivered and
received them, that is where art would enter the picture. Then
writing is out of the box, in all directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Damerow agreed that cuneiform writing appeared to have developed
in two stages, first as a new but limited means of recording
economic information, later as a broader encoding of spoken
language for stories, arguments, descriptions or messages from one
ruler to another.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it was a long way from the origin of writing to truly
literate societies. At the symposium, scholars noted that the early
rulers could not write or read; they relied on scribes for their
messages, record keeping and storytelling. In Egypt, most early
hieroglyphics were inscribed in places beyond the public eye, high
on monuments or deep in tombs.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, said Dr. Pascal Vernus of the University of Paris,
early writing was less administrative than sacred and ideological,
``a way of creating and describing the world as a dominating elite
wants it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Piotr Michalowski, professor of Near East civilizations at
the University of Michigan, said the Uruk proto-cuneiform writing,
whatever its antecedents, was ``so radically different as to be a
complete break with the past, a system different from anything
else.'' It no doubt served to store, preserve and communicate
information, but also was a new instrument of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it's because I grew up in Stalinist Poland,''
Michalowski said, ``but I say coercion and control were early
writing's first important purpose, a new way to control how people
live.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Sumerians had a story to explain their
invention of writing more than 5,000 years ago. It seems a
messenger of the king of Uruk arrived at the court of a distant
ruler so exhausted from the journey that he was unable to deliver
the oral message. So the king, being clever, came up with a
solution. He patted some clay and set down the words of his next
messages on a tablet.
</P>
<P>
   A Sumerian epic celebrates the achievement:
</P>
<P>
   Before that time, writing on clay had not yet existed,
</P>
<P>
   But now, as the sun rose, so it was!
</P>
<P>
   The king of Kullaba ((Uruk)) had set words on a tablet, so it
was!
</P>
<P>
   A charming just-so, or so-it-was, story, its retelling at a
recent symposium on the origins or writing, held here at the
University of Pennsylvania, both amused and frustrated scholars. It
reminded them that they could expect little help _ only a myth _
from the Sumerians themselves, presumably the first writing people,
in understanding how and why the invention responsible for the
great divide in human culture between prehistory and history had
come about.
</P>
<P>
   The archeologists, historians and other scholars at the meeting
smiled at the absurdity of a king's writing a letter that its
recipient could not read. They also doubted that the earliest
writing was a direct rendering of speech. Writing more than likely
began as a separate and distinct symbolic system of communication,
like painting, sculpture and oral storytelling, and only later
merged with spoken language.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the story, the Sumerians, who lived in Mesopotamia, the
lower valley of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in what is now
southern Iraq, seemed to understand writing's transforming
function. As Dr. Holly Pittman, the Pennsylvania art historian who
organized the symposium, observed, writing ``arose out of the need
to store information and transmit information outside of human
memory and over time and over space.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchanging interpretations and new information, the scholars
acknowledged that they still had no fully satisfying answers to the
most important questions of exactly how and why writing was
developed. Many of them favored a broad explanation of writing's
origins in the visual arts, pictograms of things being transformed
into increasingly abstract symbols for things, names and eventually
words in speech. Their views clashed with a widely held theory
among archeologists that writing grew out of the pieces of clay in
assorted sizes and shapes that Sumerian accountants had used as
tokens to keep track of livestock and stores of grain.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars at the meeting also conceded that they had no
definitive answer to the question of whether writing was invented
only once and spread elsewhere or arose independently several times
in several places, like Egypt, the Indus Valley, China and among
the Olmecs and Maya of Mexico and Central America. But they
criticized recent findings suggesting that writing might have
developed earlier in Egypt than in Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Dr. Guenter Dreyer, director of the German
Archeological Institute in Egypt, announced new radiocarbon dates
for tombs at Abydos, on the Nile about 250 miles south of Cairo.
The dates indicated that some hieroglyphic inscriptions on pots,
bone and ivory in the tombs were made at least as early as 3200
B.C., possibly 3400. It was now an ``open question,'' Dreyer said,
whether writing appeared first in Egypt or Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   At the symposium, Dr. John Baines, an Oxford University
Egyptologist who had just visited Dreyer, expressed skepticism in
polite terms. ``I'm suspicious of the dates,'' he said in an
interview. ``I think he's being very bold in his readings of these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The preponderance of archeological evidence has shown that the
urbanizing Sumerians were the first to develop writing, in 3200 or
3300 B.C. These are the dates for many clay tablets with a
proto-cuneiform script found at the site of the ancient city of
Uruk. The tablets bore pictorial symbols for the names of people,
places and things for governing and commerce. The Sumerian script
gradually evolved from the pictorial to the abstract, but it was
probably at least five centuries before the writing came to
represent recorded spoken language.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian hieroglyphics are so different from Sumerian cuneiform,
Baines said, that they were probably invented independently not
long after Sumerian writing. If anything, the Egyptians may have
gotten the idea of writing from the Sumerians, with whom they had
contacts in Syria, but nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the writing idea became more widespread at the
beginning of the third millennium B.C. The Elamites of southern
Iran developed a proto-writing system then, perhaps influenced by
the proto-cuneiform of their Sumerian neighbors, and before the
millennium was out, writing appeared in the Indus River Valley of
what is now Pakistan and western India, then in Syria and Crete and
parts of Turkey. Writing in China dates back to the Shang period
toward the end of the second millennium B.C., and it dates to the
first millennium B.C. in Mesoamerica.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists pointed to other, subtler dangers. What, for
example, of the incentive for professors who need research money to
gear their work toward areas with the greatest potential commercial
applications, rather than the greatest inherent scientific worth,
in hopes of attracting corporate sponsors? And what of the
temptation to sign contracts with sponsors all but giving away the
shop, by, say, long delaying publication?
</P>
<P>
   A study by Massachusetts General Hospital policy analysts of
more than 2,000 life-sciences researchers published in 1997 found
that about 20 percent reported having delayed publication of their
results for more than six months, or not publishing at all, mainly
because of their relationships with private sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association said the withholding of data was less than widespread,
it said it had affected a significant number of faculty,
particularly the most productive and entrepreneurial.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with money, Alan Hartford, a
Massachusetts General Hospital research fellow, told the
conference, but ``what we must guard against is the loss of
professional values.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another, strong side to the issue that emphasizes the
good that is done by private money: studies have found that
professors with private financing publish more, teach a bit more,
and serve more as department chairs and journal editors. Indeed,
when this topic has come up in science publications, there has been
a solid chorus of voices from professors who say they see private
money as an overwhelming good, and feel unconstrained by the
agreements they negotiate with companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the Massachusetts General report also found that privately
financed researchers kept more secrets, and were three times as
likely as non-commercial professors to delay publication and to
deny colleagues access to their data.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, said Martin Michaelson, a lawyer specializing in
representing universities, the academic world seems to be divided
into two types of professors, one doing largely unappreciated
research without much funding, the other a kind of academic
rainmaker who brings in industry money and becomes ``a reigning
prince.'' And the problem, Michaelson said, is that ``they are
often not talking to each other.'' And frequently when such
entrepreneurial professors do talk about their work, they want to
reveal only enough to titillate potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, too, said Charles M. Vest, MIT's president,
is that the boundary between science and technology is increasingly
blurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``And because technology frequently is tied directly to
commercial interests,'' he said, ``it presents an even fuzzier
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what to do? Proposals varied, from calls for faculties and
administrations to defend information flow more vigorously, to more
concrete suggestions that universities refrain from taking equity
positions in companies or rein in professors tempted to sign what
they should not.
</P>
<P>
   Lita L. Nelsen, director of MIT's Technology Licensing Office
described one kind of clampdown. Sometimes, she said, ``faculty who
need money to do research to get tenure have to be told, `You
cannot sign that agreement; we will not honor it.'''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had the general impression that there was a
``drifting tide,'' at work, the attractive force of money, and not
enough of a counter-force. Maybe, she said, the conference would
get that countervailing force going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wonderful,'' said Howard K. Schachman, a
biochemist at the University of California at Berkeley, ``to return
to the era when collegiality and sharing took precedence over
commercial interests.''

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In the old, Cold War days, when gathered
university scientists would turn to complaining about how secrecy
strictures sometimes kept them from sharing their work, they
usually meant pesky national security restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   These days, they tend to mention non-disclosure agreements,
worldwide patent rights, royalty streams, intellectual property
fights _ in a word, money. And all the commercial hindrances to
open science carried by the powerful wave of private capital that
has been washing into the country's research universities in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The strings that often come with private research money _ the
publication delays while patents and profits are pursued, the
proprietary findings _ hold the pernicious potential to impede the
free exchange of information that speeds scientific progress,
speaker after speaker warned last week at a conference on ``Secrecy
in Science'' held by the American Association for the Advancement
of Science and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, private research financing is also undeniably good
for scientific progress, many noted, from the biotechnology
companies' bankrolling academic gene research to the start-ups
owned by professors who work that much harder in the hope of
getting rich.
</P>
<P>
   At MIT, one official said, private capital has gone from paying
for about 5 percent of research 15 years ago to nearly 25 percent
today. But, conference organizers worried aloud, at what price?
They called for a national dialogue to explore just how much the
secrecy requirements imposed by private finance cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercialization of science,'' said Irving A. Lerch,
chairman of the science association's Committee on Scientific
Freedom and Responsibility, ``has resulted in a new regime of
secrecy which is very concerning to the scientific community,
something which we have to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the scientific enterprise _ which depends
greatly on its own control, on its openness and exchange _ and the
need of our commercial patrons to recover their investment, those
create tensions that are tremendously important.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern over the commercial influence on science is not new, but
the advent of the biotechnology era seems to be bringing it to a
head. Compared with other industries, biotechnology companies rely
very heavily on academic work for the scientific underpinnings of
their products.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, said Robert Cook-Deegan, director of the
National Cancer Policy Board, private investment in health-related
research surpassed the public money put into it, and biotechnology
companies report that about a quarter of them are heavily dependent
on academic research, and another quarter are somewhat dependent.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, said Nelson Y.S. Kiang, a professor emeritus at MIT, the
committee ``has come across a number of cases that all had the same
characteristics: someone had a scientific result that he or she was
enjoined from making public because it went against the interests
of a third party, either government or a commercial business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These were not aberrations,'' Kiang continued. ``It looks like
this is a pattern which is built into our social institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Among cases brought up at the conference was that of Dr. David
Kern, a Brown University occupational health specialist who
described the pressure he encountered not to publish his findings
of a new, potentially fatal occupational lung disease he had
identified among workers at a local textile company that had hired
him as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Kern had signed no scientific non-disclosure agreement, he said,
but the company insisted that he had and pressured his employers,
Memorial Hospital in Pawtucket, R.I., and Brown University, to
silence him. After Kern published anyway, his employers dissolved
his program, Rhode Island's only occupational health center, he
said, and barred him from treating the company's employees. They
also eliminated his tenurelike position. His contract with Memorial
was not renewed, and will run out in three months.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending the conference and put forth as a cautionary
example was Dr. Nancy Olivieri, a researcher at the University of
Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. She recently
received a settlement and was reinstated by her employers after a
three-way dispute between her university and a Canadian drug
company, Apotex, Inc., over the publication of her studies of a new
drug for thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder.
</P>
<P>
   A third case was that of Dr. Betty Dong, a pharmacy professor at
the University of California at San Francisco whose research showed
that generic thyroid drugs worked as well as their brand-name
equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   Because she had signed a confidentiality contract with the drug
company that financed her work, Boots Pharmaceuticals, it took
almost seven years for Dr. Dong's results to be published in a top
medical journal. In that time, the paper's authors estimated,
Americans could have saved about $365 million a year by using the
cheaper generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of universities and scientists is sad, shocking
and frightening,'' said Dr. Drummond Rennie, another committee
member, who described Dr. Dong's case and the University of
California's failure to defend her. ``They are seduced by industry
funding and frightened that if they don't go along with these gag
orders, the money will go to less ethical institutions.''

<P>
   In Massachusetts, many doctors give a diagnosis of nonverbal
learning disorder because it qualifies a student for more help,
said Ms. Fling, who lives in Hamilton Township, N.J. In Texas,
children with Asperger's are often labeled high-functioning
autistic for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment is usually a mix of speech and occupational therapy
combined with behavioral training focused on social skills, Dr.
Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Volkmar called the overall goal using childrens' strengths _
intelligence and verbal ability _ to overcome their deficits.
Judith Rivkin, the mother of a Manhattan 9-year-old with
Asperger's, Sam D., described the process as breaking down behavior
that most people master without thinking into discrete fragments
that can be learned by rote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of practicing what you could say,
practicing taking the other person's point of view,'' Ms. Rivkin
said. ``Things like, `Do I have to look him in the eye?' `Yes, but
just a little bit to let him know you're listening.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many parents have found music and pets helpful. Ms. Willey
called music a ``salvation'' in her own childhood. ``When you're
really obsessing on something, it's as if music makes something
click, and gives your brain permission to say, `Ah! I can float
away on this!'''
</P>
<P>
   Adolescence is particularly hard for children with Asperger's.
Many teachers find it hard to believe that a bright student who is
disrupting class is not doing it on purpose, Volkmar said. Until
recently, that often meant that students with Asperger's were
lumped in with aggressive students in special classes for
troublemakers, a practice that he said amounted ``to putting the
perfect victims in with the perfect victimizers.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam S.' mother, Lori, has dealt with the trauma of teasing both
with her son and as president of Aspen Inc., a New Jersey group
that offers support to parents in the New York region. ``Because
our kids are so bright, they have a lot of self-awareness. They're
aware that the thing is to blend in, and that they don't _ and that
can lead to depression.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Adam's district has assigned him a ``shadow'' aide,
who helps guide him away from inappropriate behavior as well as
keep him working smoothly in his mainstream classes. And his recent
victory in his school's geography bee is the kind of positive side
to his intense focus that his family and teachers can use to help
bolster his self-esteem. ``I was very worried about his starting
middle school,'' his mother said. ``But it's turning out to be his
best year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Adam sometimes comes home crying, frustrated by his
inability to connect. Volkmar recalled one teen-ager with the
syndrome who tried to translate emotions into equations and offered
to give up a watch that was his prize possession if he could get a
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   But children can be helped to connect. Ms. Rivkin said her son
has ``learned to have friends and to care about his friends.'' He
recently gave a rundown on his classmates ``all about how he likes
her, but she doesn't like him, and how this one likes me,'' and
wrapped it up by declaring ``and that's the Love Report!''
</P>
<P>
   Even adults who have overcome the most isolating elements of
Asperger's say they still struggle with the consequences of things
like having a poor grasp of what to say _ or not to say _ when.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people tell me I'm just a little weird,'' said Ms.
Willey, who has published a memoir, ``Pretending To Be Normal.''
``Other people think we're quirky and cute. Well, our quirkiness
keeps us from getting jobs, from making friends, keeps us on
antidepressants. We're screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Kirby, the creator of an Internet resource site for
Asperger's called the Oasis, said she gets messages regularly from
adults who hear a description of the syndrome and think it matches
them. Dr. Bristol-Power said many people receive diagnoses as
adults, but cautioned that the label could easily be overapplied.
``Where do you draw the line between a syndrome and diversity of
personality types, which you want?''
</P>
<P>
   The active role on the issue being taken by some adults with
Asperger's has made a push for greater acceptance for
``non-neurotypicals'' a central goal. David Spicer, a North
Carolina computer programmer who received an Asperger's diagnosis
at the age of 46 in 1994, says he is often asked if he wishes he
could be cured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if there's my autism, and then there's me,'' he
said. ``I don't exist separate from my autism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Willey's daughter with Asperger's, Meredith, 8, is well
aware of the difficulties Asperger's imposes, from recognizing word
sounds to being easily overwhelmed by the bustle of a mall. But she
sees another side as well. ``When I find something I like, like
horses and Shakespeare and Winnie the Pooh,'' she said, ``I like
them a whole lot more than other people like their things.''

<P>
   Adam S. was clearly a bright little boy. He began reading at age
2, and as a preschooler would lecture friendly adults _ actually,
any adult who would listen _ about state capitals or presidents or
famous painters.
</P>
<P>
   But something was wrong. Adam had no friends, no connection to
his peers. By third grade he was adrift: isolated, troublesome and
unhappy, despite his academic ability.
</P>
<P>
   A string of experts gave Adam a string of diagnoses: attention
deficit disorder, nonverbal learning disorder and
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Then three years ago, when he was 9,
doctors reached a new diagnosis _ Asperger's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's confusing mix of abilities and deficits and the confusion
of those who tried to assess it are both typical for children with
Asperger's, a condition that is generally considered a form of
autism. While it remains little known, the number of diagnoses has
soared since psychiatric authorities formally defined it five years
ago. Dr. Marie Bristol-Power, of the National Institute of Child
Health and Mental Development, said recent survey data suggest that
under some definitions as many as one in 500 people have the
condition, higher than the estimate for classic autism.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Asperger, the Viennese pediatrician who first described the
condition in 1944, called his patients ``little professors'' who
use words as their lifeline to the world. Most Asperger's patients
have average intelligence or above; 80 percent of autistic people,
by contrast, suffer some degree of mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking characteristic of the syndrome is consuming
interest in arcane subjects. Dr. Fred Volkmar, a psychiatrist with
the Yale Child Study Center who helped write the standard
diagnostic definition of Asperger's, has encountered obsessions
with clocks; the Titanic; deep-fat fryers; lists of congressional
members, wives and aides; refrigerators, and train, plane and bus
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows someone with an all-encompassing interest in
something or other, said Volkmar, whose Child Study Center team
last month held a conference on Asperger's, organized with the help
of Aspen of America, a national advocacy organization. ``But the
key point in the diagnosis is that their obsessive behavior
significantly impairs their social functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters with the condition are unable to pick up on the
nonverbal cues that underlie most interactions with others, but
they are smart enough to come to realize, and regret, a gap they
can cross only with extreme difficulty. As teen-agers they may
experience what one expert called ``extreme teasing.'' And while
many adults manage to master enough social skills to attend
college, find good jobs and even marry, others sink into isolation.
Researchers report high levels of depression and suicide, and
anti-depressants are the only medication considered appropriate for
the condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can learn to pretend to be normal,'' said Lianne Holliday
Willey, a 39-year-old Kansas writer who describes herself as having
``residual'' Asperger's. ``We just don't get the point of it the
way you all do.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Willey is unusual in one sense _ Asperger's is largely
a condition affecting boys and men _ she came to her diagnosis in
1997 the way many adults do: by having a child diagnosed with it.
At a North Carolina conference on the subject for parents of
children with Asperger's, Dr. Bristol-Power said, so many wives
recognized their husbands in descriptions of the syndrome that they
formed a support group for spouses.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the slow acceptance of Asperger's work is that
writing in German in Vienna, Austria, in 1944 was not a good way to
spread an idea, Volkmar noted. His paper was first translated into
English in 1981 by a London psychiatrist, Dr. Lorna Wing, and only
in 1994 was the syndrome included in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual IV, the latest version of the mental health profession's
guidebook.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wing's shorthand for the condition was ``active but odd,''
to distinguish it from the extreme self-absorption of classic
autism. More recently, scientists have talked of an autistic
spectrum, with Asperger's commonly being described as the span's
``smart end.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Volkmar and some other researchers, Asperger's appears
more like a separate but related condition he would describe as
autism's mirror image.
</P>
<P>
   All of the autistic-like conditions that have come under an
umbrella term of ``empathic disorders'' _ to emphasize the stunted
social skills that undermine the learning process _ appear to be
caused by lesions in a portion of the brain that processes sensory
input. In cases of classic autism, the difficulties are
predominantly with the verbal skills handled by the brain's left
hemisphere. In Asperger's the deficits are largely in nonverbal
skills, connected to the right hemisphere, leading Volkmar to
speculate that the syndrome may someday be known as right-brained
autism.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic link is also stronger in Asperger's than in autism:
In more than one-third of the 800 cases studied at the Yale center,
a family member identified at least one other relative as having
similar traits.
</P>
<P>
   Autism is usually diagnosed around age 3, but children with
Asperger's are not usually identified until after they enter
school, when their social inabilities begin to stand out.
</P>
<P>
   That lag is unfortunate. Applied behavioral analysis, a type of
intensive, one-on-one teaching that experts consider the most
effective treatment for autism, is itself most effective in the
preschool years, said Dr. Mary Jane Weiss, the director of the
Rutgers University Autism Program.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Dr. Weiss said, because ``their strengths obscure what
their deficits are,'' Asperger's children typically receive less
help.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires ``appropriate'' services for children with
special needs over the age of 3, but Echo Fling, whose book
``Eating an Artichoke _ a Mother's Perspective on Asperger's
Syndrome'' will be published this fall, says that in practice,
districts are ``all over the map'' in the types of services
offered.

   Wintry Uranus
</P>
<P>
   Winters may be long and hard here, but consider the situation on
Uranus, the seventh planet in the solar system. There, where the
seasons last for more than two decades, old man winter is a  &UR; very &LR; 
old man indeed.
</P>
<P>
   But now, parts of Uranus are coming out of a long wintertime
slumber. And a new time-lapse movie of images taken by the Hubble
Space Telescope shows for the first time the seasonal changes
taking place. Uranus, long considered fairly featureless, is
wracked by spring storms.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Earth, which spins on an axis that is perpendicular to
the plane of its orbit around the Sun, Uranus is on its side, with
each pole pointing toward the Sun for about a quarter of the
planet's year. And with a year that is equivalent to about 84 Earth
years, that means that the hemisphere opposite the sunny pole is in
winter for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble images, compiled by an astronomer at the University
of Arizona, were taken from 1994 to 1998 as the Sun began to warm
the northern hemisphere again. They show rapid movement in Uranus'
largely hydrogen and helium atmosphere, with some clouds,
presumably of methane crystals, billowing around the planet at 300
miles an hour. The images also show a distinct wobble in Uranus'
ring system, which may be caused by the planet's slightly flattened
shape or the pull of its moons.
</P>
<P>
   Storm Ribbons
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, springtime storms are often accompanied by electrical
activity, of which lightning bolts are the most visible and
dramatic sign.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of this decade, scientists have been investigating
another phenomenon of electrical storms _ wispy glowing ribbons
that appear at high altitudes, above the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   These red glows, known as sprites, accompany about one in every
200 lightning strikes. They are difficult to view from the ground
(although airline pilots reported them for years before scientists
determined what they were), and getting a reliable estimate of
their number has been practically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at the University of Massachusetts and Stanford
have determined that lightning bolts that have accompanying sprites
have a distinct electrical signature. The scientists studied a 1996
storm in Kansas, videotaping the sprites and noting the duration of
the electrical currents from the lightning. Bolts that were
accompanied by a sprite lasted much longer than those that were
not.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who reported their results in the April issue
of Geophysical Research Letters, say that with just four relatively
low-cost receivers the number of sprites could be counted for the
entire Western hemisphere. Determining their number may help
determine what effect, if any, sprites have on the chemistry of the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Electrical Cleanup
</P>
<P>
   Electricity in the ground, not the atmosphere, may have an
effect on the chemistry of contaminated industrial sites, helping
to clean up them up.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Monsanto, General Electric and Du Pont have
tested a method of removing trichloroethylene, a common industrial
solvent, from soil by running an electric current through it. The
method, known as ``lasagna'' technology because of the layered
treatment zones within the soil, uses electrodes buried up to 45
feet in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   With a current running through them, the electrodes attract
water laced with trichloroethylene toward them. The water reaches
the treatment zones, which are areas of clay mixed with iron
filings that destroy the trichloroethylene by dechlorinating it.
</P>
<P>
   Because cleanup can be done at the site (as opposed to trucking
the contaminated soil elsewhere) and the treatment zones can be
left in place once the process is completed, the method should be
less expensive than traditional decontamination techniques, the
researchers said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Kristie Wolek, the trouble started about a year ago, when
her periods became so heavy that the blood loss made her severely
anemic. She was exhausted all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was caused by four fibroids, benign tumors in her
uterus that had been tiny and harmless for more than a decade but
had recently begun growing rapidly. Two doctors recommended a
hysterectomy, an operation to remove the uterus and the only sure
cure for fibroids. Though Ms. Wolek, 43, did not want to have more
children, she did not want a hysterectomy, either. But she thought
she had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before she was to have the operation, however, a friend
called to tell her about a television news report about a clinic
near her home in Chicago that was offering a new, minimally
invasive alternative. In August, Ms. Wolek had the operation,
called fibroid embolization, which shrinks the fibroids by blocking
their blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of enduring major surgery and several weeks of
recuperation, she felt fine in two days and has had no problems
since.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolek is fairly typical of the hundreds of women around the
country who have had the operation in that she learned of it not
from her doctor but from the news. Though the same can be said for
many treatments, fibroid embolization has attracted exceptional
attention.
</P>
<P>
   And some experts are concerned that its heavy promotion by
doctors and medical groups on news programs and the Internet makes
women think that it is an established treatment when it is not. ``I
think it's an interesting procedure,'' said Dr. Bryan Cowan,
director of reproductive endocrinology at the University of
Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, ``but, unfortunately, there
are people who have run out and grabbed the banner and are touting
this, with no evidence that it represents the standard of care.''
</P>
<P>
   Other hysterectomy alternatives have been developed, but recent
studies have shown that this one requires minimal recovery time and
reduces symptoms of those fibroids that resist other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get 20 e-mails a day from women in all 50 states and even
from as far away as Japan, Hong Kong, Egypt and Nairobi,'' said Dr.
Carlos Forcade, an interventional radiologist at New York United
Hospital Medical Center in Port Chester, N.Y., who performs fibroid
embolization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women want this, or, rather, they don't want surgery,'' said
Dr. Gaylene Pron, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto
and coordinator of a multicenter study on fibroid embolization.
``This is a women-driven technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Any woman of reproductive age can get fibroids, but they are
most common in women over 35. According to the Society of
Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology, about 20 percent to 40
percent of these women have fibroids of significant size, and among
African-American women, the incidence is about 50 percent. Fibroids
run in families, though the cause is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, fibroids cause no symptoms and require no
treatment. But if they grow large enough or appear in sensitive
areas of the uterus, they can cause several problems, like
dangerously heavy menstrual bleeding, severe pelvic pain and
possibly infertility and miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   At first, doctors try to control fibroid-related symptoms with
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or birth control pills, but
when medicine is not sufficient, women need surgery. More than
200,000 women in the United States have hysterectomies each year
because of fibroids.
</P>
<P>
   There are less invasive kinds of surgery to get rid of small
fibroids, like hysteroscopy, in which a fiber optic scope is
inserted into the vagina to remove them. But for women with
relatively large ones who hope to become pregnant, the only
surgical option is myomectomy, abdominal surgery to remove the
individual fibroids. But with myomectomy, about 10 percent of women
need further surgery because the fibroids grow back, the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reports. And doctors
have found that myomectomy is least effective for women with
multiple fibroids or individual fibroids that are deeply embedded
in the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Embolization seems to work on fibroids that myomectomy cannot
eliminate, according to doctors who have studied them. The
procedure is usually done in a hospital with the patient under
local anesthesia. The patient can go home the next day.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual meeting of the Society of Cardiovascular and
Interventional Radiology in Orlando, Fla., last month, Dr. James B.
Spies, vice chairman of radiology at Georgetown University Medical
Center in Washington, said that 89 percent of his 61 patients had
less menstrual bleeding and that 96 had less pelvic pain. The tumor
sizes shrank by half, on average, he said. In the six years that
patients have been followed, he said, none have had new fibroids
grow. Spies said that 3 percent of women suffered complications,
like injury to the uterus and infertility. He also said that the
treatment failed in fewer than 1 percent of the women, who then
needed to have hysterectomies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest questions about the treatment is its effect
on a woman's fertility. Though Spies and other doctors have had
patients go on to have normal pregnancies, most of their patients
are in their 40s and are not interested in pregnancy. About 1
percent to 2 percent of women go into premature menopause following
the procedure, said Dr. Scott Goodwin, the first doctor to do
fibroid embolization in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women may be suffering ovarian damage because the
embolism material migrates to the ovaries,'' said Goodwin, chief of
cardiovascular radiology at University of California, Los Angeles
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the risk of infertility, Goodwin and Spies do not
recommend fibroid embolization to women who hope to become pregnant
unless they are poor candidates for myomectomy and therefore would
face infertility with any other fibroid surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Haas, chairwoman of the Massachusetts section of the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and an
assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said she considered
it ``on the cusp between experimental and standard practice''
because it looked promising in the short term. But she was at a
recent meeting when doctors discussed technical problems. ``I heard
there were arteries that couldn't be catheterized,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is new, most insurance plans do not cover the
emolization, but doctors say they can often persuade insurance
companies to pay for it on a case-by-case basis by showing them
research about the outcomes. But they say that some women want the
operation so badly that they pay for it on their own, at a cost of
as much as $15,000.

   Fitness: 4 Minutes And $600 Later
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of a hot new exercise machine make a profound claim: a
four-minute workout that really works.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion comes in an infomercial from Time Works for a $600
device that works the upper and lower body with twisting and
stepping motions. Though such a less-is-more approach _ four
minutes, four times a week _ seems hard to fathom, the Time Works
infomercial and Web site prominently feature an as yet unpublished
study conducted at Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y.
Researchers compared increases in fitness levels of two sedentary
groups of subjects who worked out four times a week. One group
exercised for 4 minutes per session on the Time Works machine and
another group exercised for 20 minutes per session on a treadmill
with an upper body component.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of six weeks, the researchers said, the four-minute
Time Works exercisers increased their aerobic fitness levels by an
average of 12.5 percent compared with the 20-minute treadmill
group's 9.7 percent improvement. Researchers also reported
decreases in waist circumference measurements in the Time Works
group but not in the treadmill group.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievable? Many prominent exercise researchers are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``However appealing in concept,'' said Dr. David Neiman,
professor of health and exercise science and director of the human
performance lab at Appalachian State University, ``you cannot
improve cardiovascular function, gain significant health benefits,
or lose a meaningful amount of weight by doing four minutes of
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own study published in the American Council on Exercise's
magazine Fitness Matters, Neiman found that a four-minute Time
Works session did not provide sufficient exercise to help build
heart and lung fitness or positively affect general health over the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Robert Otto, Adelphi's lead researcher, defends his
study, which he plans to present at an American College of Sports
Medicine conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he said, ``quite a few studies have shown that
short duration activity can have a positive impact on fitness,
especially in deconditioned individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have bitten. Since being released in 1998, Time Works,
produced by Quantum Fitness Corp. in Stafford, Texas., and
distributed by E4L, has racked up more than $60 million in sales.
Most experts stand by the college of sports medicine's
recommendation of 20 to 60 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic
activity four to six times a week for improved health, weight loss,
increased stamina and protection from disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Glenn Gaesser, associate professor of exercise physiology at
the University of Virginia, helped formulate the sports medicine
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now,'' Gaesser said, ``I don't think we have enough
evidence to tell people they can get by with four minutes of
exercise a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians Urge Hearing Tests at Birth
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics has begun recommending that
all infants be checked at birth for hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued in February, the academy said that prompt
diagnosis of hearing problems could help offset lapses in language
development.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing impairment in infants can cause delays in speech,
language and cognitive development, said Dr. Philip Ziring, the
chairman of the academy's Committee on Children With Disabilities.
Often, hearing loss is not diagnosed in children until they are 2
to 3 years old and are not speaking properly, Ziring said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if hearing loss is detected early enough, babies can be
fitted with hearing aids or watch others use sign language, said
Dr. Barbara Herrmann, an audiologist at the Massachusetts Eye and
Ear Infirmary and an assistant professor of otology and laryngology
at Harvard Medical School. ``Children learn language by exposure to
language. And without some kind of exposure, it's hard to catch
up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing loss is more frequent than other disorders now tested at
birth, Dr. Herrmann said. Hearing impairment occurs in 4 of 1,000
births, yet screening is required in only 10 states. Meanwhile,
babies are routinely checked for the metabolic disorder
phenylketonuria, or PKU, which occurs in one 1 of 16,000 births.
</P>
<P>
   Screening for hearing is non-invasive and painless. One test
evaluates hearing by measuring the vibration of the small hair
cells in the cochlea when exposed to sound, and the other uses ear
cuplets over the baby's ears and sensors on her head to measure
brain response to sound. Ideally, infants are tested while they
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge to pediatricians is insuring follow-up
testing and making sure these kids end up in early treatment
programs,'' Ziring said. ``You have about three to six months to
get it right. These tests can help prevent a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   1/1/00 Baby Race: Push for 12:01 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It is a date that has already crept into millennium folklore:
Friday, April 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big date,'' is what Dr. Amos Grunebaum, director of
maternal-fetal medicine at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in
Manhattan, calls it: the theoretically ideal date for an egg to be
fertilized to produce a baby born at 12:01 a.m. on 1/1/00.
</P>
<P>
   Motels have offered special rates for that night, television
stations have sought to recruit couples for millennium baby
contests and a Web site, is offering a Millennium Baby package,
which for $49.95 offers a book of advice, a pregnancy test, candles
and massage oil. The Web site is www.babycenter.com.
</P>
<P>
   There are only two problems with the April 9 countdown, said
Grunebaum, whose own pregnancy information Web site,
www.babydata.com, offers a Conception Calculator complete with tips
on what sexual positions to try for a boy or girl. (``50 percent
serious and 50 percent fun,'' he allowed.) The first is that the
date is based on a theory that almost never works in practice. By
obstetrical convention, due dates are calculated by counting 266
days from the date of ovulation. In practice, ``only 5 percent of
women who have a due date will deliver on that specific day,'' he
said. ``It's a crapshoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The second obstacle is a misconception of where the window of
opportunity lies.
</P>
<P>
   If a woman ovulates on April 9, then her chances of becoming
pregnant are the highest between April 5 and April 9; the odds that
sex on April 10 or 11 will produce a baby ``are nearly zero,''
Grunebaum said.
</P>
<P>
   He Thinks He Can, He Thinks He Can
</P>
<P>
   Studies in recent years have shown that boys tend to
overestimate their academic abilities, while girls tend to
underestimate them. Now, researchers from the University of Notre
Dame have tracked the growth of that gap and suggested a cause.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in March in the journal Child Development,
psychologists tracked 807 students, half starting in third grade
and half starting in sixth, for three years. They were periodically
asked to assess their own academic abilities and express their
anxiety or depression. Their teachers' assessments were collected
for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Self-confidence, even when misplaced, the researchers wrote, can
be a powerful force for success: ``Believing that one is competent
or capable of handling a particular task can be highly motivating,
even when it is not true.'' In first and second grades, earlier
researchers found, most students give themselves high marks. At the
start of the third grade, Notre Dame researchers found only a small
gap between boys and girls in the accuracy of their ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But from then on, an increasing number of boys thought better of
their skills than their teachers did; the number of girls who were
overly harsh on themselves increased at roughly the same rate.
Emotional measures were similar: depression grew among girls and
fell among boys. Anxiety levels for girls remained almost constant,
but fell among boys after third grade.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the researchers focused on anxious and depressed students
and found that boys and girls in this group were equally likely to
underrate their skills. This led them to conclude that the gap in
self-esteem was largely explained by the higher prevalence of
emotional troubles among girls.
</P>
<P>
   They also concluded that the girls' depression was the likely
cause of their low self-esteem, and not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the researchers said, it may be important to try to
determine why so many girls are unhappy.

NEW YORK: palm leaves. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I understand you do a lot of fieldwork in a different kind of
forest _ New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, yes. One of the most diverse laboratories that an
ethnobotanist could have is New York City. All these different
cultures can be found here. They all bring their healing plants,
food plants, relaxing plants, beverages with them. I give a class
at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. I do my
shopping for it in Chinatown and Harlem and also Dean &AMP; DeLuca in
SoHo. They have amazing tropical fruits that no one else has.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do your two worlds _ New York and tropical rain forest _
sometimes clash?
</P>
<P>
   A. Rarely. Though once, I was home in Westchester unpacking my
collection of rain forest hunting tools. And I had had this dart
set that had curare poison on its tip. I was very tired and I stuck
myself and I started feeling a little funny. So I called up the
number of Poison Control and they said, ``You should call Dr.
Balick _ he's our specialist.'' And I said, ``Man, this is Dr.
Balick!''
</P>
<P>
   So the woman on the other end of the phone asked my symptoms and
said, ``Now you get yourself to a hospital, but you call in advance
first.'' I then called one of the local hospitals and said, ``I
have a curare stick wound from a poisoned dart and I'm coming in an
ambulance.'' And the physician in charge, thinking it was a joke,
hung up. I eventually ended up in the E.R. of another hospital _
where there were people with heart attacks and knifings; I was the
guy in the corner with the poisoned dart wound from the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The use of botanicals and herbs in Western society has
increased. Do you find this a positive trend?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, it is fascinating. In the last few years, probably over
a third of the American public has begun using botanical medicines
for some aspect of their health care. People now know if they get
into a car wreck, they go to an emergency room, but if they want to
stave off a cold, they might take echinacea. If they want to help
with their memory retention, they might take ginko.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I only recommend that people utilize herbs under the
care of a trained health-care professional. There are specific
situations where you shouldn't be using herbs. For example, if you
have a disease of the immune system like lupus or scleroderma, you
shouldn't be using echinacea.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also concerned about the growing use of botanicals in the
personal care industry. I'm worried that in some cases, this use _
without any thought of sustainability _ could lead to the demise of
some plant resources.
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers have jumped on the bandwagon of
sustainability these days, but in truth, they had don't have a
clear idea of what that means. Sustainable harvest involves
removing only that quantity of a plant or a plant population that
will insure that the wild resource continues to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Not all personal care product manufacturers who say they ``help
the environment'' actually do that. I had a student look at some of
these manufacturers who claim, ``We're giving back to the rain
forest.'' She called some of the companies that bragged on their
labels about how much they were giving back to the environment. It
turned out that one of the bigger ones was giving away $140 that
year and another one said, ``We had no profits so we didn't give
away anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. In all your years in this business, what would you say has
been your greatest accomplishment?
</P>
<P>
   A. Working with people in Belize _ Dr. Rosita Arvigo and Gregory
Schropshire and a community of traditional healers _ to help them
preserve an entire forest, an entire ecosystem. And we call this,
the world's first ethno-biomedical forest preserve.
</P>
<P>
   It's a forest preserved so that traditional healers would have a
place to sit, teach students, plant things that are being destroyed
in other places and gather the materials for their art.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing I do, which I love, is work with urban young
people who come to the Botanical Garden from the neighborhoods of
New York. If you watch kids, they have boundless enthusiasm for
nature. They will make observations adults never would, like:
``This flower smells just like old socks!'' You want to maintain
that level of enthusiasm and openness to nature. Indeed, I think
people who really enjoy this kind of work, have maintained that
persona of a child's awareness of the earth and humility to it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you keep plants at home?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some. I keep plants that can go without care or watering for
a very long time. Because, obviously, I travel.
</P>
<P>
   I keep dracaena and yuccas and other things like that. I have an
herb garden and I struggle with it. My house happens to be situated
on a shaded plot. I grow tomatoes and they will cost about $40 a
pound, if you calculate what I've spent on them at the end of the
year. But it's money well spent. The therapy is in the growing.

 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 47, Dr. Michael Balick, who directs research and
training at the New York Botanical Garden, is one of a handful of
scientists who earns a living as an ``ethnobotanist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the things I do is wander through New York City looking
at urban markets asking healers in botanicas, `What do you use this
for?''' Balick, the co-author with Paul Alan Cox of ``Plants,
People and Culture'' (Scientific American Library, 1996), explained
on a recent morning in his office at the gardens in the Bronx. ``I
also advise physicians on the methods of traditional healers. What
can be more interesting, or more fun?''
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did ethnobotany become your life's passion?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was one of those kids always taking leaves from the woods
and pressing them between wax papers and ironing them. Forty years
later, I'm being paid to still do that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Give us the job description of an ethnobotanist.
</P>
<P>
   A. Someone who studies the relationship between plants and
people. That means the foods that people eat, the spices in their
foods, the medicines they use, and how people manage their
resources, forests, farm lands.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, this profession was traveling to a distant
culture and collecting plants. In the last 20 years, the paradigm's
been changing. What we now do is add the modern tools of science to
this old discipline. Also, we educate. We try to help urban peoples
see how much we all depend on plants. Plants are the bottom line in
life. They support all of life.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have a favorite ethnobotany movie?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Medicine Man.'' It featured a couple of big ethnobotanist
fantasies in it. The Sean Connery character, the ethnobotanist, had
a high pressure liquid chromatograph, which is a very sophisticated
analytical device and he had it set up in a remote indigenous house
_ with no electricity! That's always been my dream. To have the
latest scientific equipment down in the middle of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What kind of equipment do you actually take to the field?
</P>
<P>
   A. Very simple tools: a machete, a still camera, a video camera,
a backpack, a hat, sun screen, a plant press, some old newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The second fantasy in that movie was when Sean Connery wrote for
a research assistant, Lorraine Bracco peddled up in a boat. The
first words out of her mouth were: ``Dr. So and So, our company has
been sending you money for nine years and we never have even gotten
a report from you once!'' That to me was the greatest! We are
swamped with report-writing.
</P>
<P>
   The general public thinks ethnobotany is a very romantic
activity. But the truth of it is that you're traveling for long
periods of time _ not with your family _ to isolated places. You're
living in miserable conditions most of the time, covered with
insects. You're often sitting around waiting for things to happen
because you can't force them.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it is a very difficult profession. I could tell you
stories of people who said they wanted to do this work and then
when they finally got in the field, they wouldn't come out of their
hut.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's your best personal story from the field?
</P>
<P>
   A. In 1976, my wife, Daphne, and I canoe up the Ampiyacu River
in Peru, looking to spend time with the Bora Indians. And when we
eventually arrived at a village, 40 or 50 people came out and
circled us. They had not seen many of our kind. We were a great
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   While we were explaining what we wanted to do, suddenly an old
woman came out of the Long House and hugged me. Everyone fell on
the ground laughing. So Daphne asked, ``What is grandmother
saying?'' And the village chief says, ``You don't want to know.''
To which, Daphne says, ``Oh, no. Please tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   So he explains, ``Grandmother said that what a great opportunity
it would have been to have this guy come to our village three years
ago before the missionaries came here, when we were still eating
people because he could have fed us for a month!'' And she
proceeded to describe how you cook the fingers, the hands, the
back. Three or four years previously, before the missionaries came,
they were practicing cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   We lived with them for six weeks and they were just the most
hospitable and giving of people. They showed all these uses of
plants: how they grew things, how they cultivated their tubers, how
they harvested things from the forest, how they made backpacks from
palm leaves.

   Blood Types
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is your blood type _ A, B, AB or O _ so important? I have
never understood exactly what would happen if you got a transfusion
of an incompatible type.
</P>
<P>
   A. The most basic classification of the hundreds of ways to type
human blood, the ABO system, is important because incompatible
types of blood react with each other to form sticky globs of red
blood cells that can cause serious sometimes fatal blockages.
</P>
<P>
   The classification was developed in 1901 by Karl Lansteiner, a
Viennese pathologist and immunologist. For the first time, it
explained why certain blood transfusions were beneficial while
others caused severe problems.
</P>
<P>
   The red blood cells of people with type A blood has a protein
called the A antigen on its surface; people with type B blood have
the B antigen. In type O, the cells have neither A nor B antigens;
in type AB, there are both antigens.
</P>
<P>
   In one example of incompatibility, type A red blood cells
(erythrocytes) have the A antigen and the liquid part of the blood
(the serum) contains antibodies against the type B cells; type B
blood has the opposite configuration. So if the two types are
mixed, the antibodies from the serum react to the ``foreign'' types
making the cells clumb together.  &QL;

<P>
   A group of IBM researchers said last week that they had
successfully designed the building blocks of a new kind of computer
memory that could fundamentally alter computer design early in the
next century. Chips based on this new technology, known as
tunneling magnetic junction random access memory, or tmj-ram for
short, would be ultrafast, consume very little power and retain
stored data when a computer was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   As such they would combine the best features of computer disks,
which can store prodigious amounts of information, and conventional
memory chips, which are fast but limited in their capacities.
</P>
<P>
   An IBM researcher revealed at a meeting of the American Physical
Society in Atlanta last month that a small research team working at
the company's Almaden Research Laboratory in San Jose, Calif., had
succeeded in building microscopic magnetic memory cells that can
switch on and off as quickly as the fastest microprocessor chips,
consume power only when reading and writing, and are almost as
small as the tiny capacitors that store data in the most advanced
conventional memory chips. In contrast, today's memory chips must
be continually electrically refreshed while operating, because the
electrical charge continuously leaks from the millions of storage
capacitors that make up the chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the holy grail of computer memory,'' said Randy Isaac,
a vice president at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center. ``This
is the result of a global quest that has gone on for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the advance is a crucial step toward a new class of
electronic materials and a new kind of microelectronics, which has
been named ``spintronics'' because it is based on the ability to
detect and control the spins of electrons in ferromagnetic
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Spin is an aspect of quantum mechanics, the rules that govern
subatomic physics, that is still untapped commercially. According
to quantum mechanics, the electrons in a normal electric current
are spinning in a random mix of quantum states known as up and
down. By ordering this mayhem in a process analogous to the
polarization of light _ in effect, aligning the quantum spins to be
either all up or all down _ scientists can create the ``off'' and
``on'' states central to computer calculations and give the digital
revolution a remarkable new dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Spintronics is already a billion-dollar industry because of
another IBM innovation based on a phenomenon known as ``giant
magnetoresistance,'' which is being used to read hard disks. In the
so-called gmr effect, tiny magnetic fields are used to control the
electrical resistance of a sandwich of alternating layers of
magnetic and nonmagnetic metals.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, progress at research laboratories in the United
States, Europe and Japan has touched off an international race
among scientists who believe that spintronics may offer dramatic
gains in memory and processing power in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a number of companies including IBM,
Honeywell, Hewlett Packard and Motorola are working on spintronics,
according to Stuart Wolf, who is in charge of funding Pentagon
research in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two or three years there will be results in this field that
will make people sit up and take notice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new tmj-ram devices combine the phenomenon of spin with
another heretofore elusive quantum feature known as tunneling, in
which current can pass from one metal layer to another, switching
its spin from up to down, like a ghost melting through a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to improve these materials beyond my wildest
dreams,'' said Stuart Parkin, the IBM physicist who has been
leading the Almaden research group. ``These are wonderful devices
because in principle you can scale them through many many
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Such memories might have a broad impact on the design of
computers, he said, because they could be applied at both the very
high and low ends of the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because today's memory chips are much slower than microprocessor
chips, computer design is based on a hierarchy of memory. A
conventional computer will have a number of different types of
memory, which descend in speed and increase in capacity. This
hierarchy ranges from the so-called ultrafast cache, which is built
directly into the microprocessor and stores data and parts of the
program used most frequently, to the magnetic computer disk, which
is the slowest part of the system but holds the most data.
</P>
<P>
   Computers based on the new type of quantum-effect memory would
not only start instantly because program information and data could
be permanently stored, but would also be faster because the tmj-ram
memory would keep pace with the fastest microprocessor chips.
</P>
<P>
   Memories based on quantum-tunneling effects were first predicted
theoretically by John Slonczewski, an IBM physicist at the Watson
Research Center, in 1975. But it was not until three years ago,
when research groups at MIT and in Japan simultaneously were able
to demonstrate the magnetic tunneling effect, that Parkin's group
returned to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Parkin attributed much of his group's progress to the
development of a rapid prototyping machine that allows researchers
to quickly test new compounds for the memory cells.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the research is remarkably small. For example, the
aluminum dioxide insulating layer in the tiny sandwich of
iron-cobalt magnets that makes up the experimental memory cell is
only four atoms thick.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers were able to lower the electrical resistance of
that layer by ten-million-fold at room temperature. This allowed
current to ``tunnel'' between the layers, altering the direction of
the spin in one of the magnets and creating the equivalent of a
digital 1 or 0.
</P>
<P>
   So far the group has demonstrated reading and writing times of
about 10 nanoseconds, about six times faster than today's dynamic
random access memories.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM researchers said they had chosen to pursue the tmj-ram
because the tunneling approach promises greater memory capacity in
the future.

PERSONAL HEALTH: COPING WITH COLD, HARD FACTS ON TEEN-AGE
DRINKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest statistics on teen-age drinking are startling:
</P>
<P>
   _A 1997 national study of teen-age students revealed that 54
percent of eighth graders, 72 percent of 10th graders and 82
percent of 12th graders had consumed alcohol, and more than a third
of 12th graders had been drunk at least once.
</P>
<P>
   _More than one-third of high school seniors see no great risk in
consuming four to five drinks a day. Yet 16 percent of teen-agers
have had ``blackouts'' where heavy drinking erased their memories
of what happened the previous evening. And alcohol is the single
biggest factor behind the leading cause of death among teen-agers _
traffic fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   _Teen-agers who start drinking before age 15 are four times as
likely to become alcohol dependent as those who begin drinking at
age 21, the legal drinking age.
</P>
<P>
   _An American Academy of Pediatrics survey found that teen-agers
who drink one day a month typically consume nearly three drinks at
a time, and those who drink six or more days a month average more
than five drinks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   _A Harvard study of college drinking showed that more than
two-fifths of students indulge in binge drinking, defined as
consuming five drinks at one setting by men or four drinks by
women. Of college students who drink, one-third drink to get drunk.
</P>
<P>
   _According to the Federal Office of Substance Abuse Prevention,
college students spend more money on alcohol than on soft drinks,
coffee, tea, milk, juice and books combined.
</P>
<P>
   _The highest rate of binge drinking _ greater than 80 percent _
occurs among college students who live in fraternity and sorority
houses, and the second highest rate is found among athletes who
participate in intercollegiate sports.
</P>
<P>
   _Alcohol is involved in 95 percent of violent and property
crimes on campuses, including date rape, and 40 percent of
students' academic problems are alcohol-related.
</P>
<P>
   As with most health problems, the best way to deal with them is
to prevent them from occurring in the first place. Alcohol abuse by
teen-agers, college students or anyone else is a preventable
disorder. Colleges around the country have undertaken a concerted
effort to curb excessive drinking by students, both on and off
campus. But long before youngsters reach college age, parents play
the largest role in fostering a healthy respect for alcohol in
their children. What Parents Can Do
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, parents must set a good example by using
alcohol only in moderation, preferably with meals, and never
suggesting it as a solution to stress or other emotional problems.
Although parents tend to think that peer pressure is the primary
influence on drinking by teen-agers, youngsters say otherwise.
According to a survey released last year by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, the leading reasons given by high school seniors for
drinking are to have a good time with friends, to see what it's
like, to feel good, to relax or relieve tension, to relieve
boredom, to get away from problems and to cope with anger or
frustration. Only 8 percent gave ``to fit in with a group I like''
as their reason for drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should emphasize that getting drunk is always to be
avoided,'' said Dr. Henry Wechsler, director of College Alcohol
Studies at the Harvard School of Public Health. ``Most parents
aren't teaching their kids anything about alcohol, especially not
that alcohol in large quantities has many dangerous effects. Too
many kids think that as long as they don't drive, it's OK to get
drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents should always pay attention to their
children's behavior, including the friends they hang out with, be
consistent about discipline and be clear but realistic about their
expectations for academic achievement. Students about to go off to
college should be cautioned about checking out the drinking
practices in various sororities and fraternities before they
consider joining one.
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler said parents also could help by monitoring the
activities of their state and municipal alcohol control boards with
regard to enforcement of the minimum drinking age, sales of alcohol
around college campuses and bars that offer students ``specials'' _
high volumes of alcohol (usually beer) for a low price _ which he
said encouraged binge drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tim Marchell, director of substance abuse services at
Cornell University, suggested that parents discuss social life at
college with their college-bound children and review all the things
there are to do there besides partying and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   What Colleges Can Do
</P>
<P>
   Under a grant from the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, Cornell and the University of North Carolina are testing
an education program aimed at changing attitudes about alcohol and
campus drinking practices.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Talbot, community health educator at Cornell University,
said a university survey revealed that the drinking norm was much
lower than most students believed. The survey showed that 62
percent of Cornell students consumed zero to three drinks when they
partied, not five or six, as many students believed.
</P>
<P>
   The program also emphasizes the secondary effects of excessive
drinking on other students, including unwanted sexual advances to
women, destructive behavior, routines that disrupt sleep and
studying and vomiting in the street or communal bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to reshape the environment in which students make
choices,'' Marchell said. ``We're trying to increase student
awareness of and intolerance for the second-hand effects of other
people's drinking by drawing attention to the problems excessive
drinking inflicts on the entire community.''
</P>
<P>
   Because members of fraternities and sororities drink two to
three times as much as other students on the same campus, Cornell
has instituted such regulations as having all parties in Greek
houses catered and regulated to prevent excessive drinking and
insisting that all new fraternity and sorority members attend an
alcohol education workshop. And because athletes are the second
largest group of excessive drinkers, Cornell is also working with
athletic coaches to foster a change in student drinking behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell has also increased the availability of alcohol-free
social activities during the hours that students typically engage
in drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to show students they can have a good time without
indulging in alcohol. The activities, under the rubric of ``Up All
Night,'' are scheduled between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. and include
movies, food and various forms of recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, colleges have to work with local businesses to get bars
accessible to students to refrain from offering alcohol specials
that encourage excessive drinking.

Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, April 6:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WRITING-ORIGINS (Undated) _ When it comes to explaining the
origins of writing, scientists are largely at a loss. But many at a
recent symposium favored a broad explanation of writing's origins
in the visual arts, pictograms of things being transformed into
increasingly abstract symbols for things, names and eventually
words in speech. Their views clashed with a widely held theory that
writing grew out of the pieces of clay that Sumerian accountants
had used to keep track of livestock and stores of grain. Scholars
assembled also conceded that they had no definitive answer to the
question of whether writing was invented only once and spread
elsewhere or arose independently several times in several places,
like Egypt, the Indus valley, China and among the Olmecs and Maya
of Mexico and Central America. By John Noble Wilford. (2200 words)

</P>
<P>
   SCI-RESEARCH-SECRECY (Undated) _ The strings that often come
with private research money _ the publication delays while patents
and profits are pursued, the proprietary findings _ hold the
pernicious potential to impede the free exchange of information
that speeds scientific progress, experts warned during a conference
on ``Secrecy in Science'' held by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. By Carey Goldberg. (1600 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASPERGERS-SYNDROME (Undated) _ Asperger's syndrome, a
condition that is generally considered a less severe form of
autism, remains little known, but the number of diagnoses has
soared since psychiatric authorities formally defined it five years
ago. Recent survey data suggest that under some definitions as many
as 1 in 500 people have the condition, higher than the estimate for
classic autism. By John O'Neil. (1925 words)
</P>

<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-MEMORY (Undated) _ Heralding an era that will blend
the speed of the microelectronic world of silicon with the
permanence of the magnetic world of computer disks, a group of
I.B.M. researchers said last week that they had successfully
designed the building blocks of a new kind of computer memory that
could fundamentally alter computer design early in the next
century. Chips based on this new technology, known as tunneling
magnetic junction random access memory, or tmj-ram for short, would
be ultrafast, consume very little power and retain stored data when
a computer was shut down. By John Markoff. (1050 words)

<P>
   SCI-LAUNDRY (Undated) _ Laboratory scientists are tackling the
rigors of the domestic battlefield known as the washing machine.
The goal is to eliminate a common laundry-day disaster, when a
washerful of white clothes is forever tinted by one colored item
that, like a rogue agent, has infiltrated the load. By Henry
Foruntain. (740 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: At
least a third of high school seniors have been drunk and heavy
drinking even occurs in junior highs and middle schools. Binge
drinking remains a serious problem on college campuses. But surveys
indicate that parents can play the biggest role in shaping the
children's drinking habits. By Jane E. Brody. (1150 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LIVER-TRANSPLANTS (Undated) _ In some cases, people are
dying because HMO's are basing medical decisions on the science of
the '70s, not what's known today. Specifically, HMO's and state
governing agencies have neglected to update guidelines on liver
transplants for people with hepatitis, because in the early phases
of liver transplants, recipients with the disease could not
survive. But that changed years ago, while guidelines did not. By
Holcolm B. Noble.

PRIVACY RIGHTS CAN SHUT THE DOOR ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   A
Fourth Amendment case before the U.S. Supreme Court has caused a
rancorous debate among First Amendment advocates. The question
argued before the court on March 24, asked: Do law enforcement
agents violate the Fourth Amendment when they allow members of the
news media to accompany them on searches?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some First Amendment advocates say no _ that the news media has
a right to accompany police on searches of homes where there is
probable cause to suspect criminal activity has taken place and to
record the arrest of suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The Fourth Amendment, if anything, strongly implies the
home is a sanctuary of privacy: ``The right of the people to be
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no
warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or
affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched,
and the persons or things to be seized.''
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase an English adage credited to William Pitt, Earl of
Chatham (1708-1778): The home is a castle, and not even the King of
England can cross the threshold without invitation. When the Fourth
Amendment was created by the Founding Fathers, it was to stop the
kind of abuses carried out by the king's henchmen in the colonies
when they went house-to-house breaking down doors and searching for
seditious material.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth Amendment allows law enforcement officials to enter
private property and homes in order to conduct a search or a
seizure only after a warrant has been signed by a judge _ unless
the police are in active pursuit of a criminal suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Code expands the Fourth Amendment so that it allows
officers of the law to bring along a third party who is acting ``in
aid of'' law enforcement _ an informant to identify a suspect, a
translator if necessary, someone who can identify stolen goods. In
other words, the amendment only allows government agents to enter a
private home. It was meant to protect our privacy. The media has no
constitutional right to ``ride-along'' into our homes with police
on raids.
</P>
<P>
   Fox network's ``Cops'' violates the privacy rights of all those
who are in their homes when police execute warrants and the
program's film crews follow police into homes. But the two cases,
consolidated and argued before the high court, did not involve the
Fox program.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hanlon vs. Berger case, agents of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service were issued a search warrant to look for evidence
of killing protected wildlife on Paul Berger's ranch in Montana.
Unknown to the federal magistrate who signed the warrant, USFWS
agents had made an agreement with Cable News Network to film the
search. One of the agents actually carried a hidden microphone that
transmitted all conversations to the CNN technical crew. The
Bergers were not informed of the hidden microphone.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergers filed suit against the USFWS, claiming the federal
agency had violated their constitutional rights by allowing CNN to
be involved in the search. A jury acquitted Berger of all charges,
except for the misuse of a pesticide, a misdemeanor. CNN aired a
portion of the film footage of the raid in its story concerning the
protection of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   In the accompanying case, Wilson vs. Layne, U.S. marshals and a
local sheriff department attempted to execute an outstanding arrest
warrant against Dominic Jerome Wilson. Before dawn, a Washington
Post reporter and photographer accompanied the officers to the
fugitive's last known address, the home of his parents in
Rockville, Md. Charles Wilson was dressed only in his underwear and
his wife, Geraldine, was wearing a sheer nightgown when the
officers, reporter and photographer entered their home. The
reporter took notes; the photographer took pictures. The fugitive
son was not at his parents' home. The photographs were not
published. But the Wilsons sued the federal and state law
enforcement agents, asserting their Fourth Amendment rights had
been violated.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the law enforcement officials in these cases argue
that allowing the media to accompany officers helps ensure accurate
news coverage. The 24 news organizations, who filed briefs siding
with law enforcement, argued that such ride-alongs fulfill the
media's role as a watchdog. It is naive to think that a reporter
accompanying law enforcement officials is going to be a witness to
police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters from the New York Times, the Associated Press, the
Houston Chronicle and the Hearst Newspapers who covered the oral
argument at the Supreme Court were in agreement that at least six
justices showed their skepticism about the rationale law
enforcement officials gave for inviting along the media when
executing warrants. And, indeed, they should have.
</P>
<P>
   If police can invite a reporter along, why not a relative? Why
not a neighbor? The U.S. Supreme Court has never granted the media
greater First Amendment rights than any citizen. So why not invite
a friend to peer into the privacy of someone's home when a warrant
is served?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the friend can publish what he or she sees on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, a line must be drawn. And the front door of our homes
is the proper and precise place to draw that line. Privacy is
essential to all human beings, to all families. The sense that your
home is your castle, no matter how humble, allows us to live more
fully, more intimately, more securely, in sum, more humanly.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment cannot trump the legitimate expectations of
privacy we all have when we shut the front door against the world.
Expect the high court to reinforce that great principle.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Makes you feel all historic
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Funny thing, I suddenly have a feel for how the Austrians must
have felt in 1914. It was in June that year, a Serbian nationalist
named Princip decided to gun down the Austrian Archduke Francis
Ferdinand in the streets of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   That is all ancient history, but everything that happened more
than three weeks ago is ancient history these days. The Austrians
didn't take kindly to death by archduke. Germany thought that was
jolly, and we were off on what came to be called World War I. The
autocratic Austrians probably thought they represented rationality
and order in that part of the world. Never get in the way of
contending rationalities.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're bombing the daylights out of Serbia, and thinking we
represent rationality and order in that part of the world.
Actually, we may, but this is a case where the outcome, death,
dislocation and destruction, is just about as bad as the cause,
death, dislocation and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   If Bill Clinton, the anti-war activist of the Vietnam era, has
any taste for irony, he must be struck by the similarity of his
situation to that of Lyndon Johnson, who also hoped bombs, more
bombs, just had to work.

 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NORTH AMERICAN and CANADIAN rights only  
 &HT;     (Thomas L. Friedman is the foreign affairs columnist for The
New York Times. This article is adapted from his book, ``The Lexus
and the Olive Tree: Understanding Globalization,'' to be published
April 21 by Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux.) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the winter of 1996, I accompanied Madeleine K. Albright, then
the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, on a trip to the war
zones of Africa.
 &HT;    During the last stop, in Rwanda, she asked her staff to pose for
a picture outside her Air Force 737. The group included a
Greek-American, a Czech-American, Jewish Americans, black Americans
and white Americans. There were Air Force crewmen from small towns
and diplomats from Ivy League colleges, and they were all standing
there shoulder to shoulder.
 &HT;    As I watched the Rwandan ground crew curiously watching the
picture-taking, I couldn't help wondering what they were making of
this scene, which represented America at its best: the spirit of
community, the melting pot, the willingness to help faraway
strangers in need and, most important, a concept of citizenship
based on allegiance to an idea rather than to a tribe. As a
picture, it represented everything that Rwanda was not.
 &HT;    And as I stood there, I started to get mad _ not just about the
tragedy in Africa but also about a budget debate that was then
going on in Congress. We have something tremendously special in
America, I thought, but if we want to preserve it, we have to pay
for it and nurture it.
 &HT;    Yet, when I listened to the infamous 1994 class of freshman
Republicans _ and when I hear echoes today, with the likes of the
House majority leader, Dick Armey, boasting that he has traveled
abroad only once _ I heard mean-spirited voices, voices for whom
the American government was some kind of evil enemy. I heard men
and women who insisted that the market alone should rule.
 &HT;    And I heard lawmakers who seemed to believe that America had no
special responsibility for maintaining global institutions and
stabilizing an international system that benefits us more than any
other country.
 &HT;    And as I thought about all this on the tarmac of Kigali airport,
I said to myself: ``Well, my freshman Republican friends, come to
Africa. It's a freshman Republican's paradise.'' Yes sir, nobody in
Liberia pays taxes. There's no gun control in Angola. There's no
welfare as we know it in Burundi and no big government to interfere
with the market in Rwanda.
 &HT;    But a lot of their people sure wish there were. Like the desk
clerk in Luanda, Angola, who looked at me as if I were nuts when I
asked her if it was safe to take a walk three blocks from the
hotel, down the main street of the capital in the middle of the
day.
 &HT;    ``No, no, no,'' she shook her head _ not safe.''
 &HT;    I'll bet she wouldn't mind paying some taxes for 100,000 more
police officers.
 &HT;    And then there was the Liberian radio reporter who demanded to
know why the Marines came to Liberia after the civil war broke out
in 1989, evacuated only the U.S. citizens and then left. ``We all
thought, 'The Marines are coming, we will be saved,''' he said.
``How could they leave?''
 &HT;    Poor guy, his country has no marines to rescue him. I'll bet he
wouldn't mind paying some taxes for a few good men.
 &HT;    Employers don't have to fret about those pesky worker-safety
rules in Angola, let alone services for the handicapped. The 70,000
Angolans who have had limbs blown off by land mines get by just
fine on their own. You can see them limping around the streets of
Luanda in Fellini-esque contortions, hustling for food and using
tree limbs as a substitute for the human variety.
 &HT;    And in Rwanda and Burundi, no one is asked to pay for Head
Start, Medicaid, national service or student-loan programs. Instead
they just have a Darwinian competition for scarce land, energy and
water, with Tutsi and Hutu tribesmen taking turns downsizing one
another to grab more resources for themselves.
 &HT;    Many in Congress are reluctant to go on trips abroad. They think
it looks bad to their constituents. Too bad. They want all the
respect and benefits that come with being an American in today's
world, but without any of the sacrifices and obligations that go
with it. They should come to war-torn Africa and get a real taste
of what happens to countries where there is no sense of community,
no sense that people owe their government anything, no sense that
anyone is responsible for anyone else, and where the rich have to
live behind high walls and tinted windows, while the poor are left
to the tender mercies of the marketplace.
 &HT;    I don't want to live in such a country, or such a world. It is
not only wrong, it will become increasingly dangerous. Designing
ways to avoid that should be at the heart of American domestic and
foreign policy. Unfortunately, neither the Democrats nor the
Republicans are thinking in those terms. They behave as if the
world is now safe for us to be both insular and mindlessly
partisan.
 &HT;    To the extent that there is serious discussion about a shared
national interest, it is about whether we can define a new common
threat _ Iraq, China, Russia _ and not a new common mission. The
``big enemy'' is still the organizing principle of American
internationalism, not the ``big opportunity'' _ let alone ``the big
responsibility.''
 &HT;    America does have a bipartisan national interest to pursue, and
it has an enormous role to play. But we won't begin to fully grasp
that until we understand that we are in a new international system.
For the last 10 years we've been talking about ``the post-Cold War
world.'' We've described the world by what it isn't _ it's not the
Cold War _ because we don't know what it is.
 &HT;    Well, what it is is a new international system called
globalization. Globalization is not just a trend, not just a
phenomenon, not just an economic fad. It is the international
system that has replaced the Cold War system. And like the Cold War
system, globalization has its own rules, logic, structures and
characteristics.
 &HT;    Unlike the Cold War system, which was largely static,
glbalization involves the integration of free markets,
nation-states and information technologies to a degree never before
witnessed, in a way that is enabling individuals, corporations and
countries to reach around the world farther, faster, deeper and
cheaper than ever. It is also producing a powerful backlash from
those brutalized or left behind.
 &HT;    If all the threats and opportunities of the Cold War system grew
out of ``division,'' all the threats and opportunities of the
globalization system grow out of ``integration.'' The symbol of the
Cold War system was a wall, which divided everyone. The symbol of
the globalization system is the World Wide Web, which unites
everyone.
 &HT;    In the Cold War we reached for the hot line between the White
House and the Kremlin _ a symbol that we were all divided but at
least someone, the two superpowers, were in charge. In the era of
globalization we reach for the Internet _ a symbol that we are all
connected but nobody is in charge.
 &HT;    If the Cold War had been a sport, it would have been sumo
wrestling, says Michael Mandelbaum, a foreign-affairs expert at
Johns Hopkins University. ``It would be two big fat guys in a ring,
with all sorts of posturing and rituals and stomping of feet, but
actually very little contact until the end of the match, when there
is a brief moment of shoving and the loser gets pushed out of the
ring, but nobody gets killed.''
 &HT;    If globalization were a sport, it would be the 100-yard dash,
over and over and over. And no matter how many times you win, you
have to race again the next day. And if you lose by just a
hundredth of a second it can be as if you lost by an hour.
 &HT;    The driving idea behind globalization is free-market capitalism.
The more you let market forces rule and the more you open your
economy to free trade and competition, the more efficient and
flourishing your economy will be. Globalization means the spread of
free-market capitalism to virtually every country in the world.
 &HT;    The defining document of the Cold War system was the Treaty. The
defining document of the globalization system is the Deal. While
the defining measurement of the Cold War was weight, the defining
measurement of the globalization system is speed _ in commerce,
travel, communication and innovation. The Cold War was about
Einstein's mass-energy equation, E mc2. Globalization is
about Moore's Law, which states that the computing power of silicon
chips will double every 18 months. The Cold War system was built
around nation-states, and it was balanced by two superpowers: the
United States and the Soviet Union. The globalization system is
built around three balances that overlap and affect one another.
One is the traditional balance between states and states. The next
is the balance between states and ``supermarkets'' _ the huge
global stock and bond markets. (The United States can destroy you
by dropping bombs, and the supermarkets can destroy you by
downgrading your bonds.) &HT;    The last is the balance between states and ``super-empowered
individuals.'' Because globalization has brought down the walls
that limited the movement and reach of people, and because it has
simultaneously wired the world into networks, it gives more power
to individuals than ever before to directly influence markets and
nation-states.
 &HT;    For instance, Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire with his
own global network (Jihad Online), declared war on America, and the
Air Force had to launch cruise missiles at him. We launched cruise
missiles at an individual _ as though he were another nation-state.
 &HT;    As the country that benefits most from global economic
integration, we have the responsibility of making sure that this
new system is sustainable. This is particularly important at a time
when the world has been _ and will continue to be _ rocked by
economic crises that can spread rapidly from one continent to
another.
 &HT;    But as the biggest beneficiaries and drivers of globalization,
we are unwittingly putting enormous pressure on the rest of the
world. Americans may think their self-portrait is Grant Wood's
``American Gothic,'' the strait-laced couple, pitchfork in hand,
standing stoically outside the barn. But to the rest of the world,
Americans actually look like some wild, multicolored Andy Warhol
print.
 &HT;    To the rest of the world, American Gothic is actually two
20-something software engineers who come into your country wearing
beads and sandals, with rings in their noses and paint on their
toes. They kick down your front door, overturn everything in the
house, stick a Big Mac in your mouth, fill your kids with ideas you
never had or can't understand, slam a cable box onto your
television, lock in the channel to MTV, plug an Internet connection
into your computer and tell you, ``Download or die.''
 &HT;    We Americans are the apostles of the Fast World, the prophets of
the free market and the high priests of high tech. We want
``enlargement'' of both our values and our Pizza Huts. We want the
world to follow our lead and become democratic and capitalistic,
with a Web site in every pot, a Pepsi on every lip, Microsoft
Windows in every computer and with everyone, everywhere, pumping
their own gas.
 &HT;    No wonder, therefore, that resentment of America is on the rise
globally.
 &HT;    In 1996 I visited Teheran and stayed in the Homa Hotel. The
first thing I noticed was that above the front door in the lobby
were the words ``Down With U.S.A.'' It wasn't a banner. It wasn't
graffiti. It was tiled into the wall. A short time later, I noticed
that Iran's mullahs had begun calling America something other than
the ``Great Satan.'' They had begun calling it ``the capital of
global arrogance.''
 &HT;    The Iranian leadership had grasped the important distinction
between ``global arrogance'' and old-fashioned notions of
imperialism, when one country physically occupies another. Global
arrogance is when your culture and economic clout are so powerful
and widely diffused that you don't need to occupy other people to
influence their lives.
 &HT;    Well, guess what? The Iranians aren't the only ones talking
about America as ``the capital of global arrogance.'' The French,
Germans, Japanese, Indonesians, Indians and Russians also call us
that now.
 &HT;    In most countries, people can no longer distinguish between
American power, American exports, American cultural assaults,
American cultural exports and plain old globalization.
 &HT;    Martin Indyk likes to tell the story of when, as ambassador to
Israel, he was called upon to open the first McDonald's in
Jerusalem. McDonald's gave him a colorful baseball hat to wear,
with the golden arches on it, so he would be properly attired as he
ate the ceremonial first Big Mac in Jerusalem _ with Israel
Television filming every bite for the evening news.
 &HT;    At that moment, an Israeli teen-ager walked up to him, carrying
his own McDonald's hat, which he handed to Indyk with a pen and
asked: ``Are you the ambassador? Can I have your autograph?''
Somewhat sheepishly, Indyk replied: ``Sure. I've never been asked
for my autograph before.''
 &HT;    As the ambassador prepared to sign his name, the Israeli
teen-ager said to him, ``Wow, what's it like to be the ambassador
from McDonald's, going around the world opening McDonald's
restaurants everywhere?''
 &HT;    Indyk looked at the Israeli youth and said, ``No, no. I'm the
American ambassador _ not the ambassador from McDonald's!''
 &HT;    Indyk described what happened next: ``I said to him, 'Does this
mean you don't want my autograph?' And the kid said, 'No, I don't
want your autograph,' and he took his hat back and walked away.''
 &HT;    Oh, well. The trick for America is to lead without being too
overbearing, to be generous without overextending ourselves and to
be tough without engendering too much resentment.
 &HT;    That's no easy trick. But America has had 200 years to invent,
regenerate and calibrate the balances that keep markets free
without their becoming monsters. We have the tools to make a
difference. We have an interest in making a difference. And we have
the responsibility to make a difference.

cheaper than ever. It is also producing a powerful backlash from
those brutalized or left behind.
 &HT;    If all the threats and opportunities of the Cold War system grew
out of ``division,'' all the threats and opportunities of the
globalization system grow out of ``integration.'' The symbol of the
Cold War system was a wall, which divided everyone. The symbol of
the globalization system is the World Wide Web, which unites
everyone.
 &HT;    In the Cold War we reached for the hot line between the White
House and the Kremlin _ a symbol that we were all divided but at
least someone, the two superpowers, were in charge. In the era of
globalization we reach for the Internet _ a symbol that we are all
connected but nobody is in charge.
 &HT;    If the Cold War had been a sport, it would have been sumo
wrestling, says Michael Mandelbaum, a foreign-affairs expert at
Johns Hopkins University. ``It would be two big fat guys in a ring,
with all sorts of posturing and rituals and stomping of feet, but
actually very little contact until the end of the match, when there
is a brief moment of shoving and the loser gets pushed out of the
ring, but nobody gets killed.''
 &HT;    If globalization were a sport, it would be the 100-yard dash,
over and over and over. And no matter how many times you win, you
have to race again the next day. And if you lose by just a
hundredth of a second it can be as if you lost by an hour.
 &HT;    The driving idea behind globalization is free-market capitalism.
The more you let market forces rule and the more you open your
economy to free trade and competition, the more efficient and
flourishing your economy will be. Globalization means the spread of
free-market capitalism to virtually every country in the world.
 &HT;    The defining document of the Cold War system was the Treaty. The
defining document of the globalization system is the Deal. While
the defining measurement of the Cold War was weight, the defining
measurement of the globalization system is speed _ in commerce,
travel, communication and innovation. The Cold War was about
Einstein's mass-energy equation, E mc2. Globalization is
about Moore's Law, which states that the computing power of silicon
chips will double every 18 months. The Cold War system was built
around nation-states, and it was balanced by two superpowers: the
United States and the Soviet Union. The globalization system is
built around three balances that overlap and affect one another.
One is the traditional balance between states and states. The next
is the balance between states and ``supermarkets'' _ the huge
global stock and bond markets. (The United States can destroy you
by dropping bombs, and the supermarkets can destroy you by
downgrading your bonds.) &HT;    The last is the balance between states and ``super-empowered
individuals.'' Because globalization has brought down the walls
that limited the movement and reach of people, and because it has
simultaneously wired the world into networks, it gives more power
to individuals than ever before to directly influence markets and
nation-states.
 &HT;    For instance, Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire with his
own global network (Jihad Online), declared war on America, and the
Air Force had to launch cruise missiles at him. We launched cruise
missiles at an individual _ as though he were another nation-state.
 &HT;    As the country that benefits most from global economic
integration, we have the responsibility of making sure that this
new system is sustainable. This is particularly important at a time
when the world has been _ and will continue to be _ rocked by
economic crises that can spread rapidly from one continent to
another.
 &HT;    But as the biggest beneficiaries and drivers of globalization,
we are unwittingly putting enormous pressure on the rest of the
world. Americans may think their self-portrait is Grant Wood's
``American Gothic,'' the strait-laced couple, pitchfork in hand,
standing stoically outside the barn. But to the rest of the world,
Americans actually look like some wild, multicolored Andy Warhol
print.
 &HT;    To the rest of the world, American Gothic is actually two
20-something software engineers who come into your country wearing
beads and sandals, with rings in their noses and paint on their
toes. They kick down your front door, overturn everything in the
house, stick a Big Mac in your mouth, fill your kids with ideas you
never had or can't understand, slam a cable box onto your
television, lock in the channel to MTV, plug an Internet connection
into your computer and tell you, ``Download or die.''
 &HT;    We Americans are the apostles of the Fast World, the prophets of
the free market and the high priests of high tech. We want
``enlargement'' of both our values and our Pizza Huts. We want the
world to follow our lead and become democratic and capitalistic,
with a Web site in every pot, a Pepsi on every lip, Microsoft
Windows in every computer and with everyone, everywhere, pumping
their own gas.
 &HT;    No wonder, therefore, that resentment of America is on the rise
globally.
 &HT;    In 1996 I visited Teheran and stayed in the Homa Hotel. The
first thing I noticed was that above the front door in the lobby
were the words ``Down With U.S.A.'' It wasn't a banner. It wasn't
graffiti. It was tiled into the wall. A short time later, I noticed
that Iran's mullahs had begun calling America something other than
the ``Great Satan.'' They had begun calling it ``the capital of
global arrogance.''
 &HT;    The Iranian leadership had grasped the important distinction
between ``global arrogance'' and old-fashioned notions of
imperialism, when one country physically occupies another. Global
arrogance is when your culture and economic clout are so powerful
and widely diffused that you don't need to occupy other people to
influence their lives.
 &HT;    Well, guess what? The Iranians aren't the only ones talking
about America as ``the capital of global arrogance.'' The French,
Germans, Japanese, Indonesians, Indians and Russians also call us
that now.
 &HT;    In most countries, people can no longer distinguish between
American power, American exports, American cultural assaults,
American cultural exports and plain old globalization.
 &HT;    Martin Indyk likes to tell the story of when, as ambassador to
Israel, he was called upon to open the first McDonald's in
Jerusalem. McDonald's gave him a colorful baseball hat to wear,
with the golden arches on it, so he would be properly attired as he
ate the ceremonial first Big Mac in Jerusalem _ with Israel
Television filming every bite for the evening news.
 &HT;    At that moment, an Israeli teen-ager walked up to him, carrying
his own McDonald's hat, which he handed to Indyk with a pen and
asked: ``Are you the ambassador? Can I have your autograph?''
Somewhat sheepishly, Indyk replied: ``Sure. I've never been asked
for my autograph before.''
 &HT;    As the ambassador prepared to sign his name, the Israeli
teen-ager said to him, ``Wow, what's it like to be the ambassador
from McDonald's, going around the world opening McDonald's
restaurants everywhere?''
 &HT;    Indyk looked at the Israeli youth and said, ``No, no. I'm the
American ambassador _ not the ambassador from McDonald's!''
 &HT;    Indyk described what happened next: ``I said to him, 'Does this
mean you don't want my autograph?' And the kid said, 'No, I don't
want your autograph,' and he took his hat back and walked away.''
 &HT;    Oh, well. The trick for America is to lead without being too
overbearing, to be generous without overextending ourselves and to
be tough without engendering too much resentment.
 &HT;    That's no easy trick. But America has had 200 years to invent,
regenerate and calibrate the balances that keep markets free
without their becoming monsters. We have the tools to make a
difference. We have an interest in making a difference. And we have
the responsibility to make a difference.

PACIFISM WON'T HELP KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARY CLACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ On the cold rainy night of Jan. 15, 1991, I
marched in an anti-war demonstration, the only one I've ever
participated in. The Persian Gulf War had begun, and I joined
several hundred people in the march from Atlanta's Piedmont Park,
down Auburn Avenue to the crypt of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at
the King Center.
</P>
<P>
   That was to be expected of someone who'd studied nonviolence at
the center and who has returned there each summer and January to
teach workshops, as I have done.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, eight years later, I support, reluctantly, the NATO
bombing of Yugoslavia. I'm no more bellicose than I was back then.
For almost half my life I've advocated nonviolence; I've written
about it, spoken about it and, more important, tried _ while often
failing _ to live it.
</P>
<P>
   I believe, more strongly than ever, that only through a
commitment to nonviolence can the scourges of poverty, war and
hatred be overcome, that only nonviolence can break the manacled
chain of violence.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas the war against Iraq was about the salvation of an
oil supply, the attacks on Yugoslavia are about the salvation of
people. For all the tremendous admiration I have for pacifists, I'm
not one because I can't categorically say that force is never
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that the first goal of nonviolence is to stop
unnecessary pain and suffering, such as the ethnic cleansing
campaign the Serbs are waging on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. But
what options were left once diplomacy with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic had repeatedly failed?
</P>
<P>
   The theologian Reinhold Niebuhr described classical pacifism as
the kind where one is concerned about one's own purity and not
responsibility, ``and the great ethical divide is between people
who want to be pure and those who want to be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The ethical divide that must be crossed by individuals, nations
and multilateral alliances is whether the international community
has a responsibility to stop the slaughter of innocent people,
whether the victims are Albanians in Kosovo, Bosnian Muslims,
Serbs, Rwandans or Sudanese.
</P>
<P>
   If not, then how in the name of God, Allah, Jehovah or whatever
religious or spiritual tenets we embrace, can we justify doing
nothing? At what point does our conscience become so assaulted with
the suffering of other human beings that we choose to no longer
respond?
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Genovese's name is a symbol of neglect and dereliction of
responsibility. In New York City in 1964, she was stabbed to death
in a 45-minute attack that was witnessed and heard by 38 people,
who did nothing to help. This has been called ``bystander effect,''
in which many bystanders are present at a crisis but everyone
leaves the responsibility of action to others.
</P>
<P>
   The international community has a shameful history of waiting
too long to respond to genocide, whether it was the Holocaust,
Bosnia or Rwanda. Are moral obligations to help those in need
limited by their distance from us?
</P>
<P>
   The torrents of war roll through history in a bloody cascade of
innocent people. Finding a way to reduce that torrent to a trickle
remains, perhaps, our greatest challenge.
</P>
<P>
   That a Serb child will be killed so that a Kosovar Albanian
child won't isn't a just or logical equation. Somehow, although I
still believe the answer lies in nonviolence, we have to find a way
where we won't have to make that choice.

PINCH-HITTING FOR JOE TORRE NO DREAM JOB FOR YANKEE MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Don Zimmer was going to have to call in sick. It
was only an exhibition game, but he was going into the hospital,
leaving the New York Yankees yet another manager short.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer shrugged, and made it a point to immediately assure
everybody there was no need to start a vigil. Just a routine
follow-up to monitor an ulcer that doctors discovered over the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Other than being 68 and hobbling on a surgically repaired right
knee and worrying about dear friend Joe Torre and being in George
Steinbrenner's line of fire, Zimmer couldn't be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the diseases around here,'' Zimmer said, ``shoot, there's
nothing wrong with no little ulcer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mention anything about doctors in the vicinity of the Yankees
these days, and people get more nervous than a left-handed hitter
facing Randy Johnson. Torre is on leave due to prostate cancer
surgery. Darryl Strawberry is trying to re-establish himself as a
big-leaguer and is undergoing treatment for colon cancer.
Minor-league catcher Jaime Torres is recuperating from thyroid
cancer treatment. Third baseman Mike Lowell, whom the Yankees
traded out of their minor-league system this past winter, is on the
mend from testicular cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Until further notice, then, Zimmer is the interim manager.
</P>
<P>
   Is he having fun?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' Zimmer said. ``For many, many reasons. One of
them is, I was crippled when I took the job and got more crippled
being on it. When I say `crippled,' I mean hurting. Hurting bad (in
the knee, which doctors have drained several times). That took the
fun out of it for me. I couldn't be where I was supposed to be at
different times. I did the best I could, and I just kept injuring
it more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, taking over a club _ I don't care what club _ for a guy
who's laying in a hospital after a cancer operation, there's no way
that I could be at ease at any time. You hear so many things. Who
should manage the team? Who should do this? Those things get on
your mind, but I can't worry about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be nobody in the world _ including Ali, his
(Torre's) wife _ who will be happier when he comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   As it so happens, Zimmer is overseeing a club that won 114 games
during a 1998 season that was highly irregular.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees stormed through the American League playoffs, swept
the San Diego Padres in the World Series, and took their bows after
finishing with a major-league-record 125 wins.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees acquired five-time Cy Young Award winner Roger
Clemens at the start of spring training, things looked almost too
good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Things were too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   At best, the Yankees began the season Monday night in Oakland
without the man who has led them to World Series titles twice in
the past three years. At worst ... Nobody wants to contemplate
that. (The A's beat the visiting world champions 5-3 in the
rain-soaked opener.)
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say the prognosis for Torre is as promising as the
Yankees' prospects of reaching the postseason. Early indications
are that the cancer did not spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team has a lot of strength,'' said third baseman
Scott Brosius, the MVP of the '98 World Series. ``To be quite
honest, it's really not a team issue. It's not a baseball issue.
It's strictly an issue of a person who has a disease that he's
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to go about our business, do the things we do and
continue on a personal level to keep praying that everything goes
well for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre, 58, eased some concerns by beginning to drop by Tampa's
Legends Field training complex near the end of camp. He wanted to
show the players that he is fine, that he's resting and recovering
as fast as he can.
</P>
<P>
   Until he returns, his trusted right-hand man _ a cross between
Popeye and Yoda _ is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer began his professional baseball career in 1949. He has
managed the San Diego Padres, Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox and
Chicago Cubs. He got married on the field before a 1951 game in
Elmira, N.Y., then got in uniform and played.
</P>
<P>
   Other than one Social Security check that Zimmer cashed when he
thought he had retired after the 1995 season, he hasn't earned a
dollar outside of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   All that experience, and none of it prepared Zimmer for his
current situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how to explain the feeling I have here,
because I'm not the manager, in a sense,'' said Zimmer, who has
been the Yankees' bench coach since Torre brought him out of a
brief retirement before the 1996 season. ``I don't think I've ever
managed a team where I wasn't at ease. But here, it's different.
It's not my team. We're here to try and do the best we can until
our man gets back.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Torre always seemed to know the right thing to do and say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have a meeting, for any reason, I'm not Joe Torre,''
Zimmer said. ``Joe Torre is a very soft-spoken individual. Kind.
Loves everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Joe Torre. If I'm going to have a meeting, I can't
tell Joe to put it on a tape and let me play it for the players. If
I'm going to have a meeting, I've got so say it the way I want to
say it. It's not going to be Joe Torre. I am what I am, whether you
like it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius calls Zimmer ``the ultimate encyclopedia of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no way of knowing how the Yankees will respond to
Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some professionals in here,'' Yankees pitcher David
Cone said. ``Guys are taking care of themselves, getting ready to
go. We just deal with everything that comes. I'm glad he's here. We
thought he might retire after last year. Ironically, he's here when
we need him the most.''
</P>
<P>
   He's here, because, well, a dear friend needs him to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 68 years old,'' Zimmer said. ``I don't want to manage
anymore, except in this situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Joe.''

FINDING THE RIGHT NOZZLE TO FIT YOUR GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A pass through the garden section of any home
center or hardware store will confirm that watering your lawn,
shrubs, flowers and garden has become both art and science.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of garden hose spray nozzles can meet your every
watering need, and in most cases they are all contained in one
hand-held adjustable tool. These nozzles often feature a large
round head with a selection of spray functions. With each turn,
there is a different nozzle opening, offering a different spray
pattern _ from mist to soaker, shower or jet.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can water delicate flowers with a subtle mist rather
than risk blowing their petals off with a blast tantamount to a
fire truck hose.
</P>
<P>
   The shower spray allows you to water more than one plant at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Turn to the jet spray for cleaning debris from the driveway,
washing windows or house siding.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to traditional hose nozzles, the squeeze-grip handle
features a lock bar, so the water stays on, without having to
constantly maintain a strong grip on the handle.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the manufacturer, adjustable hose nozzles come in a
variety of materials, from chrome-plated to rubber and high-impact
plastic. The price will vary between manufacturers, materials and
number of jet options. But most adjustable sprays range in price
from approximately $4.79 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   To keep a nozzle in good working order, always wipe off dirt and
any grease after each use. If spray openings become clogged from
hard water and its mineral deposits, soak the head in a
lime-cleansing solution, which is available at most hardware
stores.
</P>
<P>
   It's also advisable to keep plastic nozzles out of direct
sunlight on a daily basis, as the exposure may eventually cause the
plastic to become brittle.

VARYING TYPES OF FIBER IMPORTANT TO BALANCED DIET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Doctors have known for decades that fiber is the
foundation of any healthy diet, and can help reduce the risk of
cancer, heart disease and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science is solid,'' said Joyce Bagyi, a clinical dietitian
at the Albany Medical Center here.
</P>
<P>
   More recent research, however, shows that while fiber is good,
not all fiber is the same. The soluble fiber found in oats,
psyllium (the stuff of Metamucil), beans, lentils and some fruits
work best at reducing artery-clogging cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Other insoluble fiber, found in wheat bran, seeds, whole grains,
and the skins of vegetables and fruits, is also good but serves a
different purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Most nutritionists say their primary goal is to encourage people
to increase their total fiber intake, regardless of the specific
type.
</P>
<P>
   The American diet, rich in processed and fast foods, provides
only 12 to 14 grams of fiber per day, about half the recommended
amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even diets including the recommended servings of grains,
fruits and vegetables may not provide adequate soluble fiber,''
said Joanne Slavin, a professor in the Department of Food Science
and Nutrition at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Soluble fiber remains longer in the intestines and thus absorbs
more cholesterol. Insoluble fiber absorbs water, which increases
the speed at which waste passes through the body.
</P>
<P>
   Both types of fiber serve an important function in the body, but
to reduce the risk of heart disease, it's worthwhile to note the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we think of soluble fiber, we really think of cholesterol
lowering,'' Slavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a bowl of oatmeal and a bowl of split pea or black bean
soup is a good way to start adding soluble fiber to the diet.
</P>
<P>
   But it's only part of the story. ``The oatmeal can't work
alone,'' Bagyi said. ``It's really getting people to eat a more
balanced diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some easy changes to make: Pick whole-grain bread over
white, add a fruit item to every meal, eat a salad or other
vegetable with lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   A good rule of thumb, courtesy of the American Dietetic
Association, is five servings or fruits and vegetables daily, and
legumes at least once or twice a week. High fiber snacks include
Triscuits or air-popped popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of soluble fiber is psyllium, found in Metamucil
and other natural laxatives. While there's no harm in supplementing
a diet with regular Metamucil, nutritionists say the preferred way
to get fiber is through a healthy diet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet psyllium, which comes from a plant, is such a good source of
natural fiber that some food manufacturers, including Kellogg's,
have begun adding it to their products as a way to boost overall
fiber content.
</P>
<P>
   For those who are not used to eating a lot of fiber, go slowly
at first. The body needs time to adjust or the higher-fiber diet
may cause unwanted gas.
</P>
<P>
   Slavin often hears from people who give up on fiber because they
feel it makes them too flatulent. ``That's really a barrier for
people,'' she said.

   Cheryl Gelder-Kogan is a fiber fan and not just because she
likes the taste of fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a family with heart disease and cancer, so as a
sheer survival strategy, I've tried to become a healthy eater,''
said Gelder-Kogan, who lives in the Albany suburb of Menands.
</P>
<P>
   Gelder-Kogan, 45, believes her high-fiber diet has helped lower
her cholesterol from 325 to 204 during the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   She stays away from fast food and eats fruits instead of sweets.
``I can't remember the last time I had a chocolate fudge sundae,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her family, eating fiber has become part of the daily
routine, like exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's both changing your thought process and adjusting to
making something with a little more fiber,'' she said.

IT'S MCCAIN OVER CLINTON ANY TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain is a smart man, an excellent U.S. senator, a
courageous human being and _ compared to President Clinton, at
least _ an expert on military matters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain knows about war, having endured the hell on earth of
being a POW during the Vietnam War. Clinton never served in the
armed forces and in fact demonstrated against the very war that
inflicted so much misery on McCain.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems perfectly reasonable that the former Navy
pilot/current GOP presidential hopeful should see fit to offer
advice on the subject of warfare to the former war
protester/current president.
</P>
<P>
   And the advice that McCain has been giving Clinton, in
interviews and an Op-Ed piece published by USA Today, is this: The
United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization must be
ready and willing to fight a ground war if their ongoing air
assault fails to stop the merciless campaign of ethnic cleansing
being conducted by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomats may call our use of force something less than war,
but the pilots who are leading the offensive know, even if their
leaders do not, that the United States and our NATO allies are at
war ...,'' McCain wrote. ``And we must, by whatever means
necessary, win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure, the introduction of American ground troops in
Kosovo would be an awful decision for any president to make. Hearts
will break in many homes when families lose _ as surely they will _
loved ones to ancient Balkan hatreds that few Americans can
comprehend. While such a decision should be made very reluctantly
and only when all other means have been exhausted, it must not be
ruled out.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the sort of thing that most Americans want to hear.
It is definitely not the sort of thing that Clinton wants us to
hear when he is doing his devious best to downplay the potential
for full-fledged warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton specializes in misleading the American people. McCain
specializes in telling the truth. And the truth about U.S.
involvement in Yugoslavia's civil war is that there are only two
options: cut and run, or cut loose and do whatever it takes to
crush Milosevic and his murderous regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Means must be designed to serve ends, and not vice versa,''
McCain wrote. ``It is utterly irresponsible for any U.S. official
to declare or even intimate that we will not do whatever we must to
defeat the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, the Republican candidate for president in 1996, has
been making similar statements. But even though Dole is reluctant
to criticize the man who defeated him at the polls _ and who later
sent him to the Balkans as a special envoy _ McCain isn't reluctant
in the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a terrible derogation of his responsibilities as commander
in chief, President Clinton failed to prepare the public adequately
for the difficulty and danger of this mission,'' McCain said in his
USA Today commentary. ``Indeed, the president himself seems
surprised to discover that war can be more challenging than firing
a few cruise missiles at radar sites.''
</P>
<P>
   When he suggests that Clinton was surprised that Milosevic
didn't cave in as soon as the bombs started falling, McCain is
giving the president a benefit of the doubt that some Americans
might not be willing to give him. Those of us who oppose American
intervention in a European civil war _ and who don't trust Clinton
as far as we could throw him _ suspect that the president knew darn
well that air power alone would not break Milosevic and that NATO
would achieve its military and political objectives only by
embarking on a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us suspect that Clinton knew all this and that he
declined to share his knowledge with the American people. If the
president is taking his country to war, he at least owes his fellow
citizens the truth.
</P>
<P>
   McCain argues that there is no turning back now, that the United
States is committed to ``proving the power and resolve of the
world's only superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he's right. But it never should have come to this.

SCHOOL HOPES TO BOOST ITS PROFILE WITH AD CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ ``Where's the beef?'' ``Got milk?'' To these
indelible advertising questions, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
hopes to add ``Why not change the world?''
</P>
<P>
   That's the centerpiece of the largest marketing blitz in the
university's history, aimed at making RPI a legitimate competitor
of research powerhouses like Stanford University and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Following a year's worth of research showing that RPI suffers
not so much from a poor image as a lack of image, print ads will
appear throughout the country in newsmagazines and television spots
will air on CNN, CNBC and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a national strategic campaign to gain
international renown for RPI,'' said Robbee Kosak, RPI's vice
president for institute advancement. ``We don't have the visibility
we think we deserve based on the quality of education we deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   The $250,000 campaign creates a singular look to go along with
the message. Gone are the autumnal tones, fresh faces and
ivy-covered buildings of the typical college brochure. The RPI ads
have a hard-edged, almost science fiction-like feel.
</P>
<P>
   The television spot begins with a close-up of Earth, electric
guitar reminiscent of Norman Greenbaum's ``Spirit in the Sky''
playing in the background. As the shot widens, viewers see Earth is
in the shape of a light bulb _ which fizzles and turns black.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many universities does it take to change the world?'' an
announcer asks. ``Just one,'' he answers. The light returns and the
screen fills with the RPI logo and directions to the school's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   The six print ads feature innovative research conducted at RPI,
including Brutus.1, the computer that writes novels, and Map-Info
Corp., a student project that turned into a $60 million company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get away from the ivy-covered image of most
universities and look to the future,'' said Dick Shultz, the
president of Media Logic, the Albany company that designed the ads.
</P>
<P>
   With increased competition for students and grants, universities
are beginning to turn to strategic marketing to enhance their
images. According to Kosak, RPI and Texas Christian University in
Fort Worth are among the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger universities, particularly the ones with richer
histories, have never had to go on the marketing bandwagon,''
Schultz said. ``But increasingly, universities are seeing the
importance of having a brand and protecting that brand, rather than
just leaving it to tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign appears part of a synergy of measures designed to
boost the national profile of RPI, a 175-year-old upstate New York
school with an enrollment of 6,300.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the selection of Shirley Ann Jackson, head of
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as the university's next
president. And, more recently, there was the announcement that RPI
would join a handful of elite institutions that require their
students to own laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz thinks those actions would resonate for the ad campaign's
target audience, those he calls ``influence peddlers'' among alumni
and business people.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the current issue of RPI's alumni magazine said
the ads were aimed at ``a better-educated, more affluent and more
influential marketplace.'' Though the ads will run in national
outlets, they will be focused regionally in areas where technology
and enrollment is strong: upstate New York, Northern California,
New York City and northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will last 10 weeks, to be followed by a study that
will examine its effectiveness.

FINDING THE SENSE BENEATH THE SURFACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Im having trouble understanding the phrase humanitarian
catastrophe,'' writes Joan Zomberg of Rockland, Maine. ``A
situation can be a catastrophe, a disaster, a natural disaster,
maybe a human disaster, but a catastrophe that is humanitarian,
that `promotes human welfare'? . . . Can the phrase be defended in
English, and how does it translate into French or Italian?''
</P>
<P>
   The catastrophe Zomberg refers to is, of course, the plight of
the fleeing Kosovars; humanitarian disaster is a frequent
alternative. And either one, if humanitarian is read as an
adjective, can sound absurd.
</P>
<P>
   But yes, the phrase can be defended. In fact, it needs no
defense: English, with its freedom to mix and match parts of
speech, is full of similar compounds. An English paper is not
``English'' in the same sense as your cousin from Birmingham; an
insane asylum is a place to house the mentally ill, not an
unbalanced building; a juvenile court may be centuries old.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, we take these words for granted, but
``occasionally someone notices that the first element in one of
these compounds can be read as an adjective,'' note Bergen Evans
and Cornelia Evans in their 1957 usage dictionary. ``This is all
very well as a source of innocent merriment,'' they allow _ and
indeed, such innocent merriment has made language maven Richard
Lederer famous, with his jokes about the semantic absurdity of
civil war and death benefit. But jokes aside (where they belong),
such compounds are normal English.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian catastrophe is a relatively new one; it's not
widespread in journalism until the '90s, after the Gulf War, though
the keen-eared John Updike had characters using it in his 1978
novel ``The Coup.'' We haven't yet assimilated it, so its
oxymoronic potential is more apparent than that of, say, criminal
justice. But read humanitarian as part of a compound noun and you
get the common-sense meaning _ that in humanitarian terms, with all
that word can encompass, the situation is catastrophic for the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, too, the term has its uses; it avoids the
inflammatory genocide (while officials debate the facts and
definitions), and it gets around ethnic cleansing, such an odious
euphemism it can only be used with sanitizing quotation marks. It
also blames nobody, allowing each interest group to pick its own
villain.
</P>
<P>
   As for the French and Italian, they're using the same words in
the newspapers _ and having the same linguistic debate. Le Monde
reports on the catastrophe humanitaire, Corriere della Sera on the
catastrofe umanitaria. But a letter to the editor of the Italian
paper makes exactly the same point as Zomberg does: If humanitarian
has to do with improving the human condition, ``come e possibile
parlare di `catastrofe umanitaria?' '' _ ``how is it possible to
speak of a humanitarian catastrophe?'' Word watchers of the world,
unite! (And how do you say nitpick in Italian?)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in the American-speaking world, the crisis in
Europe has put a lid on bloviate, which was enjoying a revival in
the waning days of Monicagate. But for readers who inquired about
it during those windbaggy weeks, here's the scoop: Bloviate is an
American coinage meaning ``to orate pompously,'' according to
William Safire's New Political Dictionary, and dates to about 1850;
it's widely associated with President Warren G. Harding, apparently
an adept in the art. Michael Quinion's highly recommended World
Wide Words web site (http://www.quinion.com/words) suggests that
bloviate, like Harding, is an Ohio native.
</P>
<P>
   The real mystery is why the lexicographers ignored bloviate for
so many years. It's in my 1997 Webster's New World College
Dictionary, but readers searched other recent dictionaries without
success. Like disconnect, bloviate somehow eluded the radar of most
slang compilers as well as straight lexicographers.
</P>
<P>
   The peak of its current flowering may have been a George Booth
cartoon in the Jan. 25 New Yorker, in which Congressman Blowviatt
demands ``no more half-truths, no more spins, no more
taradiddles,'' then retires to his room with a copy of Hustler
magazine. It may be lying low while the bombs fall, but I have a
feeling bloviation will be back with us long before the current
humanitarian catastrophe has ended.

THESE AUSSIE EXPRESSIONS ARE EXTRA GROUSE 
</HEADLINE>

   While dining in Australia recently, we heard a woman at the next
table order steak and seafood, then tell her friends, ``In America,
they call that surf and turf!'' True enough, but why bother
mentioning it: When it comes to colorful expressions, Americanisms
can hardly compare to Aussie talk. Here, from Australian airline
Qantas and down-under travel specialist Austravel, are some of the
memorable words and phrases.
</P>
<P>
   --We say ``hard work'' _ they say ``hard yakka.''
</P>
<P>
   --We say ``trousers'' _ they say ``strides.''
</P>
<P>
   --We say ``pay up'' _ they say ``hit your kick.''
</P>
<P>
   --We say ``thank you'' _ they say ``ta.''
</P>
<P>
   --We say ``goodbye'' _ they say ``ta ta.''
</P>
<P>
   --We say ``try it'' _ they say ``give it a burl!''
</P>
<P>
   --We say ``dispute'' _ they say ``barney.''
</P>
<P>
   --We say ``outstanding'' _ they say ``extra grouse.''
</P>
<P>
   --We say ``cookie'' _ they say ``bickie.''
</P>
<P>
   --We say ``slot machines'' _ they say ``pokies.''
</P>
<P>
   We hear some of these expressions may be fading, especially in
urban areas, with one reason being the ubiquitous and sometimes
insidious influence of American pop culture. Let's hope not: We
think ``tube and tucker'' (a can of beer and food) beats ``surf and
turf'' any day.

CRISIS COULD RESHAPE THE QUEST FOR THE PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Depending on how long the United States is involved
in the conflict in Kosovo, the crisis could reshape the
presidential campaign, shifting the focus from domestic affairs to
foreign policy, an area in which some candidates have little
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, the conflict has highlighted the lack of
foreign policy experience of the Republican front-runner, Texas
Governor George W. Bush, while it appears to have boosted Senator
John McCain of Arizona, a former Vietnam POW and a Senate leader on
international issues.
</P>
<P>
   This is the opposite of what analysts thought would unfold in
the Republican presidential race. Until recently, it was presumed
that the 2000 campaign, like those in 1992 and 1996, would center
on domestic matters. Indeed, after Bill Clinton defeated President
Bush in 1992, it was widely attributed to Clinton's effectiveness
in criticizing Bush for focusing too much on foreign affairs. Thus,
the backers of Bush's son for the presidency highlighted his
domestic expertise as governor.
</P>
<P>
   But even McCain says it is far too early to say how Kosovo will
affect the campaign. It depends on how long the conflict lasts, and
the result, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this situation is resolved fairly quickly, then it will
recede in the consciousness of the American people as previous ones
have,'' McCain said Monday in an interview. ``But if it goes on,
obviously the American people would look at people they think about
who they can trust on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, a drawn-out battle in Kosovo could
provide former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey with a prime
issue against Vice President Al Gore, who helped develop the
bombing strategy. Bradley started out cautiously, saying the day
the NATO airstrikes began on March 24 that he had ``serious
questions about our policy.'' But a week later, on April 1, Bradley
took aim at his primary opponent, saying the Clinton-Gore policy is
flawed, and ``Kosovo could become like Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The two losers could be Gore and George W. (Bush),'' said
Walter Russell Mead, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations. ``If we have a long inconclusive war, then the
Democratic Party needs somebody not linked to the policy, and Gore
won't be able to separate himself. That's good news for Bradley.
For George W., it does make it tough that he doesn't have good
foreign policy experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to former
President Bush, said Monday that the younger Bush clearly lacks
international credentials. ``Is he comfortable with foreign policy?
I would say not,'' Scowcroft said. He said the governor's main
experience ``was being around when his father was in his many
different jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Scowcroft stressed that Governor Bush and McCain are his
favorite candidates. Scowcroft said Bush will learn throughout the
campaign ``and he had more attention to foreign policy than Bill
Clinton did in 1992.'' The bottom line, Scowcroft said, is there
needs to be more focus on the importance of foreign policy than in
the last two campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo conflict already has affected McCain's candidacy. He
canceled plans Tuesday to formally announce his presidential
campaign in New Hampshire, figuring this was no time to attack
Clinton's policy _ or trying to compete with the news from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, McCain has received more attention in the last
week from the national media for his statements in support of the
airstrikes and his warning that ground forces shouldn't be ruled
out. For the record, McCain said Monday, ``I'm a candidate. I'm
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican candidate strongly in support of the
airstrikes is Elizabeth Dole, whose government experience is mostly
domestic, such as heading the Transportation and Labor departments,
but who also has foreign policy experience as former head of the
Red Cross. Her husband, former Senator Bob Dole, has been to Kosovo
as a special envoy for the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The other Republican candidates have varying foreign policy
experience. Magazine publisher Steve Forbes is known mostly for his
flat tax issue. He has cited his foreign business dealings and his
service as chairman of the bipartisan Board for International
Broadcasting from 1985 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander often notes that he
has talked with world leaders and once lived with his family for
six months in Australia. Former Reagan administration aide Gary
Bauer specialized in domestic, not foreign, affairs. Patrick J.
Buchanan, meanwhile, often talks about foreign policy from an
isolationist perspective, making his opposition to the Serbian
bombings predictable. Representative John Kasich of Ohio has
specialized in domestic budget and tax matters.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a Vietnam veteran, does have
significant credentials, serving as chairman of the strategic
forces subcommittee of the Armed Forces Committee. Smith opposes
the US military action in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Smith said Kosovo ``could be a defining
issue in the Republican presidential primary. Where is George Bush
on this, where are these guys on this?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, his lack of foreign policy experience has not been
viewed as a problem until recently. Bush's father served as CIA
director, US ambassador to China, and later as president put
together the coalition forces for the Persian Gulf War. But in the
1992 campaign, Clinton criticized Bush for caring little about
domestic affairs. By comparison, Governor Bush's focus on domestic
policy is considered his major strength.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, when asked about Clinton's policy on Kosovo, has been
cautious, saying the United States ``must have a clear mission ...
My question is, is it good for America?''
</P>
<P>
   A quick resolution to the conflict could diminish the importance
of foreign affairs in the campaign. After all, even President
Bush's 1991 victory in the Gulf War was not enough to prevent his
defeat the following year.
</P>
<P>
   But if the conflict drags on for months or casualties start to
mount _ and especially if ground troops are warring with Serbian
forces during the primaries _ then the impact could be huge. In
that case, the comparison likely will be made to President Carter,
who lost reelection in 1976 partly because US hostages had been
taken in Iran.

AIRLIFT CHALLENGE: THE RETURN TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evacuation of 100,000 ethnic Albanians from the chaotic camps to
which they have fled from Serbia's Kosovo province would require
the largest civilian airlift in history, but it is well within the
ability of the United States and its NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   The real challenge to the allies, say current and former
officials of refugee-assistance agencies, is to return the refugees
to the communities from which they were driven. Otherwise, the
officials say, the evacuation will have helped Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic achieve his goal of emptying Kosovo of its
non-Serb residents.
</P>
<P>
   Already, families and communities that fled together are
splintering, reducing the chances they will return eventually to
their homeland. Restoration of previously existing communities has
never been accomplished in the bloody years since 1991, when the
disintegration of multi-ethnic Yugoslavia began.
</P>
<P>
   Little specific information about NATO's evacuation plans is
known, other than that Germany has agreed to receive 40,000
refugees; the United States and Turkey, 20,000 each; Greece,
Norway, and Canada smaller numbers. Administration sources said
Monday that details of when the airlift will begin, and how it will
be organized, are still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of preparation _ coupled with the speed with which the
allies were able to pump over a million rations of food a day into
the region _ was widely interpreted as indicating that NATO badly
underestimated the likely size and speed of the exodus from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves the alliance facing what has long been a nightmare
scenario _ creation of hostile Albanian Muslim refugee camps in
Macedonia, which could give Milosevic a pretext for invading that
former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew S. Natsios, who was director of the US Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance in President Bush's administration, said Monday
that the evacuation of 100,000 people would be a massive
undertaking, requiring hundreds, perhaps thousands, of flights. The
disaster assistance office would be a lead agency in any such
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios, who is now Massachusetts secretary of administration
and finance, said he did not believe the US government would run
the flights itself, but would rely on the Geneva-based
International Organization for Migration. That organization, formed
after World War II to help refugees return home, is supported by
annual donations from member states.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the US, NATO, or the migration organization runs the
flights, ``it can be done,'' said Natsios, who helped plan and
execute refugee relief efforts in Bosnia, Somalia, and Iraq. ``The
question is not that, but if you move them to other places, will
they ever go back? . . . The farther they go, the longer they're
gone, the less chance they will go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Natsios said that for any relief effort to succeed, the
countries leading the effort must have clear, constant objectives
and a strategy for realizing them. In this respect, he said,
``watching this unfold has been painful'' because the objectives
have changed several times and the evacuation does not appear to
have been part of the strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   The impending evacuation dwarfs the dramatic airlift of US
personnel and allied South Vietnamese from Saigon on the closing
day of the Vietnam War. The 70 helicopters that operated
continuously between the city and US ships waiting offshore moved
only about 7,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Power, director of the Human Rights Initiative at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, said there is nothing in
the announcement of the refugee evacuation that indicates the US
administration foresaw the potential size of the exodus from
Kosovo, or contemplated the need to move refugees from the region
to prevent Macedonia and Albania from being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were so busy focusing on protection of NATO pilots and on
political objectives, that this was quite far from people's
minds,'' said Power, who has been both a journalist and a relief
worker in the Balkans. ``There was also a feeling that the best
thing was to keep people at the border because one of the lessons
of Bosnia is'' that when people settle in far-away places, ``they
do not go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugee-assistance agencies are alarmed at the possibility of a
broad dispersion of the refugees. But they also say the refugees
must get relief from the chaos and horrific conditions in which
they are now mired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a terrible mistake to move people out of camps to other
places where resettlement is not a real option,'' said Leonard
Rubenstein, executive director of Physicians for Human Rights, an
internationally active human rights organization based in Boston.
US military bases at Guantanamo, Cuba, and on the Pacific island of
Guam, where the US may shelter refugees, ``are not for resettlement
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``These refugees have been subjected to cataclysmic human rights
abuses, and one of the major abuses is forcible removal from their
homes,'' Rubenstein said. Places like Guam and Guantanamo, which
are isolated from normal society, ``will really disrupt their lives
even more, unless people are aware what kind of places they are,
and want to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sheri Fink, a member of the physicians' group who is working
with refugees in Blace, Macedonia, said divisions within families
and communities who fled Kosovo together already are occurring, and
she fears evacuation will widen the divisions and lessen the
chances of returning the refugees to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   But, Fink said in a telephone interview Monday, the airlift is
positive because ``these people have to get out of the situation
they are in now.''
</P>
<P>
   She said hypothermia, severe diarrhea, seizures, and mental
distress already are commonplace, and there will be a threat of
cholera if the weather warms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indescribable how they're living in this field, sinking
in mud and human waste,'' Fink said. ``Most of them are city
people, and they don't know at all what to do. They sit there and
say, in English, `Help me, please. Get me out of here.' ''

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Thep Phanom's Quail Flies With Thai Flair  
   
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  It seems every time a restaurant goes under, a
Thai restaurant rises in its spot. The vibrant flavors and fresh
ingredients have made this style of food just about as popular as
Chinese.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing that makes Thai food so irresistable is the complex
balance of ingredients _ like the mix that flavors the Fried Quail
from Thep Phanom. Thep Phanom opened in 1986 and still maintains
its position as the best Thai restaurant in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are first rubbed with lemongrass, garlic, cilantro and
fish sauce, then are allowed to marinate overnight. Then the birds
are fried to a crisp turn and served with a dipping sauce made with
fish sauce, fresh lime, chile powder and cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Chef/owner Pathama Parikanont is a self-taught cook, learning at
her father's knee in Thailand. He would tell her what he wanted and
she would choose the vegetables from the garden and run to the
nearby rivers to catch fish and shrimp for his creations.
</P>
<P>
   She started with many of his recipes and has since made them her
own. At the restaurant, she creates dishes that combine her Thai
background and California sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, located in a Victorian on Waller at Fillmore,
feels like a turn-of-the-century parlor. It's warm and inviting and
filled with Thai artwork the owner has collected through the years.
</P>
<P>
   The menu includes the popular chicken coconut soup, but also
offers many other dishes, such as the Siamese Twins, a curried
seafood dish that's wrapped in banana leaves and steamed.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there's the quail, which is reason enough for me
to return again and again.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Thep Phanom, 400 Waller St. (at Fillmore), San Francisco; &LR; 
 &LR; (415) 431-2526. Open for dinner nightly. &LR;

 &UR; THEP PHANOM'S FRIED QUAIL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 quail
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced fresh lemongrass (use only the tender pale
part)
</P>
<P>
   Stems from 1 bunch cilantro, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Golden Mountain Sauce (Thai soy sauce)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Tipparos Fish Sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil

<P>
   6 cilantro leaves for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Thai-Style Spicy Sauce (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the quail by cutting along both sides of the backbone
with kitchen scissors. Place your index finger into the neck cavity
and gently pull down on the backbone, removing it and the ribs (you
may need to use a boning knife to cut away ribs).
</P>
<P>
   Find the hip bone and cut around it, taking care not to cut off
the legs. Rinse the quail thoroughly, then dry with paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the garlic, lemongrass, cilantro stems, white pepper and
salt in a mortar and crush to form a paste. Add the black pepper,
soy sauce, fish sauce and 1 tablespoon oil; blend well.
</P>
<P>
   Rub each quail thoroughly with the paste. Stack quail atop one
another in a plastic bag. Squeeze out all the air and seal the bag.
Refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Remove quail from the refrigerator; discard the marinade.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large saucepan to 375 degrees. Carefully slip
2 quail in the pan and fry for about 3 minutes on each side for
slightly pink meat, 4 minutes each side for thoroughly cooked meat.
The skin will be crisp. Remove the quail and drain on paper towels.
Repeat with the remaining quail.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer to serving plates and garnish with cilantro leaves.
Serve with the Thai-Style Spicy Sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The San Francisco Chronicle's panel
of  professional tasters tries a different product available in 
 supermarkets.    TASTER'S CHOICE: Mollie's Squeezes Out Other Orange Juices  
   
   
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  For many people, the day just can't start without
orange juice. In recent years, fresh-squeezed brands with shorter
shelf lives have gained in popularity, with many people touting
their superior taste.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted five brands of orange juice labeled as
fresh-squeezed. We also included one popular brand of orange juice
not-from-concentrate to see if there was a significant difference
in taste. And there was: Panelists scored the fresh-squeezed brands
as many as 57 points higher than the not-from-concentrate variety.
</P>
<P>
   Prices between fresh-squeezed orange juice and pasteurized
brands that are not from concentrate vary dramatically. There's
also a significant price range among the brands of fresh-squeezed.
But the panel's results suggest you get what you pay for.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mollie Stone's &LR;  (1/2 gallon, $6.99 at Mollie Stone's) _ the
most expensive brand _ took top honors. One panelist described it
as ``a beauty;'' others noted the balance of acidity to sweetness
and pleasantly strong orange aromas. One panelist, however, did not
like the bitter aftertaste from the orange pith. Four would buy it;
one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to another brand that's squeezed at the
store: &UR; Whole Foods &LR;  (1/2 gallon, $6.29 at Whole Foods). Three
panelists commented on the superior balance of flavors. One
detected notes of orange blossom. Four would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Odwalla &LR;  (1/2 gallon, $5.49 at many supermarkets) scored just
two points lower than Whole Foods. One panelist thought it was too
sweet; another described it as ``excellent but not as exciting'' as

 CHRON   EDITORS NOTE: Food, nutrition and health studies bombard us, but 
 the seemingly endless information is often as confusing as it is 
 enlightening. Starting today, with Food in the News, The 
 Chronicle's Food staff aims to change that. This regular 
 round-up column will make practical sense of the latest 
 nutrition-related studies _ as well as offering offbeat but 
 tantalizing snippets of other food news to put on your plate.

 FOOD IN THE NEWS: Salmonella Infection Declines Nationwide  
   
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Some good news about food contamination:
Salmonella infections are dropping _ particularly cases involving
tainted eggs.
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services reported last month
that the number of cases involving salmonella enteritidis _ the
type of bacterium associated with eggs _ dropped 44 percent between
1996 and 1998. Other salmonella infections dropped 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news doesn't end there. The report shows a 15
percent drop in the number of cases caused by campylobacter, the
most common disease-causing bacteria in the U.S. food supply.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control attributes the drop to new
strict inspection guidelines enforced by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration. In part, the
rules require meat and poultry plants to keep scientifically
structured records of things such as refrigerator temperatures and
sanitation schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on the number of cases of infections
reported to five data-collection sites around the country,
including one that covers San Francisco and Alameda counties. The
sites reflect a health sampling of 20.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   There is one piece of bad news, however: The rate of E. coli
infection continues rising and falling like a roller coaster. The
numbers of reported cases of infection by  &LR; E. coli 0157:H7 &LR; , the
strain that's most virulent, rose to 2.8 per 100,000 people last
year. In 1996, the number was 2.7 cases per 100,000 people; in
1997, it dropped to 2.3.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Exclusive Vegetables &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A tiny seed of an effort between organic farmers and the
government could result in the comeback of obscure, century-old
fruits and vegetables _ some of which may end up in Bay Area
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The group of farmers, researchers, seed producers and social
activists _ a California contingent among them _ met last week with
USDA representatives in Oregon to figure out how to make better use
of the government's 27 public seed and plant-material repositories.
</P>
<P>
   The government ``libraries'' contain about 437,000 species of
fruits, nuts and seeds. For example, researchers at the National
Plant Germplasm System repository for pears in Corvallis, Ore.,
have material from a 150-year-old tree in Massachusetts. California
repositories include heirloom and wild tomatoes, as well as samples
of rare dates and almonds. Other U.S. seed libraries hold Egyptian
onions, Turkish legumes and unusual spices, like black cumin.
</P>
<P>
   Although the material is free for the taking, farmers rarely tap
it. That's because samples are handed out in quantities too small
for farming. Many of the varieties never have been tested
commercially, which also keeps farmers away. And many who farm
organically are simply unfamiliar with the varieties at the
repositories.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the libraries are aimed at research-and-development
scientists, who use the material to breed crops with certain
traits, such as higher yields or pest resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The government is asking the new coalition of farmers to grow
some of the varieties stored in the libraries as long as they keep
records about how the plants perform.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the farmers can market the seeds through a
cooperative, as well as sell the fruits of their labors.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers could see the early results on the plates of local
restaurants. Jim De Quattro of the USDA's Agricultural Research
Service envisions chefs contracting with farmers to grow exclusive
lines of herbs or vegetables based on material found in the
government libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``As organic farming has taken off in the past five years,
people have more choices. And they continue to want more choices
when they go to restaurants,'' he said. ``I could envision a grower
hooking up with a chef to supply a certain type of, say, red
garlic. Let's face it, when you go to a fancy restaurant, you want
something new and different.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Toward a Better Berry &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rominger, deputy secretary for agriculture, was in Davis
last week to tout a promising alternative to methyl bromide, a
chemical fumigant that is being phased out by 2001 because it
damages the earth's ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   The state's strawberry farmers, who rely heavily on methyl
bromide to keep weeds and soil-borne diseases at bay, are eager to
find new ways to keep crops healthy. At stake is an industry
providing about 80 percent of the nation's fresh strawberry crop,
or about 1 billion berries each year.
</P>
<P>
   USDA researchers working test plots in Salinas believe a compost
mixed with plastic mulch, beneficial microorganisms and corn gluten
might offer a solution. The mixture appears to stimulate a plant's
own defenses against pathogens and helps it get more water and
phosphorus. Phosphorus is essential for heathy plant growth.
</P>
<P>
   The California strawberry test is one of several around the
country conducted by scientists scrambling to replace methyl
bromide. Among them: an ultralow oxygen storage system in Texas
that could protect grapefruit from fruit flies and mold, a breed of
bell peppers in South Carolina that might resist root infection and
a natural plant extract being used as a fumigant in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   About 23,000 acres in California are planted in strawberries
every year. The season begins in January in Southern California and
peaks in April and May, when strawberry growers all over the state
harvest. Northern growers continue to harvest berries into
November.

HOPEFUL NEWS ON MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ The sky, it turns out, isn't falling. But this is
a place where not even good news is viewed free of the blinders of
politics, so the fresh fact that Medicare is nothing like the
basket case portrayed is being processed as if it still were.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that much of the politics of the government's vital
entitlement programs continues to be trapped in the vanished
atmosphere of huge budget deficits.On the right, Newt Gingrich's
minions manipulated the chimera of impending doom to push for
privatization via vouchers _ ending Medicare, in effect, in order
to save it. They did it in their attempted revolution of 1995, and
they were back with a vengeance two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Each time they were defeated in their own Congress and by
President Clinton's veto actions and threats.But they're still at
it, and they have allies in the center who continue to push
cost-cutting ideas that originated in the era of $200 billion
deficits, when tough-minded opinion argued that the hemorrhage
could not be stopped unless all programs absorbed a fair share of
the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Time for some new thinking to take account of new realities.
Time to understand that the real problem is less Medicare per se
and more its place among competing national priorities over the
next generation.The occasion is last week's annual report of
Medicare and Social Security's trustees, shaped around the
bipartisanly accepted calculations of its professional actuaries.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, D-Day (as in depletion of the hospital
insurance fund in Medicare was supposed to occur in nine years; to
nearly universal surprise, the report tacked on another seven
years, to 2015, five years into the retirement of the baby boomers.
The report called this ``a substantial improvement.'' Even more
significant, it showed that this improvement was as much a function
of cost-restraining steps taken two years ago and other
improvements in Medicare operations as it was of the flourishing of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the encouraging news is not likely to end with the
latest report. The new D-Day of 2015, for example, is based on a
midrange assumption of annual economic growth over the period
averaging 1.5 percent, far below current trends and historical
experience.Moreover, since the final steps were taken to balance
the federal budget two years ago (which included hefty Medicare
savings from cuts), the long-term deficit for the program as
estimated by its actuaries has been slashed by two-thirds. It's
still there, but, in perspective, the country has resolved far more
difficult problems, beginning with the fiscal red ink of the 1980s
and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the most serious problem the government faces over the
next decade is not the entitlements by themselves, but the task of
balancing them in the face of other priorities. The real problem,
in other words, is the budget itself.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: In the unlikely event the just-passed congressional
budget resolution were actually to take effect, with its $800
billion tax cut and add-ons to military spending, the impact on the
rest of the government would have to be gigantic. Indeed, by a
decade from now, all spending other than the Pentagon, debt
interest, and entitlements would have to be slashed by nearly 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That includes everything from law enforcement and education, to
job-training, health research, air travel safety and child
nutrition. But before our friends on the left yell too loudly, it
needs to be recognized that the implications of Clinton's budget
proposals as fleshed out would only reduce that gutting of the
operating functions of the government by half in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, income-tax cuts are properly seen by most people
as low priority, given the pressures of the next two decades. In
addition, earmarking 15 percent of any surplus over the next decade
to Medicare, on top of the 62 percent for Social Security, will
relieve even more of the fiscal pressure. And reforms should be
targeted and fair, not masks for wholesale slashing that hurts the
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the insurance cost for the highest-income beneficiaries
is prudent and fair; raising the eligibility age is crude. More
choice and more managed care for the healthy elderly is sensible,
but phony choices designed to herd people are only disguised burden
shifts onto backs of the less well-to-do, who already are paying
more out of pocket every year.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to remember that roughly 10 percent of Medicare's
beneficiaries account for nearly three-fourths of its expenditures.
It also helps to remember that Medicare currently doesn't cover
drugs, eyeglasses, and hearing aids, nor does it have caps on what
individuals have to pay out of pocket in situations that are
covered.Reform, in short, must expand and reform the program to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the conventional wisdom is correct that the good actuarial
news takes the steam out of any drive to accomplish reform this
year or next. And maybe that means that Medicare and Social
Security will have to be a major element in next year's pivotal
presidential campaign. Great idea.

 THE WEEKEND COOK: Here a Chickpea, There a Chickpea  
   
   
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  As a child, one of my favorite dishes was pasta
with sauteed onions and chickpeas. I loved the flavors of the sweet
onions and the salty grated cheese together. But the texture of the
chickpea really hooked me _ a creamy, dense ball that collapsed
under a little pressure from teeth and tongue. The flavor of the
chickpea wasn't something that I could describe easily, but it was
something I easily liked.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And I'm not alone. The chickpea is a popular bean in
Mediterranean and Indian cuisines. Its blandness makes it a perfect
match for herbs, spices and numerous other ingredients. Its bulk
makes it a good choice for appetizer, entree or side dish.
</P>
<P>
   The cook easily can open a can of chickpeas. But cooking dried
chickpeas yields a more interestingly textured bean and a cooking
liquid that has all sorts of good uses, especially when you cook
the chickpeas on the weekend and use them throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; MASTER RECIPE: VERSATILE CHICKPEA STEW &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds dried chickpeas (about 5 cups)

   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the chickpeas in a large bowl and pour in warm water to
cover by 4 inches. Soak for 24 hours; drain.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the chickpeas to a large soup pot; pour in water to
cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil; boil for 10 minutes, skimming
from time to time. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Return the chickpeas to the pot and add 18 cups cold water.
Bring to a boil over high heat. Bundle together the thyme, bay
leaves and rosemary; tie with kitchen string. Add this bouquet
garni and the garlic to the pot. Reduce heat and simmer for 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the carrots, celery, onions and salt pork; simmer for 30
minutes. Add the salt and simmer until the chickpeas are very
tender and the liquid is cloudy and slightly thickened, about 2
hours total cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes before the chickpeas are done, remove the salt
pork. Finely chop and reserve all the meat. Finely dice a small
piece of the fat and add to the meat. Discard remaining fat.
</P>
<P>
   When the chickpeas are cooked, discard the bouquet garni.
Transfer about 7 cups of the chickpeas and vegetables and about 5
cups of the liquid to a heated soup tureen. Stir in the reserved
meat and the parsley.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; st  &LR;   &UR; To serve:  &LR; Place a slice of garlic toast in each serving
bowl, then ladle in the stew. Dust with pepper; serve with the
grated cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the remaining chickpeas and vegetables, reserving the
cooking liquid. Cool chickpeas and liquid to room temperature, then
store in separate covered containers in the refrigerator. Will keep
for up to 5 days.

 BAY AREA CLASSICS: Marin French Specialty Cheese Ripe for 
 Choosing  
   
   
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; PETALUMA, Calif. _ &LR;  The French have a saying that a baker needs to
get a hand into the dough.
<P>
   At the Marin French Cheese Co., that old saw could be altered to
``you have to get a hand into the curds.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how scientifically precise a machine might be, owners
Jim and Chris Boyce say, there is nothing like the hand of an
experienced cheese maker to determine when milk curds are exactly
the right consistency for making soft-ripened cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   And there is nothing as individualistic as a hand-shaped,
hand-wrapped cheese. It is to mass-produced cheese what a baguette
is to a loaf of sliced bread in a plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Brie, which many companies produce, the Boyces claim
they are the only producers in North America to make Camembert,
schloss and breakfast cheese (a slightly firmer, milder cousin of
Camembert that's sliced rather than spread), all European
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   The cheeses are marketed under the Rouge et Noir label and have
been produced on the same site in Marin since 1865 (some sources
claim 1854) from milk provided by herds grazing in the surrounding
rolling pastures.
</P>
<P>
   The cows cannot claim quite as long a pedigree. In the 1930s,
disease nearly wiped out the main dairy herd, leaving just 27 head
of cattle. So a herd of Jersey cows was purchased in Oregon,
shipped by rail to Novato and driven over country roads to their
new home. Their descendants grazing at Dolcini farm, just down the
road from the cheese factory, provide Rouge et Noir with milk for
cheese. The cheese makers prefer these Jerseys, with milk at 4.5
percent butterfat, to Holsteins, with milk at 4.3 percent fat. The
more milk fat, the richer the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Until a year ago, members of the Thompson family, pioneers who
started Rouge et Noir on a Spanish land grant, continued to operate
the cheese factory. When the last in the line, Bob Thompson,
decided to go on to other pursuits, the Boyces, who operate cattle
and feed ranches in Eastern California and Nevada, took over.
</P>
<P>
   The cheese factory, unlike most of the Boyces' enterprises, is
not certified organic. But since the Dolcinis never joined the
stampede to give their cows hormones and other chemicals, and since
the cheese factory relies on purified local rainwater exclusively,
the cheeses certainly are natural.
</P>
<P>
   The Boyces, whose association with Rouge et Noir goes back six
years, have some plans for expansion, but things basically will
stay as they have been for generations: The picnic area by the
bucolic duck pond will stay open to the public, and free guided
tours will continue. The tasting/sales room, which long has offered
a limited selection of salads, sandwiches, crackers and wine, is
being expanded into a full-service deli showcasing other local
foods.
</P>
<P>
   The Boyces also hope to expand distribution beyond the West
Coast, which would raise production from the current average of
2,000 pounds a day. Quark, a European soft fresh cheese, is being
added to the lineup in small quantities, and premium ricotta will
follow.
</P>
<P>
   These will be the biggest innovations since the introduction
five years ago of flavored Bries (garlic, jalapeno, peppercorn,
tomato basil and pesto), which won a quick following.
</P>
<P>
   The Boyces don't know if their son, Max, 22, an agricultural
economics major at the University of California, Davis, will take
over Rouge et Noir, even though he sometimes makes cheese on the
weekends. But they have a feeling of mission about their business:
The cheese factory will thrive as long as the local dairies
prosper, which in turn will guarantee the agricultural future of
the land. It is, says Jim Boyce, ``a symbiotic relationship.''

BIOGRAPHY SHARES THE PLEASURE OF GIDE'S COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ANDRE GIDE 
A Life in the Present 
By Alan Sheridan 
Harvard University Press, 709 pp., illustrated, $35 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when every undergraduate room came equipped
with a copy of Andre Gide's ``The Counterfeiters.'' An English
translation of the novel remains in print, but only one bookstore
in Harvard Square currently carries it. Of Gide's vast output, only
``The Immoralist'' is still widely available in English
translation.
</P>
<P>
   In France, of course, Gide remains a towering figure. Even
people who are not part of literary culture admire Gide as part of
their national glory. Partly this is because some of his work has
been translated into the popular media; also, his refusal to submit
to convention or authority in any sphere, most especially those of
morality and religion, makes him perennially attractive to young
readers. (For a time, it earned his complete works an honorable
place on the Vatican's Index of books it was a mortal sin to read.)
</P>
<P>
   Gide's life was one of his great achievements; it was unusual
and particular, but through everything, he stood for something _ a
great many things actually, so he became a worldwide symbol even to
people who never read a wrote he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   When Gide died, in 1951, at 81, he had lived through two world
wars and countless social upheavals, political crises, and literary
controversies. He owned settled residences but could never really
be said to ``live'' anywhere. He traveled constantly throughout
Europe, to North Africa and the Congo, and to the Soviet Union,
where he eulogized Gorky in Moscow with Stalin standing on the
platform; for a time he was the most popular European writer in the
Soviet state, until he wrote a book critical of the USSR. He knew
virtually everyone of interest in the Europe of his time, and his
lifelong friends were a luminous group _ and so were his enemies,
some of whom were former friends like Paul Claudel. (One of
Claudel's grandsons brought a copy of the published Claudel-Gide
correspondence for Gide to autograph. Claudel has already signed
it, ``With my regret at being found in such bad company.'' Gide's
response was to write ``Ditto.''). Still, Gide the man, as opposed
to Gide the writer, seems to have gotten along with nearly everyone
_ except for Jean Cocteau, whose poses distorted in the clear
mirror of Gide's intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   For Gide, sex and love were separate categories. Gide loved his
wife, his cousin Madeleine, with a pure and spiritual love, but
they had no sexual relations. It was Oscar Wilde, no less, who
confirmed Gide's homosexual identity; Gide's successful pursuit of
sexual adventure among younger men was lifelong. He wrote more
openly of his own sexual identity than any writer since the
Renaissance, and his Socratic dialogue about homosexuality,
``Corydon,'' became an underground classic, passed from hand to
hand, but kept under lock and key in many libraries. The love of
his life was Marc Allegret, whom he had known since childhood
(Allegret was the son of a family friend); Allegret became one of
France's most important film directors, and despite his own basic
heterosexuality, remained close to Gide throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   Other women loved Gide with a passion born of frustration; the
saddest and most ridiculous of them was Dorothy Bussy, the sister
of Lytton Strachey (who therefore should have known better); Bussy
became Gide's principal English translator. His closest female
friend was probably the ``Petite Dame,'' Maria van Rysselberghe,
the wife of the painter Theo Rysselberghe. Later Gide responded to
a request from the Petite Dame's free-spirited daughter and
fathered a daughter of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of this Gide wrote serious books and jeux d'esprit;
he wrote plays, libretti (Stravinsky's ``Persephone''),
translations, and theatrical adaptations (``Hamlet,'' ``Antony and
Cleopatra,'' and Kafka's ``The Trial''); he wrote travel books and
books of social and political advocacy. Everything he wrote was
marked by lucidity, honesty, and a refusal to oversimplify anything
complex or to accept any received truth. He was a founder of the
influential Nouvelle Revue Francaise and played a role in the
development of one of the world's great publishers, Gallimard.
Nearly everything that happened to him or that he thought of went
into a journal he kept most of his life and that stands as one of
the major achievements of 20th-century literature. His vast
correspondence fills many volumes. He was a mentor to many, an
exemplar to more _ a major figure in the memoirs and journals of
his contemporaries; some votaries wrote down everything the master
said in their presence.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it was left to an Englishman, Alan Sheridan, to
write the first full-scale life of Gide. Sheridan has the
credentials for the job _ the mastery of two languages; the grasp
of political and cultural as well as literary history; the
patience; the sympathy; the sheer industry. He has assimilated all
this material and handles it with easy familiarity, taste, and wit.
Sometimes he runs on for pages that catalogue places visited and
people met without much comment or commentary, but he writes with
insight about the life, the works, and their interconnections, and
he can suddenly cut straight to the marrow. Writing of Gide's
self-delusion about the ``limitless purity'' of his marriage,
Sheridan observes, ``This is not an intelligent man of 1998
speaking, but it doesn't sound like an intelligent man of 1919
either.'' Sheridan has no ax to grind, no theory to impose; he
allows us to share the pleasure he takes in Gide's company.

 THE WEEKEND COOK: Here a Chickpea, There a Chickpea  
   
   
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  As a child, one of my favorite dishes was pasta
with sauteed onions and chickpeas. I loved the flavors of the sweet
onions and the salty grated cheese together. But the texture of the
chickpea really hooked me _ a creamy, dense ball that collapsed
under a little pressure from teeth and tongue. The flavor of the
chickpea wasn't something that I could describe easily, but it was
something I easily liked.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And I'm not alone. The chickpea is a popular bean in
Mediterranean and Indian cuisines. Its blandness makes it a perfect
match for herbs, spices and numerous other ingredients. Its bulk
makes it a good choice for appetizer, entree or side dish.
</P>
<P>
   The cook easily can open a can of chickpeas. But cooking dried
chickpeas yields a more interestingly textured bean and a cooking
liquid that has all sorts of good uses, especially when you cook
the chickpeas on the weekend and use them throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MASTER RECIPE: VERSATILE CHICKPEA STEW &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>

   Fifteen minutes before the chickpeas are done, remove the salt
pork. Finely chop and reserve all the meat. Finely dice a small
piece of the fat and add to the meat. Discard remaining fat.
</P>
<P>
   When the chickpeas are cooked, discard the bouquet garni.
Transfer about 7 cups of the chickpeas and vegetables and about 5
cups of the liquid to a heated soup tureen. Stir in the reserved

 THE WEEKEND COOK: Here a Chickpea, There a Chickpea

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ A story outgoing Harvard College dean of
students Archie C. Epps III relishes telling:
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened, oh, maybe 20 years ago,'' Epps begins, sitting
in his ground-floor University Hall office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A senior tutor called a professor and said he was sending
along a student of his who was having trouble academically,'' he
says. ``The professor told the tutor to have the student wait
outside his office. When he opened the door, there were two
students sitting there. One black, one white. He beckoned the black
student in, and of course he had picked the wrong one.''
</P>
<P>
   Epps, dapper as always in his customary pinstriped suit and
jaunty bowtie, pauses to take a sip of tea. The afternoon sunlight
pours into his office, warm and comforting as an old tweed coat. If
these walls could talk, they would probably break into a chorus of
``Fair Harvard, we join in thy jubilee throng.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, that's what the professor expected to find. A
black student having difficulty,'' continues Epps, who is stepping
down this spring after 29 years in the dean's chair, closing a
remarkable chapter in Harvard history. During the period under
discussion, Epps was upbraiding his own admissions office for
letting in too many unqualified black students _ a position that
cost Epps, Harvard's first African-American administrator, dearly
in campus popularity polls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Epps was appointed to the post in 1970. Without seeking to be
initially, he was often cast as the college's point man on racial
issues, particularly during the tumultuous decade from 1969-79. By
1980, when Epps began to play a more organized role in articulating
racial policy, the college had reversed course and adopted a more
selective approach to minority admissions. One of Epps's arguments
to the admissions office then was that his office was forced to
deal with the failed experiments, the misguided gestures toward
inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard was promising these students an experience it could
not deliver,'' Epps reflects. ``And it had certain expectations of
these students that they could not deliver, either.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Epps says, he began speaking out against
racial separatism on campus. He opposed the creation of a third
world center when other elite universities like Yale and Stanford
embraced the idea, unapologetically calling himself an
``old-fashioned integrationist.'' Militant students accused Epps of
being an arch-conservative masquerading as a brother, or worse.
Epps, who could have gone elsewhere (job offers were not a problem
for a young black Harvard dean with strong academic credentials),
chose to stay. Perhaps no official in Crimson history has taken
such abuse while deriving such personal joy from his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question to be asked now is, what good did I do?'' resumes
Epps, virtually interviewing himself now. ``Because you either
climb the ladder and pull it up after you, so no one else can
follow. Or you put it down so others can climb up too.''
</P>
<P>
   Epps folds his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he says, ``people here have trouble with that. Peter
Gomes'' _ minister of Harvard's Memorial Church _ ``was once asked
if I was being used by the Harvard administration. And Peter said,
`Maybe it was a double game. Maybe Harvard was using Archie, and
maybe Archie was using Harvard.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Epps leans forward, quivering with laughter. ``My response is,
maybe I am Harvard in some sense. Maybe it was my game all along!''
</P>
<P>
   His eyes dance with merriment. The tea table totters. On the
subject of his own legacy, at least, Epps seems determined to have
the first laugh as well as the last.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime allies of his say that is how it should be, too. That
the Epps hustled out of University Hall by student protesters in
1969, and flogged by black students for being too apolitical in the
1970s, deserves to be recognized as one of modern Harvard's great
humanizing forces.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Archie presents an incongruous figure,'' says government
professor Martin Kilson, Harvard's first tenured black faculty
member, who is also retiring this spring. ``He brought Malcolm X to
Harvard in the 1960s, yet in many ways he typifies the
old-fashioned black college administrator with his gentlemanly
ways. With Archie, what you see is not always what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Kilson, Gomes contends that Epps has often been
underestimated, if not unappreciated. Do not mistake his innate
courtliness for lack of conviction, Epps's friends say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fashionable to say he's suffered'' from the
personal attacks, says Gomes. ``But I don't think he has. Annoyed,
maybe. But Archie possesses an inner ballast that is absolutely
unshakable.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gomes's view, Epps's devotion to Harvard is not some
byproduct of his ``playing the company man'' but of something
deeper in Epps, who when he got to Harvard 40 years ago thought
seriously about becoming a preacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archie held onto his own core values when others in this
community did not,'' says Gomes. ``And ironically, he's among the
few to enjoy vindication in his own lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Prior to its 25th reunion in 1994, the class of
1969 sent a delegation to make peace with campus officials who
still bore the scars of the '69 strike. Calling upon Epps, one of
the few holdovers from that era, the group proposed it was time to
forgive and forget. According to Gomes, Epps drew himself up and
said, ``Gentlemen, while it is quite likely we can all forgive, I
shall never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   The story delights Gomes no end. ``Archie came here from afar
and bought the Harvard myth lock, stock, and barrel,'' he says.
``That's the great irony of Archie. At Harvard he's out-Yankeed the
Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time and infirmity have taken their toll on the 62-year-old
Epps. In 1995 he underwent double-bypass heart surgery. A few
months later he received a kidney transplant, both procedures the
result of his struggle with diabetes. The kidney was donated by his
wife, Valerie, a professor at Suffolk Law School. Anyone who knows
Epps will be unsurprised to learn that each operation has generated
a minimum of one punch line.
</P>
<P>
   His retirement in July is to ``protect my bride's investment in
me,'' quips Epps whenever the subject comes up. Discussing his
heart surgery, Epps says he looked up from the operating table and
recognized a former student of his.
</P>
<P>
   `` `I was in your office a lot,' the student said,'' Epps
deadpans. ``And I said, `Let's not talk about that now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Epps, who has two sons, both Harvard men (Josiah, '98, and
Caleb, a freshman this year), is not really retiring, either,
although health problems have forced him to relinquish his
day-to-day duties.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, Epps will assume a part-time position as college
ombudsman, mediator, senior class adviser, and mentor to younger
administrators. He will also teach a freshman seminar on race and
diversity he helped design and pursue other pet projects as his
health permits. Among these are a new student activity center (a
campaign he claims to be losing), redrafting Harvard's policy on
sexual violence (an issue that rocked the campus earlier this
year), and making sure that conservative speakers feel as welcome
on campus as liberals do (contrary to Harvard's repution beyond zip
code 02138).
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Epps era is inarguably reaching its denouement. Later
this month a banquet, church service, and concert in Harvard Yard
will be held in Epps's honor. The Harvard Crimson broke news of his
retirement last fall in headlines suitable for a papal visit.
``While many undergraduates couldn't pick Harvard's top
administrators out of a lineup,'' the paper eulogized, Epps ``cuts
a recognizable figure'' as both a ``sympathetic ear . . . and an
authority figure'' to thousands of Harvard students, present and
past.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent Crimson managing editor Georgia Alexakis covered
Epps's office for three semesters. Being recognizable and
accessible ``doesn't sound like such a great accomplishment,'' says
Alexakis, ``but in the context of the Harvard administration, it's
significant. He's also been the point person on issues like housing
randomization and race relations, things that don't rate high on
the university's agenda. I think most students respect him for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Epps summed up his own accomplishments in a Thanksgiving letter
to the community. Highlights: having presided over a threefold
growth in undergraduate organizations; helping establish the
Harvard Mediation Service, which assists in racial conflict
resolution; and participating in Harvard's often heated (but seldom
dull) conversation about race and diversity. Epps closed with a
quote from Emerson about the ``long winding train'' of men and
women who have ably served Harvard over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The quote was apt, not only because Epps is part of that
tradition but because Emerson's (Class of 1820) Harvard was
probably more like the one Epps first encountered than today's
version. When Epps arrived at the divinity school, in 1958, the
college had only 30 black students _ and no black faculty members.
Radcliffe and Harvard were separate entities, and the era of sex,
drugs, and radical politics was safely in the distance. The
Afro-American Studies department, today one of Harvard's academic
crown jewels under the leadership of Henry Louis Gates Jr., was 10
years away from conception.
</P>
<P>
   The college presents a vastly different face in 1999, with a
student body that is 34 percent minority and strongly (6 percent)
international in flavor. Minority representation on the faculty and
administrative staffs hovers near 20 percent. Could Harvard choose
its first African-American president sometime in the next century?
``Oh absolutely, that's within reach now,'' says Epps.

<P>
   One recent survey found that 80 percent of Harvard's 6,500
undergraduate students have mixed-race friendships, 60 percent live
in multiethnic dorm groupings. (A 1997 survey sponsored by the
Crimson painted a less rosy portrait of race relations on campus,
although Epps contends that the tone and wording of the
questionnaire had much to do with that.) College housing recently
went to a random assignment system, further breaking down ethnic
barricades. Multiculturalism is also reflected in the more than 70
ethnic and cultural organizations on campus, from the Armenian Club
to Latinas Unidas.
</P>
<P>
   Brandeis University historians Morton and Phyllis Keller are
writing a history of Harvard from the 1930s to the present, the
theme of which is the university's evolution from Brahmin preserve
to an international, meritocratic institution. Phyllis Keller calls
the race issue central to this evolution and credits Epps with
helping lead what has (mostly) been a quiet revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some students did not think Archie was going fast enough or
far enough,'' says Keller. ``He was not an appeaser. But Archie was
on the line with the students, day in and day out. And in the end,
the consensus he helped shape did prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Morton Keller, ``To me it's interesting that the first
black Harvard administrator was Old Harvard in style, from the teas
to the Glee Club. At Harvard, that can be very useful.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Epps did not set out to be a pioneer, to be sure, much less the
Jackie Robinson of Harvard Yard.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Lake Charles, La., a mixed-race town of 70,000, Epps
and his twin brother, now a track coach at Jackson State
University, attended Catholic school. Their father, a former
football star, owned a local dry cleaning company and provided his
family with a comfortable, middle-class existence.
</P>
<P>
   Matriculating to Talladega College, Epps majored in philosophy
and psychology and was steered toward Harvard or Yale, neither of
which he could locate on a map.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not very sophisticated about race or much else,'' he
recalls. ``In the late '50s, the battle lines were just being drawn
anyway. I was frightened out of my mind when I got to Harvard, but
I made friends easily. I stayed here one summer to enter an essay
contest, and I remember sitting in Widener Library one afternoon
thinking, Oh, this is my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As the civil rights movement gathered steam _ Epps led a group
down to Washington for the historic march of 1963 _ so did Epps's
Harvard career. He was appointed senior tutor in Leverett House and
assistant Glee Club conductor, an outgrowth of his love of choral
music. Long interested intellectually in Islam, he taught a seminar
on the civil rights and black nationalist movements. Malcolm X,
James Baldwin, and Ralph Ellison were among the speakers whom Epps
brought to campus. Epps and Kilson became advisers to the fledgling
Association of African and Afro-American Students. In 1963, dean
John Monro recruited Epps as assistant dean after Epps had been
rejected for another administrative position.
</P>
<P>
   Was he marginalized in the early going?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had enough authority to get them in here to see me if I
needed to,'' Epps says. ``Also, if you talk to a faculty member
who's had too much to drink and said something he shouldn't have,
you can see him the next day and ask, `Do you know what you said to
me last night? We should talk about it.' I've turned many people
around simply by my length of service here.''
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of Epps's career ended with the retirement of
Harvard president Nathan Pusey, who drew fire from many quarters
for ordering state troopers in to break up the occupation of
University Hall. Pusey was succeeded in 1971 by Harvard law school
dean Derek Bok. From then on, says Epps, his mission was to help
restore order _ not at the cost of free speech but in celebration
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internally there was a great struggle over how Harvard should
be governed,'' says Epps. With Bok's presidency came an expansion
of the Harvard bureaucracy, growing from one vice-president to
seven. Epps and others labored to keep the college competitive
among all the other constituencies clamoring for the university's
attention _ and resources. In 1980, Epps published a study
concluding that minority students were ``separatist in
orientation'' and ``isolated from the mainstream.'' Bok responded
with a pronunciamento endorsing a new foundation committed to
diversity and a recommitment to affirmative action. Among Epps's
closest allies was Kilson, proof that institutional politics indeed
makes strange bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty and I are totally different personalities,'' Epps
concedes. ``He's an eccentric and a socialist. I'm a conservative
Democrat. Yet on questions of race we agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilson remarks that there are two types of administrators.
``Those who operate from personal vision,'' he says, ``and those
who operate like weathervanes. Archie always concerned himself with
the college's relative place in the larger university. And he was
doing that when he was a relative nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, says Gomes, a student committed suicide over
Christmas break. At the time, Harvard was trimming energy bills by
shutting off heat in the dorms when they were allegedly vacant. Bok
and other officials were badly shaken by the suicide, says Gomes.
With Bok's blessing, Epps drew up a plan to ensure that every
student on campus over the holidays got invited to parties at,
among other venues, Epps's home. Even black students who scorned
Epps publicly ``came to Archie under cover of night,'' says Gomes,
``wondering, `How does this man cope in an environment that's
killing me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Epps was interviewed for job of the dean of the college
but failed to get it. Some minority students raised the race issue,
which Epps characteristically preferred to sidestep. ``I was
disappointed,'' he admits, ``but I didn't encourge the protests
because that's not my style.'' Was race a factor? ``No,'' says
Epps. ``Knowing Henry Rosovsky'' _ dean of the faculty, who made
the decision _ ``I don't believe it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Epps was also thrust, not always civilly, into other
controversies in the '80s and early '90s. One was the debate on
whether Harvard should divest from companies doing business in
South Africa. Another concerned the college's final clubs _
Harvard's equivalent of nonresidential fraternities _ which had
held the line at admitting women and where alcohol abuse was a
vexing issue to Harvard authorities. Concerned about their
exclusionary policies, Epps led a movement to sever ties between
the college and the clubs. The divorce became final 15 years ago.
Epps has seldom met an undergraduate organization he did not like,
but in this case he made an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was against their discriminating by gender, but I was also
tired of waiting by the phone for a call that another student had
been hospitalized because of drinking,'' Epps explains. At the same
time, he stepped up pressure on local law enforcement officials to
exercise more caution about randomly stopping young people of color
near the Harvard campus. Harassment of minority students was a
focal point for student protests early in the '90s. If the police
mistakenly detain a minority student today, says Epps, ``they know
the next phone call is coming from my office, requesting an
explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Epps's authority over racial issues was broadened. He
published Harvard's first handbook on race relations, a resource
that is updated annually. Tensions also flared that year when
Leonard Jeffries was invited to speak at Harvard. Jeffries, a New
York professor known for his inflammatory views on Jewish
complicity in the African slave trade, ignited a fresh debate about
race and free speech on campus. The conservative Epps again found
himself in the middle of it. In the media and elsewhere, questions
were raised about Epps's contribution to racial progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Harvard hired Epps for this job was to keep the
students in check,'' charged Zaheer Ali, president of the Black
Students Union. Ali, who graduated in 1994, told the Crimson last
fall that his view of Epps had softened over time. As dean, said
Ali, Epps had a right to question the group's invitation to
Jeffries. ``But as Archie Epps,'' Ali added, ``he understood.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neil Rudenstine's presidency and the revitalization of
Afro-American Studies have helped put the finishing touches on what
Epps hoped to realize 30 years ago. While Epps played no direct
role in recruiting Gates, he kept the pressure on key figures like
Bok and Rosovsky to rescue the floundering department. Rudenstine
finished what Bok began by getting Gates here, followed by Cornel
West, William Julius Wilson, and others. Af-Am Studies is now among
Harvard's hottest academic departments.
</P>
<P>
   About Epps, Rudenstine says, ``His longtime devotion to the
college and its students has left an indelible imprint on Harvard,
and for me he has been a continuing source of friendship, helpful
advice, and judgment born of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Epps, ``In my life as a black man at Harvard, it has always
been the people at the top who made the difference. Every black
person at Harvard who has worked in a senior position has his or
her scars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us won't tell'' how those scars were inflicted, he
adds with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   And conceivably Epps never will. A few days ago, however, he was
meeting in the basement of University Hall with a group of young
administrators. Epps was there to reminisce about his career with a
group that as much as any symbolizes the new face of Harvard.
Everyone at the table but Epps was a woman of color. Most were not
even out of grade school when he was heaved out of the same
building by angry student protesters. The sum total of their
institutional memory could have fit in Epps's boutonniere. And that
is no slight to them.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Epps for an hour, some of the women raised
their hands and said that the Harvard they knew was not always as
accommodating as the one Epps had been describing. Specifically,
they told Epps, if you talked differently, dressed differently,
spoke up too loudly, or wore your hair in some
less-than-fashionable fashion, Harvard could be a fairly
unforgiving place.
</P>
<P>
   Epps listened patiently for several minutes. Finally he said
that while anyone had a right to speak out on these matters, he
preferred to take the long view and change the system from within.
Rising to leave, Epps mentioned that one of his retirement projects
will be a memoir of his Harvard years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my colleagues it will be based on the secret diaries
I've been keeping all these years,'' he said, laughing. ``And when
I mention that, their faces go white.''

   April has just begun and already a top horse is pointing for the
May 29 running of the Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs.
According to trainer H. James Bond, Behrens, who captured the
$750,000 Oaklawn Handicap with ease Saturday, is headed straight to
the $600,000 MassCap.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-year-old son of Pleasant Colony, Behrens added his Oaklawn
victory to a tally in the Gulfstream Park Handicap, and runner-up
finishes in both the Donn Handicap (behind Puerto Madero) and
Broward Handicap (behind Sir Bear), all run at Gulfstream, to stand
4-2-2-0 on the year. The $450,000 purse he captured at Oaklawn
raised his earnings to $775,000 for 1999 $1.7 million overall, with
a career record of 14-6-3-1. In the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association poll, taken before the Oaklawn Handicap, Berhens was
rated the fifth-best thoroughbred in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens took the Oaklawn Handicap by 2 1/2 lengths under regular
rider Jorge Chavez in the quick time of 1:47 3/5 over a sloppy
track, returning $5 to win as the 3-2 choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, `Don't get in any trouble,' '' said Chavez.
``The horse did everything. I never rode him on a sloppy track, and
I didn't know how he was going to handle it. But it was
sloppy-fast, and he just kind of skipped over it.''
</P>
<P>
   A top 3-year-old in '97, when he was beaten just a nose (by
Deputy Commander) in the Travers at Saratoga, and then won the
Pegasus at Meadowlands, Behrens went on to have a rough 1998
campaign. He went to Dubai for the World Cup in March, finished
fifth behind Silver Charm, and came back exhausted. He ran only
once more that season, finishing ninth in the Brooklyn at Belmont
in June, and finishing the year a dismal 4-0-0-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This colt was outstanding as a 3-year-old,'' said Bond.
``After he finished seventh in the Breeders' Cup Classic, everybody
kind of wrote him off, and 1998 was a disaster after Dubai. Now, he
has come back, and we have something to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming good health, the next building block will be the
MassCap. Bond is friendly with Suffolk vice president Lou Raffetto.
They keep in regular contact, and Bond, who is based in New York,
enjoyed the hospitality here when his Will's Way ran third behind
Skip Away and Formal Gold, respectively, in the 1997 MassCap. With
22 points, Behrens is the leader in the NTRA handicap series, which
concludes with the Pacific Classic in August and offers rich
bonuses; the MassCap has 6 points to contribute to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens was favored in the Gulfstream Park Handicap, as well as
at Oaklawn, and unless a real heavy hitter, such as Free House or
Silver Charm, shows up, Behrens will be favored in the MassCap.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A big weekend
</P>
<P>
   It's been a roller coaster ride for trainer Bob Baffert, but the
Silver Fox is back in the lead on the road to the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing to note on what was a sensational
weekend for Team Baffert is that he has not ruled out running
outstanding filly Silverbulletday in the Derby. Silverbulletday has
won 9 of 10 career starts and $1.75 million. She has consistently
earned higher speed figures than the 3-year-old males, and she
might well be favored in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   After Silverbulletday took Saturday's $500,000 Ashland Stakes at
Keeneland by 7 lengths in another impressive performance against
fellow fillies, Baffert said, ``If we went with a filly in the
Derby, it would be Silverbulletday.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert has committed his other top filly, Excellent Meeting,
who tallied in the $250,000 Fantasy Stakes at Oaklawn Friday and
now has a career mark of 11-7-3-1 and $1.1 million in earnings, to
the Kentucky Oaks April 30. He doesn't need to run both fillies to
win the Oaks. If Silverbulletday races in the Derby, it will give
high-profile Mike Pegram a chance to become the fist owner to win
the Derby back-to-back since Penny Tweedy's Meadow Stable did it
with Riva Ridge and Secretariat in 1972-73.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were Baffert's outstanding fillies victorious over the
weekend, but his colts, General Challenge and Prime Timber, ran
1-2, respectively, in the $1 million Santa Anita Derby Saturday.
Baffert's fillies never failed him, but at one point, he had lost
his top 3-year-old colt, Exploit, to injury, Finder's Gold and
Straight Man had flopped, and General Challenge (in the Louisiana
Derby) and Prime Timber (in the San Rafael) had been beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Now, everything's coming up roses for Baffert, especially if he
starts Silverbulletday in America's greatest race.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quick turnaround?
</P>
<P>
   Desert Hero, who had won both of his starts, including the San
Rafael, was mildly disappointing in the Santa Anita Derby,
finishing third, beaten a total of 7 lengths, behind the Baffert
duo. In what would be an intriguing move, trainer Richard Mandella
may run Desert Hero in the Derby Trial at Churchill, a 1-mile prep
race April 24. Because he has run only three times in his career,
Desert Hero might be fresh enough to run in the Trial and the Derby
one week later, which would be very unusual for a serious
contender. If not, he could run in the Trial and go to the
Preakness at Pimlico May 15. ``We have no plan right now,'' said
Mandella. ``Anything's possible. We'll watch him for a week and
see. The Derby Trial is a possibility.'' . . . If you're looking
for a long shot in Saturday's Blue Grass at Keeneland, you could
take a shot with Lemon Drop Kid. A promising 2-year-old, Lemon Drop
Kid has run only once this year, winning an allowance at Gulfstream
Feb. 27. However, his trainer is very high on him. ``He really
loves this racetrack,'' said veteran conditioner Scotty Schulhofer
after Lemon Drop Kid zipped 5 furlongs Saturday in :58 3/5, out 6
furlongs in a rapid 1:10 3/5. ``He did it so easily. We didn't ask
him, he did it all on his own. He's as good as I can get him right
now. He's feeling awfully good. I'll tell you the truth. I think
this colt is as good as any horse I've ever had. Maybe he hasn't
won the big races or proven it yet, but I really think he is the
best. He is so professional. He eats and he sleeps and he runs.'' .
. . Suffolk will award a patron a trip for two to the Kentucky
Derby if he or she can win the ``Derby Prep Pick Three'' contest
Saturday. A fan must pick the winners of the Blue Grass, Wood
Memorial at Aqueduct, and Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn that day. If
more than one person picks all three, a drawing will determine who
gets the trip. You must be present to win.

   In 1991, a U.S. grand jury indicted two Libyans _ Lamin Khalifa
Fhimah, ex-manager of the Libyan Arab Airlines office in Malta, and
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, a high-level intelligence official _
for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
A British court did the same.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed its own sanctions,
including a flight ban that effectively closed Libya's airports.
Tripoli, in response, proposed trying the two suspects in a neutral
country, but Washington and London would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last August, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
announced that she would ``call the Libyan government's bluff'' and
offered a trial by a Scottish court seated in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   When I decided on a journey to Libya late last year, I went to
the State Department for a briefing. Officials there acknowledged
that they knew little about what was going on in Libya. Two years
before Lockerbie, in 1986, President Reagan broke off relations
with Libya and imposed economic sanctions in response to a series
of terrorist incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the officials said, Libya had committed
no terrorist acts. Unlike Iraq, it posed no strategic threat. But
because of Lockerbie, the United States still shunned Gadhafi and
kept Libya on its list of terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
   An intimate of Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, ever since
their student days at military college, Youssef Debri had contacted
me some weeks before to propose that I visit Libya. Cut off from
the world by the U.N. embargo over Lockerbie, Libya, he said, had
grown weary of its isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the embargo's terms, it could sell oil _ its only export _
to European customers, so it had money for food and medicines. But
the other barriers to trade and transportation were wearing it
down. Few businessmen and almost no journalists came to call.
</P>
<P>
   Debri's message was that Libya, anxious for a new start, wanted
to put Lockerbie behind it. In Libya, he assured me, I would be
free to go where I liked and to see whomever I wanted, including
Gadhafi himself.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I rode with Youssef Debri for half an hour across the Libyan
desert, and were met by a police escort, which led us to an almost
indiscernible dirt track that ran off the paved road. A bumpy mile
or so later, we reached the gate of a chainlink fence, where three
or four limousines sat.
</P>
<P>
   Parking our car among them, we piled into a Land Rover, which
bucked us over rock and sand a half-hour deeper into the desert.
Finally, we reached an encampment of large tents and modern
trailers near which grazed a herd of some 200 camels. No armed
guards seemed to be anywhere in view. native robes, I was offered
tea.
</P>
<P>
   Youssef escorted me to Gadhafi's tent, pitched nearby, and left
me there. Save for a few simple chairs and a table, the tent was
bare. Its camel-skin roof and sides were weathered; the rugs
covering the sand floor were ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi sat alone, except for an interpreter. He wore a thin,
tattered Bedouin robe, embroidered at the edges, over a
much-laundered print sport shirt and khaki pants. His furrowed face
was clean-shaven, his eyes covered by dark glasses. A beige turban
half-concealed his bushy hair.
</P>
<P>
   I began the interview by asking whether the view that Libya had
embarked on a new course was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi did not turn to me to answer. Through the open flaps of
the tent, he fixed his eyes on the horizon. His lips seemed barely
to move. He spoke in a controlled monotone, though from time to
time emotion quickened its pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' he said, ``unfortunately treats us as if the world
was the way it used to be. Americans accept that changes have taken
place since the end of communism, but not in their treatment of
Libya. So in the end, they take a racist and fanatical position,
similar to the way Hitler treated the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that America is much like Hitler. We have no
explanation for this, except that it is a religious, fanatical,
racist position. Some analysts call this a new colonialism. But
colonialism is colonialism, and it is always unjust. It is how we
were treated by the Italians, Algeria by the French, India by the
British. This is imperialism, and we seem to be entering a new
imperialist era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause of our conflict with America is not that we attacked
them. We have never attacked an American target. America started
the aggression against us right here in the Gulf of Sirte. When we
defended ourselves, they attacked us in these very tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were bombed by missiles in our own territorial waters. In
1986 our own children were killed. No one can bring my daughter
back to me. Then Lockerbie came along. Now we'd like this chain of
events to be over. But America doesn't want to turn the page. We
shall, however, show courage and be patient, and America will be
the loser.''
</P>
<P>
   The events about which Gadhafi rambled date back to 1981, when
American jets shot down two Libyan planes in a dispute over the
extent of Libya's territorial waters. In January 1986, President
Reagan, responding to terrorist attacks in Rome and Vienna, blocked
commerce with Libya and froze its American assets. A few weeks
later, U.S. Navy planes bombed Sirte and destroyed four patrol
boats in another dispute over territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Reagan, blaming Libya for a bomb that killed two
American soldiers in a Berlin nightclub, attacked Tripoli and
Benghazi, along with suspected terrorist camps in the desert. Among
the 37 civilians reported killed was Gadhafi's adopted infant
daughter, Hana'a. Libyans say the child's death haunts him still.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Gadhafi if Libya was responsible for the many
terrorist incidents of which it was accused in the 1980s, he issued
no denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents that you mention belong to the past,'' he
said. ``Once Abu Amar (Yasir Arafat) was wanted. Now he enters the
White House with all the trappings, the music, the red carpet
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought I detected a note of envy in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Libya is a terrorist country. But now that is
illogical, not reasonable. All these things are of the past, an era
that is over. The bombing of the French plane (a French UTA
airliner bombed over Niger in 1989, at a cost of 171 lives) took
place during a time of war in the region _ Libya, Chad, France. It
was similar to America's downing of the Iranian plane in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis shot down a Libyan aircraft over the Sinai. The
Soviet Union shot down a Korean airplane. It was a time of war. So
how come you forgot all about that and you just mention the charges
against Libya? There is no explanation for that. We go back to the
racist, fanatical complexes of America.''
</P>
<P>
   When I suggested to Gadhafi that the downing of the other
airliners might have been the result of miscommunications, he broke
into derisive laughter. But I persisted, asking whether the UTA and
Lockerbie bombings were not deliberate efforts to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at your logic, the American logic. Those who use missiles
or fighter planes and rockets are legitimate. Those who use
explosives or small bombs are considered terrorists. If we use the
same logic, Osama bin Ladin will use cruise missiles, the same
weapon used by America, and he will not be accused of being a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we were responsible for bringing down the French plane
will be decided by a French court. We don't say anything about it.
The same is true of Lockerbie. I can't answer as to whether Libya
was responsible. Let's let the court decide. Libya has not been
convicted of any terrorist act up to this moment. If they accuse
us, they have to prove their charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Was terrorism, I asked, ever in Libya's national interest?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you ask me that? Why don't you ask why it is in
America's interest to attack us in the Gulf of Sirte, why it is in
America's interest to kill our children? Is it so unusual for Libya
to have a reaction when these things happen? Who is being unfair?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no interest in being hostile to America. We would be
fools to initiate a confrontation with America. But when you face
aggression, you have to defend yourself, no matter how small you
are. We want a reconciliation with America, but America doesn't
want a reconciliation with us. ... I want to find out the truth
about Lockerbie myself. After that, the story will be finished. I
am not so concerned about whether the two Libyans are convicted or
not. What is important is that the problem come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice the number of Libyans have died from the embargo than
were killed at Lockerbie. Whether this one or that is guilty or not
is the business of the lawyers and the courts. What matters is that
once the trial starts, sanctions will be over against Libya. The
embargo will be lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on, pessimistically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, normal relations between our two countries should
be restored. But I am sure that because of America's psychological
complexes and imperialist designs, such normal relations will not
be restored, even if the Lockerbie business is over. America wants
to occupy the Gulf of Sirte and the north of Africa. It wants to
hand over Egypt and Syria to Israel, so that a Greater Israel is
established.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problems with the West generally. Libya has good
relations with Europe. We have European embassies and companies
here. But America is different. We are not enemies of the American
people. Millions of Arabs, millions of Muslims, millions of
Africans are Americans these days. How could we be their enemy?
Only imperialist policies prevent our working together. Libya is a
victim of American terrorism.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later I was cautiously sipping camel milk in the
waiting-tent when Youssef returned. In an urgent tone he reported,
``The Leader wants me to remind you that he was not talking
officially and that he was not stating policy. He asks you to
remember that he is a private person and was speaking from his
heart on what he feels.''

</P>
<P>
   When I suggested to Gadhafi that the downing of the other
airliners might have been the result of miscommunications, he broke
into derisive laughter. But I persisted, asking whether the UTA and
Lockerbie bombings were not deliberate efforts to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at your logic, the American logic. Those who use missiles
or fighter planes and rockets are legitimate. Those who use
explosives or small bombs are considered terrorists. If we use the
same logic, Osama bin Ladin will use cruise missiles, the same
weapon used by America, and he will not be accused of being a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we were responsible for bringing down the French plane
will be decided by a French court. We don't say anything about it.
The same is true of Lockerbie. I can't answer as to whether Libya
was responsible. Let's let the court decide. Libya has not been
convicted of any terrorist act up to this moment. If they accuse
us, they have to prove their charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Was terrorism, I asked, ever in Libya's national interest?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you ask me that? Why don't you ask why it is in
America's interest to attack us in the Gulf of Sirte, why it is in
America's interest to kill our children? Is it so unusual for Libya
to have a reaction when these things happen? Who is being unfair?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no interest in being hostile to America. We would be
fools to initiate a confrontation with America. But when you face
aggression, you have to defend yourself, no matter how small you
are. We want a reconciliation with America, but America doesn't
want a reconciliation with us. ... I want to find out the truth
about Lockerbie myself. After that, the story will be finished. I
am not so concerned about whether the two Libyans are convicted or
not. What is important is that the problem come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice the number of Libyans have died from the embargo than
were killed at Lockerbie. Whether this one or that is guilty or not
is the business of the lawyers and the courts. What matters is that
once the trial starts, sanctions will be over against Libya. The
embargo will be lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on, pessimistically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, normal relations between our two countries should
be restored. But I am sure that because of America's psychological
complexes and imperialist designs, such normal relations will not
be restored, even if the Lockerbie business is over. America wants
to occupy the Gulf of Sirte and the north of Africa. It wants to
hand over Egypt and Syria to Israel, so that a Greater Israel is
established.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problems with the West generally. Libya has good
relations with Europe. We have European embassies and companies
here. But America is different. We are not enemies of the American
people. Millions of Arabs, millions of Muslims, millions of
Africans are Americans these days. How could we be their enemy?
Only imperialist policies prevent our working together. Libya is a
victim of American terrorism.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;

<P>
   A few minutes later I was cautiously sipping camel milk in the
waiting-tent when Youssef returned. In an urgent tone he reported,
``The Leader wants me to remind you that he was not talking
officially and that he was not stating policy. He asks you to
remember that he is a private person and was speaking from his
heart on what he feels.''

FREAKNIK 1999 MAY BE NO-SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the third weekend in April approaches, Atlanta is
waiting to see if Freaknik, a boisterous rite of spring for black
college students, will be gone with the wind.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the event began in 1982 as a
spontaneous gathering of fewer than 100 revelers, eventually
growing into an annual attraction for tens of thousands, there are
signs that the party might not materialize here this year.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Freaknik Web site promises that the 1999 celebration
``will attract over 450,000 visitors to Atlanta Centennial Olympic
Park April 16-18,'' city officials say that no one associated with
the event has applied for permits for outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been the level of interest this year as much as
in previous years,'' said Nick Gold, press secretary for Mayor Bill
Campbell. ``That does not mean, by any means, that young people are
not coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual Sweet Auburn Spring Fest, in Martin Luther King Jr.'s
old neighborhood, has been scheduled to coincide with the Freaknik
date this year to offer ``something meaningful'' for student
visitors, Gold said.
</P>
<P>
   But the word on the grapevine from predominantly black campuses
says the scene may shift to Los Angeles or Florida. That would be
in keeping with the haphazard nature of Freaknik, which has always
been something of a moveable feast.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta event is a variation of the old student invasions of
Florida, when thousands of collegians swamped Fort Lauderdale and
Daytona during spring breaks. Like the Florida frolic, Freaknik has
been a study in disorganization.
</P>
<P>
   The Freaknik Web site did not respond to queries for more
information, and no one could be found to speak authoritatively for
the event this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, it's going to happen,'' said Seth Coleman, a
spokesman for Morehouse College in Atlanta. But Coleman
acknowledged that Freaknik ``has been pretty much killed off''
since he was a Morehouse student earlier in the decade and the
April weekend in Atlanta was in riotous bloom.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that Freaknik may be disappearing here, George
Hawthorne, last year's chairman of the city's Black College Spring
Break Committee, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ``All the
indications say that the event is going to be a nonevent.''
</P>
<P>
   Freaknik went into decline last year after the 1997 affair
resulted in more than 500 arrests, 535 traffic summonses, and three
shootings. The year before, a young man from Ohio who came to
Atlanta for the spring break was shot to death. Freaknik's
reputation also suffered from looting rampages.
</P>
<P>
   From its peak in 1994, when an estimated 200,000 students poured
into Atlanta, causing gridlock on the streets and pandemonium in
parts of the city, the crowds dropped to about 50,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since one of the main activities involves cruising in cars,
Freaknik became synonymous with monumental traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe used the event to set a comic scene in ``A Man In
Full,'' his best-selling novel. The traffic on Piedmont, a major
Atlanta thoroughfare, Wolfe wrote, ``came to a complete, utter,
hopeless, bogged-down glue trap halt, both ways, northbound,
southbound, going and coming, across all four lanes.'' As wealthy
whites attending a party at the Piedmont Driving Club watched
incredulously, ``black boys and girls began popping out . . . of
convertibles, muscle cars, Jeeps, Explorers, out of vans, out of
evil-looking little econo-sports coupes, out of pickup trucks,
campers, hatchbacks,'' dancing and singing, ``Ram Yo' Booty!''
</P>
<P>
   To the Atlanta establishment, Freaknik is one big headache,
though few are willing to complain publicly because of the event's
racial identification. When other Southern capitals were engulfed
in civil rights turmoil, Atlanta liked to be called ``the city too
busy to hate.'' Black mayors have governed for more than 20 years,
white business leaders have encouraged racial reconciliation, and
Atlanta is sensitive to racial slights.
</P>
<P>
   But with Freaknik spinning out of control, the city's black
leadership moved to crack down on the crowds in the last few years.
Following the arrest of hundreds of visitors two years ago, Police
Chief Beverly Harvard, a black woman, was critical of the ``lewd''
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prospect that Freaknik will not happen here this
year, Atlanta police and traffic control authorities are prepared
for another visitation, according to Gold, the mayor's spokesman.
Asked about Campbell's position on Freaknik, Gold said:
``Everyone's welcome. There are no restrictions _ provided they
obey the law.''

PHILADELPHIA: FLOWERS, FLOWERS EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE DANIEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Maybe you didn't make it to the Philadelphia
Flower Show, the world's largest indoor show, which was held a few
weeks ago. But that doesn't mean you have to miss out on all the
gardens of the region. In Philadelphia and the surrounding
countryside, visitors will find the largest concentration of public
gardens and arboreta in North America _ more than 30.
</P>
<P>
   From the manicured farmlands in Pennsylvania's Bucks and Chester
counties to the wealthy suburban estates of Montgomery County and
the fertile banks of the Brandywine River, towering trees, lush
woody plants, and eye-popping blossoms color the landscape with an
intense, natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
   How did the Philadelphia area become such a prime garden spot?
Much of the reason has to do with former Quaker farming communities
and especially with the weather _ rich, fertile soil and four full
growing seasons. Furthermore, there was the wealth of such families
as the du Ponts, who contributed much by way of plantings and
philanthropy, encouraging private gardeners to make their land
public in order to share information and inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The learning center of this world of green is the Morris
Arboretum of the University of Pennsylvania, the official arboretum
of the commonwealth. A must stop on the garden tour, the arboretum
began in 1887 as ``Compton,'' the summer home of siblings John and
Lydia Morris. The land they purchased, in the northwest corner of
Philadelphia, was barren, but they turned it into a beautiful
landscape for others to enjoy and learn from. It was their dream
that the estate one day become an educational and research center
devoted to horticulture and botany, which it has.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its location in Philadelphia's historic Chestnut
Hill, a charming neighborhood known for unique shops, restaurants,
and cafes, the arboretum is a perfect destination for a day trip or
weekend getaway. A university garden since 1932, the 175-acre
arboretum is a Victorian delight, complete with winding paths,
special areas of varying styles, and streams running throughout the
estate. It also contains thousands of rare woody plants and many of
the city's oldest and largest trees. From ferns to flowers and
medicinal plants, from seedlings to strapping trees, the arboretum
contains more than 10,000 labeled plants. The more than 200
varieties of ferns are housed in the Fernery, built in 1899 and
renovated in 1994. This main attraction features an arched glass
roof and original cascade, grotto, and bridge, and is a favorite of
children. Kids also will delight in pumping water the old-fashioned
way at the cozy Log Cabin and watching baby swans at the Swan Pond.
</P>
<P>
   If the Morris Arboretum is the garden lover's Harvard, then
Longwood Gardens is its Disney World. The world-famous Longwood, in
the Brandywine area, 30 miles west of Philadelphia near Kennett
Square, Pa., is the extraordinary creation of industrialist Pierre
Samuel du Pont (1870-1954). A Quaker farming family first owned the
land, which du Pont purchased in 1906 to save the trees on the
land; the name, Longwood, is taken from the Quaker meetinghouse
built in 1859 and located a few miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
   This 1,050-acre horticultural showplace attracts more than
800,000 visitors a year, which means visitors should prepare for
overcrowding on holidays and special weekends. Longwood has one of
the world's largest conservatories, 20 outdoor and 20 indoor
gardens within four acres of greenhouses, a topiary garden, and
11,000 types of plants. One of the most eye-catching displays is
the Lily Display Garden, an outdoor aquatic display featuring
tropical and hardy water lilies on giant platters, in bloom from
July to October.
</P>
<P>
   Special events and themes occur year round. This year's Easter
display runs March 27-April 9 when lilies, daffodils, freesias, and
tulips fill the indoor gardens. From April 10 through May 28,
``Acres of Spring'' features tens of thousands of daffodils, along
with blossoming magnolias, forsythias, and flowering cherries. The
summer's ``Festival of Fountains'' highlights annual and perennial
flowers, as well as alfresco concerts and water displays in three
fountain gardens. During the year, there are about 400 performing
arts events, from concerts on the Longwood's world-famous
10,010-pipe organ to fully staged outdoor musical productions.
</P>
<P>
   Another du Pont site is the Hagley Museum and Library, in the
Delaware section of the Brandywine River Valley. Although
understandably overshadowed by its more prominent neighbors, this
240-acre site is home to a phenomenal ruin garden, which features
exquisitely beautiful broken mosaics and crumbled columns. The
Hagley also maintains a formal French vegetable garden.
</P>
<P>
   French gardens also are the highlight at Nemours, a re-creation
of French chateau country north of Wilmington. The 300-acre estate
was the residence of Alfred I. du Pont, and is a legacy of the
French architectural and gardening traditions that were part of his
heritage. The grounds include animal sculptures, fountains, and
sunken gardens. Colonnades, gates, and figurines add to the
architectural splendor.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest of Wilmington is the Winterthur Museum, Garden &AMP;
Library, a 60-acre garden on the 1,000-acre estate that has been in
du Pont ownership since 1811 and was the former country estate of
Henry Francis. Unlike Longwood or Nemours, Winterthur draws its
inspiration directly from nature. For example, the gorgeous
eight-acre azalea woods, in the main part of the garden, were
created from the gaping holes left in the canopies after a chestnut
blight struck the area in 1911. Winterthur is more known as a
world-class museum of American decorative arts, and visitors
discover that the outside art of the year-round gardens complement
the treasures found indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to Philadelphia, in Merion, just west of the city, is the
Arboretum of the Barnes Foundation, which houses the 1,000-piece
world-famous art collection of Dr. Albert C. Barnes (1982-1951).
Plants were selected for their color, texture, seasonal change, and
floral display. Barnes handled the paintings, while his wife,
Laura, tended to the garden, making it a living art gallery, with
plants and flowers selected for visual and aesthetic values. A
collection of nearly 200 lilacs was originally selected for its
color, graduating from lighter to deeper shades of purple. There
now are more than 250 lilac varieties, a rose and peony garden,
crabapples, and a woodland on the arboretum's 12 acres.
</P>
<P>
   America's oldest surviving botanical garden, Historic Bartram's
Garden, is tucked away in a 44-acre tract of land in West
Philadelphia along the Schuylkill River. As a garden, it grew the
notable plants of the continent; it was also the meeting place for
Colonial politicians and scientists, and is credited with saving
the Franklinia alatamaha tree from extinction. On May 18 through
23, Bartram's will be celebrating its 300th anniversary with
special events, including a living history festival.
</P>
<P>
   Another Colonial garden landmark in the city is Wyck, home to
nine generations of the same Quaker Philadelphia family, the
Wistars and Haineses, from 1690-1973.
</P>
<P>
   The country's first horticultural society, the Pennsylvania
Horticultural Society, founded in 1827 and located next to the
headquarters of Independence Park in downtown Philadelphia, is
responsible for much of the gardening publicity for the region by
way of its two famous shows, the Philadelphia Flower Show at the
Civic Center and the Harvest Show. The themed Flower Show features
more than 500 exhibits, 60 of which are lavishly produced each year
by area nurseries, educational institutions, corporations, and
governmental agencies. The smaller-scale Harvest Show, held every
October, is more popular with gardeners than tourists, showing more
state-fair practicality than Las Vegas glitz.
</P>
<P>
   The Horticultural Society also is responsible for many community
plantings through the Philadelphia Green Program, which it directs
to inspire plantings throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   So whether you take in one or two gardens during a visit to the
Philadelphia area or plan an entire garden-hopping trip (the Valley
Forge tourism office has suggested itineraries), your thumb is
bound to turn a bit greener.

THE EXCITING LIFE AND TIMES OF RICHARD HARDING DAVIS STILL
ENTERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a foray to Archer City, the small town in North Texas
that author-bookseller Larry McMurtry is putting on the literary
map of the world, I spent most of an afternoon with Richard Harding
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis shelf found in one of McMurtry's four Booked Up
buildings showed novels, short-story volumes, plays, reportage,
autobiographical writings, and several biographies of Davis penned
long ago, when or just after he was the most celebrated American
among those with writing professions.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Richard Harding Davis (1864-1916) was a household
name before the century's turn and until his premature death, which
was the likely issue of excesses.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was the original Arrow collar man. Beheld as the most
handsome and debonair fellow of his time, he took the show away
from old Mark Twain. The Philadelphia-born Davis defected to New
York, becoming a regular in Manhattan's cafe society, and his
romantic odyssey was popular newspaper fodder before there were
movie stars to track.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Harding Davis was the son _ and absolute pride and joy _
of Rebecca Harding Davis, herself a journalist and novelist of
considerable note. Although the son's fame far outstripped the
mother's, Rebecca Davis is today considered a more significant
figure in the pageant of American literature, as both muckraker and
feminist. Her son was a writer for his time but not for all time.
</P>
<P>
   Davis at age 21 began a fabled reportorial career with the
Philadelphia North American and Inquirer and in 1888 joined the
staff of the New York Sun and won instant fame for his ``specials''
_ reportage of sensational events in Gotham, dramatized for effect
with considerable poetic license. At age 25, he was managing editor
of Harper's Weekly; and very soon afterward, he became the first
superstar of a new journalistic breed, the war correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Like his great contemporaries Stephen Crane and Frank Norris
(and then much more famous than either), Davis covered the
Spanish-American War for newspapers in the United States and
Britain. His saga was the stuff of grand opera: At different times
he also reported the Boer War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the
Greco-Turkish War. In Europe, he covered the early battles of World
War I and died before our country's involvement in that ``war to
end wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis belonged to an age when authors wrote ... and wrote and
wrote, and wrote some more. He produced eight novels, a dozen story
collections, and was a successful dramatist with 25 plays performed
in New York. Indeed, Richard Harding Davis is the very translation
of ``sic transit gloria mundi.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Davis still can provide enjoyable light reading. Many of his
stories concern Courtlandt Von Bibber, a New York dandy closely
resembling Davis himself. ``Soldier of Fortune'' (1897), Davis'
best-known novel, reads like a streak. It is set mainly in a
fictional South American country, as is the play ``The Dictator,''
a great success for the young John Barrymore, who in 1915 made it
his silent-movie debut vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   My reading acquaintance with Davis was slight before our
rendezvous in McMurtryland, but long ago I read and enjoyed ``The
Bar Sinister'' (1903), a novel whose autobiographical narrator is a
bull terrier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, during the waning glory of MGM, ``The Bar Sinister''
was a delightful movie. Today an enterprising screenwriter could
hardly do better than conceive a film based on the tumultuous life
of Richard Harding Davis.

HOPEFUL NEWS ON MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ The sky, it turns out, isn't falling. But this is
a place where not even good news is viewed free of the blinders of
politics, so the fresh fact that Medicare is nothing like the
basket case portrayed is being processed as if it still were.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that much of the politics of the government's vital
entitlement programs continues to be trapped in the vanished
atmosphere of huge budget deficits.On the right, Newt Gingrich's
minions manipulated the chimera of impending doom to push for
privatization via vouchers _ ending Medicare, in effect, in order
to save it. They did it in their attempted revolution of 1995, and
they were back with a vengeance two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Each time they were defeated in their own Congress and by
President Clinton's veto actions and threats.But they're still at
it, and they have allies in the center who continue to push
cost-cutting ideas that originated in the era of $200 billion
deficits, when tough-minded opinion argued that the hemorrhage
could not be stopped unless all programs absorbed a fair share of
the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Time for some new thinking to take account of new realities.
Time to understand that the real problem is less Medicare per se
and more its place among competing national priorities over the
next generation.The occasion is last week's annual report of
Medicare and Social Security's trustees, shaped around the
bipartisanly accepted calculations of its professional actuaries.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, D-Day (as in depletion of the hospital
insurance fund in Medicare was supposed to occur in nine years; to
nearly universal surprise, the report tacked on another seven
years, to 2015, five years into the retirement of the baby boomers.
The report called this ``a substantial improvement.'' Even more
significant, it showed that this improvement was as much a function
of cost-restraining steps taken two years ago and other
improvements in Medicare operations as it was of the flourishing of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the encouraging news is not likely to end with the
latest report. The new D-Day of 2015, for example, is based on a
midrange assumption of annual economic growth over the period
averaging 1.5 percent, far below current trends and historical
experience.Moreover, since the final steps were taken to balance
the federal budget two years ago (which included hefty Medicare
savings from cuts), the long-term deficit for the program as
estimated by its actuaries has been slashed by two-thirds. It's
still there, but, in perspective, the country has resolved far more
difficult problems, beginning with the fiscal red ink of the 1980s
and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the most serious problem the government faces over the
next decade is not the entitlements by themselves, but the task of
balancing them in the face of other priorities. The real problem,
in other words, is the budget itself.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: In the unlikely event the just-passed congressional
budget resolution were actually to take effect, with its $800
billion tax cut and add-ons to military spending, the impact on the
rest of the government would have to be gigantic. Indeed, by a
decade from now, all spending other than the Pentagon, debt
interest, and entitlements would have to be slashed by nearly 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That includes everything from law enforcement and education, to
job-training, health research, air travel safety and child
nutrition. But before our friends on the left yell too loudly, it
needs to be recognized that the implications of Clinton's budget
proposals as fleshed out would only reduce that gutting of the
operating functions of the government by half in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, income-tax cuts are properly seen by most people
as low priority, given the pressures of the next two decades. In
addition, earmarking 15 percent of any surplus over the next decade
to Medicare, on top of the 62 percent for Social Security, will
relieve even more of the fiscal pressure. And reforms should be
targeted and fair, not masks for wholesale slashing that hurts the
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the insurance cost for the highest-income beneficiaries
is prudent and fair; raising the eligibility age is crude. More
choice and more managed care for the healthy elderly is sensible,
but phony choices designed to herd people are only disguised burden
shifts onto backs of the less well-to-do, who already are paying
more out of pocket every year.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to remember that roughly 10 percent of Medicare's
beneficiaries account for nearly three-fourths of its expenditures.
It also helps to remember that Medicare currently doesn't cover
drugs, eyeglasses, and hearing aids, nor does it have caps on what
individuals have to pay out of pocket in situations that are
covered.Reform, in short, must expand and reform the program to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the conventional wisdom is correct that the good actuarial
news takes the steam out of any drive to accomplish reform this
year or next. And maybe that means that Medicare and Social
Security will have to be a major element in next year's pivotal
presidential campaign. Great idea.

NBC'S AILING THURSDAY LINEUP GETS LIFE SUPPORT FROM `WILL &AMP; GRACE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're still wedged in the Nielsen ratings' Top 10, still
sitting pretty in the protected cocoon of a Thursday night
supposedly devoted to sophisticated humor. But the only funny thing
about ``Jesse'' and ``Veronica's Closet'' these days is watching
promos that trumpet the pair as ``Must-See TV.''
</P>
<P>
   There were times when I sat still for both shows, keying in on
every story line and subplot, every character, every joke, trying
to figure out why viewers didn't simply bail. Until it hit me that
they probably do. Nielsen ratings numbers register television sets
tuned in to network channels, but Nielsen has yet to devise a
tracking system for, say, extended potty breaks, phone calls,
nose-hair clippings, dog-walkings, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   And if you look at the ratings, a clear pattern of avoidance
emerges. Look at how many viewers start the night with ``Friends''
and exit when ``Jesse'' emerges. They return for ``Frasier'' and
disappear as ``Veronica's Closet'' appears, then return in bulk for
``ER.'' Thing is, the number staying put is enough to keep eyeballs
away from the programming of rival networks, which continue to send
forth perfectly adequate programs on suicide missions.
</P>
<P>
   It's fair to acknowledge that NBC's blockbuster Thursday has
always had weak links _ remember ``Caroline in the City'' and
``Suddenly Susan?'' But none was as obviously dependent on
coattails as the current bunch. And never before have networks like
the WB and ABC stated publicly that the Thursday-night juggernaut
is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the network known for sophisticated comedy, from
``The Cosby Show'' to ``Cheers'' and now ``Frasier'' and
``Friends,'' has taken one nasty little creative spill.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 p.m. CST on Tuesdays, NBC offers for our midseason
consideration ``Everything Relative,'' yet another formula comedy
delving into the world of nitwit parents. (It's displacing ``Will &AMP;
Grace,'' which moves to, yes, Thursdays.)
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Rahm is Leo, a comedy writer under siege from his neurotic
mother, played by Jill Clayburgh, and his eccentric father, Jeffrey
Tambor. Judging from the opening episode, it's some drop from the
wit and wisdom of ``The Larry Sanders Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom and Dad have been divorced for 20 years, but Clayburgh's
Mickey, a clinical therapist who claims to have written a
graduate-school thesis on obsessive relationships, is dangerously
obsessed with her ex-husband. She spends the first part of the
debut episode looking deranged, the other part suicidal. Who knows
what that bulge in her purse might be?
</P>
<P>
   The show's only surprise is that it's produced by Paul Junger
Witt, Tony Thomas, Nina Wass and Mitchell Hurwitz, whose combined
credits include ``The Golden Girls'' and ``John Larroquette Show,''
among others.
</P>
<P>
   NBC would love to see this series work, because that would allow
it to keep rookie success ``Will &AMP; Grace'' in ``Jesse's''
post-''Friends'' spot. Then NBC could ship the Christina Applegate
vehicle to another night or ``into'' the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse'' has never ventured beyond limiting and lifeless story
lines about a single mother and the Latin lover who pursues her.
``Will &AMP; Grace,'' by comparison, is the network's most successful
newcomer this side of ``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the series looks and behaves like so many other sitcoms,
the originality at the center of ``W&AMP;G'' was questioned early on.
Its gay/straight subject matter was considered gimmicky, and its
``Friends''-like pacing was seen as a rip-off. Still, there's
something about a funny show that makes you forget about such
pickiness.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder ``W&AMP;G'' now looms as a suitable fit for NBC's
Thursday-night block. Hilarity aside, it idealizes young, white,
single New York urbanites who spend an inordinate amount of time
talking and chatting and pontificating on every pop-cultural moment
imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``W&AMP;G'' moves along like a freight train behind schedule,
offering up such lightning-quick dialogue that you miss half of the
show's zippy one-liners and snappy comebacks if you're not careful.
(No potty breaks here.) Eric McCormack, as Will, and Debra Messing,
as Grace, have managed to go through their paces with charm and
great chemistry, and producers Max Mutchnick and David Kohan should
thank the casting gods for scene- stealers (and savers) Sean Hayes
(Jack) and Megan Mullally (Karen).
</P>
<P>
   ``W&AMP;G'' also has proved to be somewhat ingenious in introducing
a gay lead and gay supporting characters. This early in the
post-''Ellen'' universe, you'd have expected a backlash, but the
producers' decision to spoon-feed the audience, virtually taking
sex out the equation, makes Will less threatening and thereby more
acceptable. Some might call this a less-than-truthful, manipulative
maneuver with red-flag mixed messages _ one being that gay men
don't have sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   You be the judge of whether this is progress. But Mutchnick, who
is gay, didn't want to go the beat-them-over-the-head way of Ellen
DeGeneres. Now, a Thursday-night slot might be his big payoff.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Friends'' kicking it up a notch, ``Frasier'' smoothing
out early season mistakes and ``ER'' being less than fabulous but
still better than most, NBC could actually lay a formidable
foundation for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Now if only it would clean out that ``Veronica's Closet.''

AND AFTER THAT POSSIBLE GROUND WAR, THEN WHAT? (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A reader called to take issue with what she interpreted in a
recent column as my endorsement of Sen. John McCain's contention
that U.S. involvement in an all-out ground war will be necessary to
effectively finish what NATO started in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly was not my intention to make any such endorsement.
In fact, I don't believe that McCain has endorsed a ground war. He
has simply said that the use of ground troops should not be ruled
out as an option _ and that the American people should understand
that their country may already be so deeply involved in Yugoslavia
that a ground war is virtually unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been saying in interviews and newspaper commentary
that U.S. participation in airstrikes against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has put the world's lone remaining superpower in
a difficult situation: If the airstrikes do not achieve the
intended results, the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization might be forced to take the next step _ a ground war _
or risk forfeiting their credibility in future confrontations with
potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's point is a valid one _ and it's one that deserves to be
debated as publicly as possible before President Clinton commits
our nation to further military intervention in a part of the world
where war never ends and peace never lasts.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Clinton is far less inclined than true statesmen
such as McCain and ex-Sen. Bob Dole to level with the American
people about the possible perils of meddling in the Balkans.
Clinton has said again and again that there are no plans for a
ground war in Yugoslavia, which might mean that there are no plans
or that there are plans piled on top of plans.
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on Clinton's definition of ``plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Would anyone be shocked or even slightly surprised if it turned
out that Clinton has known from the start that airstrikes wouldn't
get the job done but withheld that information from the public in
the expectation that he could drum up public support for all-out
warfare later on?
</P>
<P>
   What? Bill Clinton mislead the American people? Perish the
thought.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of the American people, and especially our fighting
men and women in the armed forces, let's hope that the president
actually believes that the airstrikes will work _ and that his
belief is well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   The dual purpose of the bombing is to shut down Milosevic's
campaign of ethnic cleansing against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and
to force him to allow a NATO peacekeeping force to occupy his
country. The dual result, so far, has been the opposite: Ethnic
cleansing is worse than ever, and Milosevic appears to be no closer
to accepting a peace agreement than he was before the first cruise
missile was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the concern of McCain and others that bombing won't work
and that ground troops will be needed to win the peace against
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   That reader who called wondered if the good guys would be able
to win a ground war, given the deterioration of military
preparedness that has occurred during Clinton's tenure as commander
in chief. It's a legitimate concern, although most of those
military ``consultants'' who work as analysts for the various TV
networks seem to believe that a NATO invasion force would prevail
in decisive fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But ground war or no ground war, the overriding question about
U.S. involvement in Yugoslavia remains the same: If we win, what
will we have won?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer: We will have won the right to occupy a foreign
country whose internal disputes have defied solution for centuries
_ and whose problems, serious though they are, have no impact on
U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
   The even shorter answer: We will have won nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all-out war is inevitable. Maybe it's what Clinton has
been planning all along. And if it is what he's been planning,
maybe he'll get around to sharing those plans with the American
people one of these days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, let's hope and pray that the airstrikes succeed. The
quagmire is getting deeper by the hour.

EMC CORP'S $67 BILLION MARKET VALUE OVERTAKES GILLETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts has a new stock market champ.
</P>
<P>
   EMC Corp., a Hopkinton technology firm, Monday became the
Massachusetts company with the greatest market value, a title held
for the past seven years by Gillette Co. When trading ended at 4
p.m. Monday, the total value of EMC's shares _ what you would have
to pay if you were to buy the entire company _ topped $67 billion,
compared to about $64 billion for Gillette. A year ago Gillette's
market value was more than three times greater than EMC's.
</P>
<P>
   If you invested a dollar in EMC stock at the beginning of this
decade, it would be worth nearly $500 today.
</P>
<P>
   The changing of the guard says something about the two
companies. EMC is hot; Gillette is not. But it speaks more to the
kind of changes sweeping the economy and the stock market. In the
new economy, technology is king. Investors are convinced that
technology is remaking the world and that a handful of electronics
companies will lead the way.
</P>
<P>
   In response, they have bid up the price of technology stocks to
incredible _ some would say ridiculous _ levels. Microsoft's market
value is almost as great today as the entire gross national product
of Canada. ``Anyone who thinks these stocks aren't vulnerable to a
major correction isn't being realistic,'' says Thomas O'Neill,
chief investment officer of Fleet Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   But even those who are skeptical about today's stock prices are
not skeptical about EMC's prospects. Although it is far from a
household name, on Wall Street the company is mentioned in the same
breath as the technology elite _ Microsoft, America Online, Dell
Computer, Cisco Systems. ``They are about as dominant as anyone in
technology in their space,'' says Rob Joseph, an analyst with State
Street Research in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   EMC's specialty is storage; it makes devices that hold
information. The company's products are often referred to as the
file cabinets of the electronic age. It sounds boring and
unimportant. It isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have recognized that storage is as important as
the computer itself,'' says Mark Fredrickson, a spokesman for EMC.
``It may be more important because it is where data lives. And
there is not a company out there that doesn't generate more
information every day.''
</P>
<P>
   EMC provides storage systems to companies like Cisco, Delta
Airlines, and Visa. Its customers also include big Internet players
such as Amazon.com, the electronic bookstore, and Charles Schwab,
the nation's leading discount broker.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet may be a big part of the company's future, but
EMC's rise largely predated the rise of the World Wide Web. Simply
put, the company recognized the importance of storage before the
rest of the world and used that edge to beat the pants off its
competition.
</P>
<P>
   EMC long ago knocked off IBM, the old leader in storage. The
company became the top player in storage for mainframe computers
and then did the same thing in the storage market for smaller
machines. From practically nothing, EMC has built a software
business that will top $500 million in sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has noticed. Over the past 10 years, EMC's stock has
done better than all the stocks in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
with the exception of Dell Computer. Last year the stock climbed
209 percent. In 1999 the stock has risen another 56 percent. In
1990 you could have bought the whole company for $136 million.
Monday EMC would have cost you $67 billion.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the stock market, Gillette has not exactly been
a slacker. Since 1981 its stock has risen roughly sixtyfold.
Between 1987 and 1997 Gillette's share price rose an average 33
percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock's rise has created great wealth on Wall Street and
within the ranks of the company's work force. Gillette recently
said that more than 300 of its employees own more than $1 million
worth of Gillette stock. Some of those employees are blue-collar
workers who make less than $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past two years, Gillette has had to contend with the
ups and downs of the world economy. Economic woes in Asia and
Russia have made it more difficult for people to buy Gillette's
razors and batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Just Monday Gillette said its earnings in the first quarter of
1999 would be slightly below Wall Street's expectations, a
development the company blamed on weak sales in Latin America.
``Gillette is fighting a world recession,'' says Ned Riley, chief
investment officer at BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's stock fell Monday and analysts expect more of a
dropoff today. Gillette is still a much larger company than EMC.
Its sales topped $10 billion in 1998; EMC's were slightly less than
$4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that the stock market is a fickle friend.
Investors assign prices to stocks by peering into crystal balls and
imagining what the future will look like. When unexpected events
occur _ like Monday's announcement by Gillette _ the view of the
future can go from sunny to cloudy very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of the 1980s Digital Equipment Corp. was
Massachusetts' leader in stock market value. In the early 1990s,
the computer company stumbled badly and Gillette moved into the
number one slot. Monday the shaving king passed the crown to the
computer storage giant.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing you can say with certainty is that someday,
EMC will give way to another challenger.

AND AFTER THAT POSSIBLE GROUND WAR, THEN WHAT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A reader called to take issue with what she interpreted in a
recent column as my endorsement of Sen. John McCain's contention
that U.S. involvement in an all-out ground war will be necessary to
effectively finish what NATO started in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly was not my intention to make any such endorsement.
In fact, I don't believe that McCain has endorsed a ground war. He
has simply said that the use of ground troops should not be ruled
out as an option _ and that the American people should understand
that their country may already be so deeply involved in Yugoslavia
that a ground war is virtually unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been saying in interviews and newspaper commentary
that U.S. participation in airstrikes against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has put the world's lone remaining superpower in
a difficult situation: If the airstrikes do not achieve the
intended results, the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization might be forced to take the next step _ a ground war _
or risk forfeiting their credibility in future confrontations with
potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's point is a valid one _ and it's one that deserves to be
debated as publicly as possible before President Clinton commits
our nation to further military intervention in a part of the world
where war never ends and peace never lasts.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Clinton is far less inclined than true statesmen
such as McCain and ex-Sen. Bob Dole to level with the American
people about the possible perils of meddling in the Balkans.
Clinton has said again and again that there are no plans for a
ground war in Yugoslavia, which might mean that there are no plans
or that there are plans piled on top of plans.
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on Clinton's definition of ``plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Would anyone be shocked or even slightly surprised if it turned
out that Clinton has known from the start that airstrikes wouldn't
get the job done but withheld that information from the public in
the expectation that he could drum up public support for all-out
warfare later on?
</P>
<P>
   What? Bill Clinton mislead the American people? Perish the
thought.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of the American people, and especially our fighting
men and women in the armed forces, let's hope that the president
actually believes that the airstrikes will work _ and that his
belief is well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   The dual purpose of the bombing is to shut down Milosevic's
campaign of ethnic cleansing against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and
to force him to allow a NATO peacekeeping force to occupy his
country. The dual result, so far, has been the opposite: Ethnic
cleansing is worse than ever, and Milosevic appears to be no closer
to accepting a peace agreement than he was before the first cruise
missile was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the concern of McCain and others that bombing won't work
and that ground troops will be needed to win the peace against
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   That reader who called wondered if the good guys would be able
to win a ground war, given the deterioration of military
preparedness that has occurred during Clinton's tenure as commander
in chief. It's a legitimate concern, although most of those
military ``consultants'' who work as analysts for the various TV
networks seem to believe that a NATO invasion force would prevail
in decisive fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But ground war or no ground war, the overriding question about
U.S. involvement in Yugoslavia remains the same: If we win, what
will we have won?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer: We will have won the right to occupy a foreign
country whose internal disputes have defied solution for centuries
_ and whose problems, serious though they are, have no impact on
U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
   The even shorter answer: We will have won nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all-out war is inevitable. Maybe it's what Clinton has
been planning all along. And if it is what he's been planning,
maybe he'll get around to sharing those plans with the American
people one of these days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, let's hope and pray that the airstrikes succeed. The
quagmire is getting deeper by the hour.

NOURISHMENT FOR THE BODY AND THE SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the heavenly rewards I enjoy each morning is a muffin
smothered with red raspberry jam made by the monks at St. Joseph's
Abbey in Spencer, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The jams are sold in supermarkets but it can be a far more
fulfilling experience to visit the Trappist monastery just outside
Worcester _ and, I'm not even Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   For many, a visit to a monastery or retreat house provides a
peaceful time to escape the outside world, a time for solitude that
leads to reflection and, perhaps, regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   In other venues, there are quiet places for travelers to explore
life changes ranging from holistic vacations to health
revitalizating spas, from self-improvement to educational
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately there are places scattered about the country and
overseas that offer just such vacations. Four recent books provide
a gateway to finding just the right retreat or revitalizing
vacation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Vacations That Can Change Your Life'' by Ellen Lederman
(Sourcebooks, $16.95); ``The Whole Heaven Catalog'' by Marcia and
Jack Kelly (Crown, $18); and ``Bed and Blessings in Italy'' by June
and Anne Walsh (Paulist Press, $16.95); and ``Sanctuaries'' also by
the Kellys (Crown Publishing, $18).
</P>
<P>
   You'll find some surprises in these books. For example, while I
knew the Trappists take a vow of silence and are for men only,
couples and women can stay at the abbey for a retreat.
</P>
<P>
   On Cape Cod, the Society of Jesus was a mystery. Now I know it
is a society made up of members and clergy from various Protestant
denominations, and even offers Cape Codders services such as lawn
care and construction.
</P>
<P>
   It's located right in Orleans on the water. At most of the
retreats you don't have to be a member of a particular church, or
even sign up for a organized program.
</P>
<P>
   There are retreats for just about every religion, and every
need. For example, just a short distance from Spencer in Lenox is
Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health, which caters to meeting the
spiritual needs for the whole person from health to exercise to
meditation. It's near Tanglewood, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's
summer ``retreat'' center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vacations That Can Change Your Life'' offers the greatest
variety of retreat or learning vacations. ``The Whole Heaven
Catalog,'' in addition to being a guide to retreat centers, offers
information to products made at a particular center along with
festivals to participate in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctuaries'' and ``Bed and Blessings in Italy'' are limited
to being guides to retreat centers. The Italy guide is on Roman
Catholic centers, and provides a great source of accommodations for
anyone heading to Rome or elsewhere for the Holy Year of 2000.
``Sanctuaries'' covers retreat centers for all faiths.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing a place for reflection, these retreats
all provide low-cost accommodations. All the guides provide
complete information on locating the centers, along with costs,
types of accommodations, and whether the retreats are suitable for
families, singles or couples.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Going to church?
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 28 percent of adult travelers (43 million) in the United
States went to a church, temple, mosque or other place of worship
to attend a regularly scheduled religious service while on a trip
of 100 miles or more last year.
</P>
<P>
   The travel industry survey reported in the Newport County
Gateway said the poll did not include travelers who went to a place
of worship for sightseeing or to attend a special service such as a
wedding or bar mitzvah.
</P>
<P>
   Newport is marking the 350th anniversary of the founding of
Trinity Church, and is also home to the nation's oldest synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Taxing times
</P>
<P>
   Looking for ways to ease the tax bite? New York's Barbizon Hotel
&AMP; Towers has an interesting Tortured by Taxes package for April 14.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's suites will be equipped with a lap top computer
fully-loaded with Intuit's Turbo Tax, a copy of Taxes for Dummies
will be available as well as a paper shredder for you know what,
and an IRS Voodoo doll with assorted pins and needles for stress
relief.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, show your completed tax form and a $50
contribution will be made in your name to a charity of your choice
and it's good for a '99 tax deduction. Also included is a spa
therapy relaxation treatment. The package is $475; for information
call 800-223-1020.

STUDY CITES PROBLEMS WITH NEW GAS STATION TANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAY KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A multibillion-dollar, decadelong government
campaign to seal underground fuel tanks at gas stations across the
country has sprung a leak.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline and the possibly cancer-causing fuel additive MTBE
continue to ooze from some tanks and pipes that were repaired or
replaced at the owners' expense to meet a 1998 legal deadline,
according to a yearlong study by the State Water Resources Control
Board in California.
</P>
<P>
   Faulty tank installations, poor maintenance, improper operation,
inferior equipment and upgrades that didn't comply with
requirements are the main causes, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspections revealed there was leakage from upgrades,'' said
Allan Patton, manager of the state's underground tank program and
chairman of the study advisory panel. ``Are they all leaking? No.
What we don't know is if there's a widespread problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complex system, and things can go wrong. It could be a
national problem,'' Patton said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations at 23 sites in three California counties _ Santa
Clara, El Dorado and Sacramento _ by a team from industry, water
districts and municipalities found problems at 18 stations.
</P>
<P>
   Most commonly, gasoline was dripping from pipe connections
beneath pumps. There were also cases in which gas was escaping from
pipes connected to a turbine pump in the fuel tank, which moves gas
to the gas pump. Or gas was seeping from joints in underground
pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Environmental Resource Council, a Santa
Rosa-based group of business owners organized to deal with the law,
were dismayed at the results. Members of the council include small
gas stations and contracting, equipment and electrical companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they tell us that the new systems leak. We're back to
square one. Again, it's the tank owner holding the bag. We're the
ones who have to pay for new upgrades,'' said Kirk Veale, a founder
of the group, who was required to replace the tanks at his former
car dealership in Santa Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saddest part of the story is that so many people have
already gone out of business. Unlike the big oil companies, the
small owners can't recoup their loss by adding to the price of
their product,'' Veale said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Sutley, a senior policy adviser for the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, said the study raised questions about the
effectiveness of the underground tank regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to understand how this happened, and find common-sense
ways to address the potential for leakage,'' Sutley said. ``Now
we're starting to get some information. We have to figure out what
it means, and what we need to do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said there was no suggestion of ``another whole set of
regulations and expenditures at any level of government.''
</P>
<P>
   But in California, a state panel will look at the study and
others to decide whether new regulations are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before any regulatory improvements are recommended one way or
another, we want a thorough diagnosis of the problem. We don't need
regulatory window- dressing. We need real solutions,'' said David
Fogarty, a spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association, an
oil industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the problems are with the older systems that don't
comply,'' he said. ``That doesn't mean we don't have to be vigilant
to ensure that underground tanks don't leak.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers have expressed concern that their costly efforts are
not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Amick, operator of Civic Center Shell in San Jose, said
that although Shell paid for tank improvements, closing his station
during installation cost him $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very expensive for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that, even after the work, fuel appeared to be
leaking, possibly from piping under the gas pumps.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of MTBE in the ground water measured 280,000 parts
per billion last April, exceeding by 56,000 times a drinking water
warning level proposed by state health officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything they (the regulators) tell us to do,'' Amick
said. ``They keep changing all the time, and we're trying to keep
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Gov. Gray Davis declared MTBE a ``significant
risk to California's environment'' and ordered the compound removed
from the state's gasoline supply by 2003.

</P>
<P>
   Since before World War II, fire departments and other agencies
encouraged burial of fuel and chemical tanks to prevent
catastrophic fires.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1980s, hydrologists were finding widespread
plumes of solvents and gasoline spoiling wells and other
underground water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   California adopted requirements in 1984 to coat or line tanks
and contain leaks by such means as plastic liners.
</P>
<P>
   The high cost of the regulations drew objections from industry
and small businesses. They battled against environmentalists who
wanted a phase-out of single-wall tanks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the federal government passed regulations requiring
double-wall tanks, structures to contain seeps, and monitoring
devices to detect leaks. The government banned single-wall steel
tanks, but to ease the financial burden, grandfathered in those
that were fiberglass or specially coated.
</P>
<P>
   After Dec. 22, 1998, oil companies were prevented from
delivering fuel to stations that did not have a blue-and-white
upgrade placard. Violators faced daily fines of $5,000 per tank.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to prevent leaks has produced widespread
environmental degradation, in some cases spoiled drinking water
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   By last year, the state had identified 32,409 sites of leaking
underground tanks. In 13,278 cases, fuel had reached ground water.
</P>
<P>
   In at least 10,000 California sites, according to a Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory study, ground water is contaminated
with MTBE, which is added to gas to make engines burn cleaner.

<P>
   Among the findings of the state study:
</P>
<P>
   _ Leaks are the result of improper installation, operation or
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most leaks are pipe joints under the gas pumps, in fittings
throughout the system and where pipes connect to the fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
   _ There is inadequate enforcement against owners who don't
comply with leak-detection requirements or who fail to follow up on
suspected releases.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tank owners aren't conducting leak-detection tests at all or
frequently enough.
</P>
<P>
   _ There's no standard procedure to test the soundness of
containment structures designed to capture leaks beneath gas pumps
or at connections to the tanks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Older tank systems leak more frequently. They are more likely
to be poorly installed, contain outdated technology or have
corroded pipe connections.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tank owners don't have highly qualified inspectors checking
initial installations or continuing to catch problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Owners fail to maintain the systems.

   YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MAIN _ WASHINGTON _ More U.S. weapons are on the way to
the Balkans as humanitarian groups struggle to care for the growing
number of ethnic Albanian refugees. Developing. (Deans, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA _ DURRES or TIRANA, Albania _ Ethnic Albanian exiles
here are recruiting fighters for the Kosovo Liberation Army,
preparing a ragtag army to eventually force the Serbs out of what
they consider their homeland. A look at the KLA's recruiting and
training operations. (Roughton, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-GITMO _ MIAMI _ In normal times, the U.S. Navy base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba is a sleepy place where 3,500 seamen assist
the Navy with operations across
</P>
<P>
   Latin America. But if the United States decides to airlift
ethnic Albanians there, the base will have to be transformed to a
hodge-podge metropolis of tents and field latrines to serve up to
20,000 desperate refugees. People familiar with the base say the
transformation would be a logistical nightmare, and they question
whether it's a good idea to bring Kosovars used to cold weather to
such a hot spot in the Caribbean that's nearly 5,000 miles from
their homeland. Refugee experts say the Kosovars should be housed
closer to home. (Emling, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   SPENDING _ When Congress set campaign contribution limits in
1975, gasoline sold for $.50 a gallon and a McDonold's hamburger
cost $.20. Gas, burgers and everything else has increased since
then but federal contribution limits have remained frozen at $1,000
_ a third what it would be worth today if adjusted for inflation.
But after 25 years, there are the first glimmers that Congress
might be ready to bump up the limits. While proponents say it will
ease the fundraising burden on candidates, campaign reform
advocates say that it will only further swamp a system that is
awash in too much cash. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   LEVITT-FUNDS _WASHINGTON _ SEC to announce new 'tool' to help
investors calculate mutual fund costs. (McNaughton, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   EVERGLADES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A mere 63 years after
Marjory Stoneman Douglas proclaimed the Everglades' ``11th hour,''
the Army Corps of Engineers will finally end the decline of
Florida's most precious marsh system _ in 2010. That's the promise
of the corps' newest version of its $7.8 billion restoration plan,
which hits the Internet and the libraries on Wednesday. (King, Palm
Beach Post). 20.
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-ANALYSIS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Historical analysis
of hurricane damage in the U.S.: what would happen if the big
storms of the past were to hit in the vastly developed coastline
today? When adjusted for 1995 dollars, the 1926 storm that hit
Miami would have been the costliest to hit Florida: $72 billion.
Andrew's damage in 1992 was $21.6 billion (in 1995 dollars and
considering property values and growth, that cost would have jumped
to $33 billion). The 1928 Lake Okeechobee storm would have cost
nearly $14 billion in 1995 dollars. We'll look at the 10 most
expensive storms to hit South Florida, based on a report presented
to the hurricane conference Thursday. (Kleinberg, Palm Beach Post).

<P>
   FLA-ELDERLY-WILL _ LANTANA, Fla. _ Before all the trouble began,
Ruth Turgeon was the sort of gentle elderly soul who lives alone,
dotes on her cats, feeds stray animals and sends money to humane
societies. A little forgetful, maybe, but who isn't when they're
well past 80? Neighbors in her little waterfront community watched
out for her, took her meals, ran in to check on her. Then the state
abuse hot line got a call saying Turgeon was being exploited,
something about her giving money to a friend who picked up stray
animals and sent the vet bills to her. A state investigator checked
it out and made some startling discoveries. The frugal,
sweet-natured woman who'd been a secretary for the Postal Service
and a co-founder of the Jeanne Craig Foundation for stray animals
had a fortune of $2.5 million in stocks, bonds and cash _ and no
will. That was the end of Ruth Turgeon's quiet and privacy. For the
past 18 months, she's been enveloped in chaos and anxiety as the
state, the neighbors, three nieces _ and everybody's lawyers _
battled for control of her body, her mind and her money.

BUSINESS OVER NET POSES RISK OF FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GABRIELLE CRIST 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It might have been too good to be true, but
for at least a dozen folks across the country, it was too good to
pass up.
</P>
<P>
   They are, after all, a little berserk over Beanie Babies. So
when they saw an advertisement for some hard-to-find stuffed
critters on an Internet auction site at low prices, they took a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Pilch, a Virginia mother of five, got a cash advance from
her credit card and sent $3,000 to a Fort Worth man who placed the
advertisement. Michigan resident Vicki Geiss sent about $220.
Roberta Wells, who also lives in Virginia, sent about $100.
</P>
<P>
   All paid in cash, but none received anything in return. No
charges have been filed against the seller, and he said he plans to
make good with all his customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the case points out the dangers of doing business on the
Internet. And it's a lesson more people learn every day as they
surf the Net, looking for that really good deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth man, who calls himself ``31 and dumb,'' said his
intentions were always good. There was a delay in the delivery of
Beanie Babies to him, he said. Then, a main satellite malfunctioned
and his order didn't transmit, he said. Then, the prices of the
Beanie Babies increased and he didn't have enough money to pay for
them.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he told some of the buyers that someone had stolen
his supply. That was ``a lie just to buy some time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he will do whatever it takes to return their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably will, more than likely, get a job,'' said the man,
who is not being identified because he has not been charged with a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Less than confident that they will be repaid, some of the people
who sent the man money have filed a complaint with the Postal
Service, which investigates mail fraud cases. Officials there would
not confirm whether they were conducting an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints to Internet Fraud Watch, a division of the National
Consumer's League, have tripled in the past seven months, and about
half of the reports involved a cash payment, said Cleo Manuel, the
consumer organization's vice president for public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web has become a huge yard sale,'' Manuel said. ``More
people are going online, and as more people go online, more people
are going to be victims of fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Geiss, who figures her $220 is gone for good, said she feels
foolish for her lack of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I put my faith in the Web site when I shouldn't
have,'' Geiss said.
</P>
<P>
   That's how a lot of people are becoming victims, Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a false sense of trust because technology is viewed as
something pure,'' Manuel said. ``They're not used to being
skeptical online.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel said online auctions are a great place to wheel and deal
for most people, but they are also a favorite spot for con artists.
Sites such as eBay, Up For Sale and Auction Universe allow sellers
to post items for sale, and consumers place bids on them.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel remembers one woman who purchased a lightweight
wheelchair in an online auction. She got a metal folding chair on
casters, Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Beanie Babies are a popular product, Manuel
said. One woman paid more than $1,000 for Quackers, a yellow duck
that comes in two versions _ with wings or without. The woman
thought she was paying for the one without wings, which is more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   She received a Quackers that once had wings, but they had been
plucked off.
</P>
<P>
   Auction sites will kick sellers off if it can be determined that
they are misrepresenting their products or not sending the
merchandise. The Fort Worth man said he was kicked off eBay, Beanie
Nation, Auction Universe and Up For Sale.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Kirksey, an inspector for the Southwest Division of the
Postal Service, said complaints concerning Internet mail fraud are
rapidly growing.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, complaints were virtually unheard of. In the past
several months, inspectors have received four complaints that
resulted in investigations, Kirksey said.
</P>
<P>
   As the popularity of the Internet increases, so will the cases,
she said. And new laws are needed to address the problem, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several laws concerning the Internet have been proposed, but
most do not specifically address Internet fraud. Rep. Robert
Weygand, D-R.I., has introduced a bill that would amend the federal
criminal code to include penalties for Internet telemarketing
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't help the people who mailed their money to the
Fort Worth man.
</P>
<P>
   Wells said she was suspicious of the deal to begin with, so she
sent less money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of knew what I might have been getting into,'' said the
44-year-old Wells. ``I'm ashamed, but it was greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells said she did learn one thing from the ordeal:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a sucker,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people who sent money said they will continue to
browse for bargains on the Net. They'll just do it a little more
cautiously.

 c.1999 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On Nov. 16, 1995, Lt. Gen. Wesley Clark sat in Dayton, Ohio,
inside a PowerScene virtual-reality imaging system, using a
joystick to fly back and forth through simulated three-dimensional
scenes of the hills of Bosnia east of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   At about 11 p.m., Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic had
joined him, as well as some other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lubricated by Scotch, Milosevic and the Americans zoomed back
and forth on the computer simulation to try to carve out a path
from the besieged Bosnian capital to Gorazde, a U.N. ``safe area''
surrounded by Bosnian Serbs. In the wee hours of the morning, Clark
used crayons to draw a corridor from Sarajevo to Gorazde that was
not hopelessly indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic shook hands with Clark, who is now the supreme allied
commander in Europe, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the main American
peace negotiator, and what is variously known as the Clark Corridor
or the Scotch Road was born.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the United States had shifted from a determination not
to be dragged into the Balkans to using U.S. officials and
computers to draw Bosnia's new frontiers. Winston Churchill used to
brag about having drawn Jordan's borders on a map one afternoon;
the American general could say much the same thing about Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But America's entry lacked swagger. Rather, U.S. policymakers
came to sketch the Scotch Road with a profound sense of
ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Documents relating to this diplomacy _ including Holbrooke's
memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996 official
study of the process leading to the Dayton Accords of November 1995
_ show that American officials were painfully aware of the
shortcomings of U.S. Bosnia policy and the distance it had shifted
from the goals that Bill Clinton had espoused in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Dayton was a vast improvement over the muddle and
bloodshed that preceded it. But it was oversold.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton represented not the vindication of the liberal ideals
with which Clinton excoriated George Bush on the 1992 campaign
trail _ firm action to halt genocide, bringing war criminals to
justice, tolerance, multiethnic nation-states, liberal nationalism
and the use of international and European institutions _ but rather
a version of the chilly realpolitik that kept the Bush
administration out of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal the Clinton team helped cut edged ominously close to
partition, writing an epitaph for Bosnia as a multiethnic state and
ceding much of its territory to the Bosnian Serbs. Many of Dayton's
better provisions, especially the prosecution of war criminals and
the return of refugees, remain largely unimplemented.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Dayton required dealing with and ultimately strengthening
Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, two ethnic
nationalists whose ideology and ruthlessness are antithetical to
liberal values.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's lessons are grimly appropriate when considering the
violence in Kosovo, where Milosevic's demagoguery helped set off
the demise of Yugoslavia and which now is the latest target of his
tragic ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodshed in Kosovo is a symptom of the approach that
strengthened Milosevic and Tudjman. By doing so, Dayton plunged
Serbia deeper into ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb
soil'' of Kosovo matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the
Albanians who lived there. As such, the Kosovo crisis comes as
scant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   While the theater has shifted, and while Kosovo is part of
Serbia proper, the underlying questions are much the same. As in
1993, the Clinton administration found itself faced with a
fundamental choice. Would the United States push Milosevic to
respect autonomy, the rights of minorities and the rule of law, or
would it retreat, as it did for two years in Bosnia, by saying that
getting involved was not worth American blood?
</P>
<P>
   To win any accord in Bosnia in 1995 was not easy; Dayton took
considerable diplomatic skill and tenacity. Congress' isolationists
proved unhelpful and irresponsible, and the administration ran huge
political risks by deciding to intervene. But it ran those risks
for a reluctant realism.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the very policies that the administration balked at
in May 1993 _ using military force and firm leadership of the
Europeans _ were the ones that stopped the war in the autumn of
1995. According to Warren Zimmermann, the last U.S. ambassador to
Yugoslavia, the cost of delay was more than 100,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fuller our picture of the Dayton situation becomes, the
clearer it is that the Dayton process _ its accomplishments
notwithstanding _ is less a how-to manual for peacemakers than a
cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Clinton administration inherited a mess. Its
Republican predecessors were consummate realists. After meeting
Milosevic in Belgrade in June 1991 to warn him against
``exploitation of ethnic resentments (and) failure to respect human
rights in Kosovo'' _ complaints that could be lifted from later
headlines _ Secretary of State James A. Baker III felt he ``was
talking to a wall with a crew cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration greeted Yugoslav intransigence with a
shrug. Its basic _ and correct _ diplomatic calculus was that only
military force would deter the ambitions of Milosevic and Tudjman.
Its basic _ and incorrect _ political calculus was that such an
intervention could never be sold to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment was shaded by Bush's determination not to try.
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said that the president
would frequently ask him, ``Tell me again what this is all about.''
He saw no U.S. interests engaged in Bosnia, and his European allies
reinforced his skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in, where does it end?'' asked then British Prime
Minister John Major. Instead, the Bush administration treated
Bosnia as if its woes were the result of a famine or an earthquake
rather than an act of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, as Baker put it, was that the costs in
casualties ``would have been staggering ... the necessary support
by the American people for the degree of force that would have been
required in Bosnia could never have been built or maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the other hand, promised a very different policy on
the campaign trail. ``I know that ethnic divisions are one of the
strongest impulses in all of society all over the world,'' he said,
``but we've got to take a stand against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration, he charged, was immoral ``for turning
its back on violations of basic human rights,'' and needed to show
``real leadership.'' When the Clinton administration dithered,
unlike the Bush administration, it did so in defiance of its
promises.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian war could well have been ended in May 1993 had the
president fulfilled his campaign pledge to lift the arms embargo on
the Bosnians and launch air strikes on the Serbs. At that time,
Clinton sent Secretary of State Warren Christopher to sound out the
Europeans about lift and strike.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher was instructed to consult, not to lead, and what
he heard was across-the-board opposition, concern for European
soldiers in the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), distaste for
supposed American arrogance and warnings that NATO might sunder.
</P>
<P>
   At a pivotal briefing in the Roosevelt Room the morning of his
return, Christopher told Clinton that lift and strike was still
viable, but that it would require, as he put it, a ``raw power
approach'': telling the Europeans ``that we have firmly decided to
go ahead with our preferred option and that we expect them to
support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the choices, Christopher explained, the least attractive
_ and most hypocritical _ would be to continue the Bush policy of
``doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton blanched.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did Clinton ultimately act decisively, backing
heretofore toothless diplomacy with force and American leadership?
Alas, the answer to this puzzle lies in a startling decision _ or,
better, a nondecision _ that no administration should repeat.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the August 1995 decision to push for Holbrooke's
shuttle, without being fully aware of it, Washington had already
committed itself to a military presence in Bosnia. The decision was
made in so aimless a manner that almost all senior officials were
caught off-guard when the implications of what they had done
finally sank in.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's Bosnia study confirms that most senior
foreign-policy officials, most notably the president himself, were
surprised to learn in June 1995 that U.S. troops might soon be on
their way to Bosnia whether the administration liked it or not.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion stemmed from an earlier presidential decision
that, should the situation on the ground become chaotic enough to
prevent UNPROFOR _ the hapless U.N. peacekeeping mission already in
Bosnia _ from functioning, NATO would intervene to help the blue
helmets flee.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration confirmed this commitment in late
1994, and NATO military planners duly began work on Op-plan 40104,
which called for using 20,000 U.S. troops as part of a
60,000-person evacuation force.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO approved this mission in the spring of 1995 with the
consent of American NATO Amb. Robert E. Hunter and U.S. military
planners in Brussels, the Clinton administration boxed itself in.
While an intervention to limit U.N. failure would be dangerous and
humiliating, the White House figured that reneging on its promise
to NATO would destroy the remains of its credibility and devastate
an already frayed alliance.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.N. peacekeeping force daily revealed to be impotent,
the only way Washington would be able to forestall the withdrawal
mission to which it had committed itself was to push the parties to
peace _ a better option, but one that would still require sending
American troops to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   What one Clinton adviser called ``the single most difficult
decision of (Clinton's) presidency _ to send troops to Bosnia'' had
been made without anyone realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   As the war worsened, the specter of Op-plan 40104 loomed larger.
The Serb massacres of thousands of Bosnian Muslims in July 1995 in
the ``safe areas'' of Srebrenica and Zepa made the U.N.
peacekeeping mission's ignominy complete.
</P>
<P>
   European countries participating in UNPROFOR began warning that
they would soon pull their troops out, triggering what American
policymakers referred to as the 40104 ``doomsday machine'' _
intervention triggered by humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior officials, including then U.N. Amb. Madeleine K.
Albright and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, began arguing
that since American troops were headed for Bosnia anyway, the
administration should try to implement a success rather than ratify
a failure.
</P>
<P>
   As one official memorably put it, the question on Bosnia was not
whether to stay in or out; it was ``choosing which waterfall we
will go over.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven mainly by Lake and the National Security Council staff,
senior officials spent the rest of the summer scurrying to come up
with a plan. In August, Holbrooke's mission began.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decision to reevaluate its Bosnia
diplomacy came not from a realization of the failure of its earlier
rudderlessness. Rather, it came from a decision few could even
remember making.
</P>
<P>
   When apprised of the details of Op-plan 40104, everyone _ from
Holbrooke to Christopher to Clinton himself _ was shocked. The
choice to commit U.S. troops to help withdraw the U.N. peacekeepers
had not been the fruit of any formal deliberative process in which
the president approved the mission through such standard means as a
decision memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was made by inertia.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dayton accord, which emerged from the haphazard process
triggered by Op-plan 40104, as Holbrooke himself conceded, was
hardly perfect. To be sure, it stopped the fighting _ which should
not be underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   But what is left of Bosnia are the tatters of a tolerant,
cosmopolitan society. Ultimately, in that war, the West lacked the
will to reverse Serb and Croat aggression, and the Bosnian-Serb
obsession with self-rule was ratified.

<P>
   On Nov. 16, 1995, Lt. Gen. Wesley Clark sat in Dayton, Ohio,
inside a PowerScene virtual-reality imaging system, using a
joystick to fly back and forth through simulated three-dimensional
scenes of the hills of Bosnia east of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   At about 11 p.m., Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic had
joined him, as well as some other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lubricated by Scotch, Milosevic and the Americans zoomed back
and forth on the computer simulation to try to carve out a path
from the besieged Bosnian capital to Gorazde, a U.N. ``safe area''
surrounded by Bosnian Serbs. In the wee hours of the morning, Clark
used crayons to draw a corridor from Sarajevo to Gorazde that was
not hopelessly indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic shook hands with Clark, who is now the supreme allied
commander in Europe, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the main American
peace negotiator, and what is variously known as the Clark Corridor
or the Scotch Road was born.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the United States had shifted from a determination not
to be dragged into the Balkans to using U.S. officials and
computers to draw Bosnia's new frontiers. Winston Churchill used to
brag about having drawn Jordan's borders on a map one afternoon;
the American general could say much the same thing about Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But America's entry lacked swagger. Rather, U.S. policymakers
came to sketch the Scotch Road with a profound sense of
ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Documents relating to this diplomacy _ including Holbrooke's
memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996 official
study of the process leading to the Dayton Accords of November 1995
_ show that American officials were painfully aware of the
shortcomings of U.S. Bosnia policy and the distance it had shifted
from the goals that Bill Clinton had espoused in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Dayton was a vast improvement over the muddle and
bloodshed that preceded it. But it was oversold.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton represented not the vindication of the liberal ideals
with which Clinton excoriated George Bush on the 1992 campaign
trail _ firm action to halt genocide, bringing war criminals to
justice, tolerance, multiethnic nation-states, liberal nationalism
and the use of international and European institutions _ but rather
a version of the chilly realpolitik that kept the Bush
administration out of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal the Clinton team helped cut edged ominously close to
partition, writing an epitaph for Bosnia as a multiethnic state and
ceding much of its territory to the Bosnian Serbs. Many of Dayton's
better provisions, especially the prosecution of war criminals and
the return of refugees, remain largely unimplemented.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Dayton required dealing with and ultimately strengthening
Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, two ethnic
nationalists whose ideology and ruthlessness are antithetical to
liberal values.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's lessons are grimly appropriate when considering the
violence in Kosovo, where Milosevic's demagoguery helped set off
the demise of Yugoslavia and which now is the latest target of his
tragic ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodshed in Kosovo is a symptom of the approach that
strengthened Milosevic and Tudjman. By doing so, Dayton plunged
Serbia deeper into ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb
soil'' of Kosovo matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the
Albanians who lived there. As such, the Kosovo crisis comes as
scant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   While the theater has shifted, and while Kosovo is part of
Serbia proper, the underlying questions are much the same. As in
1993, the Clinton administration found itself faced with a
fundamental choice. Would the United States push Milosevic to
respect autonomy, the rights of minorities and the rule of law, or
would it retreat, as it did for two years in Bosnia, by saying that
getting involved was not worth American blood?
</P>
<P>
   To win any accord in Bosnia in 1995 was not easy; Dayton took
considerable diplomatic skill and tenacity. Congress' isolationists
proved unhelpful and irresponsible, and the administration ran huge
political risks by deciding to intervene. But it ran those risks
for a reluctant realism.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the very policies that the administration balked at
in May 1993 _ using military force and firm leadership of the
Europeans _ were the ones that stopped the war in the autumn of
1995. According to Warren Zimmermann, the last U.S. ambassador to
Yugoslavia, the cost of delay was more than 100,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fuller our picture of the Dayton situation becomes, the
clearer it is that the Dayton process _ its accomplishments
notwithstanding _ is less a how-to manual for peacemakers than a
cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Clinton administration inherited a mess. Its
Republican predecessors were consummate realists. After meeting
Milosevic in Belgrade in June 1991 to warn him against
``exploitation of ethnic resentments (and) failure to respect human
rights in Kosovo'' _ complaints that could be lifted from later
headlines _ Secretary of State James A. Baker III felt he ``was
talking to a wall with a crew cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration greeted Yugoslav intransigence with a
shrug. Its basic _ and correct _ diplomatic calculus was that only
military force would deter the ambitions of Milosevic and Tudjman.
Its basic _ and incorrect _ political calculus was that such an
intervention could never be sold to the American people.

SAN FRANCISCO SUPERVISOR WANTS TO SKIP CHECKPOINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCSICO _ A member of the Board of Supervisors wants board
members granted the privilege of bypassing the security checkpoints
at City Hall _ protections that were tightened after a former
supervisor killed two men, including the mayor, in their offices
two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board members should not have to stand in long lines to
get access to this building,'' Supervisor Amos Brown said Monday
while acknowledging City Hall's past, but expressing frustration at
today's inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was not immediately embraced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a supervisor who carried a gun in here before,'' said
Supervisor Leland Yee, who doesn't want the security system
changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, San Francisco installed metal detectors at City
Hall entrances and required visitors to open purses and knapsacks
in security checks.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1978, Dan White, a disgruntled former supervisor who
was trying to get his job back, skirted security by climbing
through a basement window in City Hall. He then walked up two
flights of stairs and into the mayor's office, where he gunned down
Mayor George Moscone. White then walked down the hall to Supervisor
Harvey Milk's office and shot him dead.
</P>
<P>
   Security at City Hall was tightened even more after that.
</P>
<P>
   Board President Tom Ammiano said he could understand the
impatience Brown feels when he gets delayed entering City Hall.
``I'm sometimes inconvenienced, too, but I don't mind it, given the
history at City Hall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown argued that he and other supervisors, often running from
appointment to appointment, don't have time to stand in line at the
security checkpoints, which are at each of the building's four
entrances.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Capitol, he noted, ``No U.S. congressman is required
to go through a security checkpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, with the exception of police officers who flash a
badge and the mayor, who is flanked by bodyguards, all must go
through a metal detector and have their belongings hand-checked for
weapons by a uniformed sheriff's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a problem. We're all scheduled extremely tight,''
said Supervisor Michael Yaki. He said he had been stuck behind tour
groups of 40 or 50 people waiting to get into the building. But
will he support Brown's measure?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I support it, but I sympathize with it.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Paper or plastic?
</P>
<P>
   Baked potato or french fries?
</P>
<P>
   Liquid detergent or powdered?
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask Mary Lord. These are some of the most perplexing
decisions in her life.
</P>
<P>
   But confessing on the Internet that she was ``decisionally
challenged'' _ to the point where she flipped a coin to decide
whether to get married _ won the Hollywood woman the dubious title
of Least Decisive Person in America.
</P>
<P>
   Lord, a free-lance researcher, can't quite decide how she feels
about the iffy honor, awarded after her 250-word essay was chosen
over 4,000 others in a contest sponsored by Microsoft's MSN
Sidewalk online guide to travel, entertainment, shopping and more.
But she's pleased that it came with a round-trip airline ticket to
anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The hope of winning a trip, after all, was the reason she
entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing the depths a person will sink to for a free plane
ticket,'' Lord said, still surprised she won. ``I don't know why I
entered the contest. It was just a late-night, Internet kind of
thing, a late-night confessional moment. At some point, after
keeping my indecisiveness to myself all these years, it was
satisfying to confess, a cathartic moment.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the contest scale _ the most decisive
person, who won a trip, too _ was Ben Silverman, 23, of Bethesda,
Md., who woke up one morning two years ago and decided to quit both
college and his job. Within 24 hours, he'd started his own record
company (Meddle Records), designed a company logo, found his first
client and hired an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day taught me the value of making a decision based on
knowledge, experience, personal happiness and the idea that making
tough decisions is what ultimately leads to success,'' Silverman
wrote in his winning essay.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of whirlwind decision-making scares the daylights out
of Lord, who's regularly befuddled when trying to choose from the
10,000 or so items on the shelves in most supermarkets _ and
eternally grateful when a parking lot has only one space left,
making it unnecessary for her to pick a spot.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the day-to-day things that confuse her, or the big
moral questions. For the ordinary stuff, she's got a routine; for
the other, right weighs out over wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm indecisive, not a moron,'' she says sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Where she gets in a quandary is when confronting two things of
equal importance: whether to order prime rib or chicken in a
restaurant, whether to buy a Ford or a Toyota, whether to go to the
movies or rent a video.
</P>
<P>
   At the supermarket, she'll sometimes stand for 15 minutes in the
detergent aisle, comparing labels, or in the deli, trying to choose
from among dozens of cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many kinds, I can't decide. Sometimes I'll just
grab any old vile thing because somebody is watching. It's
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indecisiveness has dogged her all her life, perhaps taught
subtly by her father, who ``had a variety of careers'' because he
couldn't decide what he really wanted to do in life. Her mother was
the decision maker in the family, and both husband and daughter
were relieved to have somebody else take charge.
</P>
<P>
   Lord didn't realize that being wishy-washy could cause problems
until she entered school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real torture was ... those multiple choice questions,''
she recalled. ``How could you pick just one answer? I liked essay
questions where you could write what you knew.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she entered college, she began to feel that being a
fence-sitter was perfectly OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I began to be proud that I didn't want to do what
everybody else was doing. I signed up for lots of classes, knowing
that I could drop some later _ and that that gave me longer to
decide which I really wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lord lives a well-ordered life, working out of a tiny,
tidy office in a book-lined apartment reminiscent of old Hollywood.
A job delving into history suits her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the past because it's already happened,'' she said.
``No decisions to make there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord can only recall making one impulsive decision in her life _
buying a jar of mushroom tapenade in a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disgusting,'' she said. ``This taught me to hesitate.''
</P>
<P>
   And what's so bad about giving choices some extra thought
anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``In this world, a lot of bad things were done impulsively,''
Lord says. ``One of the biggest pieces of claptrap in our society
is, `He who hesitates is lost.' There ought to be people like me as
buffers. If our president had not been impulsive, you think he'd
have been fooling around with that little cookie? We're not going
to send the world catapulting into disaster. We're not going
anywhere fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with careful deliberation _ and an appeal to fate or
luck _ things don't always work out, she's learned.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among those things is her marriage to a New York rare
books dealer she had dated for several years.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed; she waffled.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed again; she hesitated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she hauled out her lucky 50-cent piece. She doesn't
know how she chose 30 as the magic number, but after 30 tosses,
``it came out overwhelmingly that I should marry him. I thought,
`Oh, what the hell.'''
</P>
<P>
   They wed. And after 13 years, she's now ``in the middle of the
divorce from hell,'' that propelled her across country so she could
be on her own again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have tossed that coin 31 times,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lord's got another big decision to make: Where will she go
on the trip she won in the contest?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hawaii,'' she says decisively, then pauses. ``Maybe New York
... or maybe not. Oh, I don't know _ someplace.''
</P>
<P>
   She's got until Dec. 31 to decide. That's National Make Up Your
Mind Day.

   LOS ANGELES _ On the average, American adults make 73 decisions
every day _ 39 at work, 11 about purchases and 23 involving home
and family, according to a survey conducted by the New Jersey-based
Opinion Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven percent of both men and women questioned said they
feel more empowered making a decision once they have all the facts.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, reflection and study becomes indecisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   And indecisiveness isn't a quest for perfection, it's fear of
making a mistake, according to British management consultant Robert
Heller in his new book, ``Making Decisions'' (DK Publishing;
$6.95). Although the 72-page volume was written as a quick lesson
for managers on how to make effective business decisions, the
advice can be applied to just about any decision-making situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accept that every decision in life has a chance of error and
that no individual or organization can make progress by being
negative,'' Heller advises. ``Your fear of making a mistake can be
eliminated completely only if you never make a decision at all.
Instead of falling into this trap, take positive steps to
strengthen your confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   To move beyond indecision in your personal life, Heller advises
the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Determine which decisions must be made quickly and which can
wait for more deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a checklist of the issues, both pro and con.
</P>
<P>
   _ Weigh each alternative and determine how likely each is to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   _ Imagine the worst that could happen and whether you could live
with that result.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pick one of the alternatives and take action to implement it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Write down your fears and throw them in the trash. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Paper or plastic?
</P>
<P>
   Baked potato or french fries?
</P>
<P>
   Liquid detergent or powdered?
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask Mary Lord. These are some of the most perplexing
decisions in her life.
</P>
<P>
   But confessing on the Internet that she was ``decisionally
challenged'' _ to the point where she flipped a coin to decide
whether to get married _ won the Hollywood woman the dubious title
of Least Decisive Person in America.
</P>
<P>
   Lord, a free-lance researcher, can't quite decide how she feels
about the iffy honor, awarded after her 250-word essay was chosen
over 4,000 others in a contest sponsored by Microsoft's MSN
Sidewalk online guide to travel, entertainment, shopping and more.
But she's pleased that it came with a round-trip airline ticket to
anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The hope of winning a trip, after all, was the reason she
entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing the depths a person will sink to for a free plane
ticket,'' Lord said, still surprised she won. ``I don't know why I
entered the contest. It was just a late-night, Internet kind of
thing, a late-night confessional moment. At some point, after
keeping my indecisiveness to myself all these years, it was
satisfying to confess, a cathartic moment.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the contest scale _ the most decisive
person, who won a trip, too _ was Ben Silverman, 23, of Bethesda,
Md., who woke up one morning two years ago and decided to quit both
college and his job. Within 24 hours, he'd started his own record
company (Meddle Records), designed a company logo, found his first
client and hired an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day taught me the value of making a decision based on
knowledge, experience, personal happiness and the idea that making
tough decisions is what ultimately leads to success,'' Silverman
wrote in his winning essay.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of whirlwind decision-making scares the daylights out
of Lord, who's regularly befuddled when trying to choose from the
10,000 or so items on the shelves in most supermarkets _ and
eternally grateful when a parking lot has only one space left,
making it unnecessary for her to pick a spot.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the day-to-day things that confuse her, or the big
moral questions. For the ordinary stuff, she's got a routine; for
the other, right weighs out over wrong.

BRING ON BALLPLAYER BILLBOARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - As the baseball season begins, Major League officials
are negotiating with the professional players association over the
placement of 1- to 1{-inch advertising patches on uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   It's an absolutely despicable idea. It's disrespectful. It's
disgusting. It's degrading. Not to ballplayers, of course, but to
fans.
</P>
<P>
   There's simply no way guys like me can read a 1-inch patch from
the third tier of Bank One Ballpark. If the league is going to put
ads on uniforms, then it must give us something we can see from the
cheap seats.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than use postage stamp-size patches, baseball teams
should simply expand upon existing uniform signage.
</P>
<P>
   Like the names stitched across the back of each player's
uniform, in big bold easy-to-read letters.
</P>
<P>
   This past off-season, our hometown Arizona Diamondbacks spent
almost $120 million on free-agent players. An astounding $52.4
million of that was part of a four-year deal to sign pitcher Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to figure it'll take a little extra advertising
revenue to pay for fat contracts like that.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, Arizona's $52 million man should be more than happy
to help raise the dough.
</P>
<P>
   He could do so simply by getting sponsorship from a big-time wax
company and having the back of his jersey changed to Randy Johnson
&AMP; Johnson. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Signage opportunities &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the first step.
</P>
<P>
   Each player provides advertisers with unique opportunities for
signage.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' all-star third baseman could team up with a
yuppie California catalog company to become Matt Williams-Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe a well-known paint manufacturer might like the sound of
Matt Sherwin-Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Some players have almost limitless po tential. Arizona's hot
young first baseman, who already looks like a walking billboard for
the American ideal, likely would land several major accounts.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he might wear a uniform with Travis Lee Jeans stitched
across the shoulders. The next, it could read Travis Lee Optical.
The next, Travis Lee Myles Transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Diamondbacks' highly paid second baseman certainly
would become the darling of local automobile dealerships,
alternately identified on his back as Jay Bell Ford, Jay Bell Road
Toyota, Jay Bell Dodge, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The team's new lead-off hitter, acquired from the Pittsburgh
Pirates, would be Tony Womack Truck.
</P>
<P>
   Or Tony WomackDonald's. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Some need flexibility &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lesser known ballplayers may be required to
demonstrate a little flexibility in the use of their names.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Omar Daal might have to settle for a shirt reading Omar
Dolly Madison Cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Or Omar Dollar Rent-A-Car.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder David Dellucci may be stuck with David Del-Lou Grubb
Chevrolet. Or David Del-Lucent Technologies. Or David Del-Luby's
Cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   There's no more shame in than that than in demanding truckloads
of cash to play a kids game.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, would it kill a pitcher making $32 million to
alter his name just a little from Todd Stottlemyre to Todd
Oscar-Meyer?
</P>
<P>
   Nor would the team's manager be exempt. I'm thinking, here, of
Starbucks Showalter.
</P>
<P>
   Clever ad salesmen could even collect double duty by simply
expanding the facility's name to Bank One Ballpark Franks.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Diamondbacks owner would be willing to set the
example, identifying himself on a uniform as Ben &AMP; Jerry Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe, Jerry Colangel-Lotions &AMP; Potions.
</P>
<P>
   Near as I can tell, the only drawback to baseball's new
advertising scheme is that, in the end, owners will find a way NOT
to use new profits to create savings for customers. Which means
we're not likely in the near future to spot a jersey reading Jerry
Colangel-Low Cost Ticket Prices. &QL;

   Cox News Service is marking the 25th anniversary of Hank Aaron's
breaking of the home run mark with a package of stories and photos.
Aaron hit his 715th home run in Atlanta on April 8, 1974, to break
Babe Ruth's record.

showing him circling the bases after the record home run, are
moving from the New York Times News Service.

   Below are stories that will move Wednesday for publication
Thursday. Note that two of the stories moved last week as part of
the Cox baseball preview.

FASTER COMPUTERS WON'T MAKE US SMARTER, MORE CREATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use b N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Bill Gates is smarter than I am. He's smarter than you
are. He ranks as the richest man in the world with a fortune in the
neighborhood of $80 billion. He didn't make it on looks.
</P>
<P>
   So when Gates writes about how to get ahead _ as he has in a new
book, ``Business (at) the Speed of Thought'' _ I'll bite.
</P>
<P>
   Velocity, he says, has become the key to success in the digital
age. Companies whose computers move information the fastest and
most efficiently will thrive; those that still communicate on paper
will perish.
</P>
<P>
   Information of all kinds should be passed through e-mail to a
wide range of people within an organization, he says. Sharing
knowledge broadly breeds a more collaborative workplace, connects
more minds and allows quicker decisionmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this seems sensible, and Gates explains how digital
technology has advantaged the likes of Boeing, Coca-Cola, General
Motors and McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates' boundless passion for faster communication annoys me.
His obsession with electronic speed comes off as self-serving as
well as overstated. Who do you suppose will sell most of the
software necessary to turbo-charge your company's information
system?
</P>
<P>
   While I was reading Gates' book, I recalled a favorite passage
from Henry David Thoreau, written 150 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Walden,'' he observed:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our
attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an
unimproved end. . . . We are in great haste to construct a magnetic
telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have
nothing important to communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoreau was wrong about the telegraph _ he saw technology moving
people farther away from nature, which he regarded as divine _ but
his larger point is well-taken. Communicating more quickly can make
people feel more connected, but it does nothing to improve the
substance or value of the information being shared.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Cantoni, a Scottsdale, Ariz., management consultant, knows
Thoreau was on to something. He conducted a study last year at a
multibillion-dollar, high-tech company and found that the average
worker wasted 43 minutes a day reading and writing unnecessary
e-mail. Based on an average salary of $53,000, he estimated the
annual cost of lost productivity at $8.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Employees griped about workloads, he said, but bragged about
their e-mail volume, as if it were a sign of their importance. Very
few made a connection between spending time on trivial e-mail and
finding it hard to get their work done. Some workers came to
believe that exchanging non-essential e-mail _ commonly to impress
others in the organization _ is vital work.
</P>
<P>
   Computers enable us to share more information with more people
with greater speed. But the more we think of ourselves as
``information processors,'' the more we may come to regard the mere
act of communicating rapidly to be as important as the content of
the messages.
</P>
<P>
   As computer networks rise in priority, so does the risk that we
will become ``tools of our tools'' _ another memorable phrase from
Thoreau.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to sound anti-computer.
</P>
<P>
   I can write, retrieve information, and correspond more quickly
with one. I admire its efficiency. Still, I'm aware that faster
isn't smarter or more creative or more insightful or more decent.
The computer gives me no better reasoning or evaluation skills. Nor
does it make me more human. Since it has the effect of reducing
face-to-face and voice-to-voice interactions, it leaves me a little
more detached from other people.
</P>
<P>
   While faster access to information can do many good things _ and
may, for a time, enable Company A to outsell Company B _ it can
never have the same impact as sound, non-computerized judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Gates says business success today is all about speed, and I say
Gates knows better. Moving information more rapidly can make a big
difference, but seldom as much of one as sharper thinking. He
understands that. There just isn't as much money in saying it. &QL;

   Craig Cantoni, a Scottsdale, Ariz., management consultant, knows
Thoreau was on to something. He conducted a study last year at a
multibillion-dollar, high-tech company and found that the average
worker wasted 43 minutes a day reading and writing unnecessary
e-mail. Based on an average salary of $53,000, he estimated the
annual cost of lost productivity at $8.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Employees griped about workloads, he said, but bragged about
their e-mail volume, as if it were a sign of their importance. Very
few made a connection between spending time on trivial e-mail and
finding it hard to get their work done. Some workers came to
believe that exchanging non-essential e-mail _ commonly to impress
others in the organization _ is vital work.
</P>
<P>
   Computers enable us to share more information with more people
with greater speed. But the more we think of ourselves as
``information processors,'' the more we may come to regard the mere
act of communicating rapidly to be as important as the content of
the messages.
</P>
<P>
   As computer networks rise in priority, so does the risk that we
will become ``tools of our tools'' _ another memorable phrase from
Thoreau.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to sound anti-computer.
</P>
<P>
   I can write, retrieve information, and correspond more quickly
with one. I admire its efficiency. Still, I'm aware that faster
isn't smarter or more creative or more insightful or more decent.
The computer gives me no better reasoning or evaluation skills. Nor
does it make me more human. Since it has the effect of reducing
face-to-face and voice-to-voice interactions, it leaves me a little
more detached from other people.
</P>
<P>
   While faster access to information can do many good things _ and
may, for a time, enable Company A to outsell Company B _ it can
never have the same impact as sound, non-computerized judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Gates says business success today is all about speed, and I say
Gates knows better. Moving information more rapidly can make a big
difference, but seldom as much of one as sharper thinking. He
understands that. There just isn't as much money in saying it. &QL;

IN THE VEIN OF NILSSON, RUFUS WAINWRIGHT'S SONGS PROPELLED BY
OFFBEAT MELODIES &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By RICK MITCHELL 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Many male songwriters of his generation might dream of becoming
the next Beck or R. Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Rufus Wainwright has no such grand ambition. He'd settle for
being known merely as ... the next George Gershwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just between you and me,'' he said, tongue only half in cheek.
``Well, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Wainwright's self-titled 1998 debut album has established him
as, if not the next Gershwin, at least the next Harry Nilsson. The
album's orchestrated, piano-based parlor songs seem like an odd fit
in the modern pop landscape of Eminem, the Offspring and 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   But Wainwright's offbeat melodies and oblique lyrics give his
music an unmistakably contemporary edge, while his elastic singing
integrates influences from opera and cabaret into the inventive
pop-rock vocal tradition of the Beatles and Brian Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The critics at Rolling Stone magazine liked the album well
enough to proclaim Wainwright the best new artist of 1998, and
Wainwright's name turned up on many other year-end best lists.
</P>
<P>
   Wainwright, 24, is the child of two acclaimed
singer-songwriters. His father is Loudon Wainwright III, who
decided that after three generations of Loudons, it was time for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' says Rufus of his unfashionable first name.
</P>
<P>
   His mother is Kate McGarrigle, of Canada's McGarrigle Sisters.
His parents divorced when he was very young, and Rufus was raised
in Montreal with his mother and his sister Martha, who sings
harmonies on the album.
</P>
<P>
   He developed a fondness for the stage, performing family variety
shows in his home, and then touring with his aunt, mother and
sister as the McGarrigle Sisters and Family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely got a rush from it and developed an addiction to
it from a very young age,'' he says. ``I really couldn't keep
myself away from being onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was about 14, Wainwright discovered opera. While
attending a private boarding school in upstate New York, he
envisioned himself as ``the little Mozart guy, playing the piano
and singing.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he often incorporates tricks learned from studying
classical music into his pop song structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like having introductions to songs, certain
modulations, and also things like counter-motion. But in the end I
try to judge it like some 15-year-old skater kid who knows nothing
about that stuff. It's great to use it, but it has to be kind of
hidden in order for it to be accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Wainwright's immersion into opera provided him with an escape
from the personal drama he experienced growing up gay. Several of
the songs on his debut album were inspired by a pair of tragic
romances _ one with a straight man who did not respond to his
affection in kind, and one with a young heroin addict who later
killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the album's release, some folks at his record label
suggested that his press kit delete any references to his sexual
orientation. Wainwright wasn't having any of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't advertise it, but I don't hide it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The same record label advisers _ who no longer work there, by
the way _ warned him that he'd never appeal to more than a gay-male
cult following. Wainwright has indeed built a cult following, but
it includes a sizable number of straight females, particularly
teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   Wainwright figures these fans must know he's gay, but it doesn't
matter to them. They can relate to what he's singing about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's really a lot of kinship between gay men and
young girls,'' he says. ``It's a male person who's not really
threatening to them, who's approachable and can teach them
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Wainwright spent two years working on his debut album. He
credits Dreamworks' executive producer Lenny Waronker with giving
him the time and space he needed to develop as an artist. He worked
with such proven co-producers as Jon Brion (Fiona Apple, Aimee
Mann), Pierre Marchand (Sarah McLachlan) and Van Dyke Parks (Brian
Wilson and the Beach Boys).
</P>
<P>
   Parks, also responsible for the album's audacious string
arrangements, was the first to point out the similarity of
Wainwright's style to that of Nilsson. While the latter is best
remembered for his Midnight Cowboy version of Fred Neil's folk song
Everybody's Talkin', he also wrote such charmingly eccentric early
'70s pop songs as Jump Into the Fire and Coconut.
</P>
<P>
   One singer-songwriter Wainwright is rarely compared to is his
father. But Rufus says both his parents have had an enormous
influence on his artistic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is really unappreciated in many ways. He sort of has
this jokey side, but he's a really serious songwriter. Some of his
material is really potent and poetic, and his stage persona is one
of the tightest acts you'll ever see. I learned a tremendous amount
from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my mother is one of the greatest women songwriters of our
times. I hold both my parents in the highest regard, and feel like
I'll never quite be as good as they are in certain ways. There will
always be the Loudon thing and the Kate thing, but there's also the
Rufus thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And how would he prefer to see ``the Rufus thing'' described?
</P>
<P>
   ``Say that I'm one of the most beautiful people of the century,
the Jackie Kennedy of gay men. Something completely moronic like
that. I've said everything else.'' &QL;

SPRING MEANS IT'S CALADIUM TIME 
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By KATHY HUBER 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Is it time to plant caladiums? Do I need to dig them up at the
end of the season? &QL; 
_ M.B.H., Houston &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A: &UR;  &LR; The holiday calendar can be an easy bulb-planting reminder.
Around Easter each year, it's time to purchase caladium tubers.
Soon after, when soil and air temperatures are in the 70-degree
range, we plant. Tubers planted in too cold a soil are prone to
rot.
</P>
<P>
   While some caladium varieties, such as the strap-leaf types, are
more sun-tolerant, we usually associate these members of the aroid
family with shade and use them to brighten and color the shadier
areas of the garden with their fancy foliage. The heart-shaped, or
fancy-leaf, caladiums mature to 20 inches in height, and those
planted in masses make a good show in the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Look for firm tubers as you shop for caladiums, or buy plants
when available if you want a more immediate impact.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the soil well before you plant. Caladiums thrive in a
well-draining, organically enriched, slightly acidic soil. Add a
little sharp sand to improve drainage if necessary. Mix a little
bone meal or superphosphate in the soil around each tuber. Use
superphosphate if squirrels have a tendency to dig up your efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Plant caladium tubers about a foot apart and 1{ times as deep as
the thickness of the tuber. Pick the flowers as they appear. It's
colorful foliage you're after. Keep the soil moist through the
summer. Watch for snails and slugs during rainy periods.
</P>
<P>
   Caladiums make decorative container subjects on a porch or
patio.
</P>
<P>
   Energetic gardeners remove the tubers in October when the tubers
stop producing new foliage. They dust the tubers with sulfur to
discourage fungal problems and store them in a flat of dry material
in a well-ventilated, dry area where temperatures are in the 55- to
65-degree range. Some gardeners simply hang the tubers in a mesh
bag in the garage. Watch for any decay.
</P>
<P>
   Most caladiums return the following year, although my experience
is that they are smaller. Fertilization helps. I'll admit I don't
lift the tubers; I just add new ones as I want them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Q: As in many subdivisions, our builder planted two trees in
the front yard, a pine and an oak. Each tree is approximately 15 to
20 feet tall and has the same northwest sun exposure. I put a
6-inch raised bed under each tree. Whatever I plant under the pine
does well, but I can't get anything to grow in the bed under the
oak. Everything begins to look either stunted or weak. We've tried
changing the pH, (currently it is neutral), increasing the
fertilizer and planting different flowers. Do you have any
suggestions? &QL; 
_ M.Y., Houston &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Except for the `Katie' ruellia, the flowers you listed do
best with sun. The `Katie' works in sun or shade. I'm not sure how
much light your flowers are receiving, but the canopy of your live
oak could be blocking the light required for bushier, stronger
plants that bloom well. Does the pine cast shade, too, or block
sidelight from hitting the area beneath the oak? Also, the roots of
an oak are fairly close to the soil's surface, and they could be
robbing your plants of moisture. Check the soil to determine if it
is too dry.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel inadequate sunlight is a problem, go with more
shade-tolerant plants. Summer annuals that take shade include
impatiens and torenia, or wishbone flower, which grows about a foot
tall and often is covered in cupped blooms that may be white-edged
in blue or rose or blue-edged in a darker blue. Peacock gingers are
only inches tall, with beautifully marked foliage. These perennials
go completely dormant in winter, but return in mid to late spring.
They produce flat, iridescent lavender blooms all summer. Persian
shield is another foliage plant for bright shade. Prune to promote
bushiness. You could also brighten the bed with caladiums. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Azaleas: Don't wait too long after azaleas have finished
flowering to prune to shape and fertilize. The shrubs will set buds
for next spring during the summer months.

   Miracle of the monarch: H.P. of Sugar Land recommends butterfly
weed as an Easter present. She enjoys watching the life cycle of
the monarch butterfly at home by growing butterfly weed (Asclespia)
in her garden. The plant is the host for the butterfly. Mother
monarchs lay their eggs on the butterfly weed. These hatch into
caterpillars that eat the leaves, but the foliage grows back in
short order. The caterpillars then spin their cocoons, and before
long sleepy butterflies awaken and the life cycle begins again. &QL;

GROUP SAYS ANTI-GAY VIOLENCE UP IN 1998 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Violent crimes against gays rose last year,
according to statistics released Tuesday by a San Francisco
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The annual nationwide report of the National Coalition of Anti-
Violence Programs, culled from organizations in 16 cities, shows
that although there has been a 4 percent decline in 1998 in the
total number of crimes against gays _ including harassment,
intimidation and other nonphysical incidents _ the number of
anti-gay murders rose from 14 in 1997 to 33 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Serious assaults also grew 12 percent, including a 108 percent
increase in the number of victims requiring hospitalization. The
number of weapons used in the assaults grew in tandem, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 78 percent increase in the number of firearms used;
a 47 percent rise in bats, clubs and blunt objects; 150 percent
increase in use of vehicles; a 133 percent rise in the use of ropes
and restraints; and a 13 percent rise in knives and sharp objects.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a report issued Tuesday by the San Francisco
Community United Against Violence mirrored the national findings.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California in 1998, there were 434 reported victims
in 395 incidents, down from the 517 victims in 402 incidents
reported the year before. During some of the crimes, more than one
victim was targeted in the physical or verbal assaults, according
to the advocacy agency for gays, lesbians and bisexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overall decline, however, the number of physical
assaults went up, from 20 percent in 1997 to 37 percent. Also up,
by 80 percent, were reported incidents of sexual assault and rape.
</P>
<P>
   Two Northern Californians were murdered, including Brian Wilmes,
45, who was killed by a punch outside a San Francisco gay bar in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the statistics came on the heels of Monday's
guilty plea by Russell Henderson, 21, one of two men charged with
killing Matthew Shepard, a 22-year-old homosexual in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson pleaded guilty to felony murder and kidnapping. He
faces two life sentences without parole, but his plea spares him
from facing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   His co-defendant, Aaron McKinney, 21, still faces a trial.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are accused of posing as homosexuals, luring the
5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar, kidnapping and
pistol-whipping him, and leaving him for dead tied to a wooden
fence outside Laramie.

<P>
   The United States, other governments and international
organizations such as NATO are increasingly being called upon to
influence, intervene or broker solutions to conflicts within
states, triggered by ethnic or cultural differences.
</P>
<P>
   Often these conflicts pose a substantial threat to global peace
and human life.
</P>
<P>
   All over the world, after the rush of post-Cold War secessions,
dissatisfied groups are emboldened to seek independence. Many have
decided that wars of national liberation are more likely to garner
meaningful outside support than low-key appeals for minority rights
or autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   A more clearly formulated set of international norms may
discourage at least some of the more questionable claims and the
violence that so often accompanies them.
</P>
<P>
   Such norms are not likely to satisfy partisans who extol the
virtues of yesterday's ``national'' identity. Even so, recognizing
and accommodating opposing rights is the only way the world can
respond to clashing demands in a politically and morally principled
manner.
</P>
<P>
   When responding to claims of self-determination, protecting
basic human rights should be the foremost goal. Guidelines for
decision-making must be clearly articulated so that responses can
be defended against charges of selectivity and hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Human-rights norms are widely accepted and give legitimacy to
American and U.N.-based actions. Not only are humanitarian ideals
broadly supported and understood by the public, but U.S. law
requires that human rights be a primary foreign-policy concern.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a basic factor in formulating responses should be whether
or not a particular action is likely to promote the rights of all
the people. Cultural, linguistic and religious rights must be
respected, and neither minority nor majority should seek to impose
its values on the other.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, this requires the guarantee of individual
rights to free expression, assembly, association and religion. In
other cases, innovative solutions _ affirmative action, government
representation, devolution of powers or support for ethnic cultures
_ must be devised to make equality in fact match equality in law.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is also important to reject the notion that every
ethnically or culturally distinct people, nation or group has an
automatic right to its own state _ or that ethnically homogeneous
states are desirable. For in an environment where human rights are
respected, a global system of states based on ethnicity or
historical claims is clearly unachievable.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be ``trapped'' minorities, no matter how
carefully boundaries are drawn, except in the smallest or most
isolated environments. Ethnically based states almost inevitably
lead to claims of ethnic superiority from the new majority and a
cultural rigidity that creates problems for new minorities. At
their very worst, newly created ethnic states may tolerate or
encourage killings and ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   In a new nation, a majority population need not ignore its
culture or the requirements of a modern state. Some
``state-building'' _ for example, with respect to language or a
common legal system _ may be necessary to develop the
administrative and economic ties that bind communities together.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural or ethnic minorities in a particular territory must
accept their minority status and not expect their beliefs and
customs to be reflected at the national level to the same extent as
those of the majority population.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't mean that a minority need submit to a majority
that seeks to destroy cultures that deviate from the dominant
model.
</P>
<P>
   In general, it is wise to reject the notion that there is a
legal right of secession. This principle will properly force
nationalists to abandon their claim that ``we are a nation and
therefore have a right to a state.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, central governments should no longer be
allowed to hide behind the facade of national unity without
explaining how minority rights are genuinely being protected.
</P>
<P>
   In what instances should secession be supported by the
international community?
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; When massive human-rights violations, approaching the scale
of genocide, are being perpetrated. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If there is no likelihood of change in the attitude of the
central government, or if the majority population supports the
repression, secession may be the only effective remedy for the
besieged group. Although support for secession raises serious
issues regarding possible outside intervention, it is justifiable
if the underlying abuses are sufficiently grave.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; When reasonable demands for local self-government or minority
rights have been arbitrarily rejected by a central government, even
without large-scale violence. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This exception, however, would come into play only when minimal
demands are rejected. It does not mean that the United States or
the United Nations should substitute their judgment of what is fair
or politically reasonable for that of the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1992 U.N. General Assembly declaration on
minority rights, states must ``protect the existence'' of
minorities, granting the latter the right ``to participate
effectively in cultural, religious, social, economic and public
life.'' However, it neither mandates the scope of that
participation nor grants minorities a veto over all actions that
might affect them.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and others should encourage the resolution of
claims to self-determination by means short of secession, except
when the parties agree to the division of a state. Statehood is not
necessary, however, to guarantee the legitimate rights of groups
and individuals to protect and promote their culture, language,
traditions and rights.
</P>
<P>
   The fulfillment of goals such as increased political and
economic power is more legitimately sought through the normal
democratic process. Potential mediators and advisers will need to
become familiar with a host of arrangements such as power-sharing,
devolution, federalism, confederation, territorial and functional
autonomy, self-government and special participation rights for
minorities or regional groups.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure equity, minorities in a new state that was founded to
preserve ethnic or cultural homogeneity should be granted the same
rights of self-determination that were asserted by the majority
population. Legitimate self-determination can only be exercised on
the basis of the consent of all involved parties, not just those
who wish to separate.
</P>
<P>
   If neither international law nor politics offers a mechanism
through which minorities trapped within a new ethnic state may
rejoin their former state or, at least, create an autonomous region
within their new home, rejection of the new borders by force may be
seen as the only alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, redressing historical grievances or responding to
contemporary dissatisfactions cannot justify the dispossession of
members of ethnic minorities who now live in the territory in
question and whose ancestors may have lived there for generations.
No group can claim exclusive control over a territory forever.
</P>
<P>
   It is morally impossible to decide which individuals should be
forced to choose between emigrating or remaining under ``alien''
domination and which other groups should be rewarded with
ethnically based political power in the form of a new state.
</P>
<P>
   If our concern is with peoples rather than territories, there is
no reason to regard existing administrative or ``republic''
boundaries within states as sacrosanct. In most cases, the best way
to determine the wishes of those in a new state would be through a
series of plebiscites to redraw what were formerly internal
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   These should not be used in haste or to create enclaves that are
not viable. A peaceful acceptance of the possibility of altering
borders might be a useful precondition for recognition of a new
state whenever much of the population appears at odds with the new
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when armed conflict does occur, responsibility for war
crimes and crimes against humanity must be distinguished from the
underlying political agendas of all sides.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and others should continue to support
international accountability for such war criminals, even if the
problems of the prosecutions are only too evident from the halting
work of the ongoing U.N. tribunals on Rwanda and the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, prosecution of war criminals should not be linked
to the merits of self-determination claims. A principled response
to claims asserted before the onslaught of armed conflict cannot
depend on whether war crimes are committed after the conflict
begins.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will necessarily deter highly motivated groups or
power-hungry individuals from seeking independence, whether for
honest motives or ulterior ones. But the present lack of both
normative and moral clarity may be responsible for at least some of
the increased separatist violence of the post-Cold War years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   This Friday, somewhere in the world, a historic baby will start
its journey into life. For then _ the 266 days of an average
pregnancy away from the turn of the year _ the first child of the
new millennium will be conceived.
</P>
<P>
   No one will know who or where it is, as it grows towards its
date with destiny spinning gently in its mother's womb. It may be
born rich or poor, male or female, black, brown, yellow or white _
in circumstances as diverse as the wide world itself.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, each time zone will have its own millennium baby, as
the chimes of the new year sound progressively over the spinning
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Industrialized countries, however, are likely to assume an equal
starting point, recognizing the first baby born after its
particular midnight as the landmark child.
</P>
<P>
   They will certainly mount a frenzied search to discover its
identity. Hospital records will be scrutinized and compared to find
out which baby has pipped its rivals to the post.
</P>
<P>
   And _ supposing it survives the lights going out and the
hospital machinery failing, when the millennium bug strikes _ the
chosen child is likely to live with a distinction for life.
</P>
<P>
   But it almost certainly won't be the first. The real millennium
baby is most likely to be born with no clock in sight, with no
record of its time of birth. It may not even live long enough to be
given a name.
</P>
<P>
   For there are nine chances in 10 that it will arrive in the
Third World, rather than in the West _ and four in 10 that it will
be born into extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Its life will differ dramatically depending on how it does in
the lottery of birth, for the gap between the world's richest and
poorest has never been wider.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthiest fifth of the people of the globe are 82 times
better off than the poorest fifth, and account for 88 percent of
the consumption of goods and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Computer ``lapware'' is being developed for the under-ones in
rich countries, while even those lucky enough to go to school in
poor countries often lack books and pencils.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet throws wide the horizons of the wealthy minority,
while more than half the world's people have never even made a
phone call.
</P>
<P>
   New medical techniques are likely soon to be saving American
babies born as early as 19 weeks after conception, while a third of
the children of Niger and Sierra Leone still die before they are
five.
</P>
<P>
   And if the millennium baby does enjoy material prosperity, it
may yet be lonely and unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   On present trends, an American girl will, before long, have more
Barbies than classmates. And alienation increases as family life
shrinks and social and commercial pressures grow: one in every 10
American teenagers has attempted suicide. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 475. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Below are the very diverse prospects facing the millennium baby
if he or she is born into five different circumstances, from the
hopelessness of the AIDS pandemic now sweeping through Africa, to
the comfort of the wealthy few.
</P>
<P>
   The baby, given a chance, might decide that, at these odds, it
would rather not play.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AIDS BABY: Every year more than 600,000 babies are born HIV
positive _ about 90 percent of them in Africa. In some maternity
wards in that continent one in every four newborns starts life with
the virus. And AIDS is ruining children's lives, even when they
were not infected in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   By next year one in every five children in nine African
countries will have been orphaned by the disease. Deprived of
parental protection, their meager inheritance is often seized by
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Stigmatized by the disease, they frequently end up on the
streets. And even when other families do take them in, they are
often treated harshly.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all AIDS orphans are stunted by malnutrition, and they
are less likely to go to school and more likely to be abused than
other children.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POOREST BABY: One in every four babies is born into extreme
poverty, to families trying to subsist on an income of less than a
dollar a day. Half of all the world's poorest people are children,
and there are more destitute babies than ever before. Most of them
live on the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, 12 million die every year from malnutrition and
preventable diseases before they are five. Those who survive
usually grow up stunted both in mind and body from hunger. Their
growth will be sapped by constant bouts of diarrhea, contracted
from having to drink dirty water.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than two-thirds of them will start school; fewer than
two-thirds of those who do will stay long enough to learn to read
or write. Almost everywhere the baby's prospects will be even worse
if it is born a girl.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEVELOPING WORLD BABY: Some babies born to the world's poorest
families will have relatively good prospects, for they will live in
countries which have paid particular attention to primary education
and to promoting the health of children and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Women are 27 times less likely to die in childbirth in Sri Lanka
than in the Ivory Coast, though the two countries have similar per
capita incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Children are only slightly more likely to die in infancy in Cuba
than in the U.S., though Cuba is 24 times poorer.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe almost doubled the proportion of its children starting
school during the 1980s, at a time when national wealth was
actually shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   And countries that have paid particular attention to educating
girls have seen infant deaths and population growth fall, and life
expectancy and economic growth increase.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POOR WESTERN BABY: Last week official Treasury figures showed
that two in every five British babies are born poor; a quarter of
children never escape poverty. It is much the same in the United
States where nearly half of all children live either below the
poverty line or not far above it, and a quarter have difficulty
getting all the food they need.
</P>
<P>
   Inequalities are particularly sharp in Anglo-Saxon countries but
many children live in poverty, even as their contemporaries grow
wealthier, in nearly all rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everywhere children from ethnic minorities are the worst
off; a baby born at the millennium in the United States can expect
to live nine years less if it is black than if it is white, and
less long than an elder sibling born in 1995. A black American
child is twice as likely to live in poverty as a white one.

   &UR; PROSPEROUS BABY: Fewer than one in every 10 babies is born into
prosperity to relatively comfortable families in rich countries or
to the wealthy in poor ones. They will be better off than ever.
</P>
<P>
   An American millennium baby can expect to live nearly twice as
long as one born in 1900, and to grow a full 3 inches taller.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian or Swiss baby now has twice the life expectancy of a
Zambian or Ukrainian one. It will be much more likely than its
parents to get a white-collar job, and, in most countries, to have
a much bigger house.
</P>
<P>
   The average American home is nearly 2,000 square feet, a 25
percent increase since 1977; big family rooms are now about the
size of the 1900 average house. And the rich-country babies'

enter more and more homes. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   This Friday, somewhere in the world, a historic baby will start
its journey into life. For then _ the 266 days of an average
pregnancy away from the turn of the year _ the first child of the
new millennium will be conceived.
</P>
<P>
   No one will know who or where it is, as it grows towards its
date with destiny spinning gently in its mother's womb. It may be
born rich or poor, male or female, black, brown, yellow or white _
in circumstances as diverse as the wide world itself.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, each time zone will have its own millennium baby, as
the chimes of the new year sound progressively over the spinning
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Industrialized countries, however, are likely to assume an equal
starting point, recognizing the first baby born after its
particular midnight as the landmark child.
</P>
<P>
   They will certainly mount a frenzied search to discover its
identity. Hospital records will be scrutinized and compared to find
out which baby has pipped its rivals to the post.
</P>
<P>
   And _ supposing it survives the lights going out and the
hospital machinery failing, when the millennium bug strikes _ the
chosen child is likely to live with a distinction for life.
</P>
<P>
   But it almost certainly won't be the first. The real millennium
baby is most likely to be born with no clock in sight, with no
record of its time of birth. It may not even live long enough to be
given a name.
</P>
<P>
   For there are nine chances in 10 that it will arrive in the
Third World, rather than in the West _ and four in 10 that it will
be born into extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Its life will differ dramatically depending on how it does in
the lottery of birth, for the gap between the world's richest and
poorest has never been wider.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthiest fifth of the people of the globe are 82 times
better off than the poorest fifth, and account for 88 percent of
the consumption of goods and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Computer ``lapware'' is being developed for the under-ones in
rich countries, while even those lucky enough to go to school in
poor countries often lack books and pencils.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet throws wide the horizons of the wealthy minority,
while more than half the world's people have never even made a
phone call.
</P>
<P>
   New medical techniques are likely soon to be saving American
babies born as early as 19 weeks after conception, while a third of
the children of Niger and Sierra Leone still die before they are
five.
</P>
<P>
   And if the millennium baby does enjoy material prosperity, it
may yet be lonely and unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   On present trends, an American girl will, before long, have more
Barbies than classmates. And alienation increases as family life
shrinks and social and commercial pressures grow: one in every 10
American teenagers has attempted suicide. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 475. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Below are the very diverse prospects facing the millennium baby
if he or she is born into five different circumstances, from the
hopelessness of the AIDS pandemic now sweeping through Africa, to
the comfort of the wealthy few.
</P>
<P>
   The baby, given a chance, might decide that, at these odds, it
would rather not play.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AIDS BABY: Every year more than 600,000 babies are born HIV
positive _ about 90 percent of them in Africa. In some maternity
wards in that continent one in every four newborns starts life with
the virus. And AIDS is ruining children's lives, even when they
were not infected in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   By next year one in every five children in nine African
countries will have been orphaned by the disease. Deprived of
parental protection, their meager inheritance is often seized by
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Stigmatized by the disease, they frequently end up on the
streets. And even when other families do take them in, they are
often treated harshly.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all AIDS orphans are stunted by malnutrition, and they
are less likely to go to school and more likely to be abused than
other children.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POOREST BABY: One in every four babies is born into extreme
poverty, to families trying to subsist on an income of less than a
dollar a day. Half of all the world's poorest people are children,
and there are more destitute babies than ever before. Most of them
live on the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, 12 million die every year from malnutrition and
preventable diseases before they are five. Those who survive
usually grow up stunted both in mind and body from hunger. Their
growth will be sapped by constant bouts of diarrhea, contracted
from having to drink dirty water.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than two-thirds of them will start school; fewer than
two-thirds of those who do will stay long enough to learn to read
or write. Almost everywhere the baby's prospects will be even worse
if it is born a girl.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEVELOPING WORLD BABY: Some babies born to the world's poorest
families will have relatively good prospects, for they will live in
countries which have paid particular attention to primary education
and to promoting the health of children and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Women are 27 times less likely to die in childbirth in Sri Lanka
than in the Ivory Coast, though the two countries have similar per
capita incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Children are only slightly more likely to die in infancy in Cuba
than in the U.S., though Cuba is 24 times poorer.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe almost doubled the proportion of its children starting
school during the 1980s, at a time when national wealth was
actually shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   And countries that have paid particular attention to educating
girls have seen infant deaths and population growth fall, and life
expectancy and economic growth increase.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POOR WESTERN BABY: Last week official Treasury figures showed
that two in every five British babies are born poor; a quarter of
children never escape poverty. It is much the same in the United
States where nearly half of all children live either below the
poverty line or not far above it, and a quarter have difficulty
getting all the food they need.
</P>
<P>
   Inequalities are particularly sharp in Anglo-Saxon countries but
many children live in poverty, even as their contemporaries grow
wealthier, in nearly all rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everywhere children from ethnic minorities are the worst
off; a baby born at the millennium in the United States can expect
to live nine years less if it is black than if it is white, and
less long than an elder sibling born in 1995. A black American
child is twice as likely to live in poverty as a white one.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PROSPEROUS BABY: Fewer than one in every 10 babies is born into
prosperity to relatively comfortable families in rich countries or
to the wealthy in poor ones. They will be better off than ever.
</P>
<P>
   An American millennium baby can expect to live nearly twice as
long as one born in 1900, and to grow a full 3 inches taller.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian or Swiss baby now has twice the life expectancy of a
Zambian or Ukrainian one. It will be much more likely than its
parents to get a white-collar job, and, in most countries, to have
a much bigger house.
</P>
<P>
   The average American home is nearly 2,000 square feet, a 25
percent increase since 1977; big family rooms are now about the
size of the 1900 average house. And the rich-country babies'
horizons are expanding dramatically, as computers and the Internet
enter more and more homes. &QL;

STAYING SAFE IN THE WILD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., April 11) 
(jt) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When injuries happen on trips in the wild, or even on casual
outdoor vacations, a case can sometimes be made for blaming the
victim. Failing to wear a helmet on a bike, skipping vaccinations
before going camping, throwing stones at a bear, jumping off a boat
in the middle of a lake: Such actions, or inactions, are
invitations to danger.
</P>
<P>
   While eco-tourism and adventure travel in remote parts of the
world have grown exponentially in the last decade, safety is also a
serious concern on familiar ground.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Parks and recreation areas offer a case in
point. Deaths from injuries in the areas supervised by the National
Park Service have not grown faster than the use of the parks, but
the major causes are shifting, and park experts are concerned that
the use of alcohol may be creating a rise in preventable deaths. In
last year's 146 fatal injuries, the major category was
water-related deaths, and personal watercraft played a big role
here. Nine years ago, auto crashes ranked first. Elaine Sevy, a
spokeswoman for the National Park Service, said that the service is
increasingly concerned about people who arrive in the parks and
consume alcohol before engaging in a potentially hazardous
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Mead National Recreation Area on the Colorado River in
Nevada and Arizona recorded 25 accidental deaths last year.
Twenty-two were water-related: 9 were injuries involving boats, 3
were drownings associated with boats and 10 were other drownings.
In 1997, there were only 12 accidental deaths here.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the nine ``boating'' fatalities involved personal
watercraft like Jet Skis. According to Karen Whitney, a spokeswoman
for the recreation area, managed by the National Park Service, one
person ran into the shoreline at night while under the influence of
alcohol; another ran over and killed a swimmer; one was riding a
watercraft that stalled and his son, behind him on another one ,
struck the father, killing him, and the last left his watercraft to
go swimming and was presumed drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the National Park Service reported 6,638 search and
rescue efforts in 1998. Of the 146 deaths, in all areas under the
jurisdiction of the service, The water-related total was 56 _ of
which the Lake Mead area, with its 9 million to 10 million visitors
a year, had the biggest portion. Of the total in the parks, 20
deaths involved boats, including personal watercraft, and 36 were
drownings. Motor vehicle fatalities numbered 39. The next major
category was falls, mostly while climbing, which caused 29 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers are low when measured against the 287 million
people who visited the places managed by the Park Service. But Dick
Powell, risk manager for public safety in the Park Service, says
the boom in personal watercraft is causing a significant increase
in water-related accidents and that curbs on such craft were being
discussed. Wanting `the Real Thing'
</P>
<P>
   At Lake Mead, Ms. Whitney said, the 1998 total of 25 deaths
represented a particularly bad year; in 1997 only 12 were recorded.
``It jumps up every other year,'' she said. ``People read the news
of the deaths and are careful for a year. Then we get a new group
of people who don't know, and the total rises again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous situations have an allure for some people. Dr. William
Davis, the former head of safety for the Park Service, said: ``When
you challenge nature, you are a risk seeker. You want that edge,
that happiness. You want those endorphins to run around.''
</P>
<P>
   At Grand Canyon National Park, fatalities can be attributed to
many causes, including suicide. According to Sandra H. Perl from
the superintendent's office, in 1998, there were 346 search and
rescue efforts and seven fatalities: three falls from the rim, two
suicides, one probable drowning and one death from an unknown
cause. Fatalities over the last eight years do not vary much,
except for 1995, when 22 died, 8 in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ms. Perl said that after 1996, when a record number of
search and rescue efforts were required _ 482 _ the park began
preventive efforts, putting rangers on the trail to counsel hikers
about where they might enjoy going and what they were able to
manage.
</P>
<P>
   All U.S. National Parks make efforts to enhance the safety of
visitors engaging in outdoor activities such as rafting, hiking and
climbing, biking or camping out. All outfitters with concessions to
operate in or into the parks must have minimum liability insurance
of $500,000 per occurrence, according to Judy Jennings of the
concessions department. They are also required to give safety
lectures.
</P>
<P>
   An ``acknowledgment of risk'' form is also given to the visitor
to sign, she said. It usually notes the inherent risks in the
activity _ that boats can turn over, people can fall out, hikers
can stumble, wild animals can attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wake-up call, from mosquitos to white-water hazards,''
Ms. Jennings said. In no way, however, does the form absolve the
operators of liability, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the parks, this may not be true. I have seen and signed
forms that said I held the operator free of liability, even in the
event of negligence. Except in Alaska, these waivers do not usually
stand up in court against evidence of gross negligence, but they do
warn the consumer to possible dangers in the same way that those
used in the park do.
</P>
<P>
   If the operator gives a skimpy safety lecture and the equipment
looks insecure, ask to see the releases before you get under way,
or before you are in a remote area where access is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Medical Concerns
</P>
<P>
   Many dangers of disease can be avoided or reduced through proper
medical preparation. Leaving aside shots needed before going
abroad, which depend on the destination, there are inoculations
that families should have before any trip, including one to a
national park, or for children, a camp vacation. Dr. Elaine Jong,
founder and co-director of the Travel and Tropical Medicine Service
at the University of Washington in Seattle, says that parents of
children going off to camp should be particularly vigilant about
shots. Children will be in close contact with many others and will
be eating food prepared by others in places where emergency help
may not be around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Jong said that tetanus and diphtheria shots should be routine
for families involved in outdoor activities. Adults should get
boosters every 10 years. Hepatitis A vaccine is particularly
important for children, Jong said, and may be free in many states
to children under 18.
</P>
<P>
   The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is usually given to very
young children, but the measles shot should be boosted, she said. A
booster should be given once in adult life to people born in 1957
or later. ``We like to see the second dose completed before primary
school,'' Jong said, ``and even if the children are going camping
some place no more exotic than Fort Lauderdale.''
</P>
<P>
   Chickenpox is so contagious that unless people know they are
immune through having had the disease, the course of two shots
should be given. Healthy people over 13 who have not been immunized
or had chickenpox should consider this immunization because the
disease is becoming more common in this age group.
</P>
<P>
   Jong recommends the new Lyme disease vaccine for travelers over
15 going hiking or camping in areas of frequent tranmission. This
is an expensive shot; at the Traveler's Medical Service in New York
City, it costs $78. Though young children are principal victims,
tests on children under 15 are not complete.
</P>
<P>
   Jong stressed modifying behavior rather than relying totally on
a vaccine, particularly one, like the Lyme vaccine, that is not
believed to confer 100 percent immunity. ``It is important to wear
appropriate clothing,'' she said, ``and to soak clothing in the
insecticide permethrin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a behavioral aspect to travel health, beyond the
vaccines,'' Jong said.
</P>
<P>
   That goes double for safety.

<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; Another sign it's the end of the millennium: discussing
the joys and tribulations of single fatherhood with Hugh Hefner,
the Big Bunnyman himself.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Mr. Playboy himself is making the most of it now that
he's thoroughly disensconced from holy matrimony, reviving his
uber-bachelordom and still making time on family night for cartoons
with his boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having fought the wars and being around for the
parade,'' Hefner said. ``What's happening now is the celebration
after fighting the wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Being Daddy, it turns out, is pretty great the second time
around for Hef. And being a single daddy about town the second time
around is even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a revelation,'' said Hefner, in black silk PJs and
red silk bathrobe, over a large coffee table with built-in
backgammon boards in the small, wood-paneled library at one end of
the Playboy Mansion West in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles.
``There were so many young people waiting for me to come out and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Play he has in recent months, usually with pretty blondes in
tow. It's an image, replicated in endless celebrity shots of him
out on the town, that seems to play well with many younger people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got through doing an interview with a 24-year-old guy
from Details (magazine) who assures me I'm their idol and hero,''
he says. ``They feel to some extent as if they missed that
(swinging '60s and '70s) era.''
</P>
<P>
   Hef says he can identify with that youthful angst after growing
up in the Depression era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the (Roaring) '20s, I felt like I had missed out on
the party,'' Hefner said. ``It was like arriving at the party on
Sunday morning. I think the kids today relate in some way to that.
They feel they missed the party that to some extent I, personally,
and the Playboy Mansion represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of parties, Playboy has just issued ``Playmate Pajama
Party.'' The video is part gamboling hotties, part history lesson,
part Robin Leach-esque look _ for the first time ever _ at some of
Hef's more notorious inner sancta at the Mansion, including his
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Hef's not totally enthralled with the video: ``I had relatively
little creative input other than directions I gave (the director)
at the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Those directions: Take your standard
naked-Playboy-models-running-around video, let 'em explore the
mansion so you can show off the place to a curious universe, and
sprinkle in some vintage video to give the big house some sort of
historical context.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of a more general Hef history binge, excavating his
and his creation's past in the video and a series of foot-crushing
coffee-table tomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am at a point in life and at an age where one holds
on to what one has,'' Hefner said. ``Now we're at the end of the
century, and everyone is looking back.''
</P>
<P>
   Verdict on the video: Hef's got a messy bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see that bedroom is lived in,'' he cracks. Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not surprising for a man whose fashion sense can be
summed up as pajamas and bathrobes 24/7. But aside from the
accumulated geegaws, gimcracks and knickknacks of 40-some years of
very public private life strewn over nearly every horizontal
surface, there are the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Literally thousands of them, recorded with near-curatorial zeal
on professional-grade }-inch videotape, of the dozens of classic
films broadcast on satellite and cable channels hour after hour
after hour every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to miss them,'' he says. ``Being raised in a
typical Midwestern Methodist home, I escaped into fantasies'' being
spun by Hollywood, Hefner said, citing Busby Berkeley musicals and
Frank Capra confections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the films that created the image of America,'' he
says. ``It also defines who people want to be when they grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Pajama Party'' doesn't do his collection justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you don't see in the video is the carefully color-coded,
keyworded, cataloged library of films upstairs,'' Hefner says.
``All those tapes in the bedroom are waiting to see if they make
the cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Next observation: He's got some cutting to do.
</P>
<P>
   Hef devotes Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights to movie viewing
_ complete with his preshow commentaries for the group of invited
friends who crowd his large movie viewing room in the mansion's
north end.
</P>
<P>
   His all-time fave: ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   He still shows the Bogey and Bergman classic annually, most
recently because ``the girls I'm seeing now had never seen it. To
see it with someone you care about is really wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Um, yes, but Hef, what do you mean ``girls''?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Hefner is dating three women at once, including a pair
of ``nice, Catholic'' twins from back in Chicago who are moving
here in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to come out, come out with a vengeance,''
Hefner says with more than a hint of self-satisfaction in his
still-toothy grin. ``I'm a guy who always believed in knocking down
the stereotypes of more conservatively bound members of the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. Three simultaneous girlfriends brings up another question.
Viagra?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure,'' Hefner gushes. ``I think I was the first kid on
the block to get Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of procreative urges, a statistical oddity: Hef's 73rd
birthday is Friday, the optimal day to conceive a child to be born
on Jan. 1, 2000. Does Hef love this? He loves this.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a long way from last decade, which nearly took the hop
out of his rabbit permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '80s and early '90s were very repressive, with Reagan and
Bush, the Moral Majority, the Meese Commission (on Pornography),''
Hefner said. It literally almost killed him.
</P>
<P>
   The Playboy empire was teetering financially, while the era's
moralists condemned Hef's out-of-step values. Even worse, director
Peter Bogdanovich wrote a scathing book about the murder of former
girlfriend and Playmate Dorothy Stratten that heavily criticized
Hefner's role in her rise and tragic fall.
</P>
<P>
   He blames that array of attacks for causing a 1985 stroke. &UR;  &LR; His
marriage to former ``Playmate for a Lifetime'' Kimberly Conrad four
years later was, as he said, a search for a ``safe harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also meant, ironically, marrying ``into a situation not
unlike my parents' marriage,'' he said. ``I put all of my hopes and
dreams into a more traditional lifestyle. The children were very
much a part of it. What was missing was the romantic part. We kind
of drifted apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefner and Conrad split about a year ago, at her suggestion. She
now lives in the next estate over and has the couple's two boys
with her most of the time, though he said he sees them ``nearly
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hef's term for his renewed bachelorhood: ``The unexpected
epilogue. I not only survived, but prevailed. It's never been
better than it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Hef is trying other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of the marriage, one couldn't simply return to what
they had done before, which is simply throwing parties,'' Hef said.
He had to venture out into the world a bit from his Holmby Hills
cloister. And venture he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince said to party like it's 1999. Well, it !ital!is!off!,
and that's what we're doing,'' Hefner said.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Valentine's Day party, the recent ``Boogie Nights''
party, the Midsummer Night's Dream party, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   And the list of invitees these days is exclusive, with not just
old-school Hollywood stars, literati and jazzboes, but also
20-something slacker bands like Foo Fighters and younger glitterati
such as Charlize Theron, Tori Spelling and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Now that society is busily evaluating the century's ups and
downs, Hef wants to be counted as a definite up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living the life that dreams are made of,'' Hefner said.
``People ask me, `Is it as good as it looks?' It's better. There's
so much love in it, so much fun in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, if someone made a movie about your life, Hef, what would it
be? ``One with a happy ending, an unbelievably happy
ending.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

 &HT;    SEC OFFERS HELP IN COMPARING EFFECT OF MUTUAL FUND FEES
 &HT;    By DAVID McNAUGHTON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Comparing the fees charged by different mutual
funds became easier Tuesday when the Securities and Exchange
Commission added a cost calculator to its Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's new tool (http://www.sec.gov/mfcc/mfcc-int.htm),
allows investors to type in information on a fund's upfront sales
charges _ if any_ deferred sales charges _ if any _ and annual
operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The investor has to select an investment period, an investment
amount, and estimate an annual return. Average returns over the
past 30 years for stocks, money market funds and bonds are shown,
but investors can pick any number they want.
</P>
<P>
   The cost calculator then displays the total fees paid over the
selected time frame, how much potential earnings are lost because
of money paid in fees, and the dollar value of the investment at
the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, the SEC used two real, but unspecified funds that
are comparable, but carry different fees. Based on an investment of
$10,000 and assuming a 12 percent annual return, one would be worth
$50,771.10 after 15 years, the other $45,732.82. The cost of fees
and forgone earnings would be $3,964.56 in the first case, and
$9,002.84 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like unit pricing in supermarkets, which lets consumers view
the price per ounce of products that come in different sizes, the
cost calculator will allow investors to understand the real cost of
owning a particular fund, without being the slightest bit confused
by the fund's packaging,'' said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of the calculator, said SEC Chief Economist Erik
Sirri (CQ), is that it will encourage investors to read a fund's
information-packed prospectus. That's because the fee information
investors need to plug into the cost calculator is in the
prospectus.

HEFNER BACK TO BEING A PLAYBOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Also moving in ``l'' lifestyle news file)  
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another sign it's the end of the millennium:
discussing the joys and tribulations of single fatherhood with Hugh
Hefner, the Big Bunnyman himself.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Mr. Playboy himself is making the most of it now that
he's thoroughly disensconced from holy matrimony, reviving his
uber-bachelordom and still making time on family night for cartoons
with his boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having fought the wars and being around for the
parade,'' Hefner said. ``What's happening now is the celebration
after fighting the wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Being Daddy, it turns out, is pretty great the second time
around for Hef. And being a single daddy about town the second time
around is even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a revelation,'' said Hefner, in black silk PJs and
red silk bathrobe, over a large coffee table with built-in
backgammon boards in the small, wood-paneled library at one end of
the Playboy Mansion West in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles.
``There were so many young people waiting for me to come out and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Play he has in recent months, usually with pretty blondes in
tow. It's an image, replicated in endless celebrity shots of him
out on the town, that seems to play well with many younger people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got through doing an interview with a 24-year-old guy
from Details (magazine) who assures me I'm their idol and hero,''
he says. ``They feel to some extent as if they missed that
(swinging '60s and '70s) era.''
</P>
<P>
   Hef says he can identify with that youthful angst after growing
up in the Depression era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the (Roaring) '20s, I felt like I had missed out on
the party,'' Hefner said. ``It was like arriving at the party on
Sunday morning. I think the kids today relate in some way to that.
They feel they missed the party that to some extent I, personally,
and the Playboy Mansion represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of parties, Playboy has just issued ``Playmate Pajama
Party.'' The video is part gamboling hotties, part history lesson,
part Robin Leach-esque look _ for the first time ever _ at some of
Hef's more notorious inner sancta at the Mansion, including his
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Hef's not totally enthralled with the video: ``I had relatively
little creative input other than directions I gave (the director)
at the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Those directions: Take your standard
naked-Playboy-models-running-around video, let 'em explore the
mansion so you can show off the place to a curious universe, and
sprinkle in some vintage video to give the big house some sort of
historical context.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of a more general Hef history binge, excavating his
and his creation's past in the video and a series of foot-crushing
coffee-table tomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am at a point in life and at an age where one holds
on to what one has,'' Hefner said. ``Now we're at the end of the
century, and everyone is looking back.''
</P>
<P>
   Verdict on the video: Hef's got a messy bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see that bedroom is lived in,'' he cracks. Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not surprising for a man whose fashion sense can be
summed up as pajamas and bathrobes 24/7. But aside from the
accumulated geegaws, gimcracks and knickknacks of 40-some years of
very public private life strewn over nearly every horizontal
surface, there are the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Literally thousands of them, recorded with near-curatorial zeal
on professional-grade }-inch videotape, of the dozens of classic
films broadcast on satellite and cable channels hour after hour
after hour every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to miss them,'' he says. ``Being raised in a
typical Midwestern Methodist home, I escaped into fantasies'' being
spun by Hollywood, Hefner said, citing Busby Berkeley musicals and
Frank Capra confections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the films that created the image of America,'' he
says. ``It also defines who people want to be when they grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Pajama Party'' doesn't do his collection justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you don't see in the video is the carefully color-coded,
keyworded, cataloged library of films upstairs,'' Hefner says.
``All those tapes in the bedroom are waiting to see if they make
the cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Next observation: He's got some cutting to do.
</P>
<P>
   Hef devotes Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights to movie viewing
_ complete with his preshow commentaries for the group of invited
friends who crowd his large movie viewing room in the mansion's
north end.
</P>
<P>
   His all-time fave: ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   He still shows the Bogey and Bergman classic annually, most
recently because ``the girls I'm seeing now had never seen it. To
see it with someone you care about is really wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Um, yes, but Hef, what do you mean ``girls''?
</P>
<P>

BAT ACCIDENT PROMPTS LAWSUIT AGAINST METS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As the baseball season gets under way, Sterling
Lapinski of Houston has no desire to hear the crack of the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Not after what happened almost two years ago, when a bat cracked
his head open at a game at Atlanta's Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably never going to go to another baseball game,'' he
said. ``Even the prospect of being hit by a ball worries me. You're
not really safe anywhere in the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the mishap, Lapinski, a 29-year-old energy
commodities broker, is taking a few swings at America's favorite
pastime.
</P>
<P>
   In an action that could change the way fans watch a game,
Lapinski is suing the New York Mets, who he said showed a ``pattern
of negligence'' for allowing catcher Todd Pratt to continue batting
in a July 11, 1997, game even though he lost his grip on his bat
three times that night.
</P>
<P>
   The second time it happened, the bat crashed into Lapinski's
face in the fifth inning after Pratt swung and missed on a pitch by
Atlanta's Tom Glavine. Pratt also inadvertently flung bats into the
stands in the third and eighth innings after missing pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski, who is seeking unspecified damages, needed surgery to
mend his fractured skull, broken nose and crushed nasal cavity.
Doctors told him he would have been dead if he had not turned his
head around to allow his forehead to bear the brunt of the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew angrier and angrier the more I thought about it,''
Lapinski said about his decision to sue. ``Especially since they
never called to say, `We're sorry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski, who lived in Atlanta at the time, said he grew
especially irate after seeing Pratt joke about the incident on
television, saying he missed the pitches but ``took out a few
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta federal judge dismissed the suit, but Lapinski is
appealing to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, also in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski's lawyer, Bill deGolian of Atlanta, says U.S. District
Judge Jack Camp mistakenly threw out the suit because he failed to
distinguish between flying bats and flying balls.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, courts have ruled that spectators at baseball
games assume the risk of being hit by foul balls and home runs, and
cannot seek damages for injuries inflicted by a ball. But deGolian
says that in the only other lawsuit filed in the country by a
spectator hit by a bat, a 1938 California court ruling held that
bats are not a risk spectators can expect.
</P>
<P>
   California and Pennsylvania appellate courts have cited that
ruling in declaring spectators have a right to sue for some types
of accidents at sporting events, deGolian said.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta federal judge followed Georgia law in reaching his
decision, deGolian said, but judges frequently rely on rulings from
other jurisdictions if there is no precedent in their own.
</P>
<P>
   A 1949 Georgia appellate ruling dismissed a lawsuit filed by a
woman hit by a foul ball. The decision said the judges had reviewed
a number of cases filed by people injured by ``foul balls, flying
bats and other like missiles,'' but the final ruling only said fans
should presume they could be hit by ``wild balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Marshall, a winner of the Cy Young Award for pitching in
1974 who later earned a doctorate in exercise physiology, filed an
affidavit on Lapinski's behalf, saying there is ``clear evidence''
Pratt handled his bat ``in a manner inconsistent with what is
taught and expected of a professional baseball player.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski's attorney said his client has taken heat from baseball
purists who say he is trying to change the look of the game. But he
said his client is not asking _ at this point _ for nets or other
barriers to be erected at ball parks, although he added that might
become an issue if he sues Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for the Mets could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski bears no readily visible traces of the accident, other
than a couple of small bumps on his forehead. But his hair conceals
an ear-to-ear scar where his skin was peeled back to repair his
forehead and nasal cavity.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski said his insurance paid for the surgery and related
costs.
</P>
<P>
   He said some friends who were with him at the game coaxed a fan
who caught the bat to give it to Lapinski. He still has it at his
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep it around for self-defense,'' he joked. ``I know how
much damage it can cause.''

films broadcast on satellite and cable channels hour after hour
after hour every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to miss them,'' he says. ``Being raised in a
typical Midwestern Methodist home, I escaped into fantasies'' being
spun by Hollywood, Hefner said, citing Busby Berkeley musicals and
Frank Capra confections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the films that created the image of America,'' he
says. ``It also defines who people want to be when they grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Pajama Party'' doesn't do his collection justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you don't see in the video is the carefully color-coded,
keyworded, cataloged library of films upstairs,'' Hefner says.
``All those tapes in the bedroom are waiting to see if they make
the cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Next observation: He's got some cutting to do.
</P>
<P>
   Hef devotes Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights to movie viewing
_ complete with his preshow commentaries for the group of invited
friends who crowd his large movie viewing room in the mansion's
north end.
</P>
<P>
   His all-time fave: ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   He still shows the Bogey and Bergman classic annually, most
recently because ``the girls I'm seeing now had never seen it. To
see it with someone you care about is really wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Um, yes, but Hef, what do you mean ``girls''?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Hefner is dating three women at once, including a pair
of ``nice, Catholic'' twins from back in Chicago who are moving
here in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to come out, come out with a vengeance,''
Hefner says with more than a hint of self-satisfaction in his
still-toothy grin. ``I'm a guy who always believed in knocking down
the stereotypes of more conservatively bound members of the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. Three simultaneous girlfriends brings up another question.
Viagra?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure,'' Hefner gushes. ``I think I was the first kid on
the block to get Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of procreative urges, a statistical oddity: Hef's 73rd
birthday is Friday, the optimal day to conceive a child to be born
on Jan. 1, 2000. Does Hef love this? He loves this.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a long way from last decade, which nearly took the hop
out of his rabbit permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '80s and early '90s were very repressive, with Reagan and
Bush, the Moral Majority, the Meese Commission (on Pornography),''
Hefner said. It literally almost killed him.
</P>
<P>
   The Playboy empire was teetering financially, while the era's
moralists condemned Hef's out-of-step values. Even worse, director
Peter Bogdanovich wrote a scathing book about the murder of former
girlfriend and Playmate Dorothy Stratten that heavily criticized
Hefner's role in her rise and tragic fall.
</P>
<P>
   He blames that array of attacks for causing a 1985 stroke. &UR;  &LR; His
marriage to former ``Playmate for a Lifetime'' Kimberly Conrad four
years later was, as he said, a search for a ``safe harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also meant, ironically, marrying ``into a situation not
unlike my parents' marriage,'' he said. ``I put all of my hopes and
dreams into a more traditional lifestyle. The children were very
much a part of it. What was missing was the romantic part. We kind
of drifted apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefner and Conrad split about a year ago, at her suggestion. She
now lives in the next estate over and has the couple's two boys
with her most of the time, though he said he sees them ``nearly
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hef's term for his renewed bachelorhood: ``The unexpected
epilogue. I not only survived, but prevailed. It's never been
better than it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Hef is trying other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of the marriage, one couldn't simply return to what
they had done before, which is simply throwing parties,'' Hef said.
He had to venture out into the world a bit from his Holmby Hills
cloister. And venture he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince said to party like it's 1999. Well, it !ital!is!off!,
and that's what we're doing,'' Hefner said.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Valentine's Day party, the recent ``Boogie Nights''
party, the Midsummer Night's Dream party, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   And the list of invitees these days is exclusive, with not just
old-school Hollywood stars, literati and jazzboes, but also
20-something slacker bands like Foo Fighters and younger glitterati
such as Charlize Theron, Tori Spelling and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Now that society is busily evaluating the century's ups and
downs, Hef wants to be counted as a definite up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living the life that dreams are made of,'' Hefner said.
``People ask me, `Is it as good as it looks?' It's better. There's
so much love in it, so much fun in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, if someone made a movie about your life, Hef, what would it
be? ``One with a happy ending, an unbelievably happy
ending.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

 &HT;    BAT ACCIDENT PROMPTS LAWSUIT AGAINST METS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As the baseball season gets under way, Sterling
Lapinski of Houston has no desire to hear the crack of the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Not after what happened almost two years ago, when a bat cracked
his head open at a game at Atlanta's Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably never going to go to another baseball game,'' he
said. ``Even the prospect of being hit by a ball worries me. You're
not really safe anywhere in the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the mishap, Lapinski, a 29-year-old energy
commodities broker, is taking a few swings at America's favorite
pastime.
</P>
<P>
   In an action that could change the way fans watch a game,
Lapinski is suing the New York Mets, who he said showed a ``pattern
of negligence'' for allowing catcher Todd Pratt to continue batting
in a July 11, 1997, game even though he lost his grip on his bat
three times that night.
</P>
<P>
   The second time it happened, the bat crashed into Lapinski's
face in the fifth inning after Pratt swung and missed on a pitch by
Atlanta's Tom Glavine. Pratt also inadvertently flung bats into the
stands in the third and eighth innings after missing pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski, who is seeking unspecified damages, needed surgery to
mend his fractured skull, broken nose and crushed nasal cavity.
Doctors told him he would have been dead if he had not turned his
head around to allow his forehead to bear the brunt of the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew angrier and angrier the more I thought about it,''
Lapinski said about his decision to sue. ``Especially since they
never called to say, `We're sorry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski, who lived in Atlanta at the time, said he grew
especially irate after seeing Pratt joke about the incident on
television, saying he missed the pitches but ``took out a few
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta federal judge dismissed the suit, but Lapinski is
appealing to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, also in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski's lawyer, Bill deGolian of Atlanta, says U.S. District
Judge Jack Camp mistakenly threw out the suit because he failed to
distinguish between flying bats and flying balls.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, courts have ruled that spectators at baseball
games assume the risk of being hit by foul balls and home runs, and
cannot seek damages for injuries inflicted by a ball. But deGolian
says that in the only other lawsuit filed in the country by a
spectator hit by a bat, a 1938 California court ruling held that
bats are not a risk spectators can expect.
</P>
<P>
   California and Pennsylvania appellate courts have cited that
ruling in declaring spectators have a right to sue for some types
of accidents at sporting events, deGolian said.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta federal judge followed Georgia law in reaching his
decision, deGolian said, but judges frequently rely on rulings from
other jurisdictions if there is no precedent in their own.
</P>
<P>
   A 1949 Georgia appellate ruling dismissed a lawsuit filed by a
woman hit by a foul ball. The decision said the judges had reviewed
a number of cases filed by people injured by ``foul balls, flying
bats and other like missiles,'' but the final ruling only said fans
should presume they could be hit by ``wild balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Marshall, a winner of the Cy Young Award for pitching in
1974 who later earned a doctorate in exercise physiology, filed an
affidavit on Lapinski's behalf, saying there is ``clear evidence''
Pratt handled his bat ``in a manner inconsistent with what is
taught and expected of a professional baseball player.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski's attorney said his client has taken heat from baseball
purists who say he is trying to change the look of the game. But he
said his client is not asking _ at this point _ for nets or other
barriers to be erected at ball parks, although he added that might
become an issue if he sues Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for the Mets could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski bears no readily visible traces of the accident, other
than a couple of small bumps on his forehead. But his hair conceals
an ear-to-ear scar where his skin was peeled back to repair his
forehead and nasal cavity.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski said his insurance paid for the surgery and related
costs.
</P>
<P>
   He said some friends who were with him at the game coaxed a fan
who caught the bat to give it to Lapinski. He still has it at his
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep it around for self-defense,'' he joked. ``I know how
much damage it can cause.''

<P>
   For tiny birds, quail have always had a big problem. Their
little bones can make anyone tackling them with knife and fork feel
like Gulliver in Lilliput _ and wonder whether the bother is worth
the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, though, partly boned quail have started
turning up at butcher shops and even in supermarkets. Without the
breastbones and backbones, the sweetly flavored, tender fowl are as
fast and easy to cook _ and eat _ as chicken cutlets. But the
subtly gamy flavor and succulence make the meat far more
satisfying, tempting enough, in fact, to warrant picking up the
little legs in public and nibbling them clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years ago,'' said Anstice Carroll, a Manhattan caterer,
``if you asked people what they thought of a quail, they would say:
`Oh, it's too little. Oh, it's not enough meat.''' Today, though,
she has no trouble selling them as a first course.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester Farms in Dalzell, S.C., which processes 7 million
quail a year, sells 5 million partly boned, up from 2.5 million
five years ago. Bill Odom, the owner, says the demand has come from
chefs. They save time in the kitchen by buying partly boned birds,
which are easier to sell on a menu.
</P>
<P>
   D'Artagnan in Newark, N.J., sold 20,000 of these partly boned
birds in February, said co-owner Ariane Daguin, who called deboning
a meticulous craft. Of Manchester Farms, she said: ``I've seen his
best guys do it in six seconds. I need at least five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Once it's partly boned, a quail generally weighs all of three to
four ounces, so it cooks in six minutes or less, and it can be
eaten with a fork or fingers. The Ottomanelli meat markets in
Manhattan now sell 75 percent of their quail partly boned, said
Jerry Ottomanelli, an owner. (No wonder.)
</P>
<P>
   Convenience has a cost. At Ottomanelli, frozen quail, sold four
to a package, is $11 for partly boned, compared with $7 whole
(fresh quail, sold singly and whole only, are $2.50 each). At
D'Artagnan, which sells fresh quail only, a package of four is
$21.20 for partly boned, compared with $13 whole.
</P>
<P>
   To those whose families hunt, the quail is a toothsome childhood
memory and a taste that lingers. Caroline Cox, an actress and
ecumenical minister in Blauvelt, N.Y., remembers her grandfather
hunting quail outside Kansas City, Kan. ``My grandmother would
clean them, pluck them, whack them in half _ and just fry them up
in a little oil and herbs,'' she said. She herself fries quail,
seasoned with salt, pepper, ground rosemary and garlic, for three
minutes a side.
</P>
<P>
   Food historian Waverley Root described the flavor of quail as
hovering between the blandness of barnyard fowl and the wildness of
high-flying birds like mallards and geese. Unlike chickens, quail
can fly, and a little exercise makes them taste meatier. But they
never fly far. As Root wrote in ``Food'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1980),
when faced with danger, quail would rather run than fly, ``a
suicidal habit they share with pheasants.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Williams, the executive chef at the Berkeley Bar &AMP;
Grill, to open in May in midtown Manhattan, grew up in Houston and
started hunting the bobwhite quail on the family ranch at age 7 or
8. For breakfast, her father would grill the birds, seasoned with
only salt and pepper, and serve them with cornmeal mush (what she
now offers as polenta).
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Williams uses a Tuscan technique traditionally
applied to chicken. She wraps two bricks in triple layers of
aluminum foil and stacks them on a single quail while pan-frying it
for two minutes a side. The skin turns crisp almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Batali, the chef and a co-owner of Babbo, grew up near
Yakima, Wash., where his family hunted deer, moose, elk, pheasant
and quail. But he said he ``never shot a thing _ I didn't have it
in me.'' At Babbo, he marinates quail, and then grills it.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cost, a partner in Big Bowl, a group of Chinese
restaurants in Chicago and Minneapolis, has an Asian variation of
cooking called red roasting, which is usually applied to duck or
squab. He rubs the quail in soy sauce, marinates it with a toasted
blend of salt, Sichuan peppercorns, cinnamon (cassia), star anise
and cloves, and dries them at room temperature for an hour or two.
``The cassia and the star anise were used for curing meat centuries
ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cost then deep-fries the quail for about three minutes and
serves them with the extra seasoned salt ground and on the side for
dipping. Cut into quarters, they couldn't be more approachable.
</P>
<P>
   CHINESE-STYLE QUAIL WITH SEASONED SALT
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Bruce Cost
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1{ hours
</P>
<P>
   8 partly boned quail
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 star anise
</P>
<P>
   1 small fragment cinnamon stick (about 1/3 inch)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dark Chinese soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1\ teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   Peanut oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   Fresh coriander sprigs for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Check quail for any stray bone fragments or feathers. If
there are V-shaped grilling pins protruding (these shape the partly
boned birds), leave them in place. Rinse, and pat dry with paper
towels.
</P>
<P>
   2. In small skillet or saute pan, combine salt, peppercorns,
star anise and cinnamon. Place over high heat, and stir or shake
until peppercorns begin to smoke. Set aside, and allow to cool.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place soy sauce in mixing bowl, add quail, and turn until
they are lightly coated. Sprinkle a little of the salt mixture
(avoid the whole spices) inside the quail, and somewhat liberally
outside. Put quail on a rack to dry at room temperature for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   4. While quail are drying, remove whole spices (peppercorns,
star anise, cinnamon) from the salt, and grind them in spice
grinder to a coarse powder. Add all of the remaining salt to the
powder, and continue to process until finely ground. Transfer
mixture to small serving bowl. Add sugar, and mix well. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   5. In large, wide saucepan over medium-high heat, add peanut oil
to a depth of at least 2 inches, and heat to about 375 degrees. Add
quail, in batches if necessary, and saute until lightly golden,
about 3 minutes. Remove, and drain on paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   6. To serve, remove grilling pins. Use large chef's knife or
cleaver to cut each bird in half lengthwise and then diagonally
under each thigh. The meat should be slightly pink. Arrange on
large platter, and garnish with coriander sprigs. Pass the ground
seasoned salt separately for dipping.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   8 partly boned quail
</P>
<P>
   \ cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   { cup loosely packed thyme sprigs
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Check quail for any stray bone fragments or feathers. If
there are V-shaped grilling pins protruding (these shape the partly
boned birds), leave them in place. Rinse, and pat dry with paper
towels.
</P>
<P>
   2. In large mixing bowl, combine vinegar, olive oil, honey,
thyme and black pepper. Add quail, and toss gently to coat. Cover,
and set aside in a cool place for 2 hours, or refrigerate
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat grill or broiler. Remove quail from marinade, and
place near hottest part of grill or broiler. Cook until exteriors
are browned and meat is just pink when sliced at the leg bones,
about 3 to 5 minutes a side. Remove grilling pins, and serve
immediately.

RHUBARB COBBLER 
</HEADLINE>
  This is the second of eight columns by Claudia Fleming, the pastry
chef at Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan. Her collaborator on these
columns is Melissa Clark. 
(jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I love the complex taste of rhubarb. Its mix of sweet and sour
reminds me of the harshness and warmth of spring itself. Using it
in a cobbler seems perfect; it's like a hint of the brilliance of
the coming season cloaked in a wintery sort of dessert.
</P>
<P>
   In my cobbler, tender cream biscuits rest on top of the pieces
of rhubarb, and the dish is baked until they melt into a bubbling
pale red compote and the biscuits turn golden brown.
</P>
<P>
   To add another sort of contrast, I garnish the steaming cobbler
with something cool. At the restaurant, I make goat's milk yogurt
sorbet scented with rose water; at home, you can get a similar
effect for much less effort with a cool rose clabbered cream.
Either way, the rose accents a touch of rose water that scents the
rhubarb.
</P>
<P>
   The combination was inspired by a pot of rhubarb-rose jam that a
waiter brought back from London. I ate it by the spoonful, straight
from the jar. The rose stirred memories of the crumbling stone
walls I saw in England, which were covered with brave pink flowers
and tiny brown shoots.
</P>
<P>
   To me, rose adds a little bit of romance wherever I use it. Now,
I can't think of rhubarb without thinking of reaching for the rose
water. To best distribute the rose water _ and the vanilla bean
that I also use in this dish _ I like to first rub them on the
palms of my hands, then massage them into the rhubarb pieces. On
days when I'm overwhelmed, it's a very calming, sensual way to
spend a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   RHUBARB COBBLER WITH ROSE CLABBERED CREAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 20 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the rhubarb &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds rhubarb, trimmed and cut into {-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2{ tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1 2-inch piece of vanilla bean, split lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon rose water
</P>
<P>
   For the dough  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   12/3 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   3{ tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   [ teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into {-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon turbinado (raw) sugar.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large bowl, toss together
the rhubarb, sugar and cornstarch. Scrape the seeds from one side
of the vanilla bean (reserve other side for another use). Sprinkle
rose water on your hands and smear the vanilla seeds into one palm.
Rub your hands together to distribute seeds. Gently rub the rhubarb
with your hands to coat the pieces with vanilla and rose water. (Or
in a small bowl, stir together the rose water and vanilla seeds,
and toss with rhubarb). Let the rhubarb macerate for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, prepare cobbler dough. In the bowl of a food
processor or an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,
combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Pulse or mix to
combine. Add the butter, and pulse or mix until the flour resembles
coarse meal. Add the 2/3 cup of the cream, and mix or pulse until
dough starts to come together, scraping down the bowl and dough
paddle when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   3. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently pat
it together, incorporating any stray crumbs. Using a small ice
cream scoop or a large spoon, form the dough into 2-inch balls,
then flatten them slightly into biscuit shapes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Put rhubarb in a shallow 2{-quart casserole in an even layer.
Arrange biscuits on top, leaving about an inch in between them.
Brush biscuits with remaining tablespoon of cream, and sprinkle
with turbinado sugar. Bake cobbler until rhubarb is bubbling, and
biscuits are golden brown, about 40 to 45 minutes. Serve warm, with
rose clabbered cream.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   ROSE CLABBERED CREAM  &QL;

   Time: 5 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup clabbered cream
</P>
<P>
   \ cup rose jelly.
</P>
<P>
   Place clabbered cream in an electric mixer set on medium-high,
and beat until it thickens somewhat. Add jelly, and continue to
beat until stiff peaks form. Use immediately or chill.

<P>
   PHOENIX - Almost everyone from my generation calls him ``Bobby''
Rauschenberg.
</P>
<P>
   It's an affectionate gibe at the 73-year-old artist's immense
celebrity, but it's also a means of claiming him as ours.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rauschenberg gave my generation its art, the art that
left Jackson Pollock and his crew in its dust and opened our eyes
to an entire new world of stop signs, subway trains, broken light
bulbs and stuffed angora goats.
</P>
<P>
   I first saw his work when I was still in high school, visiting
New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1966 to see his series of
pictures on Dante's ``Inferno.'' It was an art of incredible visual
and emotional energy, an art so frantically busy, I didn't know
what it meant, even as I knew I couldn't get it out of my mind. I
just knew it connected to (begin ital) my end ital) life in a way
older, more established art didn't.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, April 7, the PBS series ``American Masters''
profiles the artist and takes us on a brief tour of the world he
has created in ``Robert Rauschenberg: Inventive Genius.''
</P>
<P>
   It is sketchy, barely filling in on a life so profuse as to be a
miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make maybe three pieces a year,'' says painter Chuck Close.
``I don't think that's even a good day for him, if he's only made
three pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   And it offers very little in critical insight.
</P>
<P>
   But it does fill in the major details of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1925, Rauschenberg was raised in Port Arthur, Texas. He
never gave art a thought until one time, on furlough from the Navy,
he visited an art museum and realized it might be possible to make
art for a living.
</P>
<P>
   The GI Bill permitted him to study art in Paris in the late
'40s.
</P>
<P>
   But the students there were imitating the older art, painting
``Picassos, Matisses, Legers, but in different colors,'' he says.
``I wasn't interested in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, after a stint at Black Mountain College in
North Carolina, he didn't care for what he saw there, either. The
fraternity of Abstract Expressionists were painting what Mark
Rothko called ``tragedy, ecstasy, doom and so forth,'' but the
younger painter was more interested in what he saw on the streets
and managed to take home to his $15-a-month walk-up studio.
</P>
<P>
   He put the junk together in peculiar ways. His most famous image
is probably ``Monogram,'' a stuffed angora goat with a rubber tire
around its belly, all slathered with paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who looked at my paintings didn't see the sculpture,''
he says, ``and those who looked at the sculpture didn't see the
painting, so I made up the word `combine.' And people started
saying, `Oh, that's what it is.' Now, the word is in the
dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, he went on to pioneer performance art, stage sets
and costume design for modern dance, and kinetic sculpture. The
range of his innovations was staggering.
</P>
<P>
   ``He invented more than anyone since Picasso,'' says his
colleague, Jasper Johns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went out and put the world in his pictures,'' says narrator
Dennis Hopper. ``Whatever caught his fancy, he put in.''
</P>
<P>
   So his prints, paintings and combines of the '50s and '60s were
apt to include President Kennedy pointing, Vietnam War helicopters
hovering, slum building facades, Roger Maris at bat, one-way-street
signs, the Statue of Liberty, boxes of lemons from the fruit
market, workmen in hard hats on their jackhammers, and astronauts
smiling at the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cicero, Rauschenberg could claim with satisfaction,
``Nothing human is alien to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the paintings and prints, the imagery is chockablock, one
thing on another, with no narrative logic to it. You take in the
whole of it and see the contradictions and ironies. It's like an
aerial view of a city rather than a narrow vignette of this corner
or that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a conversation between images,'' Hopper says. ``He tells
us about ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg says he ``leaves all the faucets running'' and
tries for ``the maximum lack of control.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rauschenberg is more than a visual sponge. He is the great
synthesizer. His images are memorable because he didn't choose the
trivial for his art, but the significant. They are a summation of
our times.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the old artist, living on an island off the west coast
of Florida, continues to make art and astonish his contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a shark that has to keep swimming or he dies,'' says
contemporary artist Close.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as he says himself, ``When you're most complete as a person
is when you're working.'' &QL;

HEFNER BACK TO BEING A PLAYBOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another sign it's the end of the millennium:
discussing the joys and tribulations of single fatherhood with Hugh
Hefner, the Big Bunnyman himself.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Mr. Playboy himself is making the most of it now that
he's thoroughly disensconced from holy matrimony, reviving his
uber-bachelordom and still making time on family night for cartoons
with his boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having fought the wars and being around for the
parade,'' Hefner said. ``What's happening now is the celebration
after fighting the wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Being Daddy, it turns out, is pretty great the second time
around for Hef. And being a single daddy about town the second time
around is even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a revelation,'' said Hefner, in black silk PJs and
red silk bathrobe, over a large coffee table with built-in
backgammon boards in the small, wood-paneled library at one end of
the Playboy Mansion West in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles.
``There were so many young people waiting for me to come out and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Play he has in recent months, usually with pretty blondes in
tow. It's an image, replicated in endless celebrity shots of him
out on the town, that seems to play well with many younger people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got through doing an interview with a 24-year-old guy
from Details (magazine) who assures me I'm their idol and hero,''
he says. ``They feel to some extent as if they missed that
(swinging '60s and '70s) era.''
</P>
<P>
   Hef says he can identify with that youthful angst after growing
up in the Depression era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the (Roaring) '20s, I felt like I had missed out on
the party,'' Hefner said. ``It was like arriving at the party on
Sunday morning. I think the kids today relate in some way to that.
They feel they missed the party that to some extent I, personally,
and the Playboy Mansion represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of parties, Playboy has just issued ``Playmate Pajama
Party.'' The video is part gamboling hotties, part history lesson,
part Robin Leach-esque look _ for the first time ever _ at some of
Hef's more notorious inner sancta at the Mansion, including his
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Hef's not totally enthralled with the video: ``I had relatively
little creative input other than directions I gave (the director)
at the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Those directions: Take your standard
naked-Playboy-models-running-around video, let 'em explore the
mansion so you can show off the place to a curious universe, and
sprinkle in some vintage video to give the big house some sort of
historical context.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of a more general Hef history binge, excavating his
and his creation's past in the video and a series of foot-crushing
coffee-table tomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am at a point in life and at an age where one holds
on to what one has,'' Hefner said. ``Now we're at the end of the
century, and everyone is looking back.''
</P>
<P>
   Verdict on the video: Hef's got a messy bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see that bedroom is lived in,'' he cracks. Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not surprising for a man whose fashion sense can be
summed up as pajamas and bathrobes 24/7. But aside from the
accumulated geegaws, gimcracks and knickknacks of 40-some years of
very public private life strewn over nearly every horizontal
surface, there are the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Literally thousands of them, recorded with near-curatorial zeal
on professional-grade }-inch videotape, of the dozens of classic
films broadcast on satellite and cable channels hour after hour
after hour every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to miss them,'' he says. ``Being raised in a
typical Midwestern Methodist home, I escaped into fantasies'' being
spun by Hollywood, Hefner said, citing Busby Berkeley musicals and
Frank Capra confections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the films that created the image of America,'' he
says. ``It also defines who people want to be when they grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Pajama Party'' doesn't do his collection justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you don't see in the video is the carefully color-coded,
keyworded, cataloged library of films upstairs,'' Hefner says.
``All those tapes in the bedroom are waiting to see if they make
the cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Next observation: He's got some cutting to do.
</P>
<P>
   Hef devotes Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights to movie viewing
_ complete with his preshow commentaries for the group of invited
friends who crowd his large movie viewing room in the mansion's
north end.
</P>
<P>
   His all-time fave: ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   He still shows the Bogey and Bergman classic annually, most
recently because ``the girls I'm seeing now had never seen it. To
see it with someone you care about is really wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Um, yes, but Hef, what do you mean ``girls''?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Hefner is dating three women at once, including a pair
of ``nice, Catholic'' twins from back in Chicago who are moving
here in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to come out, come out with a vengeance,''
Hefner says with more than a hint of self-satisfaction in his
still-toothy grin. ``I'm a guy who always believed in knocking down
the stereotypes of more conservatively bound members of the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. Three simultaneous girlfriends brings up another question.
Viagra?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure,'' Hefner gushes. ``I think I was the first kid on
the block to get Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of procreative urges, a statistical oddity: Hef's 73rd
birthday is Friday, the optimal day to conceive a child to be born
on Jan. 1, 2000. Does Hef love this? He loves this.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a long way from last decade, which nearly took the hop
out of his rabbit permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '80s and early '90s were very repressive, with Reagan and
Bush, the Moral Majority, the Meese Commission (on Pornography),''
Hefner said. It literally almost killed him.
</P>
<P>
   The Playboy empire was teetering financially, while the era's
moralists condemned Hef's out-of-step values. Even worse, director
Peter Bogdanovich wrote a scathing book about the murder of former
girlfriend and Playmate Dorothy Stratten that heavily criticized
Hefner's role in her rise and tragic fall.
</P>
<P>
   He blames that array of attacks for causing a 1985 stroke. &UR;  &LR; His
marriage to former ``Playmate for a Lifetime'' Kimberly Conrad four
years later was, as he said, a search for a ``safe harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also meant, ironically, marrying ``into a situation not
unlike my parents' marriage,'' he said. ``I put all of my hopes and
dreams into a more traditional lifestyle. The children were very
much a part of it. What was missing was the romantic part. We kind
of drifted apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefner and Conrad split about a year ago, at her suggestion. She
now lives in the next estate over and has the couple's two boys
with her most of the time, though he said he sees them ``nearly
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hef's term for his renewed bachelorhood: ``The unexpected
epilogue. I not only survived, but prevailed. It's never been
better than it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Hef is trying other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of the marriage, one couldn't simply return to what
they had done before, which is simply throwing parties,'' Hef said.
He had to venture out into the world a bit from his Holmby Hills
cloister. And venture he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince said to party like it's 1999. Well, it !ital!is!off!,
and that's what we're doing,'' Hefner said.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Valentine's Day party, the recent ``Boogie Nights''
party, the Midsummer Night's Dream party, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   And the list of invitees these days is exclusive, with not just
old-school Hollywood stars, literati and jazzboes, but also
20-something slacker bands like Foo Fighters and younger glitterati
such as Charlize Theron, Tori Spelling and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Now that society is busily evaluating the century's ups and
downs, Hef wants to be counted as a definite up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living the life that dreams are made of,'' Hefner said.
``People ask me, `Is it as good as it looks?' It's better. There's
so much love in it, so much fun in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, if someone made a movie about your life, Hef, what would it
be? ``One with a happy ending, an unbelievably happy
ending.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

OUT OF THIS NETTLE, PLUCK FLAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: recipe at end of article) 
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. LANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nettle soup, a dish from my childhood, is a ritual of spring and
early summer that I have steeped my own offspring in _ over their
original objection that ``no one else eats this stuff!''
</P>
<P>
   The soup is usually preceded by my lecture on how in the old
days, most people who starved to death did so in the spring. Spring
was deceptively deadly, bursting out into bloom and new growth,
while everyone's food stores had been devoured in winter, and
nothing remained.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritious nettles, cooked like spinach, did the trick. People
ate nettle soup and nettle pie. My uncle even made nettle beer.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, I always find myself discoursing to an empty kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   So this year, even I am surprised that stinging nettles have
gone almost mainstream. Everyone else is eating these weeds.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, At EQ in Greenwich Village, Dennis Foy serves
braised nettles with sauteed turbot. David Waltuck at Chanterelle
in Tribeca fills ravioli with nettles, while Mario Batali at Babbo
in the Village teams nettle tagliatelle with asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   The nettles, with an almost peppery taste like a cross between
artichokes and Jerusalem artichokes, are shipped in from the
Pacific Northwest at this time of year and are also available in
specialty food stores.
</P>
<P>
   But how they are sold is certainly telling: Gourmet Garage, for
example, has a large sign in the produce department warning of the
plants' propensity to sting and directing customers to the deli
department, where nettles are sold only by request from under the
counter, in the manner of questionable magazines.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, nettles' painful sting was put to medicinal use.
The word urtication, for the nettle genus of Urtica, historically
meant the flogging of a paralyzed limb with nettles to stimulate
it.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Brundage, a herbalist in Hampton, Conn., said that arthritic
joints were at one time rubbed with nettles, which injected formic
acid, histamine and other chemicals into them.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting acute pain became a counterirritant, overriding
the chronic pain of the arthritis, sometimes for hours or even
days.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking, fortunately, removes the sting from the plants. But
they should still be handled with care: wear gloves or at least
sheath your hands in plastic bags while trimming the tough stems.
</P>
<P>
   The end of April through early June is the time to harvest
nettles if you're daring enough to forage for them. The leaves must
be young and tender, or they will taste gritty when cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Freshly picked, they're full of vitamins A and C, not to mention
enough iron to build a battleship.
</P>
<P>
   Having a preference for soil enriched by horse manure, nettles
were once common along roadsides, but they can be found in almost
any sunny area that has been frequented by livestock over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   The stinging nettle is a perennial with a strong underground
root system. And once it is established, it will sprout spring
after spring in the same spot, just like mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to gather your own nettles, look for young
plants that have not yet flowered. The flowers are almost dustlike
and droop from the joints, where leaves and stems meet.
</P>
<P>
   Pick only the tender top half of plants that are less than a
foot and a half tall.
</P>
<P>
   Nettle shoots can simply be broken off, but it is best to cut
them with garden shears. If you pull and break, quite often the
young plants will come up, roots and all, scattering dirt that
clings irresistibly to the small hairy leaves, which makes them
difficult to wash.
</P>
<P>
   A plain brown paper grocery bag will make a good harvesting bin.
Pack it loosely about two-thirds full with nettle plants, and you
will have enough leaves after discarding the stems to make soup for
four.
</P>
<P>
   NETTLE SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Time: { hour
</P>
<P>
   2 cups beef stock
</P>
<P>
   8 cups lightly packed young nettle leaves, including the upper 6
inches of stems, rinsed well
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   Finely ground white pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 hard-cooked eggs, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Freshly snipped chives, for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine broth and 2 cups water in a large pot, and bring to a
boil. Add nettles, reduce heat, and simmer covered 3 to 4 minutes.
Puree cooked greens and liquid in a blender in two or three
batches, being extra careful because the liquid will be very hot.
Return mixture to pot, and set over low heat.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a separate small pan over very low heat, melt butter. Add
flour, whisking until smooth and thickened. Whisk into the puree,
and continue cooking until thick and creamy. Add white pepper to
taste.
</P>
<P>
   3. Slice the hard-boiled eggs crosswise. Ladle the hot soup into
bowls. Place half an egg's worth of slices in the center of each
bowl, and garnish with chives.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

STEAK, TWICE ON THE FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: recipe at end of article) 
 (bl)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cooking a steak simply, and to perfection, is easy _ as long as
you have a grill. Cooking a steak in the broiler or oven usually
means sacrificing a good crust, and using the stovetop can set off
the smoke detector.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple enough to get a crust on a steak before smoke fills
the house, but unless you like raw steak, this is not the ideal
solution. If you sear the steak quickly, though, then remove it
from the pan before building a quick sauce, you can finish cooking
it in that sauce. The trick is to heat the skillet _ a cast-iron
one is best, but anything heavy, whether stainless steel or
nonstick, will work _ until it begins to smoke. Then quickly brown
the steak on both sides, remove the meat and turn off the heat so
that the pan cools down before you add the ingredients for the
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   This procedure reduces smoke while increasing flavor and
juiciness. It is such a good technique, with so many options, that
you may forget the grill entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Butter is not vital to the sauce, but a small amount, maybe a
little more than a teaspoon a person, adds not only creaminess but
rich flavor. And in this particular dish, that flavor combines with
soy sauce to produce an unusual, countertraditional marriage that
is, in its odd way, decidedly American.
</P>
<P>
   But the technique is not dependent on butter, ginger or soy.
Each of these ingredients can be swapped or varied until the dish
you create has nothing in common with the original recipe except
the steak and the procedure used to cook it.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to use fairly thin steaks here. Judging the doneness
of thicker ones can often be tricky, and the sauce is so nominal
that it inevitably evaporates before the meat is cooked through.
(If the liquid evaporates before the steak is done, just add a
couple of tablespoons or so of water to the skillet.)
</P>
<P>
   The ideal purchase for four people is four small, boneless
steaks, cut from the top blade, sirloin or rib-eye. But two larger
steaks will work nearly as well, as long as they're thin.
</P>
<P>
   STEAK WITH GINGER BUTTER SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 to 1{ pounds boneless top blade, sirloin or rib-eye, cut into
2 or 4 steaks } inch thick or less
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it
begins to smoke. Add the steaks, and cook until nicely browned, 1
or 2 minutes. Turn, and brown the second side, another minute or
two. Remove the skillet from the heat and the steaks to a plate.
</P>
<P>
   2. When the skillet has cooled enough so that no smoke is
rising, return it to medium heat. Add butter, and when it melts,
add ginger. About 30 seconds later, add soy sauce and stir to
blend. Return steaks to the skillet, along with any accumulated
juices. Turn heat to medium, and cook the steaks a total of 4
minutes, turning 3 or 4 times. (If pan juices dry out, add a couple
of tablespoons of water.) At this point, they will be medium-rare;
cook a little longer if you like, and serve, with pan juices
spooned over.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variations on a Steak Theme
</P>
<P>
   By changing the ingredients in the sauce, the flavor of the
steak can be varied in any number of ways. Substitute extra virgin
olive oil for the butter, garlic for the ginger, lemon juice for
the soy, and it's a whole new dish. Or stay with the butter, but
use garlic or shallots and a few leaves of tarragon instead of
ginger, and vinegar in place of the soy.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few other variations.
</P>
<P>
   For the ginger: Substitute any minced member of the onion
family, lemongrass or anchovies. Finely chopped mushrooms,
especially reconstituted porcini, are also good.
</P>
<P>
   For the butter: You can omit this entirely, or substitute any
oil. Olive and peanut are the most distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   For the soy: Red wine, lemon juice, lime juice, vinegar or nam
pla (fish sauce) are possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Add minced herbs, at about the same time you return the meat to
the skillet.

HEARING FROM CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``I would far rather be standing here answering
these (tough) questions...than I would be standing here having you
ask me why we are permitting a wholesale ethnic slaughter and
ethnic cleansing and the creation of hundreds of thousands of
refugees and not lifting a finger to do anything about it,''
President Clinton said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Well put.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the administration's clumsy handling of the Kosovo
crisis and the uncertainties surrounding NATO's military response,
Clinton is belatedly demonstrating the moral leadership we have
every right to expect of our presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The words ``moral leadership'' are not usually associated with
the president. He lost his way with Monica Lewinsky when it came to
his own personal morality.
</P>
<P>
   But public policy is quite another matter. Great civilizations
confront questions of war or peace that call not only for a sense
of strategic interests but a national conscience committed to
battle outrageous crimes against humanity _ such as the massive
rape, pillage and murder in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A president who turned his back on the hounded, starving Kosovo
refugees would not be worthy of holding his job. Now that would
REALLY be grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   All those who think Clinton has already shown he is not worthy
of the presidency will never approve of military intervention in
Kosovo because they do not trust his motives. But voters who can
see beyond Clinton the man to the larger humanitarian issues
involved will understand that being the world's greatest superpower
carries responsibilities as well as rewards.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is considering abandoning his resistance to using
U.S. and other NATO members' ground troops to clear out the Serbian
butchers, he will have to shape public opinion in support of such a
dangerous move. In fact, he has already begun an education campaign
leading that way with repeated speeches and television appearances.
It seems to be having some success.
</P>
<P>
   A new Washington Post-ABC News poll taken after the weekend's
horrifying television images of the refugees' plight indicates a
growing public consensus behind risking U.S. lives for the Kosovar
victims. The poll shows 55 percent of those surveyed in favor of
troops as well as 68 percent behind continuing the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate political question for Clinton, however, is what
Congress may do when members return next week from their two-week
Easter vacation. Both houses are likely to debate resolutions to
either signal their support for continuing airstrikes and potential
future ground warfare or deny funding for such purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents never like to bother with winning over all those
inflated egos and uninformed minds in Congress. It takes valuable
time and they can't control the outcome. Besides, presidents
consider Congress to be needlessly interfering by butting into
foreign policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But involving Congress directly can in the long run be
politically useful. It tends to neutralize the opposition.
Legendary Oklahoma Sen. Bob Kerr once explained succinctly the way
it works: ``I'm against any deal I'm not in on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Iraq's Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, President George
Bush tried to block the Senate from debating and voting on his
plans to wage war against Iraq to force a retreat. Despite strong
opposition and heated argument, the Senate approved the invasion
and Bush could proceed without fear of having the legislative rug
abruptly pulled out from under him at home.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not going to be thrilled with a congressional orgy of
complaints about his handling of the Kosovo problem either. The
situation has drastically changed since March, when both houses
narrowly approved the use of a U.S. peacekeeping force in Kosovo if
a treaty would be signed with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by scattered comments from their vacation abodes,
however, congressional Republicans are deeply divided over the
Balkan crisis. Those who are unhappy with the prospect of sending
troops have thus far had no good alternatives to offer. The
Democrats are also divided, but a majority seems to be willing to
support the president's policy, whatever it may turn out to be.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional debate will be healthy and cannot be avoided in
any case. It will offer the president a golden opportunity to
address the concerns only now surfacing. And if he can't answer
those tough questions, it is better to find out sooner rather than
later.

   O'Keeffe Still Lifes At Phillips Collection
</P>
<P>
   From April 16 through July 18, the Phillips Collection in
Washington will be full of petunias, autumn leaves, green apples,
shells, crosses, doors, bones _ all the subjects of artworks in
``Georgia O'Keeffe: The Poetry of Things.'' The exhibition, which
includes 69 paintings and works on paper dating from 1908 to 1963,
focuses solely on her iconic still life paintings.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe's still lifes were radical works. Instead of portraying
everyday objects in their familiar domestic surroundings, O'Keeffe
defied traditional notions of setting, space, scale, perspective
and time. She painted close-ups of her subjects, placing them in
indefinite, infinite space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Details are confusing,'' O'Keeffe wrote in 1922. ``It is only
by selection, by elimination, by emphasis that we get at the real
meaning of things.'' Her depictions of a single object,
face-to-face with the viewer, opened many eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the exhibit, which is drawn from 50
private and public collections around the United States, are
``Black and Purple Petunias,'' ``Pelvis with Pedernal'' and ``Green
Apple on Black Plate.'' To give the works context, the exhibition
includes photomurals of the places where she lived and worked,
several objects similar to the ones O'Keeffe painted and books from
her library.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets, which are dated and timed, cost $12.50, including the
audio guide, and are available through Ticketmaster at (800)
551-7328.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips Collection, 1600 21st St., N.W., is open Tuesday
through Sunday. It is closed Mondays and will also be be closed on
July 4. Information: (202) 387-2152.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia O'Keeffe: The Poetry of Things'' will be on view at
the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Sante Fe, Aug. 7 through Oct. 17;
the Dallas Museum of Art, Nov. 7 through Jan. 30, 2000, and the
California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco, Feb. 19
through May 14, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sound and Light At a London Theater
</P>
<P>
   The 16th-century Rose Theater _ the first Elizabethan theater on
London's Bankside, now an archeological project _ will be the site
of a new sound and light show, narrated by the actor Ian McKellen.
The 20-minute exhibition, which focuses on the history of the
theater, will open on Wednesday for a run of about two years, to
raise public awareness and funds. A re-creation of the Rose was
recently featured in the movie ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Shakespeare's first plays were performed at the Rose,
built in 1587, including ``Titus Andronicus'' and ``Henry VI, Part
I.'' Christopher Marlowe's ``Tamburlaine the Great,'' ``Dr.
Faustus'' and &QC; ``The Jew of Malta'' were also staged at the Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of the theater were discovered by the Museum of
London in January 1989 during an exploratory dig on the site of a
proposed office building on the south side of the Thames River at
Southwark Bridge. The developers altered their designs so that the
remains would be accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the discovery, a campaign to save the Rose was
launched by British actors, including the late Laurence Olivier and
Peggy Ashcroft, as well as Judi Dench and Ian McKellen. English
Heritage, a government conservation body, is overseeing the
protection of the site.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, about two-thirds of the Rose has been excavated
and is being preserved beneath a layer of sand and a crust of
concrete, with a pool of water on top. Eventually, the Rose Theater
Trust hopes to finish the excavation.
</P>
<P>
   During the show, the pool will serve as a sort of screen on
which images of the theater in its heyday will be projected, using
a range of technologies employed by the theater designer William
Dudley. Viewers will watch the spectacle while standing in a
gallery overlooking the water.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Theater exhibition, 56 Park Street in London, will be
open daily; &QC; admission $4.95, at $1.65 to the British pound.

   Five Airlines Join In a New Alliance
</P>
<P>
   Smoother transfers and enhanced frequent-flier partnerships are
the main goals of Oneworld, an alliance among five international
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneworld alliance recently became operative among American
Airlines, British Airways, Canadian Airlines, Cathay Pacific
Airways and Qantas Airways. Iberia and Finnair expect to introduce
Oneworld services later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Routes and schedules of member airlines have been designed to
complement one another. Oneworld is not a code-sharing alliance,
although some members do have a code-sharing relationship.
Personnel at transfer and customer-service desks marked with the
Oneworld logo, a blue circle, can help passengers from any of the
alliance airlines. In particular, connections between Oneworld
airlines are intended to become easier.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Participants in a frequent-flier program of any member airline
can earn miles or redeem awards on any of the others (with one
exception: Participants in American's AAdvantage plan and British
Airways' Executive Club cannot earn and redeem miles on each
other's trans-Atlantic routes).
</P>
<P>
   Because airlines use different names for various membership
tiers in their frequent flier programs, alliance members will use
emerald, sapphire and ruby to designate advanced plan levels.
Frequent-flier plan identification cards have been reissued with
the new logos to help members receive the appropriate privileges
regardless of which airline they fly.
</P>
<P>
   Access to airport lounges determined by frequent-flier level or
class of service is reciprocal across all member airlines.

   Charleston Arts
</P>
<P>
   Charleston, S.C., has been making news in the performing arts

Burgschaft,'' Kurt Weill's dark fable about immorality in the
mythical land of Urb.
</P>
<P>
   The Spoleto Festival Orchestra will perform Stravinsky's
``Firebird,'' Charles Ives's ``Unanswered Question,'' Gabrieli-
Maderna's ``Canzone in Tre Cori'' and Witold Lutoslawski's
``Concerto for Orchestra'' at the Gaillard Municipal Auditorium.
There will also be a joint performance of Maurice Durufle's
``Requiem'' and Haydn's ``Lord Nelson Mass'' by &QL; 
the Spoleto Festival Orchestra and the Westminster Choir,
accompanied by the Charleston Symphony Orchestra Chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Other events include performances of the theatrical drama
``Mamba's Daughters'' by DuBose and Dorothy Heyward; ``Ricky Jay
and His 52 Assistants,'' directed by David Mamet; Kwaidan, a
retelling of three Japanese ghost tales, directed by Ping Chong;
two mixed-media presentations of ``Moby Dick'' by the performance
artist Laurie Anderson, and an evening of jazz with the saxophonist
Sonny Rollins.
</P>
<P>
   Dance programs will feature the Miami City Ballet; the flamenco
star Antonio Canales and his ensemble; works by the choreographer
Ronald Kevin Brown, and the Brazilian company Quasar Companhia de
Danca.
</P>
<P>
   The festival finale, including performances of Ives, Gershwin
and Copland works by the Spoleto Festival Orchestra, will be at
Middleton Place, an 18th-century plantation on the Ashley River.
</P>
<P>
   The Spoleto Festival U.S.A. runs from May 28 through June 13.
Information: (843) 722-2764. Tickets: (843) 723-0402. On the

SOME TAX ADVICE FROM THE IRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN HIELSCHER   
 Sarasota, Fla., Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people would rather work overtime on weekends or give
speeches in public than confront the annual task of doing their
federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But taxes are inevitable, as the saying goes, and April 15 is
fast approaching.
</P>
<P>
   If you're one of the millions who simply can't complete your tax
forms by the deadline _ or you can't afford to pay your tax
liability right away _ here's some advice from the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   For an extension, you must file Form 4868 by April 15. That
one-page form asks taxpayers to estimate what they owe and to send
along the payment.
</P>
<P>
   Filing the form will save you money. If you fail to file, the
IRS will assess 5 percent interest on what you owe, plus additional
penalties. By filing the form, even without a payment, the interest
will be 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The extension gives taxpayers another four months, until Aug.
15, to file their complete tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest penalty is failure to file,'' said Bob Firman,
communications specialist with the IRS South Florida District.
``That's why it's important to at least get this extension form in
by April 15.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 7.4 million taxpayers, or 6 percent of the 123.3 million
filers last year, sought extensions. This year, the IRS estimates
that 7.9 million out of 126 million taxpayers, or 6.3 percent, will
ask for more time.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of late filers has steadily increased since 1993,
when the IRS softened its rules on extensions. Previously,
taxpayers had to send along their projected tax payments or their
extension requests were automatically rejected. Now, the payment is
not mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have figured out their taxes but can't afford to pay
should file Form 9465 with their regular return. That is an
installment agreement request the IRS will review and respond to
within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   It will allow the taxpayer to make monthly payments on the taxes
owed; in most cases, the tab must be paid off within one year.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS suggests that those who owe taxes should review their
weekly withholdings, a W-4 form with employers, and increase it to
cover their tax liability. Taxpayers also have the option of making
quarterly payments during the tax year.
</P>
<P>
   As of March 19, some 57.28 million taxpayers had filed their
individual income tax returns. The average refund was $1,609, up
$212 from last year.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS Web site (www.irs.ustreas.gov) is proving a popular
source of information. The agency counted 531.3 million hits at the
site between Jan. 1 and March 21, surpassing the 444 million hits
during the entire '98 tax season.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers hundreds of tax forms, publications and other
information that can be downloaded _ more than 24 million were
accessed in January and February.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers are also taking advantage of electronic filing in
record numbers. Computer e-filing by tax preparers or from home
computers is 22 percent ahead of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Refunds are processed in about 21 days through electronic
filings, compared to as long as six weeks or more for paper
filings, Firman said.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpaying remains an onerous task for many Americans. A recent
survey by Lutheran Brotherhood, which asked people to rate how they
liked or disliked several activities, found that only washing
windows ranked below doing their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The survey respondents said they'd rather go to work on
weekends, pay bills and balance their checkbooks or clean their
basements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Income taxes aren't a job you can put off,'' said Rick
Edinger, an assistant vice president with the Minneapolis-based
insurance provider. ``The pressure to make the tax deadline
probably contributes to why tax preparation is one of the least
favorite activities.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite dreading the chore, most Americans don't
procrastinate. In the survey, 64 percent said they start preparing
their taxes in January or February, 18 percent begin in March and
only 7 percent wait until April.
</P>
<P>
   People do tend to file later. While 49 percent mail their
returns in the first two months of the year, 21 percent file in
March and 23 percent file in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who mail their taxes at the last minute probably have
completed their tax forms, but are waiting to mail them because
they owe money,'' Edinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually smart financial planning to owe a reasonable
amount of money on April 15 _ rather than get a refund _ because
the money can earn interest until it's due,'' he said.

LOST COOKBOOKS OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By S.A. BELZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An American living in Japan was looking for a copy of the 1946
``Woman's Home Companion Cook Book,'' which his mother cooked from
when he was a child. He sent an e-mail to Around the Kitchen, an
Internet cookbook store in Connecticut run by Louise Pennisi
(www.aroundthekitchen.com). She found him a copy. He sent another
e-mail, asking for a copy to send his sister in Illinois as a
surprise, so that they could cook the same dishes. Ms. Pennisi
described the ending, by e-mail: ``He later wrote, telling us he
could hardly understand her through her tears when she phoned him
to thank him.''
</P>
<P>
   This small tale illustrates the emotional hold that food and
cookbooks can have, but also the emergence of the Internet as the
largest book market the world has known. Ms. Pennisi's is only one
of a half-dozen Net shops specializing in out-of-print cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, far from killing off books, may actually be reviving
them. It isn't even necessary to go trekking electronically from
shop to shop on line. Sites that are search engines allow users to
comparison-shop among thousands of bookstores in minutes. The big
three are Advanced Book Exchange in Victoria, British Columbia
(www.abebooks.com), with 4,700 dealers and 11 million books;
www.bibliofind.com in Cambridge, Mass., with about 4,000 dealers
and 9 million books, and Alibris (www2.alibris.com) in the San
Francisco area, with 800 booksellers and more than 4 million books.
There is also a search engine of search engines,
www.bookfinder.com, run by students at the University of California
at Berkeley. It includes Advanced, Alibris, Bibliocity, Amazon.com
(handy for knowing if a book can be bought new) and Powell's Books
in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   As Bibliofind.com discusses, these are the places
Barnesandnoble.com and Amazon.com shop for out-of-print books (at
markups to the customer of up to 50 percent).
</P>
<P>
   You can type in as little as an author's last name or a word or
two from a book title. Type in ``Great Chefs of France,'' and the
Net will scoop up, besides that 1978 book, ``The Master Chefs of
France Recipe Book'' and ``Favorite Recipes of the Great Women
Chefs of France.'' So be sure you're ordering the book you want. A
search for that book turned up eight copies _ one in Britain, one
in Australia _ from under $10 to $40.
</P>
<P>
   Search results give author, title, publisher, date,
illustrations, bookseller, price and condition. (``Vg/vg'' means a
book in very good condition in a very good dust jacket.) Ordering
can be done by credit card on a secure server, by e-mail or phone.
</P>
<P>
   Among other Web cookbook stores is Jessica's Biscuit
(www.jessicas.com), run by David Strymish, who maintains that
Jessica's (named for ``a very sweet golden retriever'') has the
largest inventory of cookbooks in the world, with about 10,000
titles and a million books. The site offers new and used cookbooks,
and the company has branched out into Biscuit Books, which reprints
classic cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, Ore., Johan and Kay Mathiesen run Food Words, a
catalog and Internet business that can be found at the book search
engine sites. Carolyn George of Carolyn's Cookbooks
(members.aol.com &QC; /cgcookbks) can be found at the Denver Book Mall,
but she keeps most of her stock of more than 3,000 cookbooks at
home. Janet Jarvits has a store devoted to cooking and wine in
Burbank, Calif., but said Internet sales make up 30 to 70 percent
of her business (www.abebooks.com/home/JJARVITS/). Her customers
include aficionados of old cookbook illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Babette Polzer, who runs a catalog and Internet business in
Fairfax Station, Va., called the Squirrel's Nest (searchable on
Bibliofind.com), is one of the dealers who mention the demand for
the original edition of Irma Rombauer's ``Joy of Cooking.'' A Net
search turned up two copies of the 1931 self-published volume for
upward of $2,000; three copies of the 1936 Bobbs-Merrill first
trade edition for $200 to $500, and a facsimile reprint from
Jessica's Biscuit for $20.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a book on line can be every bit the nostalgia trip
of a good old-fashioned bookstore browse, but much more satisfying
because you almost always find your book.

NEW U.S. ATTORNEY CHOSEN FOR SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By ED ASHER 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Career prosecutor Mervyn M. Mosbacker Jr. of Brownsville has
been sworn in as the new U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Mosbacker, 45, who was born in Mexico, replaces interim U.S.
Attorney James DeAtley, who had held the position since Gaynelle
Griffin Jones resigned in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela administered the oath of office
Monday at the federal courthouse in Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Mosbacker, who could not be reached for comment, has been a
prosecutor since receiving his law degree from the University of
Texas in Austin in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He served as an assistant district attorney in Cameron County
from 1982 to 1988, when he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office. Until
Monday, he was the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the
Brownsville office.
</P>
<P>
   Mosbacker takes over as the chief federal law enforcement
officer for one of the largest and most active of the nation's 94
federal judicial districts.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern District, which has its headquarters in Houston,
consists of 43 counties from Huntsville to Laredo. These include
the Texas Gulf Coast, Padre Island National Seashore and Wildlife
Preserve, the King Ranch and a 300-mile stretch of the U.S.-Mexico
border from Brownsville to Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   Mosbacker will be in charge of a staff of 134 assistant U.S.
attorneys and a support staff of 134.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mosbacker has lived in
Brownsville most of his life. His mother is a native of Ciudad
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced last month that it was forwarding
Mosbacker's nomination to the Senate. That announcement came nearly
a year after a Texas congressional delegation had recommended
Mosbacker to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it will be a challenge, but I look forward to that
challenge,'' Mosbacker said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say whether he planned any changes for the
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's proper for me to comment on any of the
internal operations in the office at this point,'' he said last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department decided not to submit the congressional
delegation's first choice, Houston attorney Roland Garcia Jr., to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who had little prosecutorial experience, was the
apparent shoo-in for the job until it was learned that his brother,
Edgar Arnold Garcia, had pleaded guilty in federal court to a
drug-related murder in Florida. During the sentencing hearing,
Roland Garcia asked the judge to give his brother a light sentence.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, who nominated Garcia, praised
the White House's decision on March 10 to send Mosbacker's
nomination to the Senate.

   LUTHERAN: On Oct. 31, 1517, Martin Luther tacked a paper to the
Palace Church door in Wittenberg, sparking a movement that changed
Christianity. But the church Luther founded finds itself in deep
trouble in Europe, where the Lutheran World Federation reported a
``general reduction in numbers.'' And the problem is even greater
in Germany, the homeland of Protestanism, where more than a million
people have left the church rolls in the 1990s.

   Ron Howard, one of Hollywood's hottest, most versatile directors
doesn't fit anyone's mold. During 40 years in the thick of show

   TART SMARTS: Savory tarts are a supreme way to celebrate spring.
And tarts _ or tortas _ are so versatile, you can tinker with most
recipes to include your favorite vegetables, cheeses and meats.
Sliced thin and small, they work well as appetizers or side dishes.
Make heartier cuts and pair with a salad for a main meal. (Includes

ignored. (Includes 4-column color photograph of car's exterior,

   GOT YOUR HEADSET ON?: Headsets traditionally have been
associated with switchboard operators, workers who spend their
entire days making phone connections. More recently, headset use
has spread to other office workers who need to type, take notes or
shuffle papers while talking on the phone. Now the big push is
toward headsets at home. (Includes 4-column color photo of woman

   WITH: ALPHA KEYBOARD: Anyone who has ever carried around a
laptop computer knows even the lightest machine becomes a
heavyweight over time. So it was with some concern that I began

   THE LURE OF MONTREAL: Montreal has plenty of offerings to make a
terrific travel destination: culture and multiculturalism, a safe
subway system that gets you everywhere you want to go, beggars with
shockingly good manners, neighborhoods that invite a healthy walk

   FOR GOLF LOVERS: Author John Feinstein spent 1998 catching the
main characters of golf in their most entertaining, enlightening
moments during the major championships. His new work, ``The
Majors,'' is a wonderful follow-up to his best-selling ``Good Walk
Spoiled.'' It's not often that you get to feel as though you're
eavesdropping on history. (Includes 3-column color photo of golf
players at Augusta National and two color photos of book jackets.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: BOOK NEWS: Hannibal the Cannibal is back. Dr. Hannibal
Lecter, the flesh-eating villain of Thomas Harris' 1988 novel,
``The Silence of the Lambs,'' will continue his adventures in a
sequel. (Includes 1-column color photo of Anthony Hopkins playing
his Oscar-winning role of Hannibal Lecter.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: Winston Churchill's life spanned nine decades and
his public life a momentous six. His love letters to his wife form
a lifelong dialogue, a passionate record of his 57-year marriage
and the public events that formed a backdrop to his life. (Includes
1-column B&AMP;W photo of Winston Churchill and color photo of book
jacket.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: ROBERT FROST: Why yet another biography of Robert Frost

   THE POWERS OF INFANT MASSAGE: Massaging infants for health
benefits and to promote mother-baby bonding has been practiced for
centuries in other countries, such as India and Russia. But now
it's been getting around America as health-care workers use it to
calm babies born colicky, drug-addicted or premature. (Includes
3-column color photo of woman massaging baby's toes, a 1-column
color detail shot of toes and a 2-column color photo of a class
listening to an instructor)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CHOCOLATE CALCIUM: Chocolate is an essential part of a
balanced diet. Really. That is, if it contains a hefty dose of
calcium, as does Viactiv Soft Calcium Chews, a new product that
delivers 500 milligrams of calcium concealed by chewy chocolate.
(Includes 2-column color photograph of new product.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: MEDICINE CABINET: Open your medicine cabinet. What do you
see? If you're like many people, what's there isn't reassuring.
Odds are that the contents wouldn't help someone who needed first
aid _ or even someone with a sore throat. A combo cleanup and
stock-up will mean you'll be ready when someone in your family
comes down with the flu, gets an insect bite or has food poisoning.

MIRACULOUS MECHANICS AT WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He
created him; male and female he created them. ... And God looked
upon everything that He had made, and behold, it was very good.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Genesis 1:27, 34
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   An old man has certain things in common with an old car. At some
point, the body parts begin to wear out and need fixing _ or
replacing.
</P>
<P>
   But the profound, too-little-appreciated difference between the
old clunker and the old geezer is the human body's capacity, still
only vaguely recognized, to regenerate itself. Rebuild. Regrow.
</P>
<P>
   This recurring physical phenomenon has been my preoccupation
during the past three weeks of professionally guided rehabilitation
at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston
after a complex, multi-pronged surgical procedure on March 12 that
took 13 hours and doubtless saved my life.
</P>
<P>
   When I came to afterward, I learned that more extensive repairs
had been made than I'd expected. The entire right jaw had been
taken. So had an adjacent segment of tongue and eight teeth.
</P>
<P>
   From my left lower leg, a skilled surgeon had taken a six-inch
segment of bone to carve a new jaw for me.
</P>
<P>
   The top layer of skin from my left thigh was transplanted to the
tongue, inner mouth and external chin and cheek. This caused my old
pal and longtime press aide, Marshall Lynam, to observe that after
40 years of trying to keep my foot out of my mouth, I now seemed to
have my whole leg in it.
</P>
<P>
   This entire symphony of modern medical miracles was the work of
a team of specialists led by Dr. Helmuth Goepfert, chairman of the
Head and Neck Department of M.D. Anderson. Seven years ago,
Goepfert successfully removed an earlier cancer at the base of my
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Medical discoveries have raced ahead at a dizzying pace in the
past generation _ even in the brief years since my 1991 operation.
Doctors are constantly learning more about the body's amazing
ability to renew itself, and how to help it do that.
</P>
<P>
   My father lost a jaw to cancer more than 30 years ago. There was
no thought then of replacing it with bone from somewhere else in
the body. Dad, a proud man, spent his last days with a facial
disfigurement that was the mark, then, of many cancer victims.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Miller, the surgeon who installed a segment of my
leg bone in my jaw, tells me this is now a fairly well-rehearsed
procedure. Three weeks after the operation, my new jaw seems to be
working well.
</P>
<P>
   The astounding thing to me is the manner in which the leg
becomes whole. Faced with a 6- to 8-inch gap in the fibula, a bone
that runs from knee to foot, the muscles that formerly entwined
that bone begin to reach out for one another, up and down along the
now-empty corridor, until they connect, rejoin and form a thick,
protective cord that can become almost as strong as the original
bone.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes ordinary things can be miraculous.
</P>
<P>
   Good blood circulation is vital to this whole self-healing
process. Connecting a healthy piece of skin from the left side of
my face to previously irradiated tissue that covered the area of my
new right jaw, Miller and his reconstructive surgeons were anxious
to know that the blood would flow freely, and not clot, once the
delicate vein network was hooked up.
</P>
<P>
   So they installed in my facial skin at the spot of the crucial
connection a tiny electronic monitor. This sent signals to a
Doppler machine in a room next to my bed. By turning the knob ever
so gently at any moment for the next several days, observers could
tune in to listen to the current whoosh of my blood as it flowed
through that particular vein.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my goofiest personal reaction of all came upon my
discovery of my left thigh, bare of its epidermal layer and looking
like a segment of ruby red grapefruit. What seemed a transparent
tent of wrinkled skin encased the upper leg like the lax hide of an
aging pachyderm.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I have shrunk that much?'' I gasped in horror.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't human skin that sagged down around my leg, I was told,
but a miracle protective plastic covering developed by modern
science and made to resemble the human skin in two magnificent
particulars: It will admit healing oxygen, but it won't admit
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good as new'' would be a misleading summation of my condition.
Medical science can do only so much. At 76, I heal more slowly.
Some functions return only grudgingly.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that cancer can be conquerable. Useful life is
prolongable. And there really are miracles.
</P>
<P>
   And so for every day of health we're given, for family's love
and hope of heaven, for every friend who prays for you, for each
good task there is to do _ thanks be to God. Rejoice!
</P>

 SOMEWHERE TO THE RIGHT OF ITALY   (For release Tuesday, April(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wanted to write about the war in Kosovo but what do I know
about Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to worry about the grandmother fleeing in a wheelbarrow
and all the others running for their lives, but all I can say is,
``those poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to have an intelligent discussion about what's
happening in that part of the world but it's too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like being stupid about the Balkans, but there are so
many of those little countries.
</P>
<P>
   I can't understand how your neighbor could suddenly turn on you
because you have a different ethnic background. I don't even know
my neighbors' ethnic background. You can't tell by looking. We look
pretty much the same, but so, I've heard, do many Christian Serbs
and Kosovo Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   I'm confused as to why so many people there and here are mad at
America for intervening when for so long they complained that we
weren't doing anything.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I could leave it up to those who know more than I do,
but how do I know that they know what they're doing? Or the real
reasons for it.
</P>
<P>
   I have skeptical friends. Someone said, look for the money. What
are the economic reasons for the U.S. to be involved?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's face-saving. Or maybe it is purely humanitarian.
Don't you have to step in when you hear that they're executing
people, burning villages, killing children?
</P>
<P>
   People say if we'd had the media we have now during World War
II, we could have stopped the Holocaust. Now we get daily atrocity
updates, so don't we have to do something? But is bombing a way to
stop killing?
</P>
<P>
   If we don't rescue people being tortured and murdered in Tibet
or Africa for their political and religious beliefs why are we
doing it in the Balkans?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know, but if you fail to respond in a humanitarian way
in one place does it mean you never try again?
</P>
<P>
   Future generations may untangle the mysteries of Balkan violence
from a historical novel or a Steven Spielberg movie. But we need to
know now. So far we've been too lazy to study what's going on in
those countries. All we know is they're somewhere to the right of
Italy and they have a tumultuous history.
</P>
<P>
   A cynical friend suggests we appeal to the writers of Ally
McBeal and get her to defend a Serb-American neighbor who set fire
to the house of her Kosovar-American landlady. Then, maybe we would
get it.
</P>
<P>
   Another bets that more Americans know the brand name of Monica's
lipstick and Linda Tripp's literary agent than the capital of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Pristina. I looked.
</P>
<P>
   I know I'm in the majority with my ignorance, otherwise I
wouldn't be so public about it, but when your country starts
bombing a part of the world and captured American soldiers appear
on Serb TV, the right to remain stupid ends.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's time to get smart and do our homework. We've been
told for so long that Balkan history and politics are beyond
understanding, you wonder if it's in someone's interest for us not
to try to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Familiarizing yourself with the region is merely a matter of
geography. If you were planning a vacation to the Adriatic you'd
figure out the borders.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the war, there's an immersion course _ with maps _
served up every day in the media. But what is news and what's
Belgrade spin, Washington spin and NATO spin? You have to pay
attention to a lot of different voices to sort it out.
</P>
<P>
   A peace worker from Sonoma County forwarded an e-mail from a
woman in Belgrade who is a member of the Women in Black peace group
that has long opposed Serbian nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   She writes that Radio Belgrade is filled with partisan songs and
people are led in chants that say death is better than surrender.
There is no appeal, she says, ``for calm and common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke with a friend by telephone in Kosovo who can't leave
because of her ill father. The Kosovar asked her Belgrade friend
for news. ``What are they saying? What are the predictions?'' The
Belgrade woman writes she has no answers, only words of
consolation.
</P>
<P>
   Both are desperate for news. It's ironic that we, who are 8,000
miles away from them, can seemingly find out more about their war
than they can. But from the same e-mail comes hope that in spite of
the news reports, some rational minds do prevail. The Kosovar woman
told her friend that in a few buildings Serbian and Albanian
neighbors still speak and have, in fact, made pacts. If the police
come for the Albanians, the Serbs will speak up for them. If the
Kosovo Liberation Army comes for the Serbs, the Albanians will
speak for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear and terror have brought them closer,'' the woman
writes from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't heard much about that.

CALIFORNIA GAS PRICES UP DESPITE RISE IN OUTPUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN and GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although oil refineries in California are
producing more gasoline than a year ago, the age-old law of supply
and demand, plus upcoming summer vacations, are expected to keep
prices high.
</P>
<P>
   The California Energy Commission reported Monday that the
state's refineries had boosted production to 953,500 barrels a day
by April 2, compared with 926,000 barrels a day a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the production spike won't result in lower pump prices
anytime soon, said Rob Schlichting, a commission spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a while for prices to come down, particularly at
the retail level,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, gasoline prices have surged 30 cents or more
per gallon in some parts of the state, the sharpest price increase
in more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The average retail price Monday of a gallon of regular, unleaded
gas was $1.59, compared with $1.46 a week ago, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the American Automobile Association reported that
the average price for regular self-serve unleaded gasoline was
$1.08 per gallon nationally. The cost in Hawaii was $1.54, the
nation's highest, and in California, $1.48.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the increase in California is linked to problems that
have reduced supply, including fires at two refineries and
mechanical problems at a third.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Gorell, a spokesman for the Chevron Corp., said he was
surprised to hear that statewide production was up, given the
industry's problems. He said production at Chevron refineries was
down 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gorell said production was only one of the many factors to take
into account in analyzing the movement of gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   He said gas prices had already begun to climb before the recent
refinery accidents. Demand was up too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil, the raw material of gasoline makers,
rose in late March after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries decided to trim production.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of weeks, the cost of our raw material
increased 12 to 13 cents a gallon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorell said demand was expected to surge as summer approached
and vacationers took their gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   While industry executives cite the law of supply and demand to
explain recent price surges, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., has
again asked the Federal Trade Commission for an inquiry and
regulatory action.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC is already investigating gasoline pricing practices in
the California oil industry, responding to a request by Boxer a
year ago. Now, she has asked the agency to add the supply issue to
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer has asked the FTC to require major oil companies to
maintain an adequate supply of fuel in California, so that prices
can be held down during emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   She also asked the FTC to require companies such as the Exxon
Corp. and the Mobil Corp., as well as BP Amoco and Atlantic
Richfield, which are seeking approval to merge, to sell to
independent marketers and refineries at fair prices.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the recent price increases Boxer wrote: ``While
external events have certainly contributed to these increases, I
believe their effects have been magnified and exaggerated by a lack
of fair competition in the California marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis DeCota, director of the California Service Station and
Automotive Repair Association and operator of Unocal stations in
Greenbrae and San Anselmo, has long argued that the Department of
Energy should require oil companies to maintain a much more
significant supply of fuel than is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil companies have lobbied against that supply so well,
but any retail business keeps an adequate supply on hand, and it
should be no different in the oil industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all independent distributors agree with Boxer, particularly
large independent oil companies like San Jose-based Coast Oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Boxer is wasting her time, taxpayers' time, the time
of the oil companies,'' said owner Jerry Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems she could figure it out,'' Cumming said. ``There is
no conspiracy. We're getting product. It's expensive. It's supply
and demand. One thing this industry does not need is more
government regulation or government investigations.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Beast, thy name is Beauty
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ I brought my Catahoula girl dog home
from the vet this week after having her fixed so as not to further
perpetuate the species.
</P>
<P>
   I consider it my contribution towards the betterment of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   This Catahoula is a truckload of dog and then some.
</P>
<P>
   They're the cajuns of the canines, the national dog of South
Louisiana, what some people call a brown heeler, so named, I'm
told, for their style of herding cows, nipping at their heels.
</P>
<P>
   Our Catahoula my wife named Beauty because she was so ugly a
little puppy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the dog that my wife brought home blind and deaf. A poor
family had her and couldn't afford to have her treated.
</P>
<P>
   Everything turned out OK. Beauty was suffering from a virus akin
to distemper, in that it attacks the nervous system. Fortunately,
it was treatable and Beauty is just fine.
</P>
<P>
   She sees all, hears all and eats all.
</P>
<P>
   She ate two pairs of my eyeglasses that I kept on the night
stand by the bed.
</P>
<P>
   She ate the controls off our electric blanket.
</P>
<P>
   She ate the remote to the TV.
</P>
<P>
   She ate the legs off one of the kitchen chairs.
</P>
<P>
   She ate the Nativity scene at Christmas. (Mary was rescued,
literally, from the jaws of the beast, but there were tiny body
parts scattered everywhere.)
</P>
<P>
   She ate a hundred-dollar bill that my wife had left on a table.
That one, also prized from her jaws, we managed to piece back
together.
</P>
<P>
   She ate most of the Book of Revelation from my wife's family
Bible, including the passages about the mark of the beast.
</P>
<P>
   (Isn't that one of the signs that we're in the end times? When
the Catahoula shall eat from the Book of Revelation?)
</P>
<P>
   And, most recently, she ate the face off of one of the
grandchildren's stuffed Easter bunnies.
</P>
<P>
   But what bothers me most is the way she's been eyeing my little
poodle.
</P>
<P>
   Beauty's a good dog. At least I'm pretty sure she's a dog. What
with the size and shape of her snout, she sometimes reminds me of
an alligator.
</P>
<P>
   Of course all cajuns have a little alligator in them at one time
or another, lunchtime or dinnertime.
</P>
<P>
   Cajuns and Catahoulas _ where else but South Louisiana?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Catahoula is a revered name in the bayou country.
</P>
<P>
   There's a Catahoula Parish and, also, the Catahoula National
Wildlife Refuge, where, I suppose, the Catahoulas are free to roam
wild.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I ever think about driving Beauty to South Louisiana
and setting her loose.
</P>
<P>
   Well, hardly ever.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping she'll begin to settle down as she grows older. At 9
months, she's little more than a puppy.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she's a lot more than a puppy _ a good 60 or 70 pounds
and still growing.
</P>
<P>
   It's not for nothing they're called cow dogs.
</P>
<P>
   That's about the size they get to.
</P>
<P>
   But I doubt Beauty could ever be an actual, working cow dog.
</P>
<P>
   One nip at their heels, and she wouldn't quit until she'd eaten
the whole herd.

GRAPEFRUIT JUICE IS BOOMING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATT SAUER   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ After years of bumper crops that drove prices
into the ground and sluggish sales, the sometimes ugly duckling of
Florida's citrus industry has taken on new life.
</P>
<P>
   Grapefruit juice sales this season are 6.7 percent ahead of last
season, despite the fact that prices have risen about 7 percent, to
$4.63 a gallon. Florida growers control about 75 percent of the
$400 million U.S. grapefruit industry.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in sales is coming after growers abandoned 6 million
boxes of the fruit last year when the bottom fell out of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus advocates say the industry is putting out a better
product as it has shifted to packaging the juice in popular
ready-to-drink cartons rather than in cans of frozen concentrate or
reconstituted juice. Growers also have largely replanted groves
with red grapefruit, a sweeter version of the fruit. Ruby Red
accounts for 90 percent of all grapefruit sold in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Bradenton's Tropicana Products Inc. puts out a Grovestand Ruby
Red Grapefruit Juice with extra pulp. The company also has added a
calcium-fortified grapefruit juice to tap health-conscious
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Health concerns have helped. Florida's Department of Citrus has
tapped into campaigns touting the cholesterol-free and fat-free
nature of grapefruit juice.

SO HERE'S THE REAL Y2K PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I started in data processing in 1958. Y2K has
almost nothing to do with computer memory and everything to do with
storage media! If I keypunch a two-digit century on an 80-column
card, I have two fewer bytes to put ``real'' data in it. If I
include a two-digit century on a tape record (there were few disks
in the old days) that is written at 200 characters per inch, I can
waste a lot of tape! Please ask any of your fellow computerologists
who also spout this nonsense to correct this.
</P>
<P>
   _ All Huffy
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HUFFY: Ahhh, I see now. Programmers were either too lazy to
punch in another couple of bytes or too cheap to buy enough cards
and tape. And here everybody thought they were only incredibly
shortsighted. I'm sure this will give us all great comfort when
civilization falls completely apart in a few months and we're
living on roasted squirrel and shooting the neighbors because they
have the only operational can opener on the block.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a problem with attempting to boot up my
system from the hard drive. The following message appears when the
attempt is made: ``DISK I/O ERROR Replace the disk and then press
any key.'' Using ScanDisk from the emergency bootup floppy yields
the following message: ``ScanDisk encountered a data error while
reading the FAT entry for cluster 789725. This error prevents
ScanDisk from fixing this drive.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Bootless
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BOOTLESS: You are, to use a highly technical term,
goobered. Something has messed up your file allocation table, the
table of contents for your hard drive. Your PC can't find its
start-up files anymore. ScanDisk can sometimes fix this problem,
using a redundant FAT on the hard drive, but it's not a dead-solid
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   See if you can find somebody with a copy of Norton Disk Doctor,
which sometimes has better luck. Don't get your hopes up, though. A
screwy FAT is almost always a sign from above that it's time to
reformat the hard drive and start from scratch. At least you can
still boot from a floppy so you can try to rescue whatever data you
can.
</P>
<P>
   To reformat, first make yourself a very stiff cocktail. I
suggest something with a lot of rum and fruit juice, since a
tequila hangover will be much more intense. Now boot from the
emergency floppy and get to a DOS prompt. Type in FORMAT C: /S and
press Enter. You should have time to mix another cocktail while the
drive is formatted.
</P>
<P>
   When that's complete, run ScanDisk or Disk Doctor, sit back,
take a large sip of your drink and try not to put your eye out with
that little umbrella. Make sure you do a surface scan, which can
identify potential trouble spots on the disk and lock them off. Now
you get to load Windows and all your programs again. Won't that be
fun? Hint: Rum is cheaper by the liter.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What does the word ``Pentium'' mean?
</P>
<P>
   _ Hegelian Etymologist
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HEGEL: It means, ``I may be the best marketing weasel at
Intel, but I still can't build a campaign around a chip with a
stupid name like `80586.'''
</P>
<P>
   (Noted computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay wanted to call the
80586 ``Layla'' but Intel couldn't get the rights to the song. He

HIGH FASHION FALLS TO FATHERHOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've always been a dreamer. Even before dreams were fashionable,
I had visions of what my life would be like once my mother let me
stay out after 9 p.m. When you're young and bereft of a social life
or cable television, you must rely on your imagination. Like most
of the young girls I knew, and none of the boys, I spent a lot of
time thinking about my family-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   We would live in the perfect house on the perfect street, me, my
husband and my two darling children, Jon Pierre and Fauntleroy. Oh,
I loved Frances Hodgson Burnett's story of 7-year-old Little Lord
Fauntleroy with his wonderful velvet suits and matching shoes. Like
him, my boys would be trendsetters. They would wear knickers and
sailor suits with cute little hats and monogrammed socks. In fact,
we would all wear matching outfits; always, even our bedclothes.
</P>
<P>
   As we gallivanted about, people would point and whisper, ``There
they go. Is that velvet? Oh my. Don't they always look so grand?''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it occurs to me that perhaps I might have
benefited from a little more time in the sunshine. Nevertheless, I
had plans _ big plans. Then I met the perfect man and told him all
about my hopes and dreams. He just smiled. I have since learned not
to interpret that smile as a yes. Not once did he rain on my
parade. He listened patiently and merely nodded when I told him
that I liked that French version of Jon without the ``h.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when I became with child and the ultrasound confirmed
that we were having a male heir, the rain started. One evening as
we were putting up a border in the nursery he said, ``You know, I
always wanted to name my son after me. My friends have all named
their first-born son after them. I know you like that French name,
but I kind of think Jon Pierre won't go over too well in Texas,
especially if he plays sports, like me. It's just not a very
intimidating name. Think about it. `Starting at defensive end, a
6-3, 280-pound sophomore; Jon Pierre Anderson.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he won't play sports,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, my husband started hyperventilating, and I had to get
him a paper sack to breathe into. At that point, I knew that
Fauntleroy was out of the question. Well, at least I can dress him
in velvet knickers, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   Would you believe it? The kid was allergic to velvet. He hated
it from the day he arrived. It made him itch like crazy. And my
husband wouldn't wear the bright purple blazer I bought him. So
either I was sentenced to a wardrobe of blue, black and brown or I
would have to give up my lifelong dreams of coordinated clothing.
Ultimately, I decided that I did not want to appear to be in
mourning every day, and really, his black suit doesn't clash with
my yellow dress.
</P>
<P>
   As for Junior and his brother, Junior II, they wear blue jeans
with holes in them every day and haven't matched since they learned
to dress themselves. But life goes on. And, oh yes, they both play
lots of sports. However, I do have the loveliest T-shirts to match
their jerseys. That velvet gets a little hot, though, during the
soccer games.

JOHN TRAVOLTA'S SON RECOVERED FROM ILLNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to John Travolta? I understand he has a son
with Kawasaki syndrome, which my son also has.
</P>
<P>
   _ C.M., N. Grafton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Travolta in care of the William Morris Agency, 151
El Camino Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   Jett, the son of Travolta and Kelly Preston, contracted a form
of Kawasaki syndrome after exposure to chemicals used to clean
their home's carpet, said publicist Michelle Bega.
</P>
<P>
   He's now 6 and fully recovered, Bega said. Travolta discussed
the experience during interviews about ``A Civil Action,'' his film
about children who die from drinking chemically tainted drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
   Kawasaki syndrome, a vascular illness with an undetermined
cause, strikes approximately 1 in 10,000 children under age 5 in
the Unites States. It has become the leading cause of acquired
heart disease among children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is ``lite'' beer light because of reduced calories or light
because of reduced alcohol?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: A little of both, though the caloric reduction is much
greater.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, light beer is made by reducing the natural sugars
present in malting barley and reducing the alcoholic content by 10
percent, said Jeff Waalkes, Miller Brewing Co. communications
manager.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-ounce can of Miller Lite has 96 calories, with 4.5 percent
alcohol, compared with Miller Genuine Draft and High Life's 143
calories and 5 percent alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Waalkes wouldn't say how much calorie reduction comes from
reduced alcohol rather than reduced sugar. ``That starts to give
out our recipe,'' he said. ``Recipes are any brewery's most closely
guarded secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to David E. Kelley of ``The Practice''? I'd
like to contact him about show ideas.
</P>
<P>
   _ M.T., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to David E. Kelley Productions, 1600 Rosecrans,
Manhattan Beach, CA 90266.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley is the creator and executive producer of ``The
Practice,'' ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Chicago Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   He was working as a lawyer in the early '80s when he sold the
script for the 1987 movie ``From the Hip.'' This led to a staff
position at ``L.A. Law,'' where he wrote numerous scripts and
became executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he writes both ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal.''
Kelley married Michelle Pfeiffer in 1993, and they have two
children.

RANGE ROVER IS TOUGH AS RAWHIDE, LUXURIOUS AS MINK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the world's most capable, most luxurious and, yes, most
expensive sport-utility vehicles is back for 1999 with the most
significant changes since it was completely redesigned for 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes are improvements to the base 4.0-liter engine,
the interior and the stereo system, as well as the addition of
four-wheel traction control, side air bags for front-seat occupants
and seat-belt pretensioners.
</P>
<P>
   All that adds up to an even better package for a vehicle that
can take its passengers to the fanciest country club or to the most
remote mountain ski hideaway.
</P>
<P>
   Range Rover vehicles, built by Britain's Land Rover (now a
subsidiary of Germany's BMW), were introduced to the United States
in 1987 to give Americans an upscale version of the original
British exploration vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   This model is a few cuts above the Land Rovers the Brits used to
traverse the Australian Outback and other far-reaching and
less-developed areas of the former British Empire. The Range Rover
is so fancy that it is sold only in North America; less-fancy
models bearing the Land Rover name are sold worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Our test vehicle was the base model, known as the 4.0 SE. It's
also the least-expensive Range Rover, with a base price of $58,000
plus $625 transportation. Two other models are offered: the 4.6 HSE
at $66,000, with a slightly larger (4.6-liter) 222-horsepower V-8;
and the limited-edition Callaway 4.6, with 240 horsepower, listing
for a whopping $78,000.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers on a budget, there is the Land Rover Discovery II,
however, with a base price of just $34,150 (about $40,000 with all
the trimmings).
</P>
<P>
   The Range Rover 4.0 SE is definitely aimed at the country club
set, and even though it is perfectly capable of going just about
anywhere that a Jeep could go, it's rare to find a Range Rover
owner willing to risk damaging the vehicle on backwoods trails.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions are people such as entertainer Jimmy Buffett, who
owns several of these vehicles, including a stretch-limo model that
he uses to take his friends hunting. I once drove an off-road
course in California with Buffett, who had come to town for some
off-road training in his newest Range Rover.
</P>
<P>
   As with most SUVs, fewer than 10 percent of owners ever take
their Range Rovers off road, and that's a shame. You can take these
vehicles into the wild without damaging them if you know what
you're doing, and Land Rover offers some off-road driving training
programs to help their customers get the most out of these truly
capable vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The ruggedness of the Range Rover comes from its aluminum body
on boxed-steel ladder frame arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent four-wheel-drive system has a viscous-coupling
unit that allows for seamless transfer of power among the four
wheels for smooth driving in all conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.0 SE's V-8 engine cranks out 188 horsepower and 250
foot-pounds of torque. The transmission is an electronic four-speed
automatic, and there is a low range for serious off-road driving
and hill-climbing. The floor-console shifter allows the driver to
choose quickly between high-or low-range modes.
</P>
<P>
   Range Rover's unique air-suspension system puts the vehicle on a
cushion of air. There are five height selections: access, which
automatically lowers the parked vehicle for easy entry and exit;
low, which is automatically selected for highway driving; standard,
for around-town cruising; high, for better off-road clearance; and
extended, a superhigh mode that is automatically engaged when the
vehicle senses that it is high-centering (straddling the center of
a dirt road).
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel, four-channel antilock brakes are standard, and the
new four-wheel traction control works with the antilock braking
system to detect and prevent wheel slippage by applying brake
pressure to the wheel that is slipping.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is quite comfortable for a vehicle that is really just
a truck, and the interior is elegant, with leather seats and
dual-zone automatic climate control included (well, of course you
wouldn't expect any less at this price).
</P>
<P>
   Other amenities include 10-way adjustable, heated front bucket
seats with separate two-position memory for each seat; cruise
control with steering-wheel-mounted controls; tilt-and-slide sun
roof with shade; universal remote transmitter for garage doors and
security gates; factory security system with engine immobilization
feature; power windows, mirrors and door locks with remote control;
tilt-and-telescoping steering column; quartz halogen headlights
with wipers and washers; power steering and much more.
</P>
<P>
   The Range Rover can tow a trailer of up to 6,500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Off-road clearance is 8.4 inches under the differential, and the
angle of approach and departure can be a maximum of 34 degrees, an
important feature when coming down a steep hill into a creek or
going up the next hill upon leaving the creek. The vehicle can tilt
45 degrees to one side without tipping over.
</P>
<P>
   The only option offered is a GPS satellite navigation system for
$2,995, a nice feature for around-town driving, highway cruising or
exploring off the beaten track.
</P>
<P>
   Five passengers can travel comfortably in the Range Rover along
with 18.5 cubic feet of gear. With the rear seat folded out of the
way, cargo capacity soars to 58 cubic feet. You could almost set
the tent up inside the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy estimates are about average for this class: 13
miles per gallon in the city and 16 mpg on the highway. The tank
holds 24.6 gallons of gas, and premium fuel is recommended.
</P>

<P>
   1999 Range Rover 4.0 SE

 &HT;    Sounds of joy mark Marlins' opener
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The post-Huizenga era of the Florida
Marlins got off to a hot start Monday on an opening day thick with
nostalgia and thin on expectation.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Player Stadium sparkled with a fresh coat of teal as
summer-like heat gave a preview to the months ahead. The Marlins,
hoping for a year that sees more team building than collapsing,
were hotter than expected too, as they easily trounced the visiting
New York Mets 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get your hopes up.
</P>
<P>
   The new paint job on the roof of the Marlins' dugout puts this
season in perfect perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having the Marlins name on it, the dugout roof now
reads ``Your Home Team.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a good reminder, considering that many fans _ including
the thousands of boisterous Mets fans at Monday's game _ will come
to the park to root against the mediocre-at-best Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   But what I particularly like about the dugout roof is the
punctuation. It doesn't just say ``Your Home Team''. It says ``Your
Home Team'' and then has a ``.'' after it.
</P>
<P>
   Your Home Team. Period.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the only dugout roof in the majors with punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that if the Marlins were expected to be pennant
contenders, the punctuation mark might be an exclamation point:
Your Home Team!
</P>
<P>
   Or if former owner Wayne Huizenga still ran the team, his
efforts to squeeze some public money for a new stadium might have
prompted a ``Your Home Team?'' on the dugout roof.
</P>
<P>
   I like the period, though. It has a Zen-like calmness to it. It
basically says, at least to me, to accept things in their imperfect
form, which isn't that bad.
</P>
<P>
   It's baseball. It's driving distance to your home. And we
promise, we're trying the best we can. Your Home Team. Period.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to shout about. But nothing to question, either.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of shouting, I brought a sound meter to the game
Monday, to quantify the relative enthusiasm and loyalty of the
38,983 fans who showed up.
</P>
<P>
   I half expected the visiting Mets, a team with pennant
expectations this year, to get most of the noise from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news for Marlins new owner John Henry is that even
against a team with a huge South Florida following, his Marlins
were still very much the home team Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Mets outfielder Bobby Bonilla got the biggest applause (95
decibels) of all the players announced on either team. But the fans
were applauding Bonilla's great year with the Marlins two years
ago, when the team won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   I know, because the crowd responded with a nearly equal
94-decibel ovation when Bonilla popped out to end a Mets' threat in
the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd spared no applause for any member of the 1997 Marlins'
World Series championship team.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Counsell, who wasn't starting Monday's game but scored the
winning run in the World Series, got a 92-decibel applause, more
than any Marlin except Alex Fernandez, who was also a member of
that 1997 team.
</P>
<P>
   There were other ways to gauge the Marlins fans' loyalty to
their team.
</P>
<P>
   When the teams first scored, it was the Marlins (97 decibels)
who drew more applause than the Mets (86 decibels.) To put that in
perspective, this was tempered enthusiasm. Rock concerts can crank
up to 140 decibels and a solo jackhammer can get to 100 on its own.
Even a noisy electric razor can generate 85 decibels, and most of
the sound was somewhat less than a low-flying jet (90 decibels) can
produce.
</P>
<P>
   But at least most of the noise went the Marlins' way. For
example, when Mets superstar Mike Piazza, who played five games as
a Marlin last year, was announced, he got a 92-decibel applause.
And he got a 93-decibel applause when Fernandez struck him out in
the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' greatest moment, a homer by first baseman John Olerud
rated 86 decibels, far less than a sparkling double-play turned by
Marlins shortstop Alex Gonzalez (100 decibels.)
</P>
<P>
   The sound meter produced a few scary results too.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the introduction of mascot Billy the Marlin (83
decibels) drew as much noise as the introduction of Hall of Fame
players Stan Musial and Whitey Ford, and 9 decibels less than the
crowd's reaction to a fan catching a foul ball in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of silence for Joe DiMaggio: 61 decibels.
</P>
<P>
   The blaring Jumbotron pregame video blared with an ear-numbing
94-decibel soundtrack _ only three decibels less than the roar of
the crowd that accompanied the Marlins' first run.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires did pretty well _ only rating an 82-decibel boo
after calling ball four on a close pitch to a Mets player. This
turned out to equal the indifference the crowd showed to the ``If
you're happy and you know it clap your hands'' song played by the
stadium organist.
</P>
<P>
   When the last out was made, fireworks popped in the sky beyond
centerfield, to celebrate a Marlins victory, the team's fourth
opening day win in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's talking World Series this year. But at least
mathematical elimination got pushed back one more day on the
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   And at least until tonight, it sounds like the Marlins are still
South Florida's home team.
</P>
<P>
   Period.

CLINTON AND NATO SPURN CEASE-FIRE IN YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton spurned a cease-fire appeal from
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday and vowed to
continue the U.S.-led bombing campaign until Yugoslav troops leave
Kosovo and NATO troops can escort refugees back to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart announced the decision
by the president and NATO leaders barely two hours after the
Yugoslav leadership declared a unilateral, five-day suspension in
the murderous, house-to-house onslaught that has uprooted 1.1
million of Kosovo's 1.8 million ethnic Albanian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' has driven more
than 500,000 refugees into neighboring Albania, Montenegro and
Macedonia _ with 250,000 refugees entering Albania alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs' cease-fire declaration did not mention NATO by
name and did not include a reciprocal demand that NATO halt its
14-day bombing campaign. Nor did Yugoslav authorities promise to
halt anti-aircraft fire against allied bombers .
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Yugoslav Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic said, however, he
hoped that NATO would respond by halting the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO continues to bombard Serbia after today's decision, it
would be very clear ... NATO is against peace,'' Draskovic said.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire took effect at 2 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart repeated Clinton's hard-line terms for ending the
bombing: Milosevic must withdraw 40,000 soldiers, police and
paramilitary vigilantes from Kosovo, accept deployment of a
28,000-troop international security force, clear the way for
refugees to return to their homes and accept creation of an
autonomous Kosovo province under local control.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mere cease-fire is clearly not sufficient to meet these
conditions,'' Lockhart said, adding: ``NATO operations will
continue until either Milosevic accepts these conditions, or we
will seriously diminish his capacity to maintain his grip and
impose his control on Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart added: ``You don't have a deal until you have a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, calling the Yugoslav cease-fire
``absurd,'' said he was flying to NATO headquarters in Belgium to
consult with allied military and political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a former GOP senator from Maine, said he would take 11
lawmakers from Capitol Hill on his trip to NATO headquarters and on
to the Aviano air base in Italy. The group included Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., a 2000 GOP presidential aspirant who has urged the
use of allied ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they attributed Milosevic's declaration of a
cease-fire to the impact of 14 nights of allied air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials warned on Monday that they expected
Milosevic to propose a cease-fire. The Yugoslav government, in a
statement broadcast on Belgrade television, declared a five-day
cease-fire through the Orthodox Christian Easter on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said it was unclear whether the Yugoslav proposal
was merely for a pre-Easter cease-fire or for a permanent
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, it's not sufficient,'' Lockhart said at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton administration officials and NATO leaders in
Brussels expressed regret for an allied air attack that went badly
wrong, when bombs missed a facility housing a Yugoslav artillery
brigade in the central Serbian town of Aleksinac. The weapons
instead hit a civilian apartment house by mistake in the mining
town of about 17,000 people 100 miles southeast of Belgrade,
killing an unknown number of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department issued a daily update on so-called ethnic
cleansing by Yugoslav forces that reported unrelenting ``forced
expulsions throughout Kosovo'' accompanied by robberies, extortion
and looting.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report said refugees continue to report
that Serbian forces are ``systematically separating military-aged
men'' from evicted groups of refugees, carrying out mass executions
and using ethnic Albanian captives as human shields in combat with
Kosovar Liberation Army forces.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said that refugees were reporting that more
than 200,000 ethnic Albanians were being detained in the Kosovar
capital of Pristina without food, water, medicine or shelter
awaiting transportation out of Kosovo.

   In the wake of the cease-fire offer, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright consulted with her counterparts from Britain,
France, Germany, Italy and Russia. The nations' foreign ministers
agreed to meet in Brussels within the next few days to review the
allied air campaign and to reaffirm the conditions that Milosevic
must meet to win cessation of allied air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe a sustained air campaign can accomplish the
objectives we have laid out,'' Albright told a forum at the
Brookings Institution in Washington. Albright added: ``We are going
to continue in this intensive air campaign and we will do so until
all the Serb forces are out'' of Kosovo.

   The embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo _ barely larger than
greater Los Angeles _ has been dominated for centuries by ethnic
Albanian Muslims who forged ties with their Turkish Ottoman
overlords who controlled the Balkans for six centuries before being
ousted during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced that the United States will provide
temporary refuge for 20,000 Kosovar refugees at the U.S. Navy base
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as part of an allied commitment to provide
safe haven for 100,000 of the ethnic Albanian Muslim refugees who
have overwhelmed Yugoslavia's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart announced that the United States will provide temporary
refugee status to Kosovar citizens who have been in the United
States since last June, to enable them to remain in the United
States at least for another year.

 &HT;    NEW CASE IN RIO GRANDE VALLEY SPOTLIGHTS BATTLE AGAINST TB

<P>
   LOS FRESNOS _ For 33 students and two teachers, the discovery of
tuberculosis in their middle school will mean months of taking
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   But the detection of an active case of tuberculosis in a
14-year-old student, which came to light during spring break,
underscores the complexity of combating a dread lung disease more
prevalent along the border than in most parts of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Health workers say they may never know how the girl was exposed
to the disease. Tuberculosis is sometimes associated with poverty
and overcrowded conditions, but in this case the sick teen comes
from a middle-class family with parents who work as professionals. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Basically it is a persistent problem and it's been present
(on the border) at double the state rate for many years, and it
continues to be a public health problem that we have to maintain a
great deal of vigilance to deal with,'' said Dr. Brian Smith,
director of &UR;  &LR; the Texas Department of Health's Region 11 in
Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said immigration, along with social and medical factors,
have combined to produce high tuberculosis rates on the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have poverty, overcrowding, and you have lifestyle
problems with alcohol and drug use, and you have a fairly large
foreign-born population that would have been exposed to
tuberculosis sometime in the past,'' Smith said, referring to
higher rates of the disease in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The other big factor, he said, is diabetes _ another problem on
the border _ because that makes people more susceptible to
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials say that since 1992, when more resources and
different strategies were devoted to tuberculosis prevention, the
rates in Texas and the border areas have been steadily declining.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the number of tuberculosis cases statewide has fallen
9 percent from 1997, with a total of 1,820 cases last year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rate along the border has fallen from its peak of
40 cases per 100,000 in 1992 to less than 20 per 100,000 today. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But it is still not surprising, officials say, for the disease
to turn up in local schools, jails, hospitals or nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Los Fresnos is not unusual. Most school
systems sooner or later have a case of tuberculosis,'' Smith said.
``The main thing to remember is to watch for the symptoms and treat
the patients as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Cuates Middle School in Los Fresnos, principal Andres
Lopez said his staff did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said the case came to light on March 18, during the
school's spring break, when the private physician treating the
eighth-grader called the school and the county health department to
report the active case of tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, county and state health workers interviewed
teachers and determined the student had, during her classes and
athletic activities, come in close contact with 134 students,
teachers and coaches. Skin tests were administered to the risk
group, and 34 tested positive for exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a mobile laboratory from the state Health Department
came to the school, and technicians took chest X-rays of those who
had tested positive. Lopez said the X-rays showed none of the
students or teachers had developed tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was done in a expeditious manner, the problem was
addressed, and everything is safe,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   What remains a mystery, health officials say, is how the student
contracted the disease. School officials say the student, who had
attended school in Los Fresnos since the first grade, was current
on her required vaccinations and tuberculosis test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been able to find who might have infected her,''
said Juan Uribe, a registered nurse who is the tuberculosis
coordinator for the Cameron County Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We checked her immediate family and everyone came out fine.
She might have contracted the germ five or six years ago, and it
has just now become a disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Uribe said the student, who is taking her classes at home, has
responded well to a combined therapy of four antibiotics and is
expected to return to school in a few weeks. Her classmates during
the next nine months will take a daily dose of isoniazid, an
anti-bacterial drug, while the adults will undergo six months of
similar treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Health workers say 10 percent of those testing positive for
exposure to tuberculosis eventually develop the disease, usually
much later in life when their immune systems begin to weaken. But
taking the drug therapy after exposure reduces the chance of
developing tuberculosis by 90 percent, health officials said.

   It has been suggested that males, in our species and others, are
more prone to violence than females.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, despite the current academic bias against genetic
explanations for behavior, this evidence does show that males are
indeed more likely to fight, murder, loot, pillage and, of course,
rape, than females.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains, however, whether this apparently innate
male predilection has much to do with war, international relations
and politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the anthropology of war, there is little basis for locating
the wellspring of war in aggressive male instincts _ or in any
instincts, for that matter. Wars are not barroom brawls writ large,
but, as social theorist Robin Fox puts it, ``complicated,
orchestrated, highly organized'' collective undertakings that
cannot be explained by any individual impulse.
</P>
<P>
   No plausible instinct would impel a man to leave his home, cut
his hair short and drill for hours under the hot sun. As
anthropologists Clifton B. Kroeber and Bernard L. Fontana have
pointed out, ``It is a large step from what may be biologically
innate leanings toward individual aggression to ritualized,
socially sanctioned, institutionalized group warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as a 1989 conference on the anthropology of war concluded,
``The hypothesis of a killer instinct is ... not so much irrelevant
as wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the male appetite for battle has always been far less
voracious than either biologically inclined theorists of war or
army commanders might like. In traditional societies, warriors
often had to be taunted, intoxicated or ritually ``transformed''
into animal form before battle.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Western history, individual men have gone to
near-suicidal lengths to avoid participating in wars _ cutting off
fingers or limbs or risking execution by deserting. Prior to the
advent of the nationalist armies of the 19th century, desertion
rates in European armies were so high that, according to historian
Geoffrey Parker, ``at certain times, almost an entire army would
vanish into thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   So unreliable and prone to escape was the rank and file of the
famed 18th-century Prussian army that military manuals forbade
allowing the men to camp near wooded areas. Even in the supposedly
highly motivated armies of 20th-century democracies, few men can
bring themselves to shoot directly at individual enemies _ a fact,
as Lt. Col. Dave Grossman writes in ``On Killing: The Psychological
Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' that has posed a
persistent challenge to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we need not resort to instinctual male
aggressiveness to explain the male near-monopoly on warfare through
time. One reason is clearly biological, resting on men's advantage
in upper body strength _ an undeniable plus when the weapons of war
are heavy swords, spears, pikes, maces or clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation is cultural, or at least as purely cultural
as one can be: In many, if not most, human societies, male
initiation rites feature acts of violence committed by or on the
initiates, and one of the most common of these rites has been
participation in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Through ``blooding a spear,'' a boy proved his manhood _ or
through ordering the bombing of some smaller nation, in the case of
recent American presidents. For an activity to be a male initiatory
rite, it cannot, of course, be open to women and girls. Hence the
widespread taboos on female handling of weapons and, in many cases,
even the tools of peaceable male-dominated crafts.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no reason to think that such initiatory activities
derive from instinctual male proclivities. In some cultural
settings, the young male's initiation to the adult world may be
entirely bloodless, featuring the receipt of a diploma or admission
into a guild.
</P>
<P>
   In others it may be violent in ways not related to war,
involving circumcision, homosexual rape or nose-bleeding induced
with sharp sticks _ activities that few would say are instinctually
driven.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the very purpose of male initiation rites is to
distinguish biological maleness _ which undoubtedly includes a
healthy desire for self-preservation _ from cultural manhood, which
requires a certain amount of self-discipline and even
self-sacrifice for the group (as does cultural womanhood).
</P>
<P>
   Nor can it be assumed that the male monopoly on warfare has been
eternal and universal.
</P>
<P>
   Gravesites recently excavated in Russia contain the remains of
women warriors from the second millennium B.C. _ female skeletons
buried with weapons and bearing wounds inflicted by similar
weapons. The victims of the famous Neolithic massacre at Jebel
Sahaba included both women and men, and there is no evidence that
the perpetrators were exclusively male.
</P>
<P>
   Moving back into the Paleolithic Age, when hunting was probably
the principal form of human violence, growing archaeological
evidence suggests that it was a communal enterprise in which women
and children joined men in driving herds over cliffs into nets or
culs-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   The male-centered hunting strategy that figured so prominently
in the writings of sociobiologists in the 1960s and '70s _ in which
a small band of men stalks an individual animal _ may be a rather
recent innovation, necessitated by declining game populations in
the Mesolithic Age.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient civilizations, some of the earliest deities
worshipped by humans were female, but they were hardly the
nurturing earth mothers imagined by many scholars. The archaic
goddesses unearthed from Mesopotamian ruins or recalled in
Mesoamerican mythology were huntresses and avid consumers of blood
sacrifices, often accompanied or represented by predators such as
lions and leopards.
</P>
<P>
   Only later were these terrifying deities ``tamed'' through
marriage to patriarchical male gods and reassigned to agricultural
duties. Although the characteristics of the archaic goddesses tell
us nothing about the roles of actual women, they do suggest a time
when the association of manhood with violence and of femininity
with peace was not as self-evident as it has seemed in the modern
age.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, whatever our genetic and prehistoric cultural
legacies, women in the past two centuries have more than adequately
demonstrated a capacity for collective violence. They have played a
leading role in nonmilitary violence such as 18th- and 19th-century
bread riots and revolutionary uprisings, in which they were often
reputed to be ``foremost in violence and ferocity.''
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, the Soviet military deployed them as fighter
pilots and in ground combat. Since then, women have served as
terrorists and guerilla fighters in wars of national liberation.
More to the point, women have proved themselves no less susceptible
than men to the passions of militaristic nationalism: Witness
feminist leader Sylvia Pankhurst, who set aside the struggle for
suffrage to mobilize English support for World War I by, for
example, publicly shaming men into enlisting.
</P>
<P>
   Among heads of government, Margaret Thatcher is certainly an
exception to the gender dichotomy. And of course the greatest
pacifist leaders of the 20th century were male: Martin Luther King
Jr. and Mohandas K. Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   Inherent aggressiveness of men and niceness of women? Perhaps
one thing is true: Whatever the innate psychological differences
between the sexes, a certain male propensity for chest-thumping
persists _ and it can be found among desk-dwelling American
scholars as well as alpha apes.

CLINTON NEEDS TO EXPLAIN HOW GOALS WILL BE REACHED  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE APRIL 6 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Monday's brief update by President Clinton on events
in Kosovo illustrated the chief executive's sense of what the
American mission in this bloody region ought to be. He dispensed
the toll-free number Americans can call to contribute to the
refugee-relief effort on behalf of Kosovars in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   While this military mission to the Balkans has not yet devolved
into a Jerry Lewis telethon, precisely what it is, and what it will
become, remains obscure.
</P>
<P>
   With the air attacks against the institutions of Serbian
strongman Slobodan Milosevic approaching their third week, and with
calls for ground troops becoming louder and more seriously
presented, it is time for the president and his advisers to begin
responding to some of the questions being shouted from the press
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start would be to illustrate with some precision
and clarity why we fight.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the March 24 bombing campaign, Clinton offered a
number of often rambling explanations for launching the missiles
and planes. One rationale, presented at a union gathering, involved
some vaguely defined economic imperative. Later, the primary
motivator evolved into protecting the Kosovars from exactly the
kind of industrial-strength ethnic cleansing that now appears to be
occurring (begin ital) because (end ital) of the airstrikes. Which
leads us to the next point the president needs to make:
</P>
<P>
   Are we winning?
</P>
<P>
   If the president and his associates in NATO intend to continue
this air campaign _ and by every indication they do _ then they
need to explain whether or not it is working.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps absolute conclusions are unfair after just two weeks,
but it would appear that even many supporters of the NATO
airstrikes believe the strikes are failing to beat Serbia into
submission.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are they failing, but they look to be producing
precisely the outcome they were designed to protect against.
Clinton argues stridently that the Serbian attacks on
ethnic-Albanian Kosovars would have taken place regardless of the
campaign, but that just raises the question: Why place any American
lives at risk in a campaign that was designed to produce no better
results than doing nothing?
</P>
<P>
   In point of fact, the tactics of this NATO incursion into the
Balkans are resurrecting many of the pale apparitions of war they
were supposed to suppress: Gen. Curtis LeMay's one-legged theory of
victory by air power . . . President Lyndon Johnson's
victory-frustrating incrementalism (Today, Apache attack choppers.
Tomorrow?) . . . dread of the ``domino effect'' . . . and, the
appalling capacity of ruthless Third World despots to simply ignore
the rising body count while they wait you out. Sound at all
familiar?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the president declared our short-term goal as the
provision of refugee relief. Long-term goal: ``Give them the right
to return.''
</P>
<P>
   It would behoove us all if the president would explain in some
detail exactly how he expects to get from here to there. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Years ago in this country, long before Beaujolais was the wine
of choice among first-time drinkers, Valpolicella, a red Italian
wine that can be equally light, fruity and fragrant, was enormously
popular _ and just as importantly, affordable. A staple in
neighborhood Italian restaurants, it was frequently the wine that
inspired people to make their first foray into the wine aisle of a
liquor store or into one of the few wine shops that existed then.
</P>
<P>
   As American tastes grew more sophisticated, Valpolicella was all
but forgotten, a symbol of an era as obsolete as drive-in movie
theaters and cars with fins. It deserved to be. Vastly
overproduced, it was by the 1970s an insipid, forgettable wine.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all of that has changed, thanks to a new generation of
Italian winemakers, many of whom were trained at the Agricultural
Institute in San Floriano in the Valpolicella district in
northeastern Italy. These winemakers are determined to place
quality ahead of quantity, and because of their efforts,
Valpolicella is beginning to take its place among Italy's better
wines.
</P>
<P>
   The Valpolicella region has long been known for its amarones,
extraordinary wines produced from dried grapes. In fact, amarone
will probably always be the region's greatest wine. Where the most
striking improvements have been made in recent years has been in
the traditional table wines, particularly those from the
Valpolicella classico district.
</P>
<P>
   By seeking out the best grapes, by adopting the most modern
viticultural techniques and, mostly, by severely limiting crop
yields, the new generation of winemakers has produced table wines
of a depth and elegance never even dreamed of. What's more, these
winemakers have given new distinction to amarone, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Valpolicella (the word means ``valley of many cellars'' in
Italian) is an extensive area lying between the Bardolino vineyards
along the shore of Lake Garda, northwest of Verona, and the
vineyards of Soave to the east. To the north looms Mount Lessini,
one of the southernmost outcroppings of the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Between the mountain and Verona are flat plains that still
produce dull wines reminiscent of Valpolicella's worst years. But
on the hills northwest of the city, where breezes from Lake Garda
temper the heat on the terraced slopes, are vineyards whose grapes
go into the best traditional wines, both Valpolicella classico and
amarones.
</P>
<P>
   The small, serious winemakers who labor on these hillsides still
have to battle the prevailing economic attitudes of the big wine
companies, which pay growers for high production. In good years, as
many as 5 million cases of Valpolicella are produced, much of
lesser quality. While serious growers limit their yields to three
tons of grapes an acre, the more commercially minded may bring in
three times that.
</P>
<P>
   Producers like Allegrini and Zenato have in recent years made
intense Valpolicella classicos, wines that make most commercial
Valpolicellas seem thin and acidic. Limiting yields means less but
better wine and inevitably higher prices. There are still
inexpensive Valpolicellas on the market, but a good classico from a
single vineyard can cost $20 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Valpolicella is made from four grapes: corvina, rondinella,
molinara and negrara. Corvina, sometimes called corvina Veronese,
is the most important grape, as it is in Bardolino.
</P>
<P>
   To produce amarone, the winemakers take bunches of especially
ripe grapes, mostly corvina, spread them out on trays and then
store them indoors for three or four months until they are shrunken
and dehydrated. The loss of water concentrates the sugar and flavor
elements in the grapes, which, when crushed in late winter, yield a
wine with high alcohol and intense flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional Valpolicella, amarone is aged for three, four
or more years in oak casks. The result is one of Italy's most
powerful red wines, in a class with some Barolos and brunellos. The
names comes from amaro, the word for bitterness, but the wine is
not bitter at all. In fact, it can give the impression of sweetness
because it is so concentrated. Some amarone lovers compare it to
tawny port in richness and flavor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent years, the more innovative producers have come up with
yet another variation on the Valpolicella theme, a wine they call
ripasso. It's made by combining the traditional, light-bodied
Valpolicella with the pomace of amarone. Pomace is the sludge of
skins and seeds left in the presses after the grapes have been
crushed. Adding it to the finished wine restarts fermentation and
produces a stronger, fuller wine that in style is somewhere between
the traditional Valpolicella and the rich, intense amarone.
</P>
<P>
   To confuse things a bit more, there is also a sweet version of
amarone, known simply as recioto della Valpolicella. The grapes for
recioto are dried in the same manner as those used for amarone, but
for several additional months. Recioto is necessarily more of an
aperitif than a table wine.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known names in Valpolicella are Bertani and Bolla,
major wine producers whose labels are known worldwide. They produce
traditional Valpolicellas, as well as amarones. But it is the
less-known producers whose wines have led to renewed interest in
the wines of Valpolicella. In addition to Allegrini and Zenato,
names to look for include Masi, Santi and Tommasi.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting wines from the Valpolicella area is
Allegrini's La Poja, which is made entirely from the corvina grape.
As a result, it can't be called Valpolicella, but it displays much
more body and finesse than most traditional Valpolicellas. It sells
for around $40, when most traditional Valpolicellas are less than
$20.
</P>
<P>
   Also from Allegrini is a single-vineyard Valpolicella called La
Grolas. This is a full-bodied red with intense flavor and a good,
long finish. It sells for about $20.
</P>
<P>
   Amarones vary in price from about $25 _ Beretta's Terre di
Cariano 1990 is about $30 _ to well more than $100. A surprisingly
good 1990 from Bolla is about $35, while a Riserva Sergio Zenato
1990 from Zenato is about $70. A 1991 from Dal Forno Romano was
listed for $135.
</P>
<P>
   These wines are made to accompany roasts, especially game, and
powerful cheeses. At the other end of the line, a simple
Valpolicella, not a classico, from Zenato _ a pleasant table wine
to match with hamburgers or pasta _ costs only $7. There is, truly,
a Valpolicella for everyone.

<P>
   Virtually all feminists who study international politics seek
the laudable goal of greater female participation in all aspects of
foreign relations, from executive mansions and foreign ministries
to militaries and universities.
</P>
<P>
   They disagree as to whether women should get ahead in politics
by demonstrating traditional masculine virtues of toughness,
aggression, competitiveness and the willingness to use force when
necessary _ or whether they should move the agenda of politics away
from male preoccupations with hierarchy and domination.
</P>
<P>
   This ambivalence was demonstrated in the feminist reaction to
Margaret Thatcher, who by any account was far tougher and more
determined than any of the male politicians she came up against.
Thatcher's conservative politics did not endear her to most
feminists, who much prefer a Mary Robinson or Gro Harlem Brundtland
as their model of a female leader, despite _ or because of _ the
fact that Thatcher had beaten men at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent findings and research in genetics and new
biology, it would seem that there is something to the contention of
many feminists that phenomena such as aggression, violence, war and
intense competition for dominance in a status hierarchy are more
closely associated with men than women.
</P>
<P>
   Theories of international relations that see global politics as
a remorseless struggle for power are in fact what feminists call a
gendered perspective, describing the behavior of states controlled
by men. Feminists claim that a world run by women would follow
different rules, and it is toward that sort of world that all
postindustrial or Western societies are moving. As women gain power
in these countries, the argument goes, the latter should become
less aggressive, adventurous, competitive and violent.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem with the feminist view is that it sees attitudes
toward violence, power and status as wholly the products of a
patriarchal culture, whereas in fact it appears they are rooted in
biology. This makes these attitudes harder to change in men and
consequently in societies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rise of women, men will continue to play a major, if
not dominant, part in the governance of postindustrial countries,
not to mention less-developed ones. The realms of war and
international politics in particular will remain controlled by men
for longer than many feminists would like.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the task of resocializing men to be more like
women _ that is, less violent _ will run into strict limits. What
is bred in the bone cannot be altered easily by changes in culture
and ideology.
</P>
<P>
   While some gender roles are indeed socially constructed,
virtually all reputable evolutionary biologists today think there
are profound differences between the sexes that are genetically
rather than culturally rooted, and that these differences extend
beyond the body into the realm of the mind. In no area is
sex-related difference clearer than with respect to violence and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the feminist agenda for international politics seems
fundamentally correct: The violent and aggressive tendencies of men
have to be controlled, not simply by redirecting them to external
aggression but by constraining those impulses through a web of
norms, laws, agreements, contracts and the like.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more women need to be brought into the domain of
international politics as leaders, officials, soldiers and voters.
Only by participating fully in global politics can women both
defend their own interests and shift the underlying male agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The feminization of world politics has, of course, been taking
place gradually over the past hundred years, with very positive
effects. Women have won the right to vote and participate in
politics in all developed countries, as well as in many developing
countries, and have exercised that right with increasing energy.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and other rich countries, a pronounced
gender gap with regard to foreign policy and national security
issues endures. American women have always been less supportive
than American men of U.S. involvement in war, including World War
II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War, by an average margin
of 7 percent to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They are also consistently less supportive of defense spending
and the use of force abroad. In a 1995 Roper survey conducted for
the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, men favored U.S.
intervention in Korea, in the event of a North Korean attack, by a
margin of 49 percent to 40 percent, while women were opposed by a
margin of 30 percent to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, U.S. military action against Iraq, in the event it
invaded Saudi Arabia, was supported by men by a margin of 62
percent to 31 percent and opposed by women by 43 percent to 45
percent. While 54 percent of men felt it important to maintain
superior worldwide military power, only 45 percent of women agreed.
Women, moreover, are less likely than men to see force as a
legitimate tool for resolving conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know how to account for this gender gap.
Observers have suggested various reasons why women are less willing
to use military force than men, including their role as mothers,
the fact that many women are feminists (that is, committed to a
left-of-center agenda that is generally hostile to U.S.
intervention), and partisan affiliation (more women vote Democratic
than men).
</P>
<P>
   It is unnecessary to know the reason for the correlation between
gender and antimilitarism, however, to predict that increasing
female political participation will probably make the United States
and other democracies less inclined to use power around the world
as freely as they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Will this shift toward a less status- and
military-power-oriented world be a good thing? For relations
between states in the so-called democratic zone of peace, the
answer is yes. Consideration of gender adds a great deal to the
past decade's vigorous and interesting debate over the correlation
between democracy and peace.
</P>
<P>
   The ``democratic peace'' argument, which underlies the foreign
policy of the Clinton administration as well as its predecessors,
is that democracies tend not to fight one another. The reasons
usually cited by democratic peace theorists for why democracies are
pacific toward one another _ the rule of law, respect for
individual rights, the commercial nature of most democracies and
the like _ are undoubtedly correct.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another factor that has generally not been taken
into account. Developed democracies also tend to be more feminized
than authoritarian states, in terms of the expansion of female
franchise and female participation in political decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   It should therefore surprise no one that the historically
unprecedented shift in the sexual basis of politics should lead to
a change in international relations. On the other hand, if gender
roles are not simply socially constructed but rooted in genetics,
there will be limits on the extent to which international politics
can change.
</P>
<P>
   Some feminists talk as if gender identities can be discarded
like an old sweater, perhaps by putting young men through mandatory
gender-studies courses when they are college freshmen. Indeed, male
attitudes on a host of issues, from child-rearing and housework to
``getting in touch with your feelings,'' have changed dramatically
in the past couple of generations because of social pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But socialization can accomplish only so much, and efforts to
fully feminize young men will probably be no more successful than
the Soviet Union's efforts were to persuade its people to work on
Saturdays on behalf of the heroic Cuban and Vietnamese people.
</P>
<P>
   Male tendencies to band together for competitive purposes, to
seek to dominate status hierarchies and to act out aggressive
fantasies toward one another can be rechanneled _ but never
eliminated. What's more, in anything but a totally feminized world,
feminized policies could be a liability.
</P>
<P>
   Even if we can assume peaceful relations between democracies,
the broader world scene will still be populated by states led by
the occasional Slobodan Milosevic or Saddam Hussein. Even if the
democratic, feminized, postindustrial world has evolved into a zone
of peace where struggles are more economic than military, it will
still have to deal with those parts of the world run by
power-wielding, ambitious, unconstrained men.

COLLECTOR DREAMS OF RV MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A man's dreams are as unique as his DNA code. So it's
inevitable that some are a little strange.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, David Woodworth hopes to open a museum devoted to
recreational vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major part of American history that no one knows much
about,'' he explained Monday afternoon from inside _ what else? _
an RV. Woodworth was parked at the Welcome Home RV campground in
Phoenix, a stop on the National RV History Tour, which is sponsored
by the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   He greeted a trickle of visitors from inside a 1999 Winnebago, a
34-footer worth $125,000 that has a full bedroom, a couch, a
television (with VCR) and bathroom with enough water stored for a
week's worth of showers and washing. The bedroom and living room
double in width with the push of a button. It's a neat trick that,
when done in reverse, makes you feel like the victim in one of
those movies where the walls squeeze in menacingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering it's a vehicle, it's really not too shabby,''
Woodworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the 1921 Lamsteed Kampkar he's towing along with him. It
sleeps four, has a two-burner stove, a pantry, a clothes chest and
running water (although you could park the entire thing inside the
living room of the Winnebago). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Inaccurate stereotype &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But still. An entire museum dedicated to RVs? We see a lot of
them in Arizona, and they conjure up a familiar image: A giant land
cruiser driven by a geezer with wraparound sunglasses, plodding
along at 25 mph in the passing lane of the interstate, emergency
lights blinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not accurate,'' Woodworth said of the image. In fact,
according to a University of Michigan study, which Woodworth quotes
with ease, 40 percent of RV owners are 55 and older while 45
percent are between 35 and 54. The Recreation Vehicle Industry
Association says that the average age is 48.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a lot of people coming down here in the winter months
who are retired,'' said Woodworth, who is 58 and retired (he was a
minister) but assures he drives the speed limit. ``That helps skew
the image.''
</P>
<P>
   And increase the blood pressure, but that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Woodworth is an RV enthusiast is to say that Dick
Vitale has a passing interest in basketball. When a few people
gathered in his mobile living room, he said, ``Let me give you a
quick history lesson.'' And he did, including a brief reading from
a dusty, well-worn book on the subject. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Road warrior &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors were looking for advice, others for RVs. Katy
Koivastik of Phoenix hoped Woodworth could hook her up with a
silver 1950s teardrop model for some desolate property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be neat to have one sitting out in the
middle of the desert,'' she said, laughing. ``For guests. Leave 'em
out with the coyotes.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodworth owns a home in Tehachapi, Calif., that doesn't have
wheels, but it's what else he owns that tips you off to his
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only own 30 (RVs) right now,'' he said, ``but I am looking
for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Did I say interest? Make that obsession. But obsession is
sometimes what it takes to make dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really need is someone that will co-op with me,'' he
said of his museum plans. Certainly, his collection forms the basis
for a good start, including a 1914 trailer model that carries this
gem of a slogan: ``It follows you like a shadow and unfolds like
the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodworth is confident his dream will be realized. Witnessing
the glee he gave off in the living room of the Winnebago made that
seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take you long to get used to this,'' he said,
sweeping an arm around the room. ``It's like saying, `I'm not used
to living with a million dollars in my checking account.' I
guarantee you'd get accustomed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The money, yes. The RV, probably. The wraparound shades . . .
those are a tougher sell. &QL;

TIPPING GUIDELINES: A HELP OR ARM-TWISTING

<TEXT>
<P>
   Restaurants aren't sure that customers get the idea about tips.
Customers seem to have this notion that they're voluntary, a show
of appreciation, something that's only done because they feel like
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the tip is just part of the game _ and a growing number
of restaurants are trying to lay down the rules and make it easier
for diners to do what they are expected to do.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants _ like the new Coach House in New York _ have
tried calculating a 15 percent tip and adding it on to the bill,
just like an extra appetizer or entree.
</P>
<P>
   Others _ like Lula in Santa Monica, Calif. _ are printing
``gratuity guidelines'' on their checks, and calculating what a 15
or 20 percent tip should be.
</P>
<P>
   A few _ like Restaurant Daniel _ are setting mandatory tips of
20 percent on groups as small as six.
</P>
<P>
   And many more places _ including the Union Square Cafe and the
Palm Court in New York _ are determindly looking for ways to
provoke diners into leaving a large-enough tip, while not provoking
them so much that they'll never come back.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a bumpy experiment so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't like to be told what to tip,'' said Barry
Wine, a New York restaurant consultant. ``We the customer want the
power to reward good service and penalize bad service.''
</P>
<P>
   But restaurateurs aren't giving up.
</P>
<P>
   The ``gratuity guideline'' or a ``suggested gratuity'' is the
most common ploy so far. The restaurants list a variety of tips _
usually 15, 18 and 20 percent _ calculated from your bill. The tip
is not added to the total but the implication is clear: tip within
the given range.
</P>
<P>
   Offering tip calculations, said Karen Kraushaar, a spokesperson
for the National Restaurant Association, is ``quicker for the
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier,'' she said. ``It's a convenience, there's no
question.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not quite the reaction most diners have. ``It's kind
of tacky,'' said Jay Goswick, an anesthesiologist in Los Angeles.
When he and his wife recently had dinner at Lula and the bill came
with a gratuity guideline, Goswick was taken aback. You can only
patronize the patron so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny to see that this was the tip they thought you
should leave,'' Goswick said. ``It would make me more critical,
make me question do they deserve that much?''
</P>
<P>
   Z-Tejas Grill in Austin, Texas, has been telling diners how much
to tip for six months. ``You kind of get mixed reviews,'' said Doug
Young, the general manager at the restaurant. Some diners have
complained, he said, saying that the restaurant is trying to force
them into leaving 15 percent. The servers, however, like the
system. ``It has 20 percent on there,'' Young said, ``and if you
give good service then you usually get 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping servers happy is important during a time when they are
in great demand _ and short supply. Tips generally make up at least
80 percent of a server's salary, so they are built into the
restaurant economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tipping does vary,'' Ms. Kraushaar said. And calculating tips
for diners ``is a way of trying to establish some consistency in
tipping _ that's why it could be worth trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that make the software used to calculate guest checks
and print credit card receipts say there is a growing interest in
programs that calculate tips. American Express developed a gratuity
calculation feature on its terminals last year. ``Merchants wanted
it,'' said Judy Tenzer, a company spokeswoman. Restaurants can
request the feature, and can then choose the tip levels they want
printed on the check.
</P>
<P>
   Micros, a maker of sales terminals with more than 1,400
restaurant clients in New York and New Jersey, has received several
requests for the program over the past nine months. One of them was
from the Union Square Cafe, which has for years been at the
forefront of service in American dining.
</P>
<P>
   An employee at the restaurant saw a gratuity guideline on a
check at a small Chinese restaurant in northern New Jersey, and
brought it to the attention of the management. They immediately
took an interest in the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem it's trying to solve is universal,'' said Paul
Bolles-Beaven, a managing partner at the restaurant. ``Sometimes
people leave a low tip and it's not an indication of poor service.
Maybe they're having a bad math experience or they've had a little
more wine than is normal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, they had considered ways of incorporating tips into
the price of the meal. They discussed this new idea for several
months and asked Micros to develop a way to integrate it into their
current system. ``On the positive side, we felt it could feel like
a service to the guest, '' Bolles-Beaven said. ``On the negative
side, we felt it could take what is currently a discretionary thing
and add some arm twisting to it.''
</P>
<P>
   When they asked some of their regular guests if they thought
they should proceed with the program, though, the response was a
unanimous no. And the idea was promptly buried.
</P>
<P>
   But restaurateurs and consultants say that New York is unique in
respect to tipping. First of all, calculating tips is made easier
by New York state tax, which, if doubled, equals 16{ percent. But,
also, said Steve Hanson, the owner of Ruby Foo's Dim Sum and Sushi
Palace and several other restaurants on the Upper West Side, New
Yorkers consider themselves more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can calculate what two percent points can be,'' he said.
And they don't want to be told.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception used to be that parties of eight or more were
charged a set tip, usually 15 percent. Now, in many Manhattan
restaurants, like Le Bernardin, Bolo and Gotham Bar &AMP; Grill,
parties of just six are charged an automatic gratuity, and often as
high as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When the new Coach House recently opened, the restaurant, which
has a fixed priced menu, tried tagging on a 15 percent service
charge to all checks. ``It was a way of establishing that you come
in and you know this is what you're going to pay for a meal,'' said
Kirk Reed, the general manager of the restaurant. ``It was trying
to simplify things but it ended up making things less simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Some diners failed to notice the service charge _ which was
listed on the bill along with other food and beverage charges. So
they added a second tip. A blank line below the total, marked
``gratuity,'' didn't help matters.
</P>
<P>
   But the other drawback to this was that, in New York, when
service charges are added to a bill, they must be added before tax,
which means that the tip is taxed.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant has since gone back to a traditional
discretionary tipping system.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Michael's restaurant, in New York City and Santa
Monica, added 15 percent service charges to all checks. Michael
McCarty, the owner of the restaurants, converted back to an
optional tipping system last year. To his surprise, the average tip
in both locations is now closer to 20 percent. ``All these years we
gave our clients a bargain at 15 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He remains adamant that service charges are a more civilized way
of doing business, but is tired of trying to win over diners.
``You're really wasting your time, if you're trying to dictate to
people what to leave,'' he said. ``People are independent.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is one of few countries where voluntary
tipping is customary. In Europe, a tip of 10 to 15 percent is
almost always included in the bill. Many travelers visiting the
United States for the first time simply do not know to tip.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, heavy snow driven by gusty winds
dramatically lowered visibility in the mountains east of Los
Angeles as a potent low pressure system in the cold upper
atmosphere drifted overhead. On Wednesday, the formidable but
lethargic disturbance will be encouraged to move eastward by a
rainy disturbance headed toward the West Coast from the Gulf of
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   A powder keg of humid air surging into the southern Plains from
the Gulf of Mexico will heighten the risk of powerful thunderstorms
Wednesday night from western Kansas to northwestern Texas as the
disturbance approaches Wednesday evening. The storms will erupt
along a dry line, a boundary that marks the separation of humid air
from the Gulf of Mexico and dry air from the Rockies. A few of the
storms could reach severe levels, spawning tornadoes, large hail or
damaging straight-line winds. Wednesday afternoon, a few storms may
ignite along the dry line, but they will be rather isolated and
probably not sufficiently strong to spawn severe weather.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will develop in western Washington and Oregon on Wednesday
and then spread south to California later Wednesday and Wednesday
night as the disturbance from the Gulf of Alaska plunges
southeastward.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, warmer air will spread to much of the Eastern states
in the wake of a disturbance lifting northeastward across eastern
Canada, though northern New England will stay rather chilly. Winds
from the west will average 15 to 25 mph with higher gusts along the
Northeast seaboard. Isolated thunderstorms will sprout in the
Southeast states.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: April Tornadoes
</P>
<P>
   With regard to the monthly tally of tornadoes, May is the most
active, on average, with over 160 twisters nationally. June is a
close second. But April holds the dubious distinction of spawning
more killer tornadoes. With the speedy jet stream continuing to
derive energy from large north-south temperature contrasts in
April, robust Pacific disturbances still come ashore and then forge
slowly east toward the Plains. Ahead of the system, humid air
streams inland from increasingly tepid waters of the Gulf of
Mexico. When potent disturbances meet high humidity, killer
twisters can result.

<P>
   The United States, as Zbigniew Brzezinski once said, will be the
first, last and only global superpower.
</P>
<P>
   American officials quite naturally tend to act as if the world
were unipolar. They boast of American power and American virtue,
hailing the United States as a benevolent hegemon. They lecture
other countries on the universal validity of American principles,
practices and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright calls the United States
``the indispensable nation'' and said that ``we stand tall and
hence see further than other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement is true in the narrow sense that the United
States is an indispensable participant in any effort to tackle
major global problems. It is false in implying that other nations
are dispensable, and that American indispensability is the source
of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet
Union, the United States was often able to impose its will on other
countries. That unipolar moment has passed. Today the two principal
tools of coercion that the United States attempts to use are
economic sanctions and military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions work, however, only when other countries also support
them, and that is decreasingly the case. Hence, the United States
either applies them unilaterally to the detriment of its economic
interests and its relations with allies, or it does not enforce
them, in which case they become symbols of American weakness.
</P>
<P>
   At relatively low cost, the United States can launch bombing or
cruise-missile attacks against its enemies. Yet by themselves, such
actions achieve little. More serious military interventions have to
meet three conditions. They must be legitimated through some
international organization, such as the United Nations, where they
are subject to Russian, Chinese or French veto. They also require
the participation of allied forces, which may or may not be
forthcoming. And they have to involve no American casualties and
virtually no ``collateral'' casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the United States meets all three conditions, it risks
stirring up not only criticism at home but widespread political and
popular backlash abroad.
</P>
<P>
   American officials seem peculiarly blind to the fact that often
the more the United States attacks a foreign leader, the more his
popularity soars among countrymen who applaud him for standing tall
against the greatest power on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The demonizing of leaders has so far failed to shorten their
tenure in power, from Fidel Castro (who has survived eight American
presidents) to Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein. Indeed, the
best way for a dictator of a small country to prolong his tenure in
power may be to provoke the United States into denouncing him as
the leader of a ``rogue regime'' and a threat to global peace.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that neither the Clinton administration nor Congress
nor the public is willing to pay the costs and accept the risks of
unilateral global leadership. Some advocates of American leadership
argue for increasing defense expenditures by 50 percent, but that
is a nonstarter. The American public clearly sees no need to expend
effort and resources to achieve American hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   However much foreign-policy elites may ignore or deplore it, the
United States lacks the domestic political base to create a
unipolar world. By acting as if this were a unipolar world, the
United States becomes increasingly alone among nations. American
leaders constantly claim to be speaking on behalf of ``the
international community.'' But whom do they have in mind? China?
Russia? India? Pakistan? Iran? The Arab world? The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations? Africa? Latin America? France? Do any of
these countries or regions see the United States as the spokesman
for a community of which they are a part?
</P>
<P>
   The community for which the United States speaks includes, at
best, its Anglo-Saxon cousins (Britain, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand) on most issues, Germany and some smaller European
democracies on many issues, Israel on some Middle Eastern questions
and Japan on the implementation of U.N. resolutions. These are
important states, but they fall far short of being the global
international community.
</P>
<P>
   On issue after issue, the United States has found itself
increasingly alone, with one or a few partners, opposing most of
the rest of the world's states and peoples. These issues include
U.N. dues; the land mines treaty; global warming; an international
war crimes tribunal; the Middle East; the use of force against Iraq
and Yugoslavia; and sanctions against Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   On these and other issues, much of the international community
is on one side and the United States is on the other. The circle of
governments who see their interests coinciding with American
interests is shrinking. While the United States regularly denounces
various countries as ``rogue states,'' in the eyes of many
countries it is becoming the rogue superpower.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1997 Harvard conference, scholars reported that the elites
of countries comprising at least two-thirds of the world's people _
Chinese, Russians, Indians, Arabs, Muslims and Africans _ see the
United States as the single greatest external threat to their
societies.
</P>
<P>
   They do not regard America as a military threat but as a menace
to their integrity, autonomy, prosperity and freedom of action.
They view the United States as intrusive, interventionist,
exploitative, unilateralist, hegemonic, hypocritical and applying
double standards, engaging in what they label ``financial
imperialism'' and ``intellectual colonialism,'' with a foreign
policy driven overwhelmingly by domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Such reactions are to be expected. American leaders believe that
the world's business is their business. However, other countries
believe that what happens in their part of the world is their
business, not America's, and quite explicitly respond.
</P>
<P>
   In a bipolar world, many countries welcomed the United States as
their protector against the Soviet Union. In today's world, in
contrast, the world's only superpower is automatically a threat to
other major powers.
</P>
<P>
   It would behoove Americans to stop acting and talking as if this
were a unipolar world. It is not. To deal with any major global
issue, the United States needs the cooperation of at least some
major powers. Unilateral sanctions and interventions are recipes
for foreign-policy disasters.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders also should abandon the benign-hegemon illusion
that a natural congruity exists between their interests and their
values and those of the rest of the world. It does not. At times,
American actions may promote public goods and serve more widely
accepted ends. But often they will not, in part because of the
unique moralistic component in American policy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also simply because America is the only superpower,
and hence its interests necessarily differ from those of other
countries. This makes America unique _ but certainly not benign in
the eyes of those countries.

   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Wednesday afternoon, between the matinee and
evening performance of ``Phantom of the Opera,'' Jacqueline Langee
will step onto the stage of New York's Majestic Theatre for the
first time in nearly half a century. When she closes her eyes,
Langee will be able to hear the quiet roar of anticipation from her
opening night audience, April 7, 1949. That was some enchanted
evening.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that night, 50 years ago, that Rodgers and
Hammerstein's ``South Pacific'' made its Broadway debut, and made
musical theater history. Jackie Langee _ now a resident of
Gainesville _ was part of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   The reunion is being organized by the New York-based Rodgers &AMP;
Hammerstein Organization, keen to commemorate one of the duo's most
beloved collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have four people coming in from England, one from
Australia, and there are 14 or 15 coming from the coast,'' said
Langee, 73. ``It's very exciting, but it's also sad. Fifty years is
a long time, a lifetime practically for a lot of people, and some
of them aren't there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the four leads, all of whom won Tony Awards for the
show: Ezio Pinza, Mary Martin, Myron McCormick and Juanita Hall.
Composer Richard Rodgers, lyricist Oscar Hammerstein, producer
Leland Heyward and director Josh Logan have passed away, too.
</P>
<P>
   Based on James Michener's World War II collection of short
stories, ``Tales of the South Pacific,'' the musical concerns a
company of Naval men and women stationed on an island not far from
Japanese territory. Nurse Nellie Forbush (a tomboyish Martin in the
original cast) falls for older man Emile DeBeque (Pinza, then a
popular bass with the Metropolitan Opera), a French planter living
on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers and Hammerstein's score was at once ethereal, gritty and
hummable, including the now-classic songs ``Some Enchanted
Evening,'' ``There is Nothing Like a Dame,'' ``Bloody Mary'' and
``Bali Hai.'' One of Langee's favorites, ``You've Got to Be
Carefully Taught,'' backed up a secondary plotline about a romance
between a white American lieutenant and a native girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodgers said backstage that someone had raised eyebrows at the
dark skin/light skin romance,'' Langee recalled. ``Racial prejudice
was a major theme of the show. Rodgers and Hammerstein were very
idealistic people.'' Raised eyebrows notwithstanding, ``South
Pacific'' was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Langee _ she was Jacqueline Fisher then _ played nurse Genevieve
Marshall. One of her big numbers, with Nellie and the other women,
was ``I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out Of My Hair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great company,'' she said. ``There was almost a
family feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Langee's own family came from Miami. She was born there, and
lived near Miami Beach until the hurricane of 1926. Her father had
a drugstore and some real estate. ``After the storm there was no
roof on the house, and all that was left of the drugstore was a
tile floor,'' she said. So the Fishers moved to Parkersburg, W.
Va., where they had relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie's alto voice was a source of pride in the family. At age
16, she was accepted into the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. She
graduated four years later and moved to New York City, where she
found work singing classical music.
</P>
<P>
   Her first Broadway show, ``Inside U.S.A.,'' was a musical revue
with Beatrice Lily and Jack Haley. Nine months into it, in 1948,
she auditioned for ``South Pacific.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers and Hammerstein, known at the time for ``Oklahoma!'' and
``Carousel,'' needed a hit. Their last show, ''Allegro,'' had been
only a modest success.
</P>
<P>
   Langee said she had five auditions for the show. The composers
attended all the auditions, along with director Logan and producer
Heyward. Rodgers told her they heard 2,500 women sing, before
choosing six nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Langee was 23 when she won the part and stayed with ``South
Pacific'' a little less than two years. The show ran for 1,925
performances. And a hit it was: ``As lively, warm, fresh and
beautiful as we had all hoped it would be,'' raved Brooks Atkinson
in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   After ``South Pacific,'' Langee continued to sing in New York,
including several seasons as a soloist at Radio City Music Hall.
She married Harvey Langee during the run of ``South Pacific'' and
moved to California in the late '50s when he was accepted to
Stanford Medical School. After a decade in Palo Alto, Calif., the
Langees _ four children in tow _ moved to Gainesville, where
Harvey, a psychiatrist, joined the University of Florida faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Langee earned master's and specialist degrees in
counselor education at UF, and sang often at campus events during
the '70s and '80s. She also ran the office for her husband's
private practice, from which he retired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Among her treasured mementos from ``South Pacific'' is a small
silver box given to each cast member by the composers, producer and
director on the show's first anniversary. It is inscribed with
their signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Looking into its reflective surface, Langee can go back 50
years, back to that spring New York night when she helped make the
magic happen, when Broadway made ``South Pacific'' the toast of the
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say that being on the Majestic stage again, just to
stand there, is exciting,'' she said. ``One of my friends, when I
told her we were going to do it, she said she got tears. Well, I
got chills.''

<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary _ The fate of the turn-of-the-century Budapest
architect Lipot Baumhorn and his work can be seen as a metaphor for
the modern Jewish experience in Hungary: optimism, splendor,
destruction, oblivion and, since the fall of communism, rediscovery
and revival.
</P>
<P>
   A disciple of Odon Lechner, the founder of Hungary's distinctive
national Art Nouveau style, Baumhorn designed everything from banks
to private houses. He achieved his fame, however, as a designer of
synagogues: he was the most prolific and perhaps the most renowned
synagogue architect in modern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Baumhorn, his buildings, and their social and
architectural significance, are being celebrated in an exhibition
sponsored by the Jewish Museum and Museum of Architecture, both in
Budapest. With Gyorgy Szego, an art historian, and Andras Hadik, an
architecture historian, as curators, the exhibition is the first
definitive exposition of Baumhorn's work. It runs through May at
the Jewish Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Baumhorn anniversary in 1999, but such an
exhibition could not be put off any longer,'' Szego said. ``Besides
showing the architect and his work, we wanted to draw attention to
the fact that some of his buildings are in very bad and unworthy
condition, treated unkindly by history and, so it seems, by
posterity.''
</P>
<P>
   Baumhorn was born in 1860. Between 1888 and his death in 1932,
he designed or remodeled more than two dozen synagogues across
Hungary and areas that today include parts of Romania, Slovenia,
Croatia, Slovakia and Yugoslavia. He also designed other Jewish
communal buildings, as well as a number of synagogues that were
never built.
</P>
<P>
   Many were grandiose domed and turreted structures with opulent
interior decoration heavy with mosaics, stained glass and gilding:
synagogues that were prominent local landmarks as well as houses of
worship.
</P>
<P>
   After the Holocaust, his work and its importance were largely
ignored. Then, under communism, most of his synagogues were torn
down or transformed into things like art galleries and sports
halls. Some, like the once grand synagogue in Lucenec, Slovakia,
were left standing but are nearly in ruins. Only about half a dozen
are still used for prayer.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, Baumhorn's tombstone in Budapest's main
Jewish cemetery was invisible under a thick shroud of shrubs and
ivy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a synagogue builder, Baumhorn ran counter to the ideals of
atheist communist society,'' said Robert Ben Turan, the director of
the Jewish Museum. ``Even the surviving Jewish community in Hungary
had little idea of his work and influence.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition presents not just Baumhorn's buildings but also
the changing architectural, social and political contexts in which
they were created. Szego and Hadik scoured archives and city
planning offices in Budapest and in the provinces to bring together
scores of original, exquisitely detailed architectural plans,
drawings and blueprints, as well as period photographs, picture
postcards and Baumhorn's own striking watercolors.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the material came from papers that Baumhorn's son-in-law
Gyorgy Somogyi, an architect who collaborated on several of
Baumhorn's synagogues, had willed to the Jewish Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Designs by several other architects are included to demonstrate
Baumhorn's relation to contemporaries like Bela Lajta, Erno Foerk,
Dezso Jakab and Marcell Komor. Of particular interest are the
juxtaposed competing designs by Baumhorn and other architects
submitted in an 1899 competition for a planned but never built
synagogue in Budapest's rich downtown Lipotvaros district. All are
monumental structures with enormous domes and sumptuous decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Letters, contracts, workbooks, news clippings and other
documents show the architect as a consummate entrepreneur as well
as an artist in his dealings with contractors, craftsmen, financial
donors and Jewish communal officials. If anything is missing from
the exhibition, it is a clear sense of the postwar fate of
Baumhorn's synagogues. Little material documents the destruction
and degradation that Szego wished to underscore.
</P>
<P>
   But photographs, designs and decorative mock-ups, for example,
show the construction of the synagogue in Gyongyos, in northern
Hungary, built in 1931 to replace an old synagogue damaged by fire
in 1917. In 1990, however, the new building was converted into a
housewares store. A marvelous photograph shows an elderly Baumhorn,
in top hat and wearing a prayer shawl, standing proudly with Jewish
community and municipal leaders at the synagogue's opening.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhorn's masterpiece, the magnificent Great Synagogue in
Szeged, exemplifies this confidence: opened in 1903, it is an
eclectic mix of styles, bristling with cupolas, turrets, tracery
and other ornamental effects. Even the trees planted in the
synagogue yard were chosen to set off the soaring architectural
lines. Restoration of the Szeged synagogue was completed in 1989.
It is used occasionally for services by its small congregation but
otherwise as a site for municipally sponsored concerts.
</P>
<P>
   When Baumhorn's tomb was cleared of vines and creepers several
years ago, a carved list of 23 synagogues he worked on was revealed
on its face. There was also a carved relief of the dome of the
Szeged synagogue, along with an epitaph by the Szeged rabbi that
was as opulent as any of Baumhorn's creations:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our inspired artist: His inspiration and heart gave birth to
the lines of synagogues that look toward heaven and awaken piety.
Above his peaceful home hovered devotion; the soul of a father and
husband gave birth to heaven-seeking consolation.''

AUSTIN, IN THE BIG TIME, GETS AN AIRPORT TO MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., April 11) 
(jt) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Robert Mueller Municipal Airport is three miles
from the state capitol. That's what's good about it. Otherwise,
it's small, overcrowded and poorly laid out, and parking is almost
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   As this bucolic university town and government center has grown
and mutated over the last decade into one of the country's leading
high-tech centers, home to Dell Computers and a galaxy of other
technology firms as well as more than a million residents, the old
infrastructure _ the hotels, the highways and the airport _ has
become strained and clogged.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why many who live in Austin, and many more who travel
to it on a regular basis, are eagerly awaiting the opening next
month of the gleaming new Austin-Bergstrom International Airport,
built on a shuttered air base eight miles southeast of the capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything at the new airport is different,'' said Jamy
Kazanoff, the airport's chief spokeswoman. ``The old problems
regarding parking are over. You'll have twice as many parking
spaces, twice as many baggage carousels, 25 gates compared to 16,
parallel runways to allow simultaneous takeoffs and landings, a
covered garage and a split upper and lower roadway so all the
curbside congestion at Mueller shouldn't happen.'' At its opening,
the new airport will be able to handle twice the current level of
17,000 passengers a day.
</P>
<P>
   Development is a bit of a dirty word in Austin, a brainy and
laid-back city at the edge of the Texas Hill Country where a slow
and easy quality of life is cherished. But even the city's
pro-green mayor, Kirk Watson _ his slate's slogan was: ``Austin or
L.A.? Our City. Our Choice'' _ has embraced the new airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been talking about what to do about Mueller
Airport since the 1970s,'' Ms. Kazanoff said. ``Then when the
federal government closed down Bergstrom Air Force Base in 1990,
the city saw it as a real opportunity. The mayor likes to say we
made lemonade out of lemons. Base closures typically depress a
community, but we're using one to build our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller Airport opened in 1930 and was expanded several times
until it had filled its 711 acres and just couldn't expand any
more. It also suddenly found itself in a growing neighborhood where
some 30,000 residents were living in the airport's noise zone. (The
new airport, in the middle of the old military base, should rattle
no one's china, Ms. Kazanoff says.)
</P>
<P>
   Passenger traffic at the old airport grew with the city. Last
December, Mueller celebrated the arrival of its six millionth
passenger of the year, which is millions more than the airport
would have handled a decade ago. From 1997 to 1998, air cargo
traffic to Austin also increased about 40 percent, to 2.4 billion
pounds of cargo, most of it high-tech stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Austin voters approved a bond issue for the new airport in 1993,
and construction, with a budget of $585 million, is just about
finished. Cargo planes have been using the new field since June of
1997, and the first passenger flight is expected to arrive at the
grand opening on May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of coming into the confusing labyrinth of Mueller
Airport, visitors will arrive at the crescent-shaped Barbara Jordan
Passenger Terminal, a sun-filled space of granite and glass that,
designers promise, will be easy to navigate. At 600,000 square
feet, the four-story terminal is triple the size of the old one.
</P>
<P>
   Bergstrom's longest runway _ a 12,250-footer inherited from the
air base _ is now long enough for the largest jumbo jets and for
nonstop flights overseas, both impossible at Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Ms. Kazanoff said, Bergstrom will have room to
expand, to as many as 55 gates.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the city's high-tech role, a central Market
Place will include, along with outposts of local restaurants like
Schlotzsky's Deli and the Salt Lick for barbecue, the Highland
Lakes Bar, with internet access, where travelers can check e-mail
or work while they wait.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that the new airport will not have when it opens
is adequate highways. ``The highway projects are under way, but
they take longer to get finished than an airport does,'' Ms.
Kazanoff said.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest concern among Austin residents and cabdrivers is
that some of the traffic in and out of the airport will pass
through what is already among the most congested highway
intersections in the city: the junction of Highway 71 and
Interstate 35 just south of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   This could force traffic headed into the city to forsake I-35
and use the surface streets of East Austin. But the problem will be
solved when the airport-related highway projects are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ms. Kazanoff said, most of the people traveling to the
airport are coming from the high-tech centers and neighborhoods on
the city's north and northwest sides. Only about 20 percent come
from the southwest of the city, the area that faces the bottleneck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic in Austin is a problem any way you look at it,'' Ms.
Kazanoff said. ``It's a headache for some, but it means Austin is
growing. We've lazed along the Colorado River for years and now
we're a high-tech center. So that comes with the territory.''

FORMER YELTSIN ALLY SCOFFS AT ARREST WARRANT 
</HEADLINE>

 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's chief prosecutor issued an arrest warrant
Tuesday for Boris Berezovsky, the tycoon and political mover who
has taken a sensational tumble from the graces of Russian high
finance and of President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the prosecutor's office said Berezovsky and Nikolai
Glushkov, a former senior official of the Russian airline Aeroflot,
had been charged with money-laundering and ``illegal
entrepreneurship'' for allegedly diverting foreign currency from
Aeroflot to a company in Geneva that they control.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky has long been said to be a dominant figure in
Aeroflot, although he denies owning even one share of stock in
either the airline or in the Geneva company, Andava. Tuesday's
charges, the first from a fusillade of recent government
investigations of Berezovsky's business empire, would seem to
signal that his days as a political and financial power are, at
best, numbered.
</P>
<P>
   But then virtually nothing done by Russia's house-of-mirrors
government can be taken at face value. And with the prosecutor's
office itself at the epicenter of a seamy sex-and-blackmail
scandal, some suggest that Berezovsky's downfall was staged to keep
him from trying to implicate Yeltsin's inner circle in the sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   That appears unlikely, though skeptics noted that prosecutors
chose to issue the warrant while Berezovsky was in France, beyond
the immediate reach of the flaccid arm of Russian law.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's spokesman said Tuesday that Yeltsin had not known that
an arrest warrant would be issued for Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, in an interview with journalists in Paris, greeted
the warrant with contempt. He called his accusers ``shameless and
dimwitted'' and dismissed rumors that he would seek asylum rather
than return to face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, a onetime car dealer who somehow parlayed currency
trading into a fortune in the wild early days of post-Soviet
Russia, was a principal backer of Yeltsin's 1996 re-election
campaign and at one time a close adviser. A year ago Yeltsin named
him secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the frayed
alliance of most of the nations that had been part of the old
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   But as Yeltsin's health and power have ebbed, Berezovsky has
became a target both of corruption inquiries and of Yeltsin's
critics _ especially Communists _ who considered Berezovsky a prime
example of the seamy excesses of Russian-style capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor general, Yuri Skuratov, who has strong Communist
backing, was among the investigators. After Yeltsin sought
unsuccessfully to fire Skuratov early this year _ and the
state-controlled television broadcast videotape of the prosecutor
cavorting in bed with two prostitutes _ Communists and some other
critics accused Yeltsin's office of trying to quash probes into
Berezovsky's dealings.
</P>
<P>
   They have suggested that Berezovsky holds secrets that could
ruin the Yeltsin presidency. And when audiotapes surfaced this
winter of private conversations between Berezovsky and Yeltsin's
daughter Tanya Dyachenko, who is her father's close adviser, some
took it as a veiled warning from Berezovsky that efforts to topple
him could bring down Yeltsin's family, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin has since dismissed Berezovsky from his post as
commonwealth secretary, and outwardly the estrangement between the
president and the tycoon appears real. While Yeltsin recently
ordered _ again _ that Skuratov be removed, corruption inquiries
under Skuratov's deputy seem to continue apace.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party leader, Gennady Zyuganov, suggested Tuesday
that Berezovsky will never be arrested and that the warrant against
him was timed so that it could not be enforced. Had prosecutors
``been sticking to their principles more strictly, they would have
sanctioned Berezovsky's arrest while he was in Russia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Communist legislators in the lower house of parliament plan
hearings on Wednesday into Skuratov's dismissal. Tuesday night some
said news of the warrant might lead them to expand the scope of the
hearings to cover his motives.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Skuratov's office said they issued the warrant
after trying and failing repeatedly to question Berezovsky about
Aeroflot. They also said they might ask Interpol to help detain
Berezovsky and return him to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night Berezovsky scoffed at that, too. ``I think that
the law in the West is much stronger than in Russia,'' he said,
``and that Interpol won't take part in a spectacle started by the
Communists and their like-minded brothers in the general
prosecutor's office.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After climbing to the 22,000-foot summit of a volcano in
northern Argentina, archeologists have found three frozen Inca
mummies, 500-year-old remains of a ritual sacrifice, which are so
well preserved that blood is still present in the heart and lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of two boys and a girl were buried beneath five feet
of rock and dirt, amid a cache of statuettes, pottery and ornate
textiles associated with human sacrifices in the Inca religion.
They had apparently been frozen since immediately after death. Two
of the mummies were in such excellent condition, physicians said,
that all their internal organs were intact. It was as if they had
died only recently.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists and other scholars said that the findings should
yield important insights into the religion and the worship of
sacred mountains in the Inca empire, which spanned most of the
Andes and the western coast of South America at the time of the
Spanish conquest in the early 16th century. They said the mummies
and artifacts were even more impressive than the discovery of the
Peruvian ``Ice Maiden,'' another frozen body of an Inca sacrifice
found in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The new discovery, made on Mount Llullaillaco, at Argentina's
border with Chile, was announced on Tuesday by Dr. Johan Reinhard,
an American archeologist and mountaineer who led an
American-Argentine-Peruvian expedition supported by the National
Geographic Society. He described the mummies and other finds at a
news conference in Salta, Argentina, and in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preservation of the mummies is just fantastic,'' Reinhard
said. ``It's eerie looking at the arms. You can still see the light
hair on their arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The archeologist said that they were the best preserved of any
mummy he had ever seen. In recent years, he has ascended the peaks
of mountains in Argentina, Chile and Peru and come down with 18
mummies, all apparent sacrifices to the sacred mountains.
Physicians so far could not establish how the three individuals,
probably between 8 and 15 years old, met their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the explorers could determine, the mummies and other
offerings to the Inca gods appeared to have been undisturbed
through the centuries. Gold, silver and shell statues, from two to
seven inches tall, were arranged on the burial platform just as
they probably were for the ritual sacrifices. Half of the statues
were clothed. Other artifacts included pottery, some of it still
containing food, and bundles of alpaca textiles that appeared to
establish the sacrifice victims as elite members of the society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The undamaged female has a beautiful, yellow geometrically
designed cover laid over her outer mantle,'' Reinhard said. She
also wore a feathered headdress.
</P>
<P>
   Below the summit, at about the 17,000-foot level, the expedition
found the stone ruins and ceramics of a camp where participants in
the rituals presumably stayed before the final ascent to the peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a scientific point of view,'' said Dr. Craig Morris, an
Andean anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in
New York City, ``these artifacts and the base camp are at least as
important as the mummies in determining the meaning of these
rituals.''
</P>
<P>
   The textiles, for example, were expected to provide clues to the
status and ethnic origins of the young people chosen for human
sacrifice, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Burger, an archeologist of early Andean
civilizations at Yale University, said that the preservation of the
bodies gave medical scientists an opportunity to conduct more
revealing tests of the diet, health and genetics of the victims.
The blood should lead to DNA studies of the genetic composition of
these people.
</P>
<P>
   These and other recent discoveries, Burger said, were important
as established cases of capac cocha, or human offerings, by the
Inca because there had been a suspicion that the Spanish conquerors
had exaggerated their accounts of such practices, as well as
cannibalism and odd sexual mores, to justify their conquests.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhard had explored Mount Llullaillaco several times before,
mapping ruins and trying the trail to the top. Last month, the
expedition battled driving snow and winds near the summit. ``We had
several days of finding nothing,'' he said. ``I was about to give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 16, the team found the first burial. One of the workers
had to be lowered into a hole by his ankles so that he could pull
the mummy out. Then they found the two others. One of the mummies,
a female, had been damaged on the left side by a lightning strike,
but the other two were undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   Calling ahead by cellular phones, the archeologists had
Argentine military vehicles waiting for them when the descended the
mountain with their cargo of mummies wrapped in plastic, snow and
foam insulation. The bodies were still frozen when they reached
Salta, a city about 300 miles away. Some members of the team were
from the Center for the Conservation of High Altitude Cultural
Patrimony, in Salta. Constanza Ceruti, an Argentine archeologist,
was a co-leader of the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   The mummies are to remain refrigerated in Salta for further
tests. Reinhard said he had more mountains to climb in search of
Inca sacrifices.

<P>
   ``Foreign policy leadership'' has become an ambiguous phrase. It
once meant leading the American people in the formation and
execution of national policy.
</P>
<P>
   But some now use it to state a less obvious idea: the United
States leading other nations in the international arena. Why should
other nations follow U.S. leaders rather than their own?
</P>
<P>
   Leadership involves some common stake between the leader and the
led, some basis for agreement on goals to be sought and prices to
be paid. The more recent meaning of foreign-policy leadership has
thrust itself to the fore because of America's claim to be ``the
leader of the free world.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim arose during World War II, when the United States was
the de facto leader of the Allies. It made sense to have a dominant
partner in the military alliance for the duration of the war
effort. Even after 1945 there have been military alliances, such as
NATO and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, in which the
United States could properly be called the leader.
</P>
<P>
   But the term ''leader of the free world'' came to have a more
grandiose meaning, extending to nations with no formal alliance
with the United States. In the global struggle between two
ideologies, only the capitalist nations could be described as free.
We aspired not only to lead them all but to entice socialist
countries to join us as well.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a more universal agenda. America was the
champion of freedom anywhere freedom was valued or challenged or
losing _ covering all situations for all peoples. The United States
considered itself not only a legitimate leader but actually more
legitimate than indigenous leaders who did not meet the U.S.
definition of freedom-loving behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Washington ``led'' people by removing inauthentic leaders _ the
enemies of freedom _ even when the people had chosen them. Over
time, American leadership substituted for that of Muhammad Mossadeq
in Iran, Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, Ngo Dinh Diem in South
Vietnam, Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, Manuel Noriega
in Panama and many others.
</P>
<P>
   This is what was considered leading the free world. But however
justified these acts may have been strategically, they cannot be
called leadership. Leaders persuade followers. The United States
used covert action, sabotage and threats. What is the proper
description of what the United States was doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Imperialism'' does not seem the right word, since an empire
usually absorbs subject states and takes their natural resources,
markets or labor. The United States, in contrast, wanted a network
of perches for military action against the Soviet Union. It did not
want to annex the countries but to use them _ call it ``security
imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach began with the Strategic Air Command, whose bases
had to be guaranteed if the U.S. military was to be able to deliver
nuclear weapons. Naturally, any facility servicing U.S. planes or
warships had to be protected by the United States, even if it was
on foreign soil.
</P>
<P>
   And America clearly needed friendly regimes at those sites. From
this it was a short step to removing unfriendly officials or
promoting subservient ones. All this was done in the name of
freedom, and it did not look sufficiently like old-fashioned
imperialism (at least to us) for Americans to question it. Instead,
it was called leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ``leader of the free world'' came to infect American
language and thinking. Even with the end of the Cold War, many have
not jettisoned the idea, although it is heard less often.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's only superpower, America is told that it must act
like ``a great nation,'' which still means defending freedom around
the world. That is a difficult enough task for any nation. It is
even more difficult for America, not only because of its
established Cold War pattern but also because of its longstanding
tradition of holding aloof from international partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The view that the United States acts authentically only when it
acts independently has recurred, from Thomas Jefferson's warning
against ''entangling alliances'' through the Monroe Doctrine,
manifest destiny and rejection of the League of Nations to the
current distrust of the United Nations, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), the International Criminal Court and any agencies set
up to monitor seas, pollution or land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else this suspicious attitude does, it cripples
America's ability to lead other countries. A leader must understand
followers and be able to enlist their energies so that they are
willing to do something for the greater good. Force, subversion and
defiance are not the traits of a leader. No one can lead people
without listening to them, reasoning with them, and showing respect
for them.
</P>
<P>
   The wisest diplomatic advice in America's founding period is
also its most neglected. It was enunciated by James Madison in The
Federalist, No. 63:
</P>
<P>
   ``An attention to the judgment of other nations is important to
every government for two reasons. The one is that, independently of
the merits of any particular plan or measure, it is desirable, on
various accounts, that it should appear to other nations as the
offspring of a wise and honorable policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the concerns of others should be taken into
account regardless of the particular policy at issue. If support
cannot be elicited, at least there should be no needless hostility
aroused or misunderstandings fostered.
</P>
<P>
   But Madison, not content to say just that, continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``The second is that, in doubtful cases, particularly where the
national councils may be warped by some strong passion or momentary
interest, the presumed or known opinion of the impartial world may
be the best guide that can be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, if we listen, we may learn something, discover our own
error or, at the least, learn what objections it would be wise to
consider. Now that is leadership talk.
</P>
<P>
   Madison was talking about the need to have a senate of older
members with longer tenure who could ponder foreign relations with
some knowledge of other countries in order to deal with them
intelligently _ an institution lacking in the unicameral Congress
of the Articles of Confederation.
</P>
<P>
   States under the Articles ignored or defied international
agreements on foreign debts, Indian relations and navigation,
actions that should sound familiar at a time when the United States
is refusing to pay its share of the U.N. budget.
</P>
<P>
   But how many politicians today would say that the United States
should go to international forums to learn rather than to dictate?
World opinion, Americans are constantly told, should be defied when
it does not match the U.S. view of reality. (Of course, one reality
this view most needs to acknowledge is that there is a world
outside the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, for example, the fact that world opinion advised
America to leave Vietnam became an argument for staying there: Are
we to be led by others' views? We must go our own way.
</P>
<P>
   What can explain this unwillingness to accept partnership, a
prior condition of leadership? Travelers often notice the contrast
between foreign papers' coverage of international affairs and
America's exiguous reporting on things beyond its borders. Even the
best newspapers have skimpy reports of any but a few international
events.
</P>
<P>
   This stems partly from the fact that the United States has so
few immediate neighbors. The nations of Europe jostle along in
close proximity to a dozen other countries and languages, while
Americans refuse to school themselves in any foreign tongue, even
in the Spanish of their nearest neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor behind this ignorance of other nations may be
America's lack of an overt empire. European habits of reporting
began when uncles and grandfathers remembered serving in India or
the Congo or Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   American elections are decided mainly on domestic issues, except
in times of war. Even then, public interest in the world is so
minimal that the relevant geography is fuzzy. How long did it take
for Americans to discover where Laos was, or Cambodia? Who can tell
exactly where Kosovo is? How many citizens have atlases that
reflect the extensive changes in national boundaries over the last
decade?
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that foreign affairs become matters of
electoral concern only when they project domestic disputes.
</P>
<P>
   When the people lack interest in foreign affairs, foreign-policy
elites tend to conclude that the subject is beyond the capacity of
all but a few. Not only does the U.S. government dismiss world
opinion, it dismisses the opinion of its own voters. Yet leading
the American people is the necessary prelude to addressing others
in the world. And a necessary condition to leading Americans is
consulting them, recruiting their support and persuading them when
they doubt or hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   If, as President Clinton says, the United States should be at
the nexus of trade exchanges, it must also place itself at the
points of political intersection. National security will depend on
the ties that bind people together.
</P>
<P>
   But America cannot bring other nations into any kind of dialogue
until its internal discourse is active and informed. Until
America's leaders address the American people and other nations
with that kind of respect, attention and persuasion, we shall lack
foreign policy leadership of any sort.

offspring of a wise and honorable policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the concerns of others should be taken into
account regardless of the particular policy at issue. If support
cannot be elicited, at least there should be no needless hostility
aroused or misunderstandings fostered.
</P>
<P>
   But Madison, not content to say just that, continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``The second is that, in doubtful cases, particularly where the
national councils may be warped by some strong passion or momentary
interest, the presumed or known opinion of the impartial world may
be the best guide that can be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, if we listen, we may learn something, discover our own
error or, at the least, learn what objections it would be wise to
consider. Now that is leadership talk.
</P>
<P>
   Madison was talking about the need to have a senate of older
members with longer tenure who could ponder foreign relations with
some knowledge of other countries in order to deal with them
intelligently _ an institution lacking in the unicameral Congress
of the Articles of Confederation.
</P>
<P>
   States under the Articles ignored or defied international
agreements on foreign debts, Indian relations and navigation,
actions that should sound familiar at a time when the United States
is refusing to pay its share of the U.N. budget.
</P>
<P>
   But how many politicians today would say that the United States
should go to international forums to learn rather than to dictate?
World opinion, Americans are constantly told, should be defied when
it does not match the U.S. view of reality. (Of course, one reality
this view most needs to acknowledge is that there is a world
outside the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, for example, the fact that world opinion advised
America to leave Vietnam became an argument for staying there: Are
we to be led by others' views? We must go our own way.
</P>
<P>
   What can explain this unwillingness to accept partnership, a
prior condition of leadership? Travelers often notice the contrast
between foreign papers' coverage of international affairs and
America's exiguous reporting on things beyond its borders. Even the
best newspapers have skimpy reports of any but a few international
events.
</P>
<P>
   This stems partly from the fact that the United States has so
few immediate neighbors. The nations of Europe jostle along in
close proximity to a dozen other countries and languages, while
Americans refuse to school themselves in any foreign tongue, even
in the Spanish of their nearest neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor behind this ignorance of other nations may be
America's lack of an overt empire. European habits of reporting
began when uncles and grandfathers remembered serving in India or
the Congo or Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   American elections are decided mainly on domestic issues, except
in times of war. Even then, public interest in the world is so
minimal that the relevant geography is fuzzy. How long did it take
for Americans to discover where Laos was, or Cambodia? Who can tell
exactly where Kosovo is? How many citizens have atlases that
reflect the extensive changes in national boundaries over the last
decade?
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that foreign affairs become matters of
electoral concern only when they project domestic disputes.
</P>
<P>
   When the people lack interest in foreign affairs, foreign-policy
elites tend to conclude that the subject is beyond the capacity of
all but a few. Not only does the U.S. government dismiss world
opinion, it dismisses the opinion of its own voters. Yet leading
the American people is the necessary prelude to addressing others
in the world. And a necessary condition to leading Americans is
consulting them, recruiting their support and persuading them when
they doubt or hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   If, as President Clinton says, the United States should be at
the nexus of trade exchanges, it must also place itself at the
points of political intersection. National security will depend on
the ties that bind people together.
</P>
<P>
   But America cannot bring other nations into any kind of dialogue
until its internal discourse is active and informed. Until
America's leaders address the American people and other nations
with that kind of respect, attention and persuasion, we shall lack
foreign policy leadership of any sort.

   ALEKSINAC, Serbia _ On Monday night, about 10 p.m., Stana
Stojanovic, a 62-year-old pensioner, was watching ``Esmeralda,''
her favorite soap opera, when she heard the airplanes flying low
over this little coal-mining town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my husband if he could hear anything, but he said
`No,' so I turned off the television,'' she said Tuesday,
shuddering and hugging herself in the hot morning sun, standing in
the chaotic rubble of what remains of Vuka Karadzica Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment there was a huge explosion, and it felt like a
hammer on my head. I dragged him off the sofa and pulled him under
a table.''
</P>
<P>
   When she emerged, she said, the houses across the street were
smoking heaps of brick and tile, with body parts visible and pools
of blood. Her neighbors, Dragan and Dragica Milodinovic, and their
42-year-old daughter, Snezana, were dead, their daughter-in-law and
two grandchildren, Marko and Dijana, badly wounded in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people responsible for this should be tried,'' she
shouted, beginning to weep. ``We will not take revenge, but we will
not be slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   In what NATO called an accident of war, on Monday night NATO
bombs demolished two residential areas in this quiet town of 20,000
people, killing at least seven of them and wounding nearly 50
others, the local police said. The explosions also damaged NATO's
reputation for surgical precision in its undeclared war from the
air against President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and his
policies in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, with the dry precision of the well-briefed modern
military man, Air Commodore David Wilby said: ``It is possible that
one of our weapons fell short of the target.'' NATO was aiming at a
barracks that houses the 203rd Mixed Artillery Brigade, he said,
but the munitions apparently fell 600 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   He regretted any loss of life, he said. ``Despite our meticulous
and careful pre-attack planning,'' he said, ``the law of statistics
will at some stage go against us and we will be exposed to a
technical defect.''
</P>
<P>
   Smilja Janic was another of those people so exposed. ``I have no
idea why NATO is bombing us,'' she said, weeping and shouting in
Dusana Trivunca Street, where a second NATO bomb ripped through
more houses about 300 yards from the first one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not any kind of politician,'' she said, standing in shards
of glass and burnt-orange roof tiles. ``I'm just an old woman and I
don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   She gestured across the street to another expanse of blasted
urban trash, where houses 56 and 58 Dusana Trivunca Street used to
stand. ``Voja and Radojka, they're probably still in that house,''
she said, describing her neighbors, who were teachers. ``And Sofia
and Jova, he was a policeman,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never expect this to happen in this town,'' Mrs. Janic
said. ``I was a kid in World War II, and the Nazis just drove
through town in their tanks. They didn't bomb us here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, was the 58th anniversary of the Easter bombing
of Belgrade by the Nazis, so the comparison with NATO was in the
air, made incessantly by state-controlled radio, television and
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, in the depths of the crater, a woman was
wailing like a terrified animal. ``You criminals!'' she yelled, her
voice cracking. ``What have you done to us?''
</P>
<P>
   A policeman shooed a journalist away. ``Her parents lived
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the crater, a seven of diamonds lay half-buried next to what
appeared to be a child's collection of different brands of empty
cigarette packets. There were Marlboro and Lucky Strike, Kent and
Bastos, a Spanish brand that purports to be American.
</P>
<P>
   An orange and yellow comforter draped crazily from an empty,
shattered window frame; a red plastic telephone, cracked in half,
ended up on top of a demolished Mazda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any feelings any more,'' said Aleks Zivkovic, a
27-year-old woman who lives in the town. ``I'm just empty.''
</P>
<P>
   She tried to help a Greek journalist with translation, then
turned back. ``This war was real for me from the beginning,'' she
said. ``But I couldn't ever believe my town would be destroyed _
it's small, it's almost too small to be on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   On Vuka Karadzica Street, Mrs. Stojanovic had drawn a small
crowd. ``Clinton Nazi!'' yelled one passerby. ``Clinton will never
kill the heart of Serbia,'' Mrs. Stojanovic said. Then she had some
words for Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who spent part of
her childhood in Belgrade with her diplomat father and who speaks
some Serbian
</P>
<P>
   ``Albright has no soul and no heart,'' Mrs. Stojanovic said.
``She grew up with the Serbs and this is how she pays us back.''
</P>
<P>
   A blasted Mercedes was covered with a fine layer of orange-brown
dirt, like a perfect paint job. Policemen and emergency workers
swept up glass and prowled the rubble, searching for life. No
official tried to stop any journalist from doing interviews. There
was no need. What happened here Monday night was obvious.

   MIAMI -- Tents that will house up to 20,000 Kosovo refugees
starting going up at Tuesday at the U.S. Navy's base at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Putting up those shelters can be done in hours, according to
U.S. military officials. But they said it may take weeks to provide
other things that are needed -- such as latrines and dining areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the facilities to handle 20,000 or even 10,000
refugees at this time,'' said Lt. j.g. Herb Josey, spokesman for
the Navy's Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk, Va. ``There is basically just
a bunch of land there, with no real large-scale facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Tents and barracks designed to house Cuban and Haitians in the
mid-1990s were dismantled in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the task of transforming the scrub-dotted base
into a tent city, there were questions about whisking people
accustomed to cold weather to a hot, humid location nearly 4,700
miles from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are they going to find translators? How are these people
going to deal with summer, when the temperature rises to over 90
degrees every day?'' asked Guarione M. Diaz, who spent several
months at the base in 1994 as President Clinton's ombudsman for the
Cubans housed there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a hard place to be even for Cubans who were used to
the strong sun, so I think the Kosovars, who also will feel so
isolated, will be extremely restless and depressed there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, temperatures in Cuba can climb to 87 degrees and the
humidity to 70 percent. By comparison, Kosovo has highs in the '50s
and the humidity is about 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desalination plant can accommodate only 5,000 people,''
Diaz said. ``Most of the roads aren't paved, so the dust is just
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the horizon is hurricane season, which begins in June.
</P>
<P>
   The news that the United States would temporarily house the
refugees in Cuba came Tuesday. But U.S. officials said it could
take several days to begin transporting them there.
</P>
<P>
   The refuge will be only a temporary one, emphasized White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully intend the Kosovars will ultimately return to their
homes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the Kosovar Albanians will be given
``temporary protective status'' at Guantanamo for up to 18 months,
although the goal is to return them to Kosovo within six months.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,000 to 4,000 military personnel will be sent to
Guantanamo over the next few weeks to help the refugees, according
to the U.S. Southern Command. The command directs U.S. military
activity in Central and South America and in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The Guantanamo base is normally home to about 1,100 seaman and
2,400 dependents and private contractors. It has a civilian-run
McDonald's, a bowling alley, a pizza parlor, a nine-hole golf
course, an 11-bed naval hospital, and a small mall with a
barbershop and a beauty parlor.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   The 45-square-mile base, established in 1903 after the
Spanish-American War, has a history of handling refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, it provided shelter for 34,000 Haitians who fled a
military coup.
</P>
<P>
   But it gained real notoriety in 1994, when the base became a
massive tent city for more than 50,000 Cuban and Haitian migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Haitians, who had attempted to escape political and
economic turmoil at home, eventually returned to Haiti. Most of the
Cubans wound up relocating to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The base, which currently houses about 50 Cubans intercepted at
sea and awaiting deportation to third countries, still has the feel
of a prison facility, surrounded by barbed wire and U.S. guards.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars who will transported to Guantanamo are part of
about 120,000 who will be offered temporary refuge in a number of
countries. There are critics who argue that the refugees should
remain closer to the Balkans so they can return home more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``By sending these Albanians around the world, the likelihood
they'll ever return home becomes infinitely smaller,'' said David
Ray, associate director for the Federation for American Immigration
Reform in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say keeping the refugees away from the American
mainland sends the wrong message to the Kosovars and the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a baffling signal to these poor, traumatized refugees
that the United States does not really want them,'' said Dennis
Grace, vice president of Refugees International, a Washington-based
advocacy group. ``It would be more hospitable for the United States
to bring them to the mainland where they won't be so confined.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, housing refugees in Cuba is bound to irritate Cuban
leader Fidel Castro, who considers the U.S. occupation of
Guantanamo Bay illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba agreed to lease the area, on the island's southeast coast,
to the United States in 1934. Because the lease may be ended only
if Washington so wishes, it remained in American control even after
Castro came to power in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cuban government refuses to cash the $4,085 rent check
the U.S. government sends each year (cq) under the lease agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every action that's taken at Guantanamo Bay is regarded by the
Cuban government as illegal,'' said Roberto de Armas, a spokesman
in Havana for the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Cuban government has not responded formally to the
U.S.' plans, although in the past it has strongly condemned U.S.
and NATO attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman said U.S. officials briefed Cuban
government officials in Washington on Tuesday about the Guantanamo
plan.

</P>
<P>
   In addition to the task of transforming the scrub-dotted base
into a tent city, there were questions about whisking people
accustomed to cold weather to a hot, humid location nearly 4,700
miles from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are they going to find translators? How are these people
going to deal with summer, when the temperature rises to over 90
degrees every day?'' asked Guarione M. Diaz, who spent several
months at the base in 1994 as President Clinton's ombudsman for the
Cubans housed there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a hard place to be even for Cubans who were used to
the strong sun, so I think the Kosovars, who also will feel so
isolated, will be extremely restless and depressed there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, temperatures in Cuba can climb to 87 degrees and the
humidity to 70 percent. By comparison, Kosovo has highs in the '50s
and the humidity is about 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desalination plant can accommodate only 5,000 people,''
Diaz said. ``Most of the roads aren't paved, so the dust is just
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the horizon is hurricane season, which begins in June.
</P>
<P>
   The news that the United States would temporarily house the
refugees in Cuba came Tuesday. But U.S. officials said it could
take several days to begin transporting them there.
</P>
<P>
   The refuge will be only a temporary one, emphasized White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully intend the Kosovars will ultimately return to their
homes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the Kosovar Albanians will be given
``temporary protective status'' at Guantanamo for up to 18 months,
although the goal is to return them to Kosovo within six months.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,000 to 4,000 military personnel will be sent to
Guantanamo over the next few weeks to help the refugees, according
to the U.S. Southern Command. The command directs U.S. military
activity in Central and South America and in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The Guantanamo base is normally home to about 1,100 seaman and
2,400 dependents and private contractors. It has a civilian-run
McDonald's, a bowling alley, a pizza parlor, a nine-hole golf
course, an 11-bed naval hospital, and a small mall with a
barbershop and a beauty parlor.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   The 45-square-mile base, established in 1903 after the
Spanish-American War, has a history of handling refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, it provided shelter for 34,000 Haitians who fled a
military coup.
</P>
<P>
   But it gained real notoriety in 1994, when the base became a
massive tent city for more than 50,000 Cuban and Haitian migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Haitians, who had attempted to escape political and
economic turmoil at home, eventually returned to Haiti. Most of the
Cubans wound up relocating to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The base, which currently houses about 50 Cubans intercepted at
sea and awaiting deportation to third countries, still has the feel
of a prison facility, surrounded by barbed wire and U.S. guards.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars who will transported to Guantanamo are part of
about 120,000 who will be offered temporary refuge in a number of
countries. There are critics who argue that the refugees should
remain closer to the Balkans so they can return home more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``By sending these Albanians around the world, the likelihood
they'll ever return home becomes infinitely smaller,'' said David
Ray, associate director for the Federation for American Immigration
Reform in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say keeping the refugees away from the American
mainland sends the wrong message to the Kosovars and the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a baffling signal to these poor, traumatized refugees
that the United States does not really want them,'' said Dennis
Grace, vice president of Refugees International, a Washington-based
advocacy group. ``It would be more hospitable for the United States
to bring them to the mainland where they won't be so confined.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, housing refugees in Cuba is bound to irritate Cuban
leader Fidel Castro, who considers the U.S. occupation of
Guantanamo Bay illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba agreed to lease the area, on the island's southeast coast,
to the United States in 1934. Because the lease may be ended only
if Washington so wishes, it remained in American control even after
Castro came to power in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cuban government refuses to cash the $4,085 rent check
the U.S. government sends each year (cq) under the lease agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every action that's taken at Guantanamo Bay is regarded by the
Cuban government as illegal,'' said Roberto de Armas, a spokesman
in Havana for the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Cuban government has not responded formally to the
U.S.' plans, although in the past it has strongly condemned U.S.
and NATO attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman said U.S. officials briefed Cuban
government officials in Washington on Tuesday about the Guantanamo
plan.

 &HT;    FROM NEIGHBORING ALBANIA, KOSOVARS RALLY RESISTANCE
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MAIN.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Sitting in the shade at a cafe table beside
the sun-drenched garden of a five-star hotel here, Shaip Muja
conducts his business by cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   He wears sunglasses and an expensive, stylish three-piece
charcoal-gray suit. He has Alex Baldwin good looks, and is in huge
demand by other people gathered on the hotel patio.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia, Muja would be branded a terrorist. In Albania,
his association with the Kosovo Liberation Army makes him a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Muja, a physician in normal times, directs the guerrilla group's
logistics, support and humanitarian efforts. His business is
keeping the beleaguered army equipped to one day drive back into
Kosovo and reclaim his homeland from the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the KLA is struggling to cope with the
simultaneous boom of fresh recruits who have been moved by the Serb
attack on Kosovo to get into the fight, and the perennial crisis of
barely having enough resources to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need three things: food, medicine and arms,'' Muja said
Tuesday afternoon, pausing between phone calls. ``This is what we
ask of NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, he has grave concerns about thousands of
ethnic Albanians trapped in a region southwest of Pristina,
Kosovo's major city. ``They are encircled by the Serbs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the trapped Kosovars are under bombardment by the Serbs
and have dwindling supplies. The KLA fighters among them are so
consumed by the task of caring for the civilians that they are
unable to fight the Serb forces. KLA officials worry that the Serbs
would use this opportunity to wipe them out. ``We have our hands
tied by the civilians,'' Muja said.
</P>
<P>
   Muja said Serb forces also have contaminated the water in the
area's rivers with the bodies of livestock and people killed in the
fighting. ``When you are in Kosovo these days, you must wear a mask
because of the smell of disintegrating flesh,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are few foreign journalists or international monitors in
Kosovo, so it is difficult to verify such reports.
</P>
<P>
   However, a representative of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said the accounts match information obtained
by that organization's sources in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also has reported that Serb forces are moving toward
remaining KLA strongholds in southwestern Kosovo near the Albanian
border.
</P>
<P>
   Muja said that KLA units occasionally have been able to open
corridors to provide supplies. ``But this is insufficient,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla group's hope is for the continued success of the
NATO bombings _ they jokingly refer to NATO as the KLA's air force
_ and the added offensive power against Serb troops that will be
provided when 24 U.S. Apache helicopter gunships arrive at the
Albanian border in a week or so. ``The Apache helicopters are the
best news we ever had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has been at war with Serb forces for nearly a year.
Serbian officials call them terrorists on the order of the Irish
Republican Army, and have used their presence to justify the
offensive into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the KLA sees itself as the only legitimate representative of
the Kosovar people. The group was a signatory to the Rambouillet
peace agreement that President Slobodan Milosovic of Yugoslavia
refused to sign, prompting the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, the KLA's ranks have swelled with a
combination of new recruits, some of whom have been pressed into
service at KLA roadblocks, and Albanian emigres who have come to
Albania to be trained for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is ordering all ethnic Albanian men from Kosovo to take
up arms once they have resettled their families in Albania. A KLA
decree last week said men between 18 and 50 years old must join the
separatist force within a month. Some women have also responded to
the call.
</P>
<P>
   Visar Reka, a KLA spokesman, said the organization has been
keeping a computer printer going full time producing registration
forms. Reka joked that the KLA made a mistake by demanding color
forms, which take longer to print than black-and-white ones. ``We
Albanians are vain,'' he said. ``But I hope that doesn't slow
recruitment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the port of Durres, young men of Albanian descent are pouring
in to join up, Reka said. Many come with their uniforms and other
equipment _ from Swiss Army knives to binoculars _ purchased in
their home countries. They are met at the port by KLA
representatives who sign them up and ship them to the remote
northern mountains to be trained.
</P>
<P>
   The new volunteers are full of zeal, but short on military
experience. Many have never fired a gun. Weapons are in short
supply, so many begin their two-month training course without
anything with which to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Training is provided by former military people _ including U.S.
Marines _ of Albanian heritage from around the world, Muja said.
Many of the trainers speak no Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   KLA leaders refuse to give details about the extent of their
arsenal or the number of their fighters. Reka estimated that the
organization had about 10,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has armed itself primarily with purchases from middlemen
selling weapons looted from Albanian military armories in 1997,
when the country endured a brief but violent period of anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   But the weapons have proved no serious match for Serb planes,
tanks and armor. In nearly a year of conflict, the KLA never
managed to control a large part of strategic territory in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So far, ethnic Albanian emigres have been the main backers of
the KLA, providing money and arms. Now the KLA fighters are hoping
for a much bigger benefactor: the United States and its NATO
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Muja said the KLA is eager for the United States and other
Western powers to make it legal for arms sellers to do business
with them.
</P>
<P>
   If the KLA can be properly armed, Reka said, the organization
would like to lead the way back into Kosovo. ``We don't want
Americans and other NATO soldiers to risk their lives over our
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that this is a fight that Kosovars must ultimately
win. ``But for the first time in history, we feel we are not
alone,'' he said.

 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSSINING, N.Y. _ Baba Eng had been a prisoner at Sing Sing for
22 years, serving a life sentence for murder, when a new inmate
walked into the shower room one day and stared at his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad,'' the stranger finally exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   The man was his son, whom Eng had not seen since his arrest, and
who now was in prison himself for armed robbery. ``It was the worst
moment of my life,'' Eng recalled. ``Here was my son; he had tried
to imitate my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Eng's experience reflects a side of the nation's prison-building
boom that is only now gaining attention: there are 7 million
children with a parent in jail or prison or recently released on
probation or parole. Those numbers alarm experts who say that
having a parent behind bars is the single largest factor in the
making of juvenile delinquents and adult criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Although most jails and prisons do not even ask new inmates if
they have children, a few are taking steps to counter the effect of
parental incarceration, as experts have begun to realize the
seriousness of the problem. Some prisons have created special
visiting areas for children; some offer parenting classes for
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   But the experts also warn that the nation's emphasis on
imprisonment to fight crime may be helping to create the next
generation of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no free lunch in this business,'' said Lawrence
Sherman, dean of the University of Maryland's school of criminology
and criminal justice. ``If you increase the number of people
arrested and sent to prison, you may actually be creating another
problem. There is a multiplier effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 1.96 million children have a parent or other close relative
in jail or prison on any given day, according to the Bureau of
Justice Statistics, a branch of the Justice Department, and 5
million more have parents who have been incarcerated and are on
probation or parole.
</P>
<P>
   The link between the generations is so strong that half of all
juveniles in custody have a father, mother or other close relative
who has been in jail or prison, said Allen J. Beck of the Bureau of
Justice Statistics. About 40 percent of the 1.8 million adults in
jail and prison have a parent, brother or sister behind bars, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why children with a parent in prison
are more likely to get in trouble, experts say. Most of these
children grow up in families troubled by poverty, abuse, neglect
and drug use. And separation from a parent _ for any reason _ is a
well-documented problem for children.
</P>
<P>
   But incarceration adds a special hazard. Children who see a
parent arrested and handcuffed, and who are frisked by guards
during a prison visit, become contemptuous toward law enforcement.
More troublesome, many children with a father behind bars make a
hero of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When children are not in contact with their parents, it is a
breeding ground for idealization, and when the parent is a big-time
criminal, they can turn them into legends,'' said Jaime Inclan, a
clinical psychologist who is director of the Roberto Clemente
Center, a mental health center serving poor families on the Lower
East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dimensions of the problem, little attention is paid
because the criminal-justice system is set up to deal with
offenders, not their children.
</P>
<P>
   In most cities, when the police make an arrest, when a judge
passes sentence, or when an inmate enters jail and prison, no one
asks if the offender has children _ or if they happen to ask, does
anything with the information. And inmates are often evasive about
their children, out of shame or fear of losing custody or
government benefits.
</P>
<P>
   There is so little research on the subject that there is no
agreement even on the seemingly simple issue of whether it is good
for children to visit their father or mother behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Juliana Perez, a social worker who directs a parenting program
in the county jail in San Antonio, says contact between
incarcerated parents and their children is essential. In addition
to helping the children, she said, ``If the system doesn't allow
bonding, we destroy whatever chance we have of changing the
offenders' behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Kathleen Richie of the Juvenile Court in Baton Rouge,
La., disagrees. ``The more these kids are exposed to prison by
visiting, the more they get used to it, and prison loses its
stigma,'' she said.

   YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MAIN _ WASHINGTON _ More U.S. weapons are on the way to
the Balkans as humanitarian groups struggle to care for the growing
number of ethnic Albanian refugees. Developing. (Deans, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA _ DURRES or TIRANA, Albania _ Ethnic Albanian exiles
here are recruiting fighters for the Kosovo Liberation Army,
preparing a ragtag army to eventually force the Serbs out of what
they consider their homeland. A look at the KLA's recruiting and
training operations. (Roughton, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-GITMO _ MIAMI _ In normal times, the U.S. Navy base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba is a sleepy place where 3,500 seamen assist
the Navy with operations across Latin America. But if the United
States decides to airlift ethnic Albanians there, the base will
have to be transformed to a hodge-podge metropolis of tents and
field latrines to serve up to 20,000 desperate refugees. People
familiar with the base say the transformation would be a logistical
nightmare, and they question whether it's a good idea to bring
Kosovars used to cold weather to such a hot spot in the Caribbean
that's nearly 5,000 miles from their homeland. Refugee experts say
the Kosovars should be housed closer to home. (Emling, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   SPENDING _ When Congress set campaign contribution limits in
1975, gasoline sold for $.50 a gallon and a McDonold's hamburger
cost $.20. Gas, burgers and everything else has increased since
then but federal contribution limits have remained frozen at $1,000
_ a third what it would be worth today if adjusted for inflation.
But after 25 years, there are the first glimmers that Congress
might be ready to bump up the limits. While proponents say it will
ease the fundraising burden on candidates, campaign reform
advocates say that it will only further swamp a system that is
awash in too much cash. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   LEVITT-FUNDS _ WASHINGTON _ SEC to announce new ``tool'' to help
investors calculate mutual fund costs. (McNaughton, Cox News

   EVERGLADES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A mere 63 years after
Marjory Stoneman Douglas proclaimed the Everglades' ``11th hour,''
the Army Corps of Engineers will finally end the decline of
Florida's most precious marsh system _ in 2010. That's the promise
of the corps' newest version of its $7.8 billion restoration plan,
which hits the Internet and the libraries on Wednesday. (King, Palm
Beach Post). 20.
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-ANALYSIS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Historical analysis
of hurricane damage in the U.S.: what would happen if the big
storms of the past were to hit in the vastly developed coastline
today? When adjusted for 1995 dollars, the 1926 storm that hit
Miami would have been the costliest to hit Florida: $72 billion.
Andrew's damage in 1992 was $21.6 billion (in 1995 dollars and
considering property values and growth, that cost would have jumped
to $33 billion). The 1928 Lake Okeechobee storm would have cost
nearly $14 billion in 1995 dollars. We'll look at the 10 most
expensive storms to hit South Florida, based on a report presented
to the hurricane conference Thursday. (Kleinberg, Palm Beach Post).

   FLA-ELDERLY-WILL _ LANTANA, Fla. _ Before all the trouble began,
Ruth Turgeon was the sort of gentle elderly soul who lives alone,
dotes on her cats, feeds stray animals and sends money to humane
societies. A little forgetful, maybe, but who isn't when they're
well past 80? Neighbors in her little waterfront community watched
out for her, took her meals, ran in to check on her. Then the state
abuse hot line got a call saying Turgeon was being exploited,
something about her giving money to a friend who picked up stray
animals and sent the vet bills to her. A state investigator checked
it out and made some startling discoveries. The frugal,
sweet-natured woman who'd been a secretary for the Postal Service
and a co-founder of the Jeanne Craig Foundation for stray animals
had a fortune of $2.5 million in stocks, bonds and cash _ and no
will. That was the end of Ruth Turgeon's quiet and privacy. For the
past 18 months, she's been enveloped in chaos and anxiety as the
state, the neighbors, three nieces _ and everybody's lawyers _
battled for control of her body, her mind and her money.

   STATE LEGISLATIVE NEWS
</P>
<P>
   OHIO-LEGIS-FINGERHUT _ State Sen. Eric Fingerhut Tuesday plans
to introduce legislation to make it easier for more welfare
recipients to follow the example of Shannon Stavis of Dayton and
move from welfare to work by getting post-secondary education. Gov.
Bob Taft singled out Stavis for praise in his state-of-the state
speech in January but Fingerhut says current Ohio law restricts the
amount of time in post-secondary education that can count toward
meeting the work requirement. The result is that potential Shannons
have to quit school and take dead-end jobs, said Fingerhut.

OSSINING, N.Y.: she said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judge Richie recently had a case in which a social worker was
taking four children to prison to visit their mother, who had been
convicted of selling crack cocaine and was awaiting trial on
charges of neglecting the children. The judge ordered that the
visits take place in her chambers, with the mother in civilian
clothes, so the children would not become accustomed to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The mother was puzzled why prison visits were a problem. She had
taken her children to visit her friends and relatives in prison for
years before her own arrest. Three of the four children have since
been arrested and sent to juvenile prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, these kids have fond memories, and their only memories,
of their mom behind bars,'' Judge Richie said. ``If you have
parents in jail, then it is part of your life, and there is nothing
offensive about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fathers
</P>
<P>
   Staying in Touch With Some Help
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Center of the visiting room at Sing Sing is a
small glass-enclosed space with shelves of children's books, boxes
of building blocks and toy cars, a crib full of stuffed animals,
and a computer.
</P>
<P>
   It may not look much different than a day care center. But in
one of the nation's oldest and most forbidding prisons, it is a
revolution, an attempt to create a haven where convicts can meet
quietly with their children in an effort to preserve, or rebuild,
the family bonds that prison often breaks.
</P>
<P>
   One day Hector Millan, a 38-year-old from Spanish Harlem serving
a 20-year to life sentence for murder, was seated at a low table
with his young grandson, Hector III. His wife, Maritza, stood
nearby. Millan has three sons and two daughters, and is one of the
lucky inmates who is still married and visited by his family.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, less than a quarter of male inmates are married, and
fewer than a third are visited by their families. But two-thirds of
them have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prison destroys families,'' Millan said matter of factly. ``I
can't tuck my children in bed at night. I can't be there to comfort
them when they scrape their knees. I can't help them when they have
problems at school. The damage done is irreparable.''
</P>
<P>
   Millan is enrolled in an unusual 16-week program at Sing Sing
that tries to teach convicts how to overcome the obstacles to
parenting behind bars. The program is part classroom reading _ with
selections from the great child psychologists Jean Piaget, Erik
Erikson and Bruno Bettelheim _ and part family therapy with
counselors to help bridge the gaps during visits or in writing
letters home.
</P>
<P>
   The program, and the special section of the visiting room, are
the brainchild of Elizabeth Gaynes, executive director of the
Osborne Association, a group based in New York that sponsors
programs to aid prisoners and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them prison walls certainly make it harder, but you
can still be a parent,'' Ms. Gaynes said. ``We say prison can be an
excuse for not taking your children to the library, but it is not
an excuse for not teaching your children the value of reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the lessons the program tries to impart, she said, are
that prisoners should stay in touch with their children, that they
should not make false promises about when they will be released,
and that they should acknowledge the pain they have caused their
children, who are also victims of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the inmates, Ms. Gaynes said, is that while
society ``will forever remember them for what they did on the worst
day of their life, their children will not judge them for just
this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, as the number of inmates has exploded, a
handful of other programs have been started to help incarcerated
parents, but most have been for mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gaynes acknowledges that the impact on a child may be
greater when the mother is locked up, because the mother is often a
single parent and the child may be sent to a grandmother or foster
home. But in sheer numbers, fathers pose a more serious problem.
Because most inmates are men, in 93 percent of the cases in which a
parent is behind bars, that parent is the father, the Justice
Department said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget most of these men are someday going to be
released,'' said Creasie Finney Hairston, dean of the Jane Addams
College of Social Work at the University of Illinois in Chicago.
``There is a growing body of research that shows maintaining family
ties while in prison leads to lower rates of re-arrest for the
fathers and makes a difference in the lives of their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisons, however, are in the business of punishment, and
security is their primary concern. Helping inmates preserve family
ties is at the bottom of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Visits by wives and children are often viewed as a security
threat by prison officials, or at least a nuisance, because they
can be an opportunity to smuggle drugs or weapons and they consume
guards' time.
</P>
<P>
   For the families, visiting prisons, which often are in rural
areas, can be time-consuming and costly, and when they finally
arrive, they can be kept outside in the cold or rain for hours and
then subjected to humiliating searches.
</P>
<P>
   ``A visit to a prison is a very emotionally difficult
experience,'' Dean Hairston said. ``There isn't time or space for
normal family arguments, and the kids tend to act out afterward and
the wives or girlfriends can be resentful.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Hernandez, an inmate at Sing Sing, said his 14-year-old son
is angry at him for abandoning him, and his 16-year-old daughter is
embarrassed and lies to her friends about where he is. Neither will
write or visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to deal with it,'' said Hernandez, who had
just begun the parenting class. ``It's impossible to be a good
father from prison.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the inmates' greatest fears, which they realize too late,
is that their children may consciously or unconsciously imitate
them.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Frederick, a 52-year-old from Harlem who has been at
Sing Sing for 10 years for murder, finds that his grandson ``thinks
I'm some sort of countercultural hero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he comes to visit,'' Frederick said, ``he sees these guys
walking around with big muscles, and then when he goes back home,
he tells his friends, `My grandfather is in prison,' and he's proud
of it. In some communities, prison just has no stigma any more.
It's a very distorted rite of passage.''
</P>
<P>
   Children often imitate the behavior of those they are close to,
said Angela Browne, a psychologist who is an expert on prisoners
and their children. ``Unfortunately,'' she said, ``children imitate
strong behavior, like anger and drug abuse, more than subtle
behavior.''

   The Children
</P>
<P>
   Following Father, Right Into Prison
</P>
<P>
   The impact on children can fall most heavily on blacks in poor
city neighborhoods, where a disproportionate number of people go to
prison, contributing to a concentration of fatherless families. But
research has found the dynamic of children being influenced by
parents in prison in all populations.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, two pioneering researchers at Harvard Law School,
Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck, found that among boys sent to a
reformatory from the Boston area, two-thirds had a father who had
been incarcerated, and half had a grandfather who had been locked
up.
</P>
<P>
   Race was not an issue. All these boys were white.
</P>
<P>
   Similar findings, that about half of incarcerated juveniles have
a parent who has been locked up, have been reported wherever the
issue has been studied: in London, Minneapolis, or Sacramento,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent research, conducted last year in California
among 1,000 girls in detention in Los Angeles, San Diego, Alameda,
and Marin counties, revealed that 54 percent of their mothers and
46 percent of their fathers had been locked up. Leslie Accoca, a
senior researcher with the National Council on Crime and
Delinquency, who directed the study, said that the real number of
fathers who had served time was undoubtedly higher, but the girls
knew less about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incarceration today is a family matter,'' Ms. Accoca said.
``There is an entire kinship system that is now moving through
jail, prison, probation and parole.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrections officials are sometimes stunned to find whole
families locked up. At the Laurel Highlands state prison in
Pennsylvania, a father and son, convicted of separate arsons, share
the same cell. At the Allegheny County Jail in Pittsburgh, a
father, mother, and their four sons and two daughters were all
incarcerated for different bank robberies. In California, a
daughter, her mother, and her grandmother were in one women's
prison for separate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The Visit
</P>
<P>
   A Child's Treat, A Parent's Reward
</P>
<P>
   Sareena Bain, all of 4 years old and dressed in a turquoise
jumper, was waiting by the slam gate entrance to the Bexar County
Detention Center, the San Antonio jail, for a new treat, a Saturday
contact visit with her father, Bobby Bain, a convicted burgler.
</P>
<P>
   A guard gently ordered Sareena to take off her shoes so they
could be searched for drugs, then passed her through a metal
detector. Nearby, civilian volunteers took off the diapers of a
group of babies to check for contraband, replacing them with fresh,
jail-issued diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Inspection finished, the children were ushered into a special
visitors room, the walls painted jungle green and emblazoned with a
mural from the ``Lion King.'' Sarena scanned the large, unfamiliar
men in orange jump suits in the room and then let out a whoop.
``Daddy,'' she said, and jumped into Bain's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Bain and the other men had earned the right to a one-hour visit
with their children by volunteering for an innovative program,
Papas and their Children, in which 70 of the 3,200 inmates in the
San Antonio jail live in the same pod and attend an hour of
parenting classes five days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Other inmates can talk to their visitors only by telephone
through a glass wall.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio program, and an equivalent one for mothers in
the jail, are the best of their kind in the country, said Anna
Laszlo, a criminologist in Washington, D.C., who conducted a
nationwide survey of programs for children of incarcerated parents
for the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   In the visitors room, Derrick Hunt, a bear of a man convicted of
drug possession, was bottle-feeding his month-old son, DiAnthony,
in his arms. Unfortunately, the baby had picked this moment to take
a nap. But Hunt was able to quiz his 5-year-old son, Derrick Jr.,
on his ABCs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really had a relationship with my children until I
came to jail and took the classes,'' Hunt said. ``But I've learned
how to control my anger and how to put my kids in timeout rather
than shout at them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the visitors room of the women's section of the jail, Mary
Anne Garza was lying on the gray carpet with her three children
tight around her: Edward, 7, Anna, 4, and Briana, 9 months. Tears
rolled down her cheeks. Ms. Garza's brother is in prison for
murder, her husband is in jail, and she had now been convicted of
auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   Anna could not stop hugging her mother. ``She wants to come to
jail with me,'' Ms. Garza said. ``She is so worried about what is
happening to me, and she is scared of the police and the guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long before, there was an automobile accident near her
mother's house, where the children are staying. When the police
came, Anna said, ``Don't go outside. The police will take you away
and there won't be any more moms.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Perez, the social worker who created the San Antonio,
program for the sheriff's department said, ``From a management
point of view, it has been a success because it has been so popular
it has changed jail culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The inmates who take part in it have never tried to smuggle in
drugs, they openly express their emotions and there are no racial
cliques or fights in the pods where they live.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just parents, not brown, black or white,'' Ms. Perez
said.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates may actually be better parents in jail than before
they were locked up, Ms. Perez said. ``Most of them are addicted,
and when they are out there, the drug is the number one thing to
them. But once in here, they have to be clean, they are able to
think clearly and they learn now important parents are to their
children.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a city that emphatically embraces Thai, Japanese
and Indian food, as well as Chinese dishes from a dizzying number
of regions, there is still one major Asian cuisine so unknown to
many New Yorkers that it's as if it's meant to be a secret.
</P>
<P>
   And it almost is. Korean food _ bold, healthful, a treasure for
the adventurous _ has almost been reserved for Koreans, whose
restaurants have made little effort to reach beyond their
traditional clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Koreans often ask themselves why Americans haven't discovered
their cooking, said Namji Steinmann, the vice president for
education of the Asia Society. ``The main reason is that the food
is not marketed to non-Koreans,'' she said. And the neighborhoods
where it can be found are few. Mostly, they are near the Garment
District and in Flushing, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   But that is slowly changing.
</P>
<P>
   Some wonderful dishes are emerging from their cloisters:
delicious fried dumplings, crisp potato and scallion pancakes,
hearty noodle soups and barbecued beef, sweetly charred along the
edges. There is kimchi, the fiery condiment made from salted and
fermented vegetables, which enlivens so many dishes. And then
there's bibimbop, the colorful, satisfying bowl of rice and
vegetables topped with meat or fish.
</P>
<P>
   One way to discover them is to go directly to one of the
traditional enclaves like Koreatown, the bustling West 30s between
Fifth Avenue and Broadway, where meats barbecued on tabletop grills
are a mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Chinese restaurants or even Italian restaurants,
which have long accommodated American tastes by serving the soup
first, or by accepting the notion that pasta can be a main course,
these Korean restaurants serve strictly Korean style: No matter
what you order, it's all put on the table at once. And often, with
little or no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expect you'll eat and scoot out, not linger,'' Ms.
Steinmann said.
</P>
<P>
   But as a new, more expansive generation of Korean-Americans
comes to the forefront, new ways to experience their cuisine are
emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Kwak was 19 six years ago, when she opened Dok Suni's with
her mother, Myeng Ja-kwak. It was the first of the hip little
downtown places, and Ms. Kwak stressed setting and service. ``For
Americans, Koreatown's food is good, but the atmosphere is not
there,'' she said. ``I grew up in the Village, so I wanted a place
that was cozier and darker and where people might go on a date.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dok Suni's and at a new Korean restaurant, Clay, also
downtown, the menu is fairly limited and organized to be easily
understood by Westerners. The food is served course by course.
``We've been criticized by Koreans for how we serve,'' Ms. Kwak
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Anita Lo started cooking at Mirezi, a Korean-influenced
Asian restaurant in Greenwich Village that was well-received but
closed last fall, she said she was not afraid to prepare
traditional dishes, but the menu had to be simplified and divided
into appetizers, main courses and desserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is Americans do not know how to navigate the
cuisine, how to put a meal together,'' said Brad Kelley, the owner
of Bop, which opened on the Bowery last year. ``Korean food seems
foreign until you break it down. Koreatown can be pretty
intimidating to Americans, and it's often their first association
with Korean food.''
</P>
<P>
   Bop, which started as a tiny experiment in SoHo before moving to
its present site, also has a limited selection of classic and
updated dishes, including stir-fried glass noodles and clams
steamed with ginger, garlic and sake. Some more challenging dishes
served in Koreatown, like beef tripe broiled at the table or cold
tofu with Spam and cucumber, have been edited out.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the dishes on the menus at most of the Koreatown
restaurants come with an English translation, and may be divided in
categories like starters, hot pots and chef's specialties,
Americans often do not know what to expect, especially when there
are 50 or more choices. Korean waiters who do not speak English are
unable to communicate well, while Westerners do not want to appear
foolish about not understanding the food and how it's meant to be
eaten. It's an unfortunate standoff.
</P>
<P>
   One exception is Hangawi, a serene Buddhist vegetarian
restaurant on East 32nd Street, where the servers go out of their
way to explain the menu, which is offered entirely in English, and
to make suggestions about the food, which is served on fine pottery
in a succession of courses. The food, including grilled codonopsis
(mountain root with ginger soy sauce) and acorn noodles with fresh
vegetables, seems more exotic and refined than what is served in
the barbecue places down the block.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, Korean is not a subtle cuisine. It is bold,
rustic and often vibrantly spiced. There is great variety, but
chili and garlic are the dominant flavors. Herbs like cilantro,
common in other Asian cuisines, are rare. The pickles and vinegar
add a cleansing note. The delicate artistry of the Japanese table
or of some Chinese cuisines, especially Cantonese, is not easy to
find in Korean restaurants. But if anything, the robust and
forthright seasonings should add to its attraction for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco DiSpirito, who serves Asian-influenced food at Union
Pacific in the Flatiron district, called it the ``Southern Italian
cooking of Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rich and garlicky,'' he said. ``Peasant fare. When I want
to use an Asian treatment for meat, I look to Korea.'' He prepares
Kobe beef marinated Korean style in soy and ginger. He has also
served cod seasoned with kimchi, the ubiquitous pickled cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   This pickle, the soul of Korean food, may be familiar to New
Yorkers from salad bars. But there are hundreds of versions, made
with everything from radishes to cucumbers and fermented fish to
fresh pears. It is also used as an ingredient, to season soups,
pancakes, dumplings, rice, noodle dishes and stir-fries. Koreans
even eat it for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from spicy kimchi, Korean food has other appeals,
including crowd pleasers like jap chae (stir-fried noodles with
vegetables and beef) and mandoo gui (fried dumplings). Though there
is little or no chicken on Korean menus, the cuisine is long on
vegetables. Even the ubiquitous beef barbecue is not eaten plain
but is piled with scallions and other vegetable condiments and
wrapped in frilly lettuce leaves.
</P>
<P>
   In most Korean restaurants, dishes like beef grilled in the
center of the table are meant to be shared, a concept that
Americans have embraced when they dine on Chinese, Indian and Thai
food (to say nothing of desserts served at a table for four in a
place like Le Cirque 2000).
</P>
<P>
   ``Koreans like to sample a lot of tastes, not fill up on one
thing,'' said Ms. Kwak of Dok Suni's.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Namhee Kong, the librarian at the Korean Cultural
Service in Manhattan, said that what elevates a Korean restaurant
meal from an everyday bowl of soup and dish of rice at home is not
the number of courses but the array and elaborateness of the kimchi
and other spicy, tangy and soothing little side dishes. There might
be three or four accompaniments at home, but 20 or 30 could cover
the table for a banquet.
</P>
<P>
   That's an extreme, but having given some New Yorkers a brief
sampling of Korean food, Ms. Kwak and her mother now have a broader
menu in mind. Come summer, they plan to open Do Hwa, a larger, more
elaborate restaurant than Dok Suni's, on Carmine Street in
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to lose the new things I've done, but I also want
to show more of the traditions,'' Ms. Kwak said. ``I think
Americans might be ready.''

REPUBLICANS VOICE DIVERSE VIEWS ON BALKAN CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One Republican presidential contender, conservative
commentator Patrick Buchanan, wants to pull all U.S. forces out of
the Balkans and labels President Clinton's policy on Kosovo a
``felony.''
</P>
<P>
   But another GOP hopeful, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, says NATO
forces must prevail over Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
no one should rule out deployment of ground troops. Faltering would
set a dangerous precedent because despots in places like Iraq and
North Korea ``pay attention'' to U.S. actions overseas, McCain has
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two views represent what American University history
professor Allan Lichtman calls ``the Alpha and Omega'' of
Republican approaches to the Kosovo crisis. The GOP's internal
differences also reflect the American public's wide variety of
views toward the U.S.-led warfare against the Yugoslav Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the Alpha of Pat Buchanan defining the extreme
nationalist, isolationist approach, and then you have the Omega of
John McCain saying (we should) go in with machine guns blazing and
ground troops,'' Lichtman said. ``You have within the Republican
Party the two extreme positions, and those, ironically, have been
getting the most play (in news reports).''
</P>
<P>
   The other GOP candidates fall somewhere in between, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic politicians have seemed far less divided on the
subject, and their comments have so far been muted.
</P>
<P>
   With the presidential field shaping up earlier than ever before,
Kosovo presents the prospective candidates with their first crucial
issue test. It could prove to be an opportunity for self-definition
or an abyss from which some might not emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' disagreement ``truly reflects some internal
confusion on the part of the American people at this time,'' said
Stephen Hess, a governmental studies scholar at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank. ``To the degree you have both
Buchanan and McCain coming from very different points of view, you
may create a very good debate in the Republican Party. That's very
valuable for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The frontrunners, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former American
Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, have been ``the missing players
in all this,'' Lichtman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was one of the last of the Republican candidates to speak
out on Kosovo after NATO bombs and missiles started falling on
Serbia on March 24. Fellow Republicans criticized his statements as
vague and timid, and the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial
page characterized them as ``Clintonian.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday with the Washington Post, Bush declined
to call Clinton's approach a failure. But he said U.S. policy
should be to ``win,'' and that ``all options ought to be on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If military briefers say it's important to use troops to
achieve the mission, I would be supportive, if two things exist:
first, a strong commitment to win, and second, a clear exit
strategy,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dole said much the same thing on options _ none
``should be taken off the table,'' she said. ``What we're doing is
the right course and we must not shrink from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on her experience with the American Red Cross, she urged
Americans to make donations to ease the suffering of Kosovo's tide
of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Two more conservative candidates, activist Gary Bauer and Sen.
Robert Smith, R-N.H., are close to Buchanan in saying U.S. forces
have no business in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, has mainly questioned the U.S. role in
Kosovo: ``This is not a matter of whose heart bleeds more for
innocent people being brutalized or killed. It really is a matter
of the responsibility of a great power.'' When the United States
overextends itself, he added, ``the world becomes less secure ... I
don't even know what our goal is.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishing magnate Malcolm S. ``Steve'' Forbes and former Vice
President Dan Quayle have directly criticized Clinton, saying
previous White House inaction on Kosovo precipitated the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The same spectrum of debate covers Republican lawmakers on
Capitol Hill. If a consensus is to be reached, it may come in the
form of a vote next week on a war powers resolution urged by Rep.
Tom Campbell, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a war, and only Congress can declare war,'' Campbell
said in a letter last week to House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   For Republican strategists, criticism of Clinton may be the only
unifying element of their party's approach to Kosovo. One
conservative consultant, who asked not to be identified, said, ``In
the long term, this is an opportunity because most (Republicans)
believe Clinton's policies will not succeed and those failures will
be laid at the feet of (Vice President) Al Gore going into 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the GOP's differing views, Clifford May, communications
director of the Republican National Committee, said the candidates
are engaged in ``a healthy debate. I don't think it is the job of
Republicans to march in lockstep.''
</P>
<P>
   But pitfalls remain. Months before the Kosovo crisis loomed,
Republicans made it clear that in the 2000 election, foreign policy
would be a key ingredient of their assault on Democrats. They said
Clinton's indecision in troublespots from China to Haiti has made
the post-Cold-War world a more volatile place.
</P>
<P>
   But one political expert said Republican's disunity on Kosovo
may hinder their effort to convince voters they are better able to
handle global entanglements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we find kind of international issue that defines what
we're likely to face over the next decade, and the Republicans are
having a hard time figuring out which way to go,'' said Donald
Kettl, director of the La Follette Institute of Public Affairs at
the University of Wisconsin.

   Television's foreign correspondents do not travel light.
</P>
<P>
   Off camera, their distinguishing feature is the small mountain
of equipment traveling with them, which sets baggage handlers to
dreaming of large tips and airlines to calculating budget-busting
excess-weight charges.
</P>
<P>
   The financial burden of that luggage is only one factor making
the network-TV foreign correspondent an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   New technologies in cable and satellite TV have turned the
stable, predictable, almost automatically profitable television
marketplace into a competitive cauldron in which journalism must
increasingly compete with entertainment programming. This has
prompted a redefining, or at least a questioning, of the
traditional news agenda in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   Producers and network executives believe the American mass
audience's interest in daily events beyond their nation's borders
is declining, so little such news is offered. And yet the image of
the correspondent reporting from some troubled land has become
firmly imprinted in viewers' imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, a television foreign correspondent performed
three functions. First, he _ it was a mostly male club _ was a
journalist reporting the story.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the report's producer, deciding what events or
visual elements needed to be filmed and what interviews recorded to
make the story. In the half-hour news format, reports initially ran
a minimum of two-and-a-half minutes and often three to five
minutes, compared with one-and-a-half minutes or even less today.
</P>
<P>
   Reports required a narrative line with the reporter as
storyteller, which brought up the correspondent's third role, more
image-driven than the first two but equally essential: He was a
familiar figure who established the news program's ``presence'' in
the story.
</P>
<P>
   Merely by being there, the correspondent gave the network
credibility, demonstrating to viewers that his organization spared
no effort or expense to be on the scene anywhere in the world where
important events were taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, however, it became apparent that the
correspondent had a partner with a will of its own: the camera. If
television's greatest strength was the transmission of human
experience rather than facts, analysis or concepts, the
correspondent ran the risk of becoming little more than a caption
writer for the moving pictures.
</P>
<P>
   With TV covering the earth, the question facing the foreign
correspondent was whether television news, besides offering drama
and emotion, could add, if not to viewers' detailed knowledge of
the world, at least to their awareness of it. The answer, I
believe, is that it has, although the effect is difficult to
quantify.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Vietnam War, television had an impact on public
opinion, which in turn affected the government's formulation of
foreign policy. Moreover, there are few signs that most Americans
seek a return to the ``splendid isolation'' of the pre-television
era. Many factors have contributed to that relative openness to the
world, but television has played a central role.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of network-TV news coincided with a broadening of the
foreign news agenda. Until the 1960s, correspondents (print and
electronic) were based primarily in the European capitals and
Tokyo. Those covering Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and
the rest of Asia were allotted few column inches and little
airtime, regardless of what was going on in those regions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, however, that changed rapidly, not only because of
the longer network newscasts but also because of the growing
prominence of the Third World and the nonaligned nations movement,
both seen in the context of the Cold War rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Travel became a key part of the foreign correspondent's job
description. The advent of the Boeing 707 halved the time it took
journalists to get to another continent. In the 1970s the routine
use of communications satellites made same-day coverage possible,
increasing the incentive for reporters and camera crews to race off
to breaking stories in remote locations.
</P>
<P>
   Newscasts saw a marked shift from overseas feature and
background stories to hard news. They gained the immediacy of
broadcasting ``today's news today,'' at the cost of the more
explanatory coverage that had been part of the evening news of
earlier years.
</P>
<P>
   For the foreign correspondent, instant satellite communications
left little time for developing expertise in a specific country.
Reporters became known as ``firemen,'' flying from one
international conflagration to the next.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1978 I was based in London, working for NBC News. On a
Monday morning of a quiet news period, I had no plans to leave the
city. By Saturday, I had covered South Moluccans seizing hostages
in the Netherlands, the Israeli incursion to the Litani River in
southern Lebanon, and the kidnapping of Prime Minister Aldo Moro in
Rome, and had returned home _ three stories in three countries on
two continents in five days.
</P>
<P>
   The passing of the Cold War era has left many institutions
adrift, searching for a new order or definition, and television
news is no exception. Broad viewer interest in world affairs is
declining from its modest Cold War heights just as U.S. global
influence is reaching new levels. This is the result of several
administrations' efforts to expand trade, businesses' need to
expand overseas, and the global dominance of American popular
culture, all driven by American leadership in the development and
exploitation of new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Today more Americans than ever before are working and traveling
abroad, from CEOs to sales reps, students and tourists.
International trade is equal to about one-quarter of the U.S. gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites transmit daily television programs from Europe, the
Middle East, Asia and Latin America. One can choose from on-line
computer services or download volumes of free information and
commentary from sites on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   More than the other news media, television is caught between the
declining interest in international affairs and rising costs and
competition. It is the most expensive medium for news, and
production costs for international reporting are particularly high.
</P>
<P>
   A correspondent for a newspaper, magazine, press agency or radio
station or network is engaged in what is basically one-person
journalism. He or she can travel to the scene of a story alone,
cover it alone, write it up alone, and transmit it alone via
telephone, fax or E-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But TV is of a different magnitude. The basic working unit in
international news consists of a correspondent, a field producer, a
cameraperson and a sound engineer, plus some 600 pounds of camera
and personal equipment. If a report is to be prepared for satellite
transmission, an editor and an additional 600 pounds of editing
equipment come along. (Because American television's technical
standards are incompatible with the systems the rest of the world
uses, the networks must bring all their own equipment.)
</P>
<P>
   The cost of this journalistic caravan, including hotels, per
diem expenses, car rentals and local support staff, begins at
around $3,000 a day. Airfare and excess-baggage charges can easily
reach $12,000. Then there are ``extras'' such as satellite fees.
New digital technology, including smaller and lighter cameras and
editing equipment, will eventually reduce costs, but there is no
indication that the networks would use the savings to increase
international coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The new litmus test at network news programs is whether viewers
(in the producers' opinion) will instinctively ``relate'' to the
story. As in other industries, as choice increases, power shifts
from the producer to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   It is at this juncture that the new competitive pressures
collide with the journalistic ethos of the foreign correspondent as
well as the expectations of viewers interested in international
affairs. The network news programs and, indeed, news programs in
general ought to consider not only whether their response to market
forces can sustain good journalism but whether it is a sound
long-term business decision.
</P>
<P>
   The programs' producers can claim to be focusing on their
customers, or at least the largest portion of them. But the
editorial downsizing, narrowing of focus and increasing homogeneity
of content give viewers searching for broader exposure to the world
even less reason to watch the programs. It is a slippery slope.

   Television's foreign correspondents do not travel light.
</P>
<P>
   Off camera, their distinguishing feature is the small mountain
of equipment traveling with them, which sets baggage handlers to
dreaming of large tips and airlines to calculating budget-busting
excess-weight charges.
</P>
<P>
   The financial burden of that luggage is only one factor making
the network-TV foreign correspondent an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   New technologies in cable and satellite TV have turned the
stable, predictable, almost automatically profitable television
marketplace into a competitive cauldron in which journalism must
increasingly compete with entertainment programming. This has
prompted a redefining, or at least a questioning, of the
traditional news agenda in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   Producers and network executives believe the American mass
audience's interest in daily events beyond their nation's borders
is declining, so little such news is offered. And yet the image of
the correspondent reporting from some troubled land has become
firmly imprinted in viewers' imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, a television foreign correspondent performed
three functions. First, he _ it was a mostly male club _ was a
journalist reporting the story.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the report's producer, deciding what events or
visual elements needed to be filmed and what interviews recorded to
make the story. In the half-hour news format, reports initially ran
a minimum of two-and-a-half minutes and often three to five
minutes, compared with one-and-a-half minutes or even less today.
</P>
<P>
   Reports required a narrative line with the reporter as
storyteller, which brought up the correspondent's third role, more
image-driven than the first two but equally essential: He was a
familiar figure who established the news program's ``presence'' in
the story.
</P>
<P>
   Merely by being there, the correspondent gave the network
credibility, demonstrating to viewers that his organization spared
no effort or expense to be on the scene anywhere in the world where
important events were taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, however, it became apparent that the
correspondent had a partner with a will of its own: the camera. If
television's greatest strength was the transmission of human
experience rather than facts, analysis or concepts, the
correspondent ran the risk of becoming little more than a caption
writer for the moving pictures.
</P>
<P>
   With TV covering the earth, the question facing the foreign
correspondent was whether television news, besides offering drama
and emotion, could add, if not to viewers' detailed knowledge of
the world, at least to their awareness of it. The answer, I
believe, is that it has, although the effect is difficult to
quantify.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Vietnam War, television had an impact on public
opinion, which in turn affected the government's formulation of
foreign policy. Moreover, there are few signs that most Americans
seek a return to the ``splendid isolation'' of the pre-television
era. Many factors have contributed to that relative openness to the
world, but television has played a central role.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of network-TV news coincided with a broadening of the
foreign news agenda. Until the 1960s, correspondents (print and
electronic) were based primarily in the European capitals and
Tokyo. Those covering Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and
the rest of Asia were allotted few column inches and little
airtime, regardless of what was going on in those regions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, however, that changed rapidly, not only because of
the longer network newscasts but also because of the growing
prominence of the Third World and the nonaligned nations movement,
both seen in the context of the Cold War rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Travel became a key part of the foreign correspondent's job
description. The advent of the Boeing 707 halved the time it took
journalists to get to another continent. In the 1970s the routine
use of communications satellites made same-day coverage possible,
increasing the incentive for reporters and camera crews to race off
to breaking stories in remote locations.
</P>
<P>
   Newscasts saw a marked shift from overseas feature and
background stories to hard news. They gained the immediacy of
broadcasting ``today's news today,'' at the cost of the more
explanatory coverage that had been part of the evening news of
earlier years.
</P>
<P>
   For the foreign correspondent, instant satellite communications
left little time for developing expertise in a specific country.
Reporters became known as ``firemen,'' flying from one
international conflagration to the next.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1978 I was based in London, working for NBC News. On a
Monday morning of a quiet news period, I had no plans to leave the
city. By Saturday, I had covered South Moluccans seizing hostages
in the Netherlands, the Israeli incursion to the Litani River in
southern Lebanon, and the kidnapping of Prime Minister Aldo Moro in
Rome, and had returned home _ three stories in three countries on
two continents in five days.
</P>
<P>
   The passing of the Cold War era has left many institutions
adrift, searching for a new order or definition, and television
news is no exception. Broad viewer interest in world affairs is
declining from its modest Cold War heights just as U.S. global
influence is reaching new levels. This is the result of several
administrations' efforts to expand trade, businesses' need to
expand overseas, and the global dominance of American popular
culture, all driven by American leadership in the development and
exploitation of new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Today more Americans than ever before are working and traveling
abroad, from CEOs to sales reps, students and tourists.
International trade is equal to about one-quarter of the U.S. gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites transmit daily television programs from Europe, the
Middle East, Asia and Latin America. One can choose from on-line
computer services or download volumes of free information and
commentary from sites on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   More than the other news media, television is caught between the
declining interest in international affairs and rising costs and
competition. It is the most expensive medium for news, and
production costs for international reporting are particularly high.
</P>
<P>
   A correspondent for a newspaper, magazine, press agency or radio
station or network is engaged in what is basically one-person
journalism. He or she can travel to the scene of a story alone,
cover it alone, write it up alone, and transmit it alone via
telephone, fax or E-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But TV is of a different magnitude. The basic working unit in
international news consists of a correspondent, a field producer, a
cameraperson and a sound engineer, plus some 600 pounds of camera
and personal equipment. If a report is to be prepared for satellite
transmission, an editor and an additional 600 pounds of editing
equipment come along. (Because American television's technical
standards are incompatible with the systems the rest of the world
uses, the networks must bring all their own equipment.)
</P>
<P>
   The cost of this journalistic caravan, including hotels, per
diem expenses, car rentals and local support staff, begins at
around $3,000 a day. Airfare and excess-baggage charges can easily
reach $12,000. Then there are ``extras'' such as satellite fees.
New digital technology, including smaller and lighter cameras and
editing equipment, will eventually reduce costs, but there is no
indication that the networks would use the savings to increase
international coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The new litmus test at network news programs is whether viewers
(in the producers' opinion) will instinctively ``relate'' to the
story. As in other industries, as choice increases, power shifts
from the producer to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   It is at this juncture that the new competitive pressures
collide with the journalistic ethos of the foreign correspondent as
well as the expectations of viewers interested in international
affairs. The network news programs and, indeed, news programs in
general ought to consider not only whether their response to market
forces can sustain good journalism but whether it is a sound
long-term business decision.
</P>
<P>
   The programs' producers can claim to be focusing on their
customers, or at least the largest portion of them. But the
editorial downsizing, narrowing of focus and increasing homogeneity
of content give viewers searching for broader exposure to the world
even less reason to watch the programs. It is a slippery slope.

25 percent if the patient is given CPR before being hooked up to
the defibrillator.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings, outlined in two studies published Wednesday,
will pose a huge challenge for communities considering the costs of
CPR training and equipping all fire departments, ambulance services
and other public agencies with defibrillators. But doing so could
yield huge rewards: saving thousands of lives among the 250,000
people who die each year in America of sudden cardiac death outside
of hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a community had widespread CPR training of citizens and
fire and police officials, and very rapid defibrillation, you could
possibly double or triple cardiac survival rates,'' said Dr. Ian G.
Stiell, associate professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa
and lead author of the defibrillation study in the current Journal
of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very inexpensive and low-tech approaches to
resuscitation,'' he added. ``They certainly could save thousands of
lives a year, there's no question it would be in the thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard A. Cobb, primary author of the CPR study and a
professor of medicine emeritus at the University of Washington, was
equally enthused: ``I think you can make a good thing better by
trying to optimize the interaction between CPR and
defibrillation.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have known for years that defibrillators save lives by
shocking the heart back into beating, which is why they've pushed
so hard to get them in ambulances, fire trucks, airplanes and other
public places. But the new report makes clear how those
defibrillators can be used more effectively to raise the dismally
low odds of survival for people who suffer heart attacks outside
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers zeroed in on 19 urban and suburban communities
around Ontario, looking at survival rates before and after the
communities reduced delays in dispatching ambulances, gave
defibrillators to firefighters and took other steps that resulted
in a 21 percent increase in the number of heart attack victims they
reached within 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The results were dramatic: a one-third jump _ from 3.9 percent
to 5.2 percent _ in patients who survived the attack and eventually
were discharged from the hospital. That translates into 21 lives
saved each year in the 19 participating cities.
</P>
<P>
   And if it works well with the 8-minute limit, it probably would
work even better if the response time could be cut to 6 minutes or
less, said Stiell: ``We could probably double the survival rate if
we could get defibrillators to the scene that quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The second study looked at a second way to raise the odds for
heart attack victims: giving them cardiopulmonary resuscitation for
about 90 seconds before hooking them up to a defibrillator.
Researchers tried the approach on 478 patients in Seattle, which
has pioneered the widespread use of defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the results were impressive: a 25 percent jump in
survival.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Washington authors say they aren't sure why
CPR seems to make defibrillation more effective, but they think it
jump-starts the flow of blood to the heart, the brain, or both.
They note that it works primarily in cases where there is a delay
of 7 or 8 minutes before the victim is hooked to the defibrillator,
and that while they used 90 seconds of CPR, future studies may show
more time _ or less _ works better.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the result ``really is quite
revolutionary,'' said Dr. Peter Stone, chairman of the CPR
Committee at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. ``I think we
will start doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Training the public to do CPR will be a substantially tougher
task, as will be getting defibrillators out to all the
emergency-response personnel who don't have them.
</P>
<P>
   Training enough members of the public in CPR to have someone on
hand to help anytime someone else suffers a heart attack, is ``a
massive public health challenge,'' said Stone. ``The CPR done in
the study by Cobb was done by experienced personnel using
ventilatory equipment as well as chest compressors. That's much
harder for the general population to provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of that equipment mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
is the only thing possible, and it's potentially more difficult.''

 &HT;    The powers of the towers: Changing the world of communication
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They are the earthbound hardware that makes the
wireless magic happen. But they are also expensive and ugly _
unless properly disguised. They are the cell phone towers.
</P>
<P>
   Around metro Atlanta, about 1,200 towers are scattered in a
variety of trappings, most obvious but many concealed or
camouflaged. Some are designed to look like pine trees, billboards
or utility poles, and others are hidden inside church steeples.
Hundreds more just look like the stark, metallic eyesores they are.
</P>
<P>
   For years, resistance by some neighborhoods to installation of a
tower has paralleled the growing urge to use cell phones _ often in
the same neighborhoods. Areas of Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood,
for example, are rife with cell phone users and also a lousy place
to get a connection. Increasingly, there has been both a
proliferation of cell phone towers and a greater effort to mask
their appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But when the nation's nearly 70 million wireless phone users hit
the talk button on their mobile phones, completion of the calls
depends on being close enough to one of those cell sites. If the
range is right, they are linked to a cell site on some tower, and
the signal passed along via wire or by another wireless signal and
the call is connected.
</P>
<P>
   Close enough can mean three to six miles _ or somewhat farther
away if you are driving relatively flat stretches of an interstate
highway. And if you are stuck in traffic, punching your phone pad
along with others alongside you, be warned that a typical cell site
can handle only about 50 or 60 calls at once. But a tower can hold
many cell sites from different companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, one of the nation's top five wireless cities with at
least one cell phone for every three people, the towers get a lot
of use. Most people, including many wireless customers, probably
give the towers no thought _ unless there is a plan to put one in
the neighborhood. Some people don't even realize that towers are
carrying the signals, believing instead their words are bouncing
off satellites high above the earth.
</P>
<P>
   But the increasingly ubiquitous wireless phone depends on
transmitters much closer to the ground. And the ownership of the
towers themselves is a business, like owning the wires that carry
land-line calls.
</P>
<P>
   Like the wires that carry local calls, most cell towers were
first built and owned by the company selling the service to the
consumer. In Atlanta, the only two wireless competitors for more
than a decade were BellSouth and AirTouch Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early going, you wanted the best possible location
because there were only two of us,'' said Jeff Battcher, BellSouth
spokesman. ``It was a competitive, strategic issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The field has since grown more crowded, and tower dynamics have
shifted.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Federal Communications Commission has been
auctioning off more wireless licenses using new parts of the
spectrum. Now, Atlanta has seven providers: the originals plus
Powertel, AT&AMP;T, Sprint, Nextel and Southern LINC.
</P>
<P>
   That has changed the business of towers.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than a century for phone lines to start carrying
calls for rival companies, and it still happens only on a fraction
of calls. By contrast, the cellular industry is barely two decades
old and the towers are increasingly being shared by competitors.
Find a tower in a place where lots of people use cellular phones
and chances are, it will hold transmission equipment from several
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining a tower costs money, but by leasing out space to
various wireless providers, the owner can often reap far more in
revenue. The average wireless company pays between $1,200 and
$1,800 a month to lease space on another company's cell tower.
Those leases can add up.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a cell site in Pittsburgh owned by Crown Castle
International reportedly has more than 100 different companies and
agencies leasing space. The result is well over $1 million per
month in revenue for just one tower.
</P>
<P>
   But even a more modest setting, where a tower holds, say five
sites, means income of $6,000 to $9,000 a month. Maintenance of a
cell tower can be minimal: cut the lawn, paint the tower, change
the lights. ... The chance to make a killing seems clear _ so why
would companies be selling their towers?
</P>
<P>
   And selling them they are _ for some big money.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Houston-based Crown Castle bought 1,400 Bell
Atlantic towers for $610 million. Two months later, Nextel sold
about 2,000 towers to SpectraSite for $560 million in cash and 17
percent ownership of the company (ownership of SpectraSite, that
is.) In March, BellSouth sold 1,850 of its towers to Crown Castle.
Only days later, West Point-based Powertel sold 650 towers for $275
million, also to Crown Castle.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those deals call for the tower company to build hundreds
or even thousands of additional towers for the carrier. For the
cellular customer, the transaction will be invisible. Calls go
through as usual. The phone companies will keep their cell sites on
the towers, but will lease space back from the tower company.
</P>
<P>
   Powertel will pay $1,800 a month for use of each tower it has
sold to Crown Castle. Nextel will pay $1,600 a month to
SpectraSite. BellSouth will pay Crown Castle $1,200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespersons for Crown Castle in Houston and American Tower
Corp. in Boston were unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The industry evidently sees towers as a good investment _ but
not a certainty. Find a good spot, where there is lots of phone
traffic or where it's hard to get permission for a second tower _
and sit back to count a healthy stream of cash from a tower crowded
with competitors' equipment. Yet many towers are a lot lonelier
than that.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has more than 300 towers in metro Atlanta, and more
than half are home to BellSouth equipment only. So why would Crown
Castle be so eager to buy those towers? The answer seems to be that
a tower company might not be profitable now, but it can get funding
from investors who expect a big payoff. On the other hand, a
cellular company might prefer to have the cash now, especially if
the deal will mean stable, predictable costs.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Lockwood, editor of Wireless Week, said the increasingly
cutthroat competition for wireless customers puts a premium on good
coverage, so many carriers are frantically expanding the
``footprint'' in which they provide service.
</P>
<P>
   That expansion is costly. Construction of a new tower costs an
average of $185,000, Lockwood said. ``I think it's mostly a
financial consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   By that measure, a new carrier's desire to duplicate the towers
in metro Atlanta would cost more than $220 million. As an added
bonus, the leasing strategy lets the carrier avoid costly,
time-consuming fights with neighborhood groups and zoning boards
for the right to erect a new tower.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the surge for wireless demand, a company might build a
tower. But it's quicker and cheaper to co-locate, that is, to put
cell sites on someone else's towers _ assuming there are towers in
the area the company wants to serve.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a company that already owns towers can see in
them a quick way to pick up cash _ lots of it, Lockwood said.
``It's every important to use whatever cash is available to build
out the system. There is a white-hot competition and coverage is a
very important factor for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth apparently wanted its money up-front, deciding it was
distracting, expensive and maybe even counterproductive to look for
more revenue by marketing space on its towers to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still a business that is very young and speculative,''
said BellSouth's Battcher. ``Why not sell the tower to another
company and let them take the risk?''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Brinkman, marketing manager for Nextel in Georgia, said
the company made the decision to sell after realizing that its core
business was phones.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel is more interested in building its nationwide business
now rather than trying to find long-term income from leasing space,
she said. ``If we can co-locate _ like any good business would _ we
will be able to reduce costs. It's more cost-effective. Others have
more expertise in regards to towers than we would.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some companies have tenaciously held their
towers.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, for example, has more than 2,000 towers and other cell
cites already. The Kansas City, Mo.-based company plans to build
more than 1,000 more, according to Bill D'Agostino, vice president
of Sprint's tower organization.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is trying to build a nationwide service, is
looking for ways to put its sites on existing towers. When it
builds its own, it is happy to have the added income from rivals
leasing space, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is still tremendous upside in remaining in the
tower co-location business. That way we can retain some control
over the assets for Sprint's future use.''

 &HT;    Coke hopes to catch teens in web gameBy Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the second year, Coca-Cola will attempt to build
brand recognition and loyalty with an interactive online game. This
time it is using the Web to market Cherry Coke to teenage soda
drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   The game called ``Time Tremors,'' will officially be available
to consumers Thursday from the Cherry Coke Web site
(www.cherrycoke.com) or MTV's Web site
(www.mtv.com/nav/introtremors.html.)
</P>
<P>
   Master marketer Coca-Cola has always understood the power of the
Web to engage consumers and potential consumers with online games
and contests to keep users logging on and typing Coke URLs over and
over again for the duration of each contest. In the past the
company has used the hot twentysomething TV show ``Friends'' and
the Grammy Awards to promote Diet Coke online. Last year, Cherry
Coke offered up ``The Lost Island of Alanna,'' a Myst-like game
that had players searching for clues on soda bottles and the Web to
navigate their way through the game.
</P>
<P>
   With last year's Alanna, there were a few problems, including
programming bugs and Cherry Coke's hope that Alanna would become
the Web's hottest game simply by word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy with Alanna was that it was an underground way to
reach kids and tell them about the new Cherry Coke,'' says brand
manager Tim Halloran. However, while the game did have avid
players, it never vaulted into mainstream Web consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry Coke sales slumped slightly last year, according to
Beverage Digest Editor and Publisher John Sicher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cherry Coke is one of the larger small brands,'' says Beverage
Digest's Sicher. ``In 1998 , 64.8 million cases down from 66.8 in
1997. By way of example, Sicher says Diet Coke sold 852 million
cases in 1998. But Halloran still says that ``Alanna'' was a
success. ``It became a much cooler brand in their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke has learned from Alanna, according to promotions manager
Christy Barrineau. One key lesson was is that in the Web's
hyper-competitive commercial environment, building a site and
waiting for eager gamers to show up isn't going to make it. This
time Cherry Coke is coming out of the blocks with traditional
marketing firepower, including print ads in gaming magazines,
banner ads on popular online gaming sites such as SonyOnline, and a
huge advertisement on MTV's Web site. Then of course, there are the
bottles themselves which tout the game. The more bottle caps users
collect, the more time they'll have to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   While it is possible to play Time Tremors without ever buying or
even looking at a bottle of CherryCoke, you won't be able to
complete the game without buying at least one bottle of the soft
drink. Halloran says that lots of research with its 13-18 year old
demographic revealed that kids don't mind having to buy cola to
finish the game. ``They said they were going to be drinking soda
anyway, so it might as well be Cherry Coke,'' Halloran says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we learned from last year, is that you are reinventing
the wheel to get teens to your site when you are a packaged goods
company. We decided to go to places on the Web where teens already
are. With MTV, we found we had some great opportunities,'' she
says. ``They will let users download Time Tremors from their site
and they are also giving us some great promotion. They are offering
game players the opportunity to share hints and tips.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Tremors'' is a role playing game where players choose a
character, male or female, and head off on a field trip only to
wind up in time capsule travelling though more than 100 different
worlds trying to keep the space-time continuum from being altered
forever. Each player will have a different gaming experience, which
is also part of Cherry Coke's master plan to associate the soda
with the idea of being creative and different.
</P>
<P>
   Internet analysts and pundits can literally talk for days about
the need for marketers to get customers involved with the brand.
There are a few companies on the Web who understand how to do this,
such as Land's End with it's interactive ``paper dolls'' that let
users try on its apparel; CoverGirl, which let's users experiment
with make up shades on various models, and Coca-Cola which uses the
Web expertly to help users connect with the brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get kids to experience being creative and being
different and what we really have seen is that it builds up the
brand in the minds of the people who play the game,'' Halloran
says. ``It's not like showing them a TV ad or talking to them on a
radio ad. We have kids interacting with our brand for two or three
hours at a time,'' he says. ``If you provide teens with an exciting
online experience, they'll think more highly and much more
positively about the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   We're not just putting up an electronic billboard that says buy
our stuff,'' Barrineau, ``We are giving them an experience.''

 &HT;    Abilene Project produces next Internet generation
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the Internet, sometimes called the information
superhighway, could be compared to the swift Interstate highway
system, Internet 2 is like a space launch. Dedicated mostly to
education and research, it is superfast. No Sunday afternoon
drivers allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Abilene Project, this second Internet started much
like the first, mostly by a consortium of schools _ in this
instance a roster of some 37 universities, as diverse and widely
separated as Georgia Tech, the University of Washington, Harvard
and the South Dakota School of Mines.
</P>
<P>
   It is also assisted by the expertise and equipment of private
businesses like Qwest Communications, Cisco Systems, and Nortel
Networks.
</P>
<P>
   While the speed of e-mail and surfing on the Internet can be
impressive, this system, bolstered by banks of supercomputers, is
beyond compare with networks commonly in use. Gordon D. Wishon,
Tech information technology staff specialist, describes it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's Internet, even at its fastest, will not support
important research and education applications, such as remote
manipulation of scientific instruments and storage and transmission
of massive experimental data sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical application of digital video, such as telesurgery,
will not be possible without the capabilities Internet 2 will
provide ... at speeds initially equivalent to 600 times as fast as
current (and relatively fast) T1-based networks.''
</P>
<P>
   T1 networks are commonly used now by business and other special
commercial operators for the high-speed transmission of data.
</P>
<P>
   Wishon and others add the new superfast networks will have
better quality, as well as speed.
</P>
<P>
   The hallmark of the new network has been cooperation among
universities that often compete for talent and prestige, and
between the educational community and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   In this region specifically, an agreement back in 1997 between
Georgia and North Carolina laid some groundwork for the larger
system. The two states connected their two high-speed networks,
thereby establishing communication among universities in both
states.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year, universities in Georgia banded together to
produce something called the Southern Crossroads GigaPop, serving
institutions in this state as well as Florida and Alabama, filling
in the larger system now known as Internet 2.
</P>
<P>
   For the technical minded, the Abilene backbone spans more than
10,000 miles and operates at 2.4 gigabits per second _ that's
45,000 times faster than the familiar 56k bps modem employed in
many personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The system will be far-reaching by the end of this year,
possibly comprising a network connecting more than 70
</P>
<P>
   institutions of higher learning and research centers.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what the private partners have contributed: Qwest has
provided its special advanced fiber optic network and engineering
support. Cisco has contributed high-speed communications equipment
that facilitates the integration of data, voice and video, as well
as engineering support for 11 nodes or intersections of the system.
And Nortel has provided its expertise in networking, as well as
optical networking.
</P>
<P>
   The organization guiding the development of the Abilene Project
is the University Corporation for Advanced Internet
</P>
<P>
   Development (UCAID), headed by Douglas E. Van Houweling,
president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remarkable collaboration among the partners has provided
Internet 2 members with unsurpassed networking capabilities,'' he
said, and the benefit of this communication will pour forth through
the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Where we are concerned here in Georgia, the Internet 2 network
is providing a communications equivalent of the air and ground
transportation network. And just as the transportation hub has
spurred economic growth in this century, the communications hub
could be pivotal in the next century.

 &HT;    Q and A with inventor Linus TorvaldsBy Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Linus Torvalds, is the inventor of the Linux computer
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Never heard of Linux? Well, don't worry, Microsoft has. Linux,
long a favorite of business users and advanced computer hobbyists,
is becoming a realistic worry for Microsoft. Many consider the
system to be more stable than Windows and less demanding of
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds, 29, will speak to the AIIM International trade group
April 12-15 at the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you going to say next week?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't tend to prepare my talks very much in advance. It's
going to be a fairly regular Linux talk. I will tell them what is
important is networking and stability _ that is fairly important if
you expect to retain your documents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you see Linux getting used now?
</P>
<P>
   A: At the extreme high-end. There are some people on desktops
who use Linux but only in certain environments. Like for a really
large database. Linux doesn't tend to scale to the 64 CPU mXXXX
that some people are using.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who shouldn't be using Linux?
</P>
<P>
   A: When the main use of a machine is Windows applications, it's
probably better to use a Windows operating system, however painful
that is to me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are we going to see Linux retooled for desktops, where most
computer users are and where Microsoft Windows really dominates?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's certainly a goal to make it accessible to a real Windows
user. I think that is two or three years away from it being a real
alternative. For your average technophobe ... maybe it's two or
three years away.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is this what you expected for Linux when you designed it?
</P>
<P>
   A: None of it was quite as I expected. It started as a program
for my own use. I was blown away by how many people there were with
similar needs. It certainly has grown faster than I thought it
would. I have been doing this for eight years. The last six months
have not been that surprising because I was already starting to see
what was happening. It was obvious to me that there were a lot of
companies that wanted Linux, but were held back by worries about
its market acceptance. A lot have been held back by nervousness
about the lack of applications. The next hurdle is when the
application houses start jumping in.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do people use Linux?
</P>
<P>
   A: Different people have different reasons ... The technology
appeals to many .... Like scientists or artists, who aren't out for
dollars. They are out for the appreciation of their peers. There
are moral issues, too. The ability to have a user customize his
system by giving him the power to do what he wants to do, by giving
him the source code....
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is that this is really is a powerful way of doing
development. The Internet allows the kind of connections that
people haven't had access to before.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since the system code is on the Net, since it is given away,
what is in it for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: My satisfaction is basically doing something and something
well. The act of doing Linux is immensely satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are you doing now? Where do you work?
</P>
<P>
   A: The company I work for is extremeley secretive. We are in
Santa Clara, and all I can say is that the office line is Transmeta
does cool stuff.
</P>
<P>
   I like my work and I want to do my work in my spare time too. I
do Linux as a hobby but some people think that means it is not
important. They don't get the message.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How old are you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm 29.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you mind being called a visionary?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am not the kind of visionary who wants to have his message
out to the masses. The difference between a visionary and a person
with strong ideals is that a visionary tries two impose his ideals
and persuade others. The proof is in the doing, and I am happy
talking about it, but I don't want to preach.

 &HT;    Threat of job losses has Y2K workers on alert
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Governor Roy Barnes recalled for an audience
Rotarians how he told his department heads earlier this year that
anyone who missed the year-end deadline in fixing the millennium
bug would be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our compliance has gone way up since then,'' said Barnes, who
was addressing a meeting of the Atlanta Rotary earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he felt compelled to make his ultimatum because the
state had been lagging behind others in upgrading its vast computer
systems to recognize any dates beyond Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia technology was antiquated and we had to throw a bunch
of it away,'' said Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   That fact was highlighted in a recent survey conducted by CIO, a
magazine that caters to government and corporate chief information
officers. The magazine's survey found that only 36 percent of the
state's computer systems and software had been made Y2K compliant
as of Dec. 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, the state had already spent $152 million to fix the
problem, according to CIO. Another $170 million has since been
allocated to Y2K, bringing total allocated expenditures for the
problem to $322 million.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, said CIO magazine, Nebraska has ``virtually''
fixed its state computers and spent only $21 million to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia state officials criticized CIO's survey on Tuesday.
``Its out of date,'' said Ted Fisher, a consultant who is secretary
of the Governor's Y2K Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher added that, as of the committee's last meeting on March
5, Y2K compliance at state agencies had jumped to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say we were ahead of the pack now,'' said Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Y2k is a potentially serious problem for state governments,
which have computerized many operations. For example, most, if not
all government disbursements such as monthly welfare checks are
computerized. Also computerized are things such as child abuse
reports.
</P>
<P>
   An uncompliant social service system might, for example, fail to
recognize a report on a child abuse incident after Jan.1 , 2000.

`SURRENDER, DOROTHY': SLENDER NOVEL, LEAN-CUISINE CHARM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sara Swerdlow is not the kind of person you expect to die young.
She is a 30-year-old perpetual student of Japanese at Columbia
University, a person who seems to have put off adulthood, even
mortality, indefinitely, and she is pretty and charming to boot.
But Sara dies in a traffic accident in the Hamptons. Abruptly her
mother (more like an older sister than a typical mother) and the
friends who shared her summer cottage find their lives thrown into
gloom and disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surrender, Dorothy,'' Meg Wolitzer's slender new novel, tells
the story of the aftermath of Sara's death. It follows the vapor
trails left by the lives of Natalie Swerdlow, Sara's possessive,
self-centered, divorced mother, and of Adam Langer, a playwright
who was Sara's inseparable best friend and confidant. Adam's lover,
Shawn Best, is also a playwright, but he is aspiring where Adam has
arrived, and he is desperate for some success. Also in the picture
are Maddie and Peter, a lawyer and a high school teacher
ambivalently married and the parents of a 7-month-old boy named
Duncan whose behavior is roughly as mature as that of the adults
who surround him and only a bit more aimless.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolitzer, whose previous novels include ``Hidden Pictures''
and ``Friends for Life,'' is a skillful practitioner of a kind of
Upper West Side literary genre: a close relative of the cinematic
genre most associated with Nora Ephron and movies like ``Sleepless
in Seattle'' and ``You've Got Mail.'' Ms. Ephron's debut as a movie
director, ``This Is My Life,'' was based on Ms. Wolitzer's ``This
Is Your Life.'' The ingredients of the genre are a kind of wistful,
Meg Ryan adorableness, a post-sexual-revolution erotic casualness,
a set of comfortingly familiar post-yuppie characters and a keen,
campy appreciation of the artifacts of yuppie life (Starbucks,
psychoanalysis and semiotics majors at Brown).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolitzer is a witty and likable writer with a tenderhearted,
critical awareness of the lighter-than-air quality of her
characters. There is an appealing delicacy to her writing and a
skillful exploitation of the almost invisible neuroses of the
people who pass through her pages. But her novel also incarnates
the very weightlessness it describes. It is a divertimento, not a
symphony, less a satiric commentary than an artifact of the world
it parodies and therefore similar to it in its adolescent ``Leave
It to Beaver'' fecklessness.
</P>
<P>
   This is a novel, after all, that uses an image from ``The Wizard
of Oz'' as its refrain, whose characters' recollection of summer
camp make up their most vivid memories. Ms. Wolitzer's themes _
jealousy, neurotic possessiveness, halfhearted infidelity, even the
floating menace of AIDS _ make for a very contemporary broth, but
it is one that stays well under the spiritual boiling point.
</P>
<P>
   Sara, even in her death, is the central character of Ms.
Wolitzer's story, and she is also emblematic of the charm and
insouciance of her entire dramatis personae. ``Sara would be loved.
Sara Swerdlow would get away with it; she would float through
everything she undertook, and no one would mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara was the only person in her circle who was not jealous of
Adam, who wrote a play, a light comedy about a Jewish family on
Mars, that went all the way to Broadway. ``Adam represented a
certain mainstream brand of gay culture that was bookish and
appealing and highly presentable.'' He and Sara were a couple whose
very lack of sexual attraction for each other made for a kind of
higher intimacy, especially when compared with the passionlessness
of their relations with boyfriends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friendship was a thing of extraordinary value, ever since it
had become clear to both of them that lovers never lasted and that
families were the traps you walked into on major holidays and
emerged from the next day, stuffed with carbohydrates and
seething.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sara dies on her way back from a quick excursion to the
Fro-Z-Cone near her group summer house, her entourage is thrown
together in grief. Natalie, the mother who never quite cut the
umbilical cord, had ``been having sex all evening'' and finds out
about the tragedy only the next morning. In her shock at getting
the news over her cell phone, she has a car accident in a New
Jersey-Manhattan tunnel; it is as if she can't get through life
without doing all of the things her daughter has done.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie drives to Long Island and shows up at the disheveled
summer rental where the rest of Ms. Wolitzer's story unfolds.
Sara's friends have not been in car accidents of their own, but
they have been living ``like squatters in the darkness of a
tunnel.'' With Natalie's arrival, they are shaken out of their
torpor just enough to begin to live out the conflicts that Sara's
disappearance brings to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn desperately tries to exploit his relationship with Adam to
advance his cause as a playwright. Hapless and poor and too
terrified to get tested for HIV (even though five of his former
lovers have died of AIDS), he is taken in hand by Natalie, who is
glad for the opportunity to be somebody's mother. Maddie, already
alienated from Peter, finds her annoyance with him intensifying.
She had told Sara the basic problem: ``He's male. And therefore, I
don't think he understands women.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Adam misses Sara and his second play is going badly.
The residents of the summer house begin to quarrel, not exactly in
the searing fashion of ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' but with
a certain restrained testiness all the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a geometry of bad feelings in the air _ none of it
referred to directly.'' But it is here also that Ms. Wolitzer's
story takes on the spiritually undernourished quality of the world
it evokes. ``Surrender, Dorothy'' retains its lean-cuisine charm
right to the end, and it proffers a degree of resolution for each
of the characters who have suffered in the wake of Sara's demise.
Life drifts on, in other words, and so does Ms. Wolitzer's book,
wry and hip and well endowed with witty lines but always just a bit
too cute, self-consciously inoffensive, like the lightweight
confection that it is.

TYCOON LINKED TO YELTSIN SOUGHT BY PROSECUTORS

 (Budgeted as Russia-Roundup)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Prosecutors Tuesday ordered the arrest of an
influential Russian tycoon with close links to President Boris N.
Yeltsin, turning up the pressure on the embattled Kremlin leader a
week before he faces an impeachment vote in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant went out for Boris Berezovsky, a longtime confidant
of Yeltsin's family, whose reputed influence over Kremlin policy in
recent years has been outdone only by the alleged worth of his
shadowy business holdings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the seven so-called ``oligarchs'' who backed Yeltsin's
reelection campaign in 1996 and later claimed to control half of
Russia's economy, Berezovsky came to epitomize the New Russian
business magnates who have parlayed Kremlin ties and easy access to
state property into huge industrial, oil and media empires.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suspect Berezovsky of setting up a Swiss company
to hide the hard currency earnings of Aeroflot, Russia's
state-owned airline. Aeroflot is one of several prominent Russian
companies in which Berezovsky, once believed to be one of the
world's most wealthy men, reportedly has a stake.
</P>
<P>
   The move against Berezovsky comes during a murky power struggle
among Moscow's political elite that has distracted attention in
Russia from Moscow's diplomatic efforts to halt NATO's airstrikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest order also comes as a corruption probe backed by
Yeltsin's Communist foes in parliament has implicated members of
his family and inner circle in alleged misuse of state funds.
Yeltsin, meanwhile, has been trying to fire Russia's Prosecutor
General Yury Skuratov, who launched the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   It is a murky tale with no heroes. Skuratov, who had served
Yeltsin loyally since 1995 before turning against him this year,
has been criticized for sitting on evidence that was available four
years ago. Yeltsin has been accused of trying to shut down
legitimate corruption investigations. Yeltsin's opponents in
parliament have been criticized for pushing their impeachment case
at a time when Moscow has been trying to show unity over Kosovo.
And Berezovsky is one of Russia's least popular figures.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of activity Tuesday, Skuratov tendered his
resignation as federal prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for the
commercial director of Aeroflot, Berezvovsky associate Nikolai
Gluzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   A warrant was also issued for another ``oligarch'' and former
backer of Yeltsin's 1996 campaign, banker Alexander Smolensky, on
charges related to a seven-year-old embezzlement case.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky has been in France since he was removed last week
from his job as secretary of the loose alliance of Russia and 11
other former Soviet republics, a position that carried immunity
from prosecution. Tuesday, he said the charges against him were
trumped up by the prosecutor's Communist ``soul mates'' in
parliament, and he told the Russian news agency Interfax his
enemies ``don't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But like his fellow ``oligarchs,'' Berezovsky's once-legendary
power has diminished significantly since last August's financial
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   His empire, built largely on his connections with Yeltsin's
family, has been losing a struggle with the increasingly powerful
prime minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov. In February, police raided the
offices of Aeroflot and other companies Berezovsky allegedly
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Last month parliament slapped down Yeltsin's request to have
Skuratov removed. It was a humiliating defeat made all the more
embarassing when a sex video starring someone who resembled
Skuratov was shown on state television in what looked like a clumsy
and sleazy Kremlin effort to remove the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Moscow city prosecutor opened a criminal case
against Skuratov, charging that he had given favors to a
businessman who paid for his sessions with prostitutes. The Kremlin
said the evidence came from one of the women in the sex video;
Yeltsin's critics charged that the case was fabricated.

 &HT;    Net.Bank system user-friendly, competitive
 &HT;    (EDS: Sidebar to main NETBANK story.)

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Higher interest rates on money market and CD accounts
are driving the popularity of Internet banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virtual banks have been most competitive on those deposit
rates,'' said Brian J. O'Connor, managing editor of Bank Rate
Monitor, a Florida-based surveyor of banking services and fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not paying for services you don't need,'' O'Connor
said, `` and they're passing the savings along to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Net.Bank has remained prominent in that competition.
For example, it offers a six-month certificate of deposit paying
5.25 percent, according to Bank Rate Monitor's figures. The
national average was 4.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank's yield on money market accounts _ 5.13 percent _ is
``as much as some longer-term CDs,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is becoming increasingly stiff, he added. Scores
of banks, savings and loans and credit unions offer online
services. They range from the big national banks, such as First
Union and Citibank, to smaller local ones.
</P>
<P>
   Customers typically set up an account at the online bank's Web
page. Deposits can be made through the mail or electronically, by
direct deposit.
</P>
<P>
   They can get to their accounts _ to pay bills and conduct other
business _ from any computer with an Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   To get actual cash, the account holder usually visits an ATM
operated by a regular bank.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the higher rates, Bank Rate Monitor listed other
advantages of online banking:
</P>
<P>
   _ Access to accounts any hour of the day or night.
</P>
<P>
   _ And nearly instantaneous execution of the customer's
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also disadvantages:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The big disadvantage is that the things you want to do in
the lobby are not going to happen,'' said O'Connor. That includes
buying travelers checks or money orders.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you get cash from another bank's ATM, you will probably
have to pay that bank a fee of $1.50 or $2.
</P>
<P>
   _ You may have to put in considerable time entering data to set
up an account via a computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the computer is down, so is access to your account.
</P>

   VENICE _ Rich tourists in Venice flock to the island of
Giudecca, site of the Cipriani Hotel. Homeless cats take up
residence on San Clemente, a lush island nearby on the lagoon. The
cat shelter menu is not as varied as the hotel's, but feline guests
are served fresh pasta with kidney sauce every day by doting
volunteers from the animal rights organization Dingo.
</P>
<P>
   And those volunteers are not happy about the city's plans to
evict San Clemente's 250 sick or stray cats and relocate them to a
smaller, damper strip of land on the Lido. Neither, for that
matter, are the elected leaders of the neighborhood where the cats
are tentatively destined.
</P>
<P>
   San Clemente, which was sold at auction in February to a
real-estate development consortium, is Venice's latest attempt to
brighten its economic prospects. But as with almost all such
efforts, planning for the future keeps getting tangled up in
Venice's past. The dispute, moreover, is covered by a thick fog of
bureaucratic confusion and mistrust over what exactly is the plan
for San Clemente and its cats.
</P>
<P>
   It can get ugly. One local Lido official complained that his
political opponents were spreading a rumor that the cats had AIDS
to prevent their transfer there. (Actually, some do have the feline
immunodeficiency virus, which is not transferable to humans.)
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Dingo persuaded the city to open a cat clinic and
sanctuary on San Clemente, an ancient pilgrimage site that in the
19th century served as an insane asylum and was finally closed down
in 1992. Imposing 19th-century buildings are still intact, as is an
exquisite Baroque church, though it was stripped of its most
precious art works by thieves in 1992, when the island was
uninhabited and unguarded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a guard and three watchdogs keep strangers away. Sick cats
are tended by volunteers in a clinic inside one of the abandoned
buildings. Healthier cats live outdoors in the rambling ivy-covered
garden, sleeping in wooden sheds and playing in large cages set
amid chestnut trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shudder at the idea they will leave this haven, especially
those who grew up here,'' Stefania Caruso, 40, a Dingo volunteer
who has looked after the San Clemente cats for the last four years,
said indignantly. ``They are trusting. They don't understand
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Cats in Venice have reason to be trusting. Venetians believe
that cats helped save their city from the devastating plague of
1348 by killing diseased rats and treat them with deference. (There
were some lapses, notably during World War II, when cats were
eaten.)
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, more than 12,000 stray cats roamed the
streets, and many were sick and starving. In 1964, an English
tourist, Helena Sanders, was so appalled that she and Venetian cat
lovers formed Dingo, which now maintains several cat colonies in
Venice, including San Clemente. Venice was the first Italian city
to pass an animal rights act, in 1987 (one was adopted nationally
in 1991), and it guarantees stray cats an area to live in freedom.
The city provides money for food, and caters to the powerful animal
lovers' lobby. At City Hall, the mayor has a special adviser on
animals, Andreina Corso. She is an unapologetic advocate who
describes Venice as too anthropocentric.
</P>
<P>
   Venice has succeeded in controlling its cat population, which is
now about 5,000. But it is unable to prevent the exodus of
Venetians, who keep fleeing the island for better jobs and cheaper
housing on the mainland. The city now has about 70,000 residents,
many of whom are over 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dream of a new harmonious relationship between people and
animals,'' Miss Corso said wistfully. ``but that can only happen if
Venice is repopulated.''
</P>
<P>
   San Clemente may be repopulated one day, but the residents will
be short-term tourists. Compagnia Finanziare di Investimento, the
real-estate consortium that includes Benetton, the clothing
manufacturer, bought it for $11 million. The company expects to
spend $40 million in restorations before selling it to a hotel
chain as a 300-room luxury hotel and conference center.
</P>
<P>
   Cats are not part of the package. ``I love cats, but 200 is too
many,'' said Aldo Mazzoco, a director of the real-estate
consortium. ``Our deal was that the city would take them away.''
</P>
<P>
   That was supposed to happen in December, but the deadline
expired as Venetians debated. Sandro Cicogna, president of the
neighborhood association of Malamocco, on the Lido, said he had
agreed to accept the cat shelter temporarily, and only on the
condition that the city also build a soccer field and a small park
near the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm being duped,'' he said. ``But how can we resolve
this? Kill the cats?''
</P>
<P>
   Other Lido residents are bitterly skeptical, and say they
believe that the cat colony will take the place of a soccer field.
``Our kids will have to pay 10,000 lire'' _ nearly $6 _ ``to go
play elsewhere when they could have played here for free,''
complained Arturo Longo, 75. ``It's a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Gianni Gusso, a member of the neighborhood association, said he
was opposed to the cat shelter because once there, it might not
easily be dislodged. ``In Venice,'' he complained, `` `temporary'
means anywhere from one year to eternity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The city, which has the authority to impose the colony without
the neighborhood's approval, says it is operating in good faith.
``We will do everything we said,'' Mario Scattolin, manager of the
Venice environment office, said wearily. ``Its just that nobody
trusts us.''
</P>
<P>
   And certainly there is plenty of ill will between the city and
the cat lovers. Scattolin said that no more than 180 cats would go
to the Lido; the rest would either be adopted, sent to other cat
colonies in the city, or, in the case of dangerously ill cats,
exterminated.
</P>
<P>
   Dingo does put incurable animals to sleep, but only as a last
resort. Now, its volunteers fear that the city will kill cats who
are merely infected with the feline immunodeficiency virus, and not
terminally ill, to lower the number of cats at the new location.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is some way to resolve logistical problems, then they
can forget about it,'' Mariuccia Torres, director of Dingo, said in
a shaky voice. ``We will fight to the end to protect these
animals.''

 &HT;    Information conference to address Net topics
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Association for Information and Image Management
(AIIM) International comes to Atlanta's World Congress Center April
12-15 for its annual conference and trade show for people in the
information management community.
</P>
<P>
   The conference will address a variety of topics including
Knowledge Management, XML, Linux, workflow on the Web, enterprise
document management and electronic commerce. Ted Leonsis, president
of AOL Interactive Properties, will be the keynote speaker for the
conference. In a recent interview, he shared some of his thoughts
on AOL and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the Internet changed consumers' habits?
</P>
<P>
   A: Defintely. The Internet has moved past being just a media
phenomenon. It's moved beyond just a way to get information or
entertainment to becoming a part of people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think has contributed to the Net's becoming so
important to consumers in such a relatively short time span?
</P>
<P>
   A: People are doing things online better and faster than they
could offline. Besides gathering information and socializing, they
are also shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the key to turning AOL users or Web users in general
from online browsers to online buyers?
</P>
<P>
   A: We are very selective about how we recruit (e-commerce)
partners because standards are higher on the Internet than they are
offline. You have to have a service that is easy to use. From the
marketing side, you have to make the first impression count _ you
really have to work at it.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers come to an e-commerce site thinking they should be
getting things faster, cheaper and better because they are getting
them from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what do you do to make the online shopping experience more
enjoyable?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've always believed in making areas ``stickier'' _ we say
to our partners, `Don't think you are just in the sales business.
You have to develop a relationship with the customer.'
</P>
<P>
   For example, this past weekend, I happened to be down in Florida
with my family and we were down by the pool and this great song
came on the radio by this great band called Sugar Ray. Later that
afternoon, I'm checking e-mail and my son says can we buy that CD,
and I'm a member of CDNow and I ordered it. A few seconds later I
got the e-mail saying my order was received and it told us about
another CD by Sugar Ray. So we listened to the Real Audio samples
and we liked that, too, and we bought it.
</P>
<P>
   Here I was able to buy the product right away. I didn't leave my
house and CDNow sold two CDs. I'm a happy consumer.

 &HT;    A year after Masters win, O'Meara's life is good
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _He doesn't come to Augusta National this week as
the player everyone is buzzing about, but it won't bother Mark
O'Meara. After all, even in the last hour of last year's Masters,
before the 20-footer that fell to change his life, people lining
the fairways still were thinking more about Fred Couples or David
Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara likes it that way. Forget about the old man, the
guy with the silver in his temples, and he just might putt you into
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval has the planet in an overlapping grip with 11 wins
in 34 tries. He is the prohibitive Masters favorite and might be
similarly installed all summer.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Meara has the Masters trophy, a Claret Jug and the new
house in Orlando disguised as a Ritz-Carlton. As Duval concedes,
all the BellSouth Classics and Michelob Championships in history
would not compare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life,'' O'Meara said, ``is pretty darn good.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-footer, of course, changed everything. One minute O'Meara
is the King of Pebble Beach, a master of the corporate outing and a
top-five man on the career money list. A few seconds later at the
18th green, the ball is tracking toward its target, breaking to the
left just as he figured.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the 41-year-old O'Meara is nervous. Watching video
tapes since then, he said, ``I look at my face, and I don't look
nervous, but I knew how I felt inside.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara takes a few deep breaths and tells himself, `Hey, this
is what we play for. How many guys would die for one putt to win
the Masters? Why not close the deal right there?' ''
</P>
<P>
   With the ball two-and-a-half feet off the putter, O'Meara tells
himself, `Man, I hit a good putt.'' With it three feet from the
hole, as necks start to stretch along the ropes at 18, O'Meara's
heart begins to hammer in his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez,'' he thinks, ``it's going to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was six inches away, O'Meara finds himself thinking,
``Please don't lip out.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't. Just barely. O'Meara's arms shot up as though
signaling a last-second field goal. Chest out, he is stunned,
staggered and very proud all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   And now here is today, a little sad that his year is up to keep
the green jacket in his closet but excited to settle his spikes in
the rye grass as defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I want to play well, but at last I've experienced that
one time, no matter what happens in the future,'' he said. ``I know
that at least one time I put on that coveted green jacket. If I
don't play well, I'll be disappointed, but I'm not going to let it
spoil all the great things that have happened to me over this past
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Monday, speaking with reporters for the first time as the
official on-site defender, he said, ``It gives you goose bumps even
with 80-degree weather.''
</P>
<P>
   You might find a soul or two of the opinion that Mark O'Meara
applies the corporate-speak a bit heavily. However, you can't find
anyone who didn't feel good for O'Meara, sometimes forgotten as a
former U.S. Amateur champion _ 1979, when he beat John Cook _ who
found a Masters and a British Open in the same year and then became
player of the year. Even Duval and Fred Couples, who were passed by
the Californian when he birdied three of the last four holes at the
1998 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara has loved the basking period. He brought the trophies to
the PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando in January and allowed fans to
pose with them. Close to many of the Orlando-based Golf Channel
personalities, he co-hosted the network's Golf Central show last
year. He played a brisk worldwide schedule, adding England's
prestigious World Match Play championship to his season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not perfect, by no means,'' O'Meara said. ``I probably
played as much or more world-wide golf over the last 18 years as
anybody has. Unfortunately, I've probably sacrificed more on being
a father and home life because I've been so competitive. . . . You
do pay a toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Before O'Meara, only two players, Arnold Palmer and Sandy Lyle,
had birdied the last hole to win the Masters. O'Meara used to watch
old Masters replays on TV and ponder how pressure-packed that would
be, standing over a putt, for so much. Ian Woosnam's 8-footer in
1991, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's funny,'' he said. ``I used to think, `How could
anybody drum up enough courage to make that putt?' I wondered what
it would be like to make that putt. I wonder if I could do that.'''
If buddy Tiger Woods has learned from O'Meara about common sense on
the PGA Tour and course management, the old man has fed off the
kid's enormous energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tiger definitely deserves some of the credit,''
O'Meara said. ``I think he's had an influence on my game. We
compete a lot together at home, and he's definitely pushed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is envious of the player whose game he helped to raise _
and not only of O'Meara's consistently sound putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the way he shallows out his plane in his golf swing,''
Woods said. ``He's got a very shallow arc through the ball, and
that's something I've always worked on. That's one reason why he
controls his distances so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Well enough to contend again? The serious betting money this
week has to go on Duval and Woods. Some will filter to Fred
Couples, Davis Love III and Ernie Els. There might not be a
groundswell of repeat support.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine,'' the champion said. ``The game doesn't owe me
anything.

BRANCH DAVIDIANS SEEK REDUCTIONS IN SENTENCES &HT;    
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In an attempt to win a shorter sentence for
followers of David Koresh, lawyers Tuesday argued once again that
five Branch Davidians neither used nor carried automatic weapons in
a deadly 1993 shootout with federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five cult members are serving 40-year sentences _ 10
years for manslaughter and another 30 years tacked on by Judge
Walter Smith when he ruled that the Davidians wielded machine guns
in the firefight rather than basic firearms. The judge gave the
fifth defendant a 10-year sentence on the use of an automatic
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the cult members say evidence is scant that the
five employed automatic weapons. More importantly, they say, the
five should have been formally charged with the weapons violation
and Smith should have left the decision to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the judge does not have the decision-making power,''
said Steven Rocket Rosen, a Houston lawyer representing one of the
five. ``The jury does.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers appealed the decision in 1996, two years after 11 Branch
Davidians were tried in San Antonio. In that case, all 11 were
acquitted of conspiracy and murder but eight were convicted on
lesser charges.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, six appealed, and upon hearing their arguments the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans asked Judge Smith to
reconsider whether the cult members used automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Smith ruled that they had, at which point lawyers for five cult
members appealed the decision yet again, bringing them Tuesday to
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the difference between dying in federal prison or
getting out and having a little time to live,'' said Richard
Ferguson, one of the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers say a recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court
bolsters their case. That case involved a carjacking in which a
judge tacked on 25 years to the defendant's 15-year sentence
because the incident resulted in serious bodily injury.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court said the bodily injury decision should have
been made by the jury, not the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Four agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were
killed in a gun battle at the Branch Davidians' fortified compound
near Waco on Feb. 28, 1993. The agents had sought to arrest Koresh
on weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   Six followers of Koresh were killed in the fight, which led to a
stalemate that lasted 51 days before fire engulfed the compound,
killing Koresh and 78 others.
</P>
<P>
   Those appealing their cases Tuesday were Renos Avraam, Brad
Branch, Jaime Castillo, Graeme Craddock and Kevin Whitecliff.

 &HT;    League will say no to Redskins deal
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Never in league history have NFL owners vetoed a bid
to purchase an existing franchise. Barring an upset, that unusual
streak will end today when the owners, convening here at an
airport-area hotel, will reject the $800 million proposal from the
group headed by Howard Milstein to buy the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the vote of the Redskins, who are legally bound to
support Milstein's efforts, he needs 23 endorsements and appears to
be well short of that number. Despite providing Milstein an extra
three weeks to address problem areas, owners apparently will arrive
here with many of the same concerns they voiced last month at the
league meetings in Phoenix, where the league's finance committeewas
split on the bid.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will huddle again this morning before the general
session. In Phoenix, three members of the committee favored
Milstein, three opposed him, and two others were undecided. Most
owners thought the proposal, which would represent the record price
for a professional sports franchise, is too heavily leveraged.
Several owners also have been critical of the way in which Milstein
has operated the NHL's New York Islanders.

   If the bid is rejected, the league probably would ask the
trustees operating the franchise to reopen the process. John Kent

   TIRANA, Albania _ With tears in his eyes, Avi Pazner, 60, who
was the first Israeli ambassador to Albania, surveyed the tent city
of Kosovo refugees that rings an empty swimming pool in the heart
of this city. Dropping to his knees, he extended a plump green
apple to a miserable little boy who hugged the cane of his elderly
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please,'' Pazner said Tuesday, during an Israeli relief
mission. ``Please, take this little bit of kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   Pazner, a worldly Israeli in a dapper business suit, stared into
the old man's eyes and lost his bearings a little. A Holocaust
survivor, Pazner said he felt dizzied by the echo of his own
history in the plight of the man, Haser Shala, an ethnic Albanian
refugee wearing muddy shoes with no laces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm going back in time,'' Pazner said. ``I feel so
close to these people. I don't speak their language, and they are
Muslim. But I have the impression I visit my people here. I think
all the time about these people as Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians alike have been mesmerized by the
images of the ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo trekking across
borders, stripped of their belongings, their homes and the
documents that confirm their identity.
</P>
<P>
   Glued to television news accounts, the Israelis and Palestinians
have watched with bounding empathy what both groups, in different
ways, see as a late 20th-century replay of their own horrors _ for
the Israelis the Holocaust and for the Palestinians the flight into
exile in 1948, when the Jewish country was founded.
</P>
<P>
   Even if their governments have not been as quick as they would
like to condemn the Serbs and spring into action, many Palestinians
and Israelis have felt personally compelled to help. The Israelis
are setting up a field hospital in Macedonia, while the Jewish
Agency, a nonprofit group, flew in the first of what will be three
planeloads this week of relief supplies to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   And the Palestinians, who are usually the recipients of aid,
began planning a relief lift of their own.
</P>
<P>
   For some, emotional reactions are overshadowed by complicated
political realities. Some Israelis believe, for instance, that they
should remain loyal to the Serbs, who defended Jews during World
War II. But for many the identification with Kosovo refugees is so
undeniable that it is painful, like a bitter reminder that the
lessons of history are not always learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see the people in Kosovo fleeing, I can only hope that
their destiny will not be like our destiny and that they will not
live in refugee camps for 50 years,'' Samir Abughazaleh, a
Palestinian accountant in Jerusalem, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Salai Meridor, the acting chairman of the Jewish Agency in
Israel, said the sight of trains loaded with ethnic Albanian
refugees was so chillingly evocative of the Holocaust that he felt
compelled last week to organize a relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   In several days the agency raised $375,000 in donations, set up
a radio telethon and a rock concert fund-raiser to be held on
Thursday and, with the help of the United Jewish Appeal in the
United States, organized the relief planes.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m. Tuesday Meridor stood between cartons of blankets,
tents and baby formula buckled like passengers into a charter
flight from Tel Aviv to Tirana. ``I feel proud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the small Israeli plane landed in Albania, though, it was
immediately shown up by a Saudi Arabian jumbo jet filled with
blankets and carpets. The Israelis were made to feel the measure of
their small country's effort, which they quickly pointed out could
never compare in size but was a genuine and heartfelt grass-roots
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come in the name of the Jewish people,'' Meridor told the
Albanian Foreign Minister, Paskal Milo, who relayed horror stories
that the refugees were telling, like those of children forced to
watch the beheading of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis left Milo's office feeling another connection, this
one to the Albanians, who they said were a scattered people, just
like the Jews, with most of the population living in a diaspora.

TIRANA, Albania: a diaspora.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While their donations traveled to a warehouse to be sorted for
distribution, the Israelis drove empty-handed to the tent city by
the cracked, weed-infested swimming pool in downtown Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   Again, what they saw first was jarringly familiar: refugees
poring over posted lists of the camp's refugees, running their
fingers down the inky pages, searching for the names of relatives
from whom they had been separated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this in Israel after the Holocaust for years,'' said
Pazner, a former Israeli diplomat in France and Italy and a member
of Tuesday's aid delegation. ``Lists on walls, lists in newspapers,
lists on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Pazner is a native of Danzig, a target of Hitler's aggression
that later became Gdansk, Poland. When he approached Shala, he
found that the elderly man had been a German prisoner of war during
World War II. They chatted in German, the Jewish man in a natty
business suit, the Muslim refugee in a tattered pinstriped one,
confessing that he felt old, ``kaput.''
</P>
<P>
   Shala and his family fled their village of Zoqishti at the
gunpoint of masked Serbian policemen who told them to go to
Albania, or America, or NATO, they said. They wore the dazed,
exhausted look of profound displacement, squatting on the concrete
outside their tent in a refugee camp that was erected beside a
small amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   Told that their visitors were Israelis, Shala's niece smiled
faintly. ``That's nice,'' she said. ``They know what it's like.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Shlomo Arad, a photographer who lost his parents in
the Holocaust, said Monday that he felt obliged to follow the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``How well we know the feeling of leaving everything behind and
in five minutes you're nobody,'' he said. ``Nothing we can do is
enough: a field hospital with 50 soldiers, a donation into a bank
account. But we must be witnesses. We must not turn away, like most
of the world did in World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   For some right-wing Israelis the matter is not so simple. Many
identify with the Serbs, respect what they see as their right to
Kosovo _ ``their Jerusalem'' _ and resent what they see as
pro-Muslim world news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be alert and attentive to what is happening in Kosovo,
as it may be a general rehearsal for what could happen here if we
don't give the Palestinian terrorists a state with Jerusalem as its
capital,'' said Elyakim Haetzni, a lawyer, in an opinion piece last
week for Channel 7, the radio station of the Jewish settler
movement.
</P>
<P>
   And, with a different lens, the Palestinians are watching
closely too. ``Unfortunately when we faced our tragic situation in
1948, nobody was paying attention to us,'' Abughazaleh said. ``But
now the whole world is following these events. So we hope that NATO
will be able to let these people return back to their homes and
properties.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tirana, Shala's family expressed that wish too. And his
grandson, with tears streaming down his face, took a timid bite of
the green apple that an Israeli well-wisher had left behind.

CLASSICS JOINING TNT'S MOVIES  
 VH-1, POPULAR PROMOTIONAL VEHICLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking to raise the prestige ante in a continuing challenge to
HBO for supremacy in made-for-cable television movies, TNT, the
main entertainment channel of the Turner Broadcasting empire,
announced a schedule of movies for the next television season that
is conspicuously heavy on the literary classics.
</P>
<P>
   Among the titles to receive movie adaptations are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ George Orwell's ``Animal Farm,'' a partly animated version
with Patrick Stewart (Napoleon), Peter Ustinov (Old Major), Julia
Louis-Dreyfus (Mollie), Julia Ormond (Jesse) and Kelsey Grammer
(Snowball) providing some of the voices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charles Dickens' ``Christmas Carol,'' with Stewart again, as
Scrooge, and Joel Grey as the Ghost of Christmas Past.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dickens' ``David Copperfield,'' a four-hour miniseries version
with Sally Field, Anthony Andrews and Michael Richards, in his
first post-Kramer television role, as Micawber.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cervantes' ``Don Quixote,'' with another big-name cast headed
by John Lithgow as Quixote, Bob Hoskins as Sancho Panza, Isabella
Rossellini as the Duchess and Vanessa Williams as Dulcinea.
</P>
<P>
   TNT, which has had a successful track record with westerns, is
also remaking a classic western, ``The Virginian,'' starring Bill
Pullman and Dennis Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   The channel will have some movies from original material,
including a mob movie (the hottest topic in television, it appears)
starring Chazz Palminteri.
</P>
<P>
   William Macy stars in a comedy thriller called ``A Travesty,''
about an amoral film critic whose behavior catches up to him. Glenn
Close is producing a new film about members of a family whose lives
are changed when they find an abandoned infant on their doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Copperfield,'' ``Don Quixote'' and ``A Christmas Carol''
are all co-productions of the increasingly busy Hallmark
Entertainment production company, which has generated both ratings
and prestige for NBC and CBS in recent television seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Many of next season's projects are intended to produce both
bigger audiences for TNT and bigger prizes for the channel, which
several years ago set out to compete with HBO for things like Emmy
Awards. The efforts paid off in the film ``George Wallace,'' which
did win an Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   The Turner sister channel TBS also announced a slate of movies,
the first time that channel has gone fully into the movie arena.
(This season, it presented its first original movie ever.) The TBS
movies tend to be much more action- and adventure-oriented, with
titles like ``Thrill Seekers'' (about time travel) and ``Sinkhole''
(a colossal sinkhole threatens to swallow New Orleans).
</P>
<P>
   Musical Teamwork
</P>
<P>
   The cable channel VH-1 is becoming a favorite promotional
vehicle for broadcast networks like NBC and ABC. The reason: The
music on VH-1 dovetails perfectly with the mainstream taste that
generates big ratings for network shows.
</P>
<P>
   That was proved twice this season as both an NBC movie, ``The
'60s,'' and an ABC movie, ``And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and
Cher Story,'' scored hit ratings after being extensively promoted
on VH-1.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday ABC announced the latest deal with VH-1, a
co-promotion of a music-heavy film it has scheduled for May called
``Double Platinum.'' This one may be the biggest success yet in the
growing genre of television movie musicals.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of its star power. The film is headlined by Diana
Ross and Brandy, playing mother and daughter music superstars who
are separated just after the daughter is born and then reunited.
</P>
<P>
   The film, to be shown on May 16, will be extensively promoted on
VH-1 from now until then, with music from the movie, highlights of
the careers of both stars and a clip trailer from the film done in
the style of a music video that will feature a duet composed for
the two stars by a Grammy-winning songwriter, Diane Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Benson, the senior vice president for advertising and
promotion for ABC, said that the network approached VH-1 about the
Sonny and Cher project last year and that ``the results were just
phenomenal.'' VH-1 ran promotions for the film along with
retrospectives of the singers' careers before its broadcast. It was
one of the highest-rated films of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said, ``This movie is even more a natural for VH-1.''
Among the reasons he cited were that Ms. Ross is an even bigger
music icon than Sonny and Cher and that Brandy is such a star for
VH-1 that she is being included in that channel's second annual
``Divas Live'' special on April 13.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy, of course, was also the star of ABC's ``Cinderella''
movie last season, the highest-rated movie of the year. She has a
successful album out now on the Atlantic label, with four songs she
will sing in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross will release her own new album on the Motown label in
conjunction with the movie. It too has four songs from the movie.
(The stars' duet will appear only in the film; it is not on either
album)
</P>
<P>
   Benson said both record labels would also be extensively
promoting the movie.
</P>
<P>
   But what does VH-1 get out of all of this? It gets what it most
wants: the movie. VH-1 is doing all this promotion in exchange for
rerun rights to ``Double Platinum.'' After ABC's run in May, the
film will become the property of VH-1 for a window of runs in
December. The channel already has the right to rerun the Sonny and
Cher movie in August.
</P>
<P>
   John Sykes, the president of VH-1, said: ``We don't mind driving
our viewers to a network like ABC for one night if we can reward
them with a movie they'd like to see several times. The networks
are in the premiere business. We're in the cumulative audience
business.''
</P>
<P>
   He said VH-1 was now talking to several networks about future
projects, ``in which we would get involved on the creative end.''

<P>
   _ Special package on the Berlin cultural scene
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN-WALKING (Berlin) _ It's safe to go walking again in
Berlin. It was here, in the early 20th century, that the practice
of strolling leisurely around a big city just to take in the sights
came into its own as a modern art form. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN-IDENTITY (Berlin) _ A phoenix rises on the rubble of
history. This is the sixth German state that Berlin will be the
capital of, following the Prussian, imperial, Weimar, Nazi, and
communist periods. Some of its identity will be new, some of it
will reflect the past. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN-CULTURE (Berlin) _ Reunified Berlin is bursting at the
seams with music, opera and theater. As a condition of German
reunification in 1990, the West was obliged to preserve the
cultural institutions of the East. By Anne Midgette.
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN-SUBCULTURE (Berlin) _ The `Cabaret' days are gone; now
it's shades of gray. Berlin's artistic and musical underground
still exists, but it's not quite as interesting as one might hope.
By Ed Ward.
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN-REDEVELOP (Berlin) _ Building a capital where triumph is
taboo: Berlin steps cautiously amid the bogs of provincialism and
the quicksand of memory. By Roger Cohen.

suspense and an entire film genre. The Museum of Modern Art is
about to begin a Hitchcock centennial retrospective. By Peter
Bogdanovich.
</P>
<P>
   SLEEPY-HOLLOW-FILM (London) _ It may seem odd to find a movie
version of `Sleepy Hollow' shooting not in New York's Hudson Valley
but in the counties around London. That's where director Tim Burton
and stars Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci are, as Burton creates
another of the singular and self-enclosed worlds for which he is
known. By Matt Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-FILM (Istanbul) _ Turkey, relenting, shows the works of a
Kurdish nationalist. Probably no Turkish film has had the worldwide

portrayed as a land of harsh military rule and feudal codes. By
Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   GORDON-SOUNDTRACK (London) _ In art, too, the sound is spooky:

   _ Theater
</P>

   But Masumoto's readers need cultivating, too. These days, the
Del Ray, Calif., farmer-writer serves his land and his literature _
land his family has worked for three generations, literature that
is earning him praise for a style called ``creative non-fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Masumoto is one of six featured authors scheduled to appear
April 10 at the Arizona Book Festival in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Also appearing on the main stage to read from their works will
be Rudolfo Anaya, author of ``Bless Me, Ultima''; Tucson author
Leslie Marmon Silko, ``Gardens in the Dunes''; James Welch, ``Fools
Crow''; J.A. Jance, author of the J.P. Beaumont and Joanna Brady
mystery series; and cowboy poet Waddie Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Masumoto will be in the Phoenix area only overnight, making his
appearance at the book fest, then dashing back to the 80-acre
family farm, which is divided between peach orchards and vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   The bloom of a peach tree is a wonder, he says, sounding wistful
before he has even left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprising and beautiful at the same time,'' he says.
``For me, it's the magic of spring. Oh, the trees are waking!''
</P>
<P>
   Masumoto and his father, Tak, 76, farm side by side, assisted by
Masumoto's wife and two children. His daughter and son are still
young, but once they were able to reach the pedals of a tractor,
they were out in the fields.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Masumoto started at age 7, when his father attached
blocks of wood to the pedals of the classic Ford tractor and sent
him driving slowly down the rows.
</P>
<P>
   Time spent driving a tractor gave him time to think, to compose
stories in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a wild imagination,'' he says by phone after his wife,
Marcy, calls him in from the fields.
</P>
<P>
   He still does his best writing behind the wheel, creating
stories rich in themes of rural America and his Japanese-American
family. He awakens early every morning to put those thoughts on
paper before climbing aboard the tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Masumoto, 46, is a little surprised to find himself a farmer and
an author. In college, he earned a bachelor's degree in sociology
and a master's in community development after telling his father he
had no plans to spend his life in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   However, on a personal adventure to Tokyo in 1974, he found
himself embracing his family's heritage and reconsidering his
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one of the largest urban areas in the world,'' he says, ``I
realized how much I missed the rural life.''
</P>
<P>
   Masumoto returned home and began to suggest ways his father
could improve the farm. Gradually, he became more involved, until
he was back on that tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Journals he kept while visiting Japan led to his second
vocation. In the 1980s, he published a book of short stories. In
1995, he wrote ``Epitaph for a Peach,'' which told the story of his
family. The book won the Julia Child Literary Food Writing Award
the next year, the only nominee without a recipe.
</P>
<P>
   In October, he published ``Harvest Son: Planting Roots in
American Soil,'' a reflection on the history of his
Japanese-American community in California's San Joaquin Valley. In
a lyrical style, he speaks the truth of the past with a novelist's
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Masumoto does not think of himself as primarily a writer. He's
still more familiar with compost than composition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a farmer first because my writing draws from
my work in the fields,'' he says. ``Our family wasn't verbal. We
were not storytellers.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been left to Masumoto to tell the family's stories, and
he finds his subject matter fecund. Curiosity about his rich
heritage, in fact, may lead him into fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Masumoto's grandparents came to America from Japan in 1899. His
grandfather was a laborer on the same land his family now owns.
Little else is known about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The couple were illiterate in both Japanese and English,
Masumoto says, simple folk who ``didn't leave much behind.''
</P>
<P>
   A great admirer of David Guterson's 1996 ``Snow Falling on
Cedars,'' an acclaimed novel about Japanese-Americans living on
Puget Sound in 1954, Masumoto would like to imagine what life was
like for Japanese immigrants in turn-of-the-century California.
</P>
<P>
   In a novel, he says, he could fill in the gaps of his
grandparents' saga.
</P>
<P>
   Without his imagination, he says, ``it remains an unfinished
story.'' &QL;

MYSTERY WRAPPED IN MYSTICISM  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
Shaman Winter 
Rudolfo Anaya (Warner, $24) 
 
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pick up the reading list for any college Chicano literature
class and Rudolfo Anaya's ``Bless Me, Ultima'' is certain to be on
it.
</P>
<P>
   With the penning of the now-classic story, Anaya earned the
mantle of guru among Chicano authors. A native of New Mexico, he
has a love and feel for Southwestern folklore that comes through in
his writing. For his novel ``Albuquerque,'' he won the PEN Center
USA West Award for Fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he jumps headlong into mysticism and magic with his latest
book, ``Shaman Winter.'' The publisher is promoting the book as a
mystery novel, but that plain-vanilla label is like describing
``The X-Files'' as a detective show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaman Winter'' is more of a mystical fantasy built around the
adventures and dreamworld of Sonny Baca, a private investigator
with roots in the barrio. With elements of time travel, sorcery and
confrontation between good and evil, it does not resemble a mystery
as much as science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Baca is a likable character who laces his conversations with
plenty of Spanglish. When the book opens, he is in a wheelchair,
recovering after a fight with the villain, Raven, who is bent on
destroying Baca.
</P>
<P>
   While convalescing, Baca begins reading New Mexico history and
having vivid dreams about his ancestors' 16th century journey from
Mexico across the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with a kindly old shaman, Don Eliseo, Baca
begins to learn how to interpret his dreams and harness spiritual
powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dream is a way to enter the world of the spirits,'' Don
Eliseo tells him. ``It is also a way to enter history. If you want
to return to a place and a time in which your ancestors lived, you
must dream about that place.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book, Anaya lays out Southwestern history,
complete with names, dates and battles that add texture to the
story. There are cameo appearances by such historical figures as
Pancho Villa and Kit Carson. However, Baca's dreamworld and reality
soon become intertwined in a heavily embroidered story.
</P>
<P>
   Young women begin to disappear in Sonny Baca's dreams and in his
waking hours. When four black feathers are found at each of the
scenes, Baca realizes that his nemesis, Raven, is behind the
kidnappings and is haunting his reality as well as his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   With help from Don Eliseo, Baca figures out that the women
disappearing from his historical dreams are Baca's ancestors and
that Raven can destroy him by erasing his history.
</P>
<P>
   To fight Raven and preserve his family line, Baca must learn to
enter the spiritual realm and control his dreams, Don Eliseo tells
him.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Baca and Raven, the Bringer of Curses, are
ancient enemies who've battled it out through the centuries. This
classic theme of the struggle between good and evil lends itself to
Anaya's use of Latin-style magical realism in the storytelling.
However, the author can't resist the temptation to heap on plot
decorations, and here he slips into the realm of the fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   Raven, it seems, wants more than just to kill Baca. He is also
bent on destroying the world and is building a nuclear bomb. The
FBI calls on Baca to help stop Raven, who is on the loose,
terrorizing New Mexico with a plutonium pit and vials of the ebola
virus.
</P>
<P>
   A tangle of conspiracies, high-speed chases, murders and chaos
unravels at a fast pace to the end of the book. Although some
scenes are entertaining, many smack of overkill and add little to
the story except to muddy the dream sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of fantasy, science fiction or New Age junkies may enjoy
this book. Others who prefer the simpler and poetic narratives of
``Bless Me, Ultima'' may find ``Shaman Winter'' as jumbled and
strange as the visions that sometimes enter our own heads when we
sleep. &QL;

ANNE PERRY'S DETECTIVES AGAIN ON THE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
Bedford Square 
Anne Perry (Ballantine, $24.95) 
 
 By SUE DOERFLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Anne Perry novel is a delight to read as much for its
Victorian era details as for the mystery it unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who has written 28 books set 100 years ago, captivates
readers with her vivid descriptions of a time that often was
thought virtuous, but in reality was plagued with problems and
scandals like those prevalent today.
</P>
<P>
   She intertwines the characters and their lives _ their daily
routines, hardships and emotions _ into a suspenseful tale that
always tackles a social issue. Without getting preachy, she draws
in readers so they become engrossed and even outraged at the trauma
at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedford Square,'' the bestselling author's latest mystery,
follows the long-established formula. In this case, blackmail, lies
and innuendo are the issues. Police Superintendent Thomas Pitt and
his adventuresome wife, Charlotte, are the main characters.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who lives on the eastern coast of Scotland in a barn that
she has converted into a home, will be in the Valley later this
week to talk about and sign copies of ``Bedford Square.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, a shabbily dressed man is discovered dead on the
doorstep of Gen. Brandon Balantyne's home. A rare snuffbox,
belonging to the general, is found in the dead man's pocket, but
the retired military officer denies knowing him.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt begins an investigation into the man's identity and
discovers that blackmail is at the heart of the situation. Many
high-placed, honorable men, including Balantyne and Assistant
Police Commissioner Cornwallis, are being accused of impropriety
and offenses that if made public would cause them to be ostracized
by London society.
</P>
<P>
   The connection among the men eludes Pitt, his associate, Sgt.
Tellman, and even Charlotte, who, as in previous books, devises her
own investigations. But to the reader, it is readily apparent _ and
a disappointment that Perry hasn't realized how obvious it is.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, knowing the connection doesn't mean the reader
will be able to discern the outcome or resolve the inevitable
whodunit. Nor does it detract from the pleasure of the read.
</P>
<P>
   The Pitts were featured in Perry's first novel, ``The Cater
Street Hangman,'' which was published 20 years ago and made into a
made-for-TV movie that aired on A&AMP;E in December.
</P>
<P>
   Perry generally writes two novels a year, one about the Pitts
and the other featuring William Monk, a former police inspector who
has amnesia. The latter also is set in Victorian times and delves
into social issues. &QL;

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE HANDYMAN &QL; 
 &UR; Carolyn See (Random House, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   We know from the prologue of this novel that its protagonist
will become a famous artist, that his work will be studied and
collected, and that his life will be grand. The prologue takes the
form of a grant application made in 2027 by an art historian who
has devoted himself to the work of Robert Hampton. But when we move
to the first chapter, we are back in 1996 and Hampton is not yet
successful but is still ``Bob,'' an aimless 28-year-old who fails
to find artistic inspiration in Paris and so returns to Los Angeles
and invents a life for himself as an unskilled handyman. There's an
air of the mundane about this story as the good-natured Bob
ventures out again and again in answer to calls for his services
and finds a collective role as savior/anchor/confessor in his
clients' lives. One of those clients is Hank, a young man who has
come from Ohio with his boyfriend, only to find that Ben has AIDS
and is deteriorating so fast that Hank has neither the skill nor
the courage to care for him. So, he summons Bob the Handyman _ ``I
had to call somebody,'' he says. ``If I didn't call someone, I was
afraid I might leave. Just walk out the door.'' Another client is
Angela Landry, whose toddler is saved from the bottom of a swimming
pool by Bob, an act that sets the stage for a new life for all
three of them. Appearances to the contrary, none of this seems
terribly dramatic. See unfolds each chapter in Bob's network of
needy clients with a wry, understated wit and the gentle suggestion
that inspiration is sometimes an accident of everyday life. Bob's
artistic talent changes as it becomes his response to the quirky
needs of his clients. This story is very Californian _ deceptively
simple, easy to read, with some sex thrown in to sweeten the deal. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; GOD IS A BULLET &QL; 
 &UR; Boston Teran (Knopf, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Melodramatic, intense, gory and un relenting _ here's a nice
book to settle down with on a Sunday afternoon. This first novel is
not for the squeamish or for those want finesse in their fiction,
but if you like violent bravado, you can't beat it. It begins with
the 1970 murder of an eccentric woman in an isolated trailer in the
California desert, then moves to the 1995 kidnapping of a
14-year-old girl and the brutal slaying of her mother and
stepfather. The crimes are connected, although we do not know how
thoroughly until later. The missing girl's father is Bob Hightower,
a cop who works a desk job and has little experience investigating
such things. But as time passes with no sign of his daughter, he
desperately accepts the help of Case, a recovering heroin addict
who has seen news reports of the double slaying and recognizes the
violent trademarks of a cult to which she belonged for 17 years.
Case leads Hightower to Cyrus, a Mansonesque character and the
book's main source of evil, depravity and seriously wacky dialogue.
Cyrus and his cohorts often seem more like the roving gangs of the
``Mad Max'' movies than characters in a novel, and this takes some
of the edge off their dastardly deeds (which involve, among other
things, a letter opener, a cactus, a rattlesnake and numerous
Lugers). There aren't really a lot of surprises, plot- driven or
otherwise _ after a while you realize that if you think something
dreadful is about to happen a character, you're probably right _
but Teran shows depth in his fiction debut. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TELLER OF TALES: THE LIFE OF ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE &QL; 
 &UR; Daniel Stashower (Holt, $32.50)
</P>
<P>
   Stashower opens this biography with the story of his trip to the
shop of a London rare-book dealer, where a saleswoman showed him a
first edition of Arthur Conan Doyle's ``The Hound of the
Baskervilles.'' Stashower held it reverently, but it was too
expensive. The saleswoman said she would check with the manager to
see whether there might be other Conan Boyle material in a back
room. Moving around the shop, Stashower was close to the manager's
office and heard the woman tell him that a customer was interested
in Conan Doyle. ``Oh, God,'' came the answer. ``It must be an
American.'' This reaction is not unusual, Stashower says. When he
presents himself in Britain as a collector of Conan Doyle material,
``the response is invariably polite, but it generally carries a
quiet note of sympathy, as though I'd just confessed some exotic
intestinal complaint.'' Conan Doyle has had the misfortune of being
eclipsed by his creation and by his own odd interests. ``Sherlock
Holmes was brilliant,'' people would say to Stashower, ``but Doyle
went a bit potty at the end, didn't he? Fairies, ghosts, and
that.'' Indeed, during the latter part of his life, he believed in
mediums and psychics. ``He became the living embodiment of the
spiritualist craze,'' Stashower says. ``His outspokenness, weighed
against the cool logic of Sherlock Holmes, seemed to invite public
scorn.'' Stashower looks without derision at Conan Doyle's devotion
to spiritualism, his books, his friendships with George Bernard
Shaw and Harry Houdini, his appeal to American audiences and his
feelings for the fictional character that cast the long shadow from
which he could never truly escape. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TENDER AT THE BONE &QL; 
 &UR; Ruth Reichl (Broadway, $13)
</P>
<P>
   Storytelling, in Reichl's family, was highly prized, which is
one of the reasons this memoir, new in paperback, is so much fun to
read _ because nothing in life, Reichl says, is as important as a
good story. Somehow that doesn't seem odd, coming from a woman who
traveled incognito as restaurant critic for the ``New York Times.''
Here she chronicles her early years and the people who influenced
her (including her mother, who would say, ``Oh, it's just a little
mold,'' before she scraped the stuff off the food and served what
was left for dinner). Reichl discovered that food was a way of
making sense of the world. In that spirit, she has dropped some of
her favorite recipes throughout the book, which now becomes a
souvenir of sorts: Reichl just this week wrote her farewell column
in the ``Times.'' She soon takes the helm as editor of ``Gourmet''
magazine. &QL;

&HT;    PREMIER'S VISIT COMES AT TUMULTUOUS TIME IN CHINESE-U.S.

(EDITORS: Second reference to Minxin Pei should be Pei. It is his

c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji arrives Wednesday with a
full agenda, but many experts believe the visit will merely be a
chance to help bolster tenuous U.S.-China relations in a tumultuous
political environment.
</P>
<P>
   Although both Chinese and U.S. officials had hoped to announce
progress toward China's admission into the World Trade
Organization, American negotiators said Tuesday that a number of
critical issues were still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an important relationship with China, and I think
regular contact is useful in and of itself,'' White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said. ``I'm not going to try to advance any specific
breakthroughs or announcements, but it is an important
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   That relationship has been seriously strained during the past
few months, starting late last year with a report concluding that
China had stolen U.S. nuclear secrets during the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional pressure against China mounted, especially after
crackdowns by Beijing on pro-democracy activists. The crackdowns
spurred the Clinton administration last month to reintroduce a U.N.
resolution to condemn human rights violations committed by the
Chinese. The resolution angered officials in Beijing, who last year
signed a human rights covenant in exchange for the United States
dropping a similar resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, China condemned NATO airstrikes led by the United
States against Yugoslavia, calling it a threat to international
security and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's nine-day, six-city tour of the United States comes just
days after reports surfaced that China's military intelligence
chief may have ordered Democratic fund-raiser Johnny Chung to
contribute $300,000 to President Clinton's 1996 re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined to comment on the report, which is being
investigated by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a difficult time in Sino-American relations, but Liu
Xiaoming, deputy chief of mission for the Chinese Embassy, said Zhu
is ready to deal with the challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``With regard to the storms, I think we have been used to it,''
he said. ``Whenever there's an important event between China-U.S.
relations, we are bound to see some storms, because there are
always some people who are not very happy with the improvement of
relations between our two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But in such a hostile environment, many experts say, not much is
expected to result from Zhu's visit, the first made by a Chinese
premier in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   At most, said Minxin Pei, senior associate for the Democracy
Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, minor
agreements may be made on some trade issues, but an agreement is
unlikely on the key issue of membership in the World Trade
Organization, which enforces international trade rules and settles
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the United States is demanding better access to
Chinese markets to reduce the $57 billion trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not overload these visits with unrealistic
expectations,'' said Arthur Waldron, director of Asian Studies for
the American Enterprise Institute. ``I would like to see this visit
lead to some honest talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues expected to be discussed during the premier's
visit are a proposed missile defense program off Taiwan's coast,
the allegations of espionage, WTO membership, human rights
violations and environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's meeting with President Clinton comes as Chinese officials
are preparing themselves for the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's visit is the latest in a series of high-level exchanges
between Washington and Beijing. Chinese President Jiang Zemin
visited Washington in the fall of 1997 for a full-pomp state visit
that also included a strong, public debate with Clinton on human
rights. Clinton went to Beijing last June as part of the first
visit of a U.S. head of state to China since the 1989 Tiananmen
incident.
</P>
<P>
   In April of that year, hundreds gathered in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square to mourn the death of a liberal Communist Party secretary.
The gathering soon turned into a student-led demonstration for
democracy but it ended on June 4, 1989, when troops and tanks were
ordered to silence the movement, killing hundreds of protesters.
</P>
<P>
   It was this same year that Zhu made a name for himself as mayor
of Shanghai, when he refused to send in troops to put down
demonstrations that had spread from Tiananmen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Pei said, he persuaded protesters to return to work and
school.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Zhu _ who was forced into ``re-education'' in the
countryside during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the
1960s _ has been viewed as a moderate.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL ADD END)
</P>
<P>
   Although Zhu has won international respect and popular support
with his pragmatic approach, direct demeanor and good sense of
humor, he is not considered too ambitious in China nor does he have
a strong power base, Pei said. In fact, if anything, his attempts
at economic reform have hurt his relationships with party bosses,
Pei said.
</P>
<P>
   But Waldron of the American Enterprise Institute said
privatization is not nearly as far along as it should be and that
Zhu still has misplaced faith in state-run industries.
</P>
<P>
   John Holden, the president of the National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations, said many did not realize how difficult the
problems were, but that Zhu should be welcomed as a man who has ``a
keen appreciation for where Americans are coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldron, however, said it would be unwise to pin all hopes on
one leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that a single czar could deal with the problems China
has is simply wrong,'' Waldron said. ``We shouldn't kid ourselves.
China faces severe problems. Highly intelligent people, people of
good will don't know what to do.''

CEASFIRE OFFER ESCALATES PROPAGANDA WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are three wars raging in Yugoslavia right now _ the Serb
terrorization of ethnic Albanians, the NATO bombing against Serb
targets, and a hearts-and-minds battle between Serb leader Slobodan
Milosevic and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The third war _ the propaganda war _ just escalated.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic government's announcement Tuesday of a unilateral
cease-fire to honor the Orthodox Easter holiday was a move clearly
meant to split the NATO alliance, say Balkan specialists. NATO
officials Tuesday quickly rejected the offer as insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   They had expected this. Aware that he might try something along
these lines, officials in the Clinton administration launched
pre-emptive diplomacy over the weekend, contacting allied leaders
and putting out word on Monday that they would not accept a ``phony
peace deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is completely part of the pattern,'' said Peter
Galbraith, who served as US ambassador to Croatia from 1993-98 and
was deeply involved in negotiations during that period. ``Having
accomplished what he wants, he calls for a cease-fire _ `Great,
let's negotiate. Now that we've driven everyone out, please stop
the bombing.' . . . I've gone gray with these kinds of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost certainly, there will be more Milosevic calls to end the
war in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Milosevic has in mind is fracturing the unity of the NATO
alliance, which is probably a mile wide and an inch thick right
now,'' said Robert Pfaltzgraff, a security studies specialist at
Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Having substantially achieved his objectives of forcing ethnic
Albanians out of Kosovo, Milosevic can afford to play peacemaker,
said Pflatzgraff. If NATO does not try to roll back his gains, he
will have ``codified a great victory.''
</P>
<P>
   While waging war in the Balkans is proving militarily and
politically difficult for Clinton, it will be even harder if
Milosevic succeeds in remaking himself as a man of peace while the
United States and its European allies look like war hawks.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody can pull off such as metamorphosis, it is Milosevic,
who throughout the decade has alternated between fiery nationalist
and cerebral peace broker, touching off wars in Croatia and Bosnia
and then sitting down at the bargaining table. British diplomat
David Owen, who negotiated with Milosevic throughout the first half
of the decade, has described the Serb leader's media skills as
``formidable.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Europeans, Asians, and many Americans who have misgivings
about the NATO bombing campaign _ especially with the possibility
of more civilian casualties as occurred in air raids Monday night _
the Serb cease-fire declaration may strike a chord. Italy and
Greece, in particular, may begin to lobby for ending the
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   It ``is clearly a way to solidify Orthodox Christian support for
him and shore himself up in the Balkans,'' said Dietrich Orlow, a
specialist in European history at Boston University. ``He has a
long history of promises like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Going back to the war with Croatia in 1991-92 and his 1992-95
proxy campaign in Bosnia, Milosevic's style is stop-and-go warfare,
said Orlow and other analysts. In each case, he has allowed Serb
paramilitaries to terrorize and uproot a population, then sent in
army regulars to roll up control on the ground before offering to
begin negotiations aimed at normalizing the new state of affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Often he will even make concessions, having taken more territory
than he intends to keep. With Serb military domination of Kosovo
now well advanced, expect Milosevic to make even more offers to
stop hostilities and commence peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that a new situation has been created,'' said
Jasminka Vdovicki, co-editor of ``Burn this House: The Making and
Unmaking of Yugoslavia.'' In both Croatia and Bosnia, she said,
Milosevic ``conquered great swaths which allowed him to negotiate
from a position of strength. Now his forces can be gallant and
withdraw from part and say they will keep the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Short of a ground invasion by NATO, the West is unlikely to
force Milosevic to capitulate, pull his forces out of Kosovo, and
allow Albanians to return to their homes. And that means the
propaganda war will get more and more tricky for NATO in the days
to come.

EX-CON WITH TIES TO MISSING ATHEIST INDICTED ON WEAPON CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A possible suspect in the case of missing
atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair was indicted Tuesday on two federal
weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   The federal grand jury indictment came nearly two weeks after a
dozen federal agents and the police raided the apartment of David
R. Waters, the former office manager for the atheist organizations
run by the vanished O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, 52, is suspected by federal authorities of having a role
in her disappearance in 1995, although he has not been charged with
any crimes relating to O'Hair and denies knowing anything about her
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has been jailed since his arrest March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities ``think he knows a whole bunch, but he has
no clue what they are talking about and I'm just as baffled,'' said
Patrick Ganne, an Austin lawyer representing Waters. ``He's looking
to me for answers, and I can't give any.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's somewhat depressed. He's concerned that the whole weight
of the federal government is coming down on him. Everyone seems to
be pointing fingers at Waters, but their hands are empty,'' Ganne
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators declined to comment beyond a single-page statement
announcing the indictment. Waters is accused of being a felon in
possession of a firearm or ammunition and of interstate transport
of guns and ammunition by a felon.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said federal agents found 119 rounds of
ammunition in Waters' apartment on March 24. The second charge
alleges that sometime in the past two months, Waters shipped two
handguns and some ammunition to his home state Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the weapons he shipped were a
Browning 9mm semi-automatic pistol and a .357 Magnum revolver.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of those charges, Waters could face 20 years in
federal prison and a $500,000 fine. He is set to appear Thursday
morning in the federal court in Austin for a bond hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has four felony convictions, including murder and
battery.
</P>
<P>
   Although authorities investigating the September 1995
disappearance of O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and daughter
Robin Murray O'Hair have not mentioned Waters, sources say he is a
prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   A second man, Gary P. Karr, 50, of Novi, Mich., is also
suspected of a role in what authorities believe was a kidnapping
and murder. Karr, also a convicted felon, has been charged with
federal weapons violations in Michigan and with transporting stolen
property in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Karr met Waters in Illinois prison a decade ago, according to
his lawyer, public defender Richard Helfrick of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   At a March 26 hearing in federal court in Detroit, FBI agent
William O'Leary testified that Karr had admitted involvement in
four homicides in Texas, but had said he did not kill anyone.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth person, Danny Fry of Florida, disappeared at the same
time that the O'Hair family did.
</P>
<P>
   Fry was an old friend of Waters' who went to Texas in the summer
of 1995 at Waters' behest, according to Fry family members.
</P>
<P>
   Fry's nude body, minus head and hands, was dumped by a river in
eastern Dallas County on Oct. 2, 1995, and was not identified until
genetic testing was performed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Helfrick said Tuesday: ``I saw him (Karr) this morning. We're
just waiting for the next thing to happen, whatever is going to
happen, and we really don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I represent him on a gun case, so that's all I'm concerned
with, the gun case, and if anything else arises in Texas, he can
get a public defender there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of federal agents spent Friday, Saturday and Sunday
searching for the bodies of the O'Hair family on a ranch near Camp
Wood, a tiny town 120 miles west of San Antonio. The FBI did not
announce any results.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Holmes, an FBI spokesman in San Antonio, said a second
search of the site has not been ruled out, but none will happen
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authority under which we executed the search warrant on
Friday was for a period of 10 days. We completed our search in two
and a half days, and we do not have any immediate plans to return
under that original authority,'' Holmes said.

 &HT;    Spring's power overwhelming
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Spring is the most demanding season; it jumps in your
face, shouts your name, forces you to participate in its seductive
unveiling, knowing from experience that its raging beauty is
irresistible, its fresh youth undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not succumb to this season, you have a hole in your
soul.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners, of course, are the easiest to seduce, the weakest of
all. I am a gardener, and I am weak.
</P>
<P>
   Strange, the power of spring. Nothing could be more predictable
than leaves appearing, buds opening, fronds unfurling. At the same
time, nothing could be so amazing, so mysterious. Each year, when
this season gets its speed up and tumbles into lushness, I go out
of doors and lose all sense of time _ lost in the season's
reassuring sameness, yes, but also jolted by its surprises.
</P>
<P>
   What a great leveler this season is: Commoners impress as much
as rare breeds. The oft-disparaged ligustrum furiously puts out new
green growth, and its pregnant buds inspire as much anticipation as
any plant in my garden. Similarly, the wisteria rambling along the
railing on the back porch promises its best crop of blooms ever as
purple clusters grow bigger by the minute, swelling and storing
fragrance that will burst free any day now. And the two
chinaberries broke out in bright green leaves the other day,
showing that they, like the rest of us, had survived another year.
</P>
<P>
   After enjoying the ocean of colorful plantings last weekend at
Callaway Gardens' newly unveiled Azalea Bowl, I came home,
inspired, to my little bushes blooming with familial zeal. And to a
banana shrub that enjoyed the mild winter and went from tight buds
to yellow blooms overnight.
</P>
<P>
   I've not seen a better year for Carolina jessamine, despite the
cold hit it suffered. While jessamine is as tough as a pansy, a
once-lovely white camellia grew tired of freezing in mid-bloom and
just gave up recently, leaving a dry, forlorn little trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of victims, can it be that my only dwarf bamboo (in a
pot, the only way to contain this plastic grass) has fallen on hard
times? I kept it as a reminder of my war on this ground cover,
potting up one clump. Now, it seems wan. My heart is not big enough
to hold sympathy for it.
</P>
<P>
   On a happier note, a potted rosemary has come to flower. After
five years of providing countless sprigs that added dash to dishes
such as pork, lamb, beans and seafood, this great fragrant plant
decided to bloom a whitish shade of pale lavender.
</P>
<P>
   An even greater surprise awaited, however.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, I grew a tree-form rose in a wooden tub.
Three feet tall, its trunk was capped during good times with a
canopy of white blossoms, fragrant, inviting. Last summer, the rose
died. After a decent interval, I pulled out the dead plant and
filled the tub with chrysanthemums. In the warm weather, the mums
have grown thick.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I noticed that, amid this growth, there was, yes,
the fuzzy, reddish stalk of a rose, about 6 inches tall. It is
filled with reddish-green leaves and the promise of more days of
roses. I love thinking they will come again, but have already
enjoyed the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   So goes spring. It grabs you by the collar, shakes you, wakes
you with its big show, then shows you a tiny surprise that holds a
world of hope. What an awesome, comforting exercise of gentle
power.
</P>

VIOLENCE THREATENS EAST TIMOR PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Three months before a scheduled vote that
many thought would bring a peaceful close to more than 23 years of
armed struggle for independence in the Indonesian province of East
Timor, a new round of violence threatens to unravel those hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Separatist rebels Tuesday reported new clashes with
government-backed forces and said they would heed the call to arms
issued Monday by jailed East Timor guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao.
Gusmao abandoned his two-month-old cease fire in frustration,
saying his forces had to protect civilians from escalating attacks
by militias allegedly backed by the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   The renewal of armed struggle threatens to undermine both the
United Nations-brokered peace talks scheduled for next week in New
York and a vote in early July to choose between autonomy or
independence for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   A renewed guerrilla struggle in the troubled territory is the
latest of several worrisome signs that Indonesia, the world's
fourth most populous nation, faces the threat of splintering,
Yugoslavia-like.
</P>
<P>
   For 32 years, the nation's authoritarian leader General Suharto
_ like the late dictator Josep Tito in Yugoslavia _ kept a tight
lid on separatist movements in this vast and diverse archipelago
nation of 17,500 islands. But a severe economic crisis sparked
popular uprisings that forced Suharto from power last May, and
fueled secessionist sentiments in the provinces of East Timor, Aceh
and Irian Jaya. Ethnic and religious rivalries have flared on
several other islands, claiming hundreds of lives and creating
thousands of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing clashes Tuesday between Christians and Muslims on the
eastern Moluccas Islands brought the week's death toll there to 66,
Reuters reported. Thousands of women and children have reportedly
fled their villages since January, while men roam streets armed
with machetes, spears, and axes. More than 250 have been slain
there this year in religious violence.
</P>
<P>
   On the northern island of Borneo, nearly 200 people have been
killed since February in gruesome clashes between ethnic Malay,
Dayak and Chinese allied against settlers from Madura island.
</P>
<P>
   The latest flash-point is once again East Timor, a former
Portuguese colony invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the next
year. Indonesia's rule in East Timor was never recognized by the
United Nations or most countries, and Jakarta is blamed for the
deaths of an estimated 200,000 people during a military crackdown
and famine that followed, and for human rights abuses ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of Suharto, Indonesia's new president, B.J.
Habibie, has said he would consider independence for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Habibie moved rebel leader Gusmao to house arrest
from prison, where he was serving a 20-year term for leading the
armed revolt, and said he wanted the East Timor issue resolved by
the end of the year. Last month, Indonesia and Portugal agreed to a
U.N.-supervised vote that would allow residents to choose autonomy
or full independence.
</P>
<P>
   So why the escalation of conflict now?
</P>
<P>
   There are those who believe pro-Indonesia forces in East Timor
have sparked violent incidents to provoke guerrillas into renewing
the civil war, thereby squelching chances of a peaceful vote that
might bring about independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents are done deliberately by people to get this
kind of a reaction from Xanana,'' said Carrascalao. ``The Army is
strong enough to prevent these kinds of conflicts, but they are
choosing not to act. There are vested interests in East Timor who
do not want the situation to be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, pro-independence groups reported clashes,
arrests, deaths and civilians fleeing violence in six cities,
including Liquisa, 1,250 miles east of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian officials strove to calm the renewed tensions. Dewi
Fortuna Anwar, assistant minister/state secretary for foreign
affairs, called for ``calm and peace, so . . . there will be a
conducive climate for East Timor people to discuss and vote with an
open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of East Timor have sacrificed for 23 years. They
should wait for at least three more months to see what happens,''
said Mario Carrascalao, former governor of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   But Gusmao's lawyer, Johnson Panjaitan, said the rebel leader
would only back off if the UN agrees to send peacekeeping forces _
an unlikely scenario _ and the military stops supporting militias.
Witnesses in Dili, East Timor's capital, reported seeing new troops
arriving Tuesday.

HARRIS COUNTY TO KEEP SELLING POUND ANIMALS FOR RESEARCH &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOE STINEBAKER 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Harris County Commissioners Court voted Tuesday
afternoon to reject a proposal that would have banned the sale of
pound animals for medical research.
</P>
<P>
   But Commissioner Steve Radack, who has pushed for such a ban for
several years, said he will continue to try to end the practice by
taking the issue before voters in November.
</P>
<P>
   Radack had hoped to get the court to agree to the ban and,
failing that, to allow the issue to be placed on the Nov. 2 ballot.
But County Attorney Michael P. Fleming told Radack that the county
lacks the proper authority from the state to conduct such a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, Radack is trying to get a rider attached to a bill
in the Texas Legislature that would give the county the authority
to hold a referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Radack placed a call to Mike Toomey, a county lobbyist in
Austin, immediately after Commissioners Court adjourned. Despite
the setback on Commissioners Court, Radack is now hoping for
support in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's worth a phone call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The court's 3-2 rejection of the ban comes as another bitter
loss to animal-rights activists, who have flooded court members
with mail and calls seeking approval of the ban. It also comes as
welcome news to many in the county's medical community, who have
lobbied to continue the sales.
</P>
<P>
   The county has contracts to sell hundreds of animals, mostly
dogs, to Baylor College of Medicine, the University of
Texas-Houston Health Science Center, the University of Houston
Animal Care Operations and Texas A&AMP;M University for $40 each. The
schools use the animals for medical research and training.
</P>
<P>
   The animal sales continue to be one of the court's most
controversial issues each year. Supporters on both sides of the
controversy piled into Commissioners Court Tuesday to press their
case.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the sales got a boost from Dr. Michael DeBakey,
the world-renowned pioneer in heart surgery. DeBakey told the court
that animal research has led to such medical breakthroughs as heart
bypass surgery and a polio cure, which have saved countless human
lives around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And Baylor has spent millions of dollars updating and improving
its animal research center, he told the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be glad to be in it yourself,'' he said. ``The animals
get treated better than some of the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen doctors from the various medical schools sided
with DeBakey, saying the research animals were treated humanely.
And Dr. Richard Ermel, of Texas A&AMP;M's College of Veterinary
Medicine, told the court that without the county's sale of research
animals, the school would have to rely on using animals
specifically bred for research.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the sales were equally adamant, saying research
on animals was no longer necessary, that most other local
governments, including the city of Houston, had banned the sale of
pound animals for medical research.

AMERICANS SEEM TO BE WARMING TO PROSPECT OF GROUND TROOPS IN
KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton says he has no plans to send
ground troops to Kosovo, but most Americans seem to be warming to
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In a marked turnabout from earlier findings, recent polls show
growing support for a ground war in the Balkans. A deployment that
had been almost unthinkable two weeks ago is now considered an
acceptable option, according to some national surveys.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington Post poll of 509 adults found that 55 percent
support the use of ground troops. Nearly 68 percent said they
expect Clinton to send troops against Serbia despite his announced
intention to avoid such a move.
</P>
<P>
   New York pollster John Zogby, who hopes to complete a Kosovo
poll Wednesday, said his early results show 60 percent support for
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said the shift in public opinion will
not alter Clinton's opposition to the use of ground forces in
Kosovo. Two weeks of NATO bombing have failed to curb Serbian
attacks on ethnic Albanians in the rebellious Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the second week of an air campaign that we are
confident will succeed,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said. ``He has no
intention of introducing ground troops. He's made his decision with
the best advice he has from his military and foreign policy
advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing public acceptance of the possibility of a ground war
contrasts with the mood when Clinton and NATO launched the air war
two weeks ago. Although a bare majority of Americans endorsed the
bombings, they strongly opposed the use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Experts attribute the shift to several factors, including the
capture of three American soldiers by Serbia and numerous reports
of atrocities committed against ethnic Albanians. Disturbing video
footage of ragged refugees fleeing the violence has also helped
give the far-off conflict a human face.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the longest time, Kosovo was not on the radar because
there was not enough video. There's been a lot of video in the last
week.'' Zogby said. ``The cause is becoming clearer.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls conducted for CBS found that support for the use of ground
troops increased from 33 percent to 41 percent after the three
Americans were captured by Serbia. The latest CBS poll was
conducted April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post poll, conducted Monday, also found
increasing support for the bombing campaign. About 68 percent of
Americans support the airstrikes but an equal proportion expressed
doubts that they would deter Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
and his followers in their campaign against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The poll had a margin of error of 5 percentage points, meaning
that the results could be off by that much in either direction due
to sampling errors.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers question the depth of support for ground combat,
a variable that has not been tested in recent polls. The last major
ground campaign, the 1991 Persian Gulf War, resulted in 148 combat
deaths for U.S. forces. The Vietnam War cost more than 47,000
American lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success tends to bring support, but failure can cause
problems,'' said John Mueller, a political science professor at the
University of Rochester in Rochester, N.Y., who specializes in
wartime public opinion. ``There may be support, but it may wane
fairly quickly if casualties start coming in.''

 &HT;    For Edwards, football isn't a war of words
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stoic on the field and soft-spoken in interviews,
North Carolina State star Torry Holt apparently missed the
directive that transferred to this year's wide receivers the gift
of gab normally associated with mouthy cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Irked by years of verbal abuse from defenders, several of the
wideouts in the '99 draft, most notably Troy Edwards of Louisiana
Tech, have countered with filibusters of their own. But for Holt, a
dynamic playmaker whose stock continues to rise, touchdowns are
more important than taunts. He has become the Marcel Marceau of
receivers, with his college deeds speaking volumes about his NFL
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that talking takes too much energy,'' Holt said during the
combine in February. ``My goal is to shut everybody else up.''
</P>
<P>
   During his ACC career, Holt rendered speechless such renowned
orators as Virginia safety Anthony Poindexter and cornerback Dre
Bly of North Carolina. Nothing, however, compares with the
collective mute button he laid on the Florida State secondary in
his junior season.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, Holt had a clean drop, and Seminoles
corner Samari Rolle immediately jumped his case. For the next two
possessions, Rolle and his secondary mates blistered Holt's
eardrums. And then Holt blistered them, catching 12 passes and
scoring five touchdowns in a performance that catapulted him into
the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his career in Raleigh with 191 catches for 3,379
yards and 31 touchdowns and also returned punts and kickoffs. He
and David Boston of Ohio State, who also has return abilities,
clearly have separated themselves from the rest of the wide
receivers in this draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holt doesn't need to call attention to himself,'' said Bob
Ferguson, Arizona Cardinals vice president of personnel. ``He kind
of kills you softly, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Edwards plays with a chip on his shoulder and never
would finish second in a debate. Even the imposing Boston, whose
father, Byron Boston, is an NFL line judge, has been known to
skirmish verbally with defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who caught 21 passes for an NCAA-record 405 yards and
three touchdowns in a 1998 loss to Nebraska, is shorter than some
teams like. He certainly talks a big game, though, and more often
than not backs up his words. At the combine, Edwards bragged to
reporters that no defensive back could ever check him one on one
and noted that he had accomplished in three years what it took
Jerry Rice four years to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never going to be bashful,'' Edwards said.''Wide receivers
have been taking (abuse) from defensive backs a long time. It's
time to give some back.''

 &HT;    You may not notice, but Masters has changed
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Augusta National has grown a little hair. You
wouldn't call the stuff now collaring the Augusta Natioinal
fairways exactly rough. More like mild inconvenience. The CBS crew
could well whisper on Thursday, ``Oh, my, Greg Norman just pushed
his tee shot into the grassy annoyance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not cabbage. It's kinder than spinach. More in the
watercress or wheat grass family.
</P>
<P>
   A ``second cut'' is the accepted term for the new growth, which
sounds more like an all-day prime rib than a hazard.
</P>
<P>
   It measures exactly 1 3/8 inches in height, this new addition to
the Masters landscape. And not a micron more. How much it will
impact play is debatable. John Huston spoke of dropping a few balls
into the first cut for practice, and ``I had no trouble spinning
the ball.'' You can lose farm equipment in U.S. Open rough. Here,
it's much more subtle, just a slightly darker shade of green.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any change seems significant at a tournament that used to
be known for its rigidity. The fact is, the Masters and Augusta
National undergo small, constant change that adds up over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yardage books never last more than year around here,''
Stuart Appleby said.
</P>
<P>
   When they construct the windmill on No. 6 green and stack some
railroad ties on the property, then you'll know the transformation
is complete.
</P>
<P>
   And while we're at it, when is this country club going to get a
swimming pool and some tennis courts?
</P>
<P>
   We go through this annually, taking inventory of the tweaks and
tucks done in the name of progress and then somberly debating them.
Every alteration is as serious as taking a surgeon's knife to
Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   For every change is a possible affront to history. ``I don't
like to see this, because I like to step up on the tee and say,
`Gene Sarazen did this or Byron Nelson did this,' and feel the same
history under your feet as what those guys played on,'' Greg Norman
said. Trouble is, those guys did it without clubs that could have
been made on the planet Krypton and with golf balls that weren't
radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they hadn't had to make (the course changes) because of
the equipment,'' rued Jack Nicklaus, out of this tournament due to
some major course redesign on his hip.
</P>
<P>
   Other alterations will change the profile of this Masters far
more than the rough. They've tinkered with the format, playing
Thursday and Friday in threesomes instead of twosomes to
accommodate larger fields, making everyone's round a little longer.
And they have adopted the idea that the old course needs to be let
out a little.
</P>
<P>
   So, they bumped back the tee boxes at the par-5 second and par-4
17th. They planted an instant forest along the par-5 15th. They
have played the role of a heavy-handed God.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it seemed the moves were a response to the way
Tiger Woods overpowered the course two years ago. The man himself
says bring on the length. ``All the changes are beneficial to all
the long hitters, no doubt about it,'' Woods said. The shorter
hitters have the greatest adjustment to make _ that's the current
working theory.
</P>
<P>
   To really penalize the young limberbacks, you see, they should
have made the course shorter. Turned Augusta National into a
par-68. Not to give them any more ideas, but it would make a lovely
executive course.

DUVAL'S MASTERY LEAVES EVEN TIGER IN AWE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Because of cultural ramifications, David Duval's
recent pillaging of the PGA Tour has not triggered the type of
global giddiness that evolved into Tigermania in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should it.
</P>
<P>
   What Woods did in his first full season as a professional golfer
transcended the game because of his multi-ethnic background. Woods
became a Pied Piper in pleated pants, leading minority golfers to
the nation's driving ranges and municipal courses, many of them for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But as well as Woods played that season, he never displayed the
total command on the golf course that Duval has shown over the past
18 months. With 11 victories in his past 34 starts, capped by a
.500 winning percentage this season, Duval heads into tomorrow's
opening round of the Masters Tournament as the world's top-ranked
golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Already, he has set a PGA Tour season-earnings record, with
$2,598,300. And he has played in only eight events, winning four.
Included was Sunday's triumph at the BellSouth Classic, an event
Duval entered primarily to hone his swing for Masters week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's gotten to the point he's winning his warm-ups,''
Brad Faxon said. ``That's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Duval play this season, Greg Norman said, reminds him
of a stretch during his prime when Norman would walk to the first
tee wondering who would finish second to him at that event.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not from arrogance or being egotistical. That's pure
confidence,'' Norman said. ``And you can see that with David right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. Duval is enjoying the type of stretch unseen
on the PGA Tour since the heyday of Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Woods won five times in his first seven months on
tour, including the 1997 Masters and 1997 GTE Byron Nelson Classic.
But he failed to continue the torrid pace and has only three
victories in the 23 months since his Nelson triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Until Duval, the hottest streak of the 1990s belonged to Nick
Price. The former Colonial champ won 10 events in 38 starts,
including two majors, in 1993-94. Duval's 11 victories in his past
34 events include triumphs in every near-major on the golf
calendar: The Players Championship, the Tour Championship and the
World Series of Golf.
</P>
<P>
   If he adds to his roll at the Masters, which would mark Duval's
third consecutive victory, he could be laying the groundwork for a
stretch unseen since Nicklaus captured 14 titles, including three
majors, in 37 starts from 1972-73.
</P>
<P>
   Woods sees something in Duval's arsenal that was missing when he
made his dizzying run in 1997: consistency. Duval leads the PGA
Tour in six of 10 statistical categories. During his closing round
of 59 at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, Duval's 11 birdie putts and
one eagle putt traveled a combined 54 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Woods never has displayed that type of control with
his irons.
</P>
<P>
   ``David plays with so much control. That's something I'm getting
better at,'' said Woods, who described himself as ``a much better
player now'' than in 1997 because he has eliminated a regular
infusion of 78s and 77s from his scorecards.
</P>
<P>
   Duval is playing so well that Woods said yesterday he is
``cool'' with the notion of being ranked No. 2 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine,'' Woods said. ``Everybody's going to have their
runs. David's having his right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But without the accompanying hysteria, which is the way Duval
prefers it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm becoming a golf star, but I'm still not like Tiger,''
Duval said. ``Tiger is a star outside the game. Just because I've
surpassed him in one respect, I don't think I've surpassed him in
the other. I don't think I'd want to.''
WESTWOOD PLANS DELAY OF DAVID'S CORONATION
</P>
<P>
   Scan the list of Masters champions in the past two decades and
you'll notice more residents of Europe (10) than the United States
(nine). Of the past 11 Masters winners, seven have jetted in from
the other side of the Atlantic Ocean to pick up their green
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the talk heading into tomorrow's opening round has centered
on the anticipated shootout between two young Americans _ David
Duval, 27, and Tiger Woods, 23 _ who rank No. 1 and No. 2,
respectively, in the world golf rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk brings a smile to the lips of Lee Westwood, a
25-year-old from Worksop, England, who is No. 7 in the world
rankings. As such, he is the highest-ranked European in a
tournament that Europeans have won more often than not since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   And, considering that the past two Masters champions have hailed
from the United States, there is the line of thinking that suggests
a European is due to haul home another green jacket. Westwood
embraces such logic, as well as the notion that the world rankings
are skewed toward enhancing the status of U.S. players.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game, right now, is fairly strong. If you look at the top
of the world rankings, although David and Tiger may be the two best
at the moment, I'm not as far behind as the rankings may suggest,''
said Westwood, who finished sixth in his last outing, at The
Players Championship (March 25-28). ``I've not played that much
this year \Rsix events\S, but I'm looking to start winning
tournaments from this week on, really. Whether I'm the European
favorite or not doesn't concern me. I'm trying to beat the rest of
the field.''
Memorable menu
</P>
<P>
   For a second consecutive year, golf legends experienced a unique
culinary experience at last night's Masters champions dinner. With
the menu selected by the defending champion, Mark O'Meara opted for
... sushi and fajitas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not much of a fish eater, in terms of cooked fish, but I
like raw fish. And I've always liked chicken and steak fajitas,''
said O'Meara, who grew up in Southern California and developed a
taste for Mexican food while living there. ``So I said, `What the
heck. It's never been served before, so we'll give it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Tiger Woods' bill of fare included cheeseburgers,
french fries and milkshakes.
</P>
<P>
   Tough ticket
</P>
<P>
   Those who question whether a Masters ticket is the toughest in
sports need only check with Buck Moore, a former Augusta National
caddie who trolled the course yesterday in search of three tickets
to today's par-3 tournament. The projected recipients? His son,
Connecticut point guard Ricky Moore, and two teammates from the
Huskies' NCAA championship basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Buck Moore, the regular caddie for Nike Tour participant Kelly
Gibson, said he was optimistic he could fill Ricky's request but
admitted he could ``use a little help'' from players or fellow
caddies in his quest.
</P>
<P>
   An Augusta native, Ricky Moore waited tables in the Augusta
National clubhouse as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Tour Championship tickets
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in three years, the PGA Tour has scheduled
its final U.S.-based event of the season in Texas, when the 1999
Tour Championship visits Champions Golf Club in Houston (Oct.
28-31).
</P>
<P>
   Tour officials announced this week that 23,000 tickets to the
event are available on a first-come, first-served basis. For
information, the toll free number is (877) 250-5747.

 &HT;    An adjustment for inflation may lift limit on donations
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Few subjects inflame the passions of Washington
more than efforts to change the way elections are financed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sparks are flying from calls to increase the federal
contribution limits to parties and candidates, which have stayed
flat at $1,000 since limits were first established in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawmakers have suddenly defined reform as making it easier for
them to raise money,'' bristles Ellen Miller of Public Campaign,
which advocates publicly funded elections. ``That's deform, not
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some loonies on the left who think we ought to
reduce contribution limits to $100,'' counters Norm Ornstein, a
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who favors increased
limits and other reforms. ``You have to provide opportunities for
candidates to raise money, and that means higher limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Such extremes usually add up to one thing in Washington:
stalemate. But a variety of observers, including Ornstein and
Miller, believe that higher contribution limits could become law
this year as part of a larger deal to ban or limit soft-money
donations to the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money is unregulated donations that flow to the political
parties from unions, corporations and wealthy individuals. Such
contributions are supposed to be used for generic ``party
building'' activities such as new offices or voter registration,
but soft money has emerged as the most effective end run around
contribution limits, funding tens of millions of dollars of party
``issue'' advertising and direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   No deal on soft money and contribution limits has been offered,
much less made. But the temptation to forge such a deal is becoming
irresistible, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, many of whom oppose contribution limits of any
kind, have argued for years that the current limits have not kept
up with inflation. Adjusted for inflation, the $1,000 contribution
limit should now be about $3,300.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who rallied Senate Republicans to
filibuster a ban on soft money last year, held a hearing last month
on raising contribution limits _ the first signal that legislation
may be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Reform advocates may stomach higher contribution limits in
exchange for a ban on soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a commitment, especially among the advocates of
reform, to get a reform bill this year,'' says Colby College
professor Anthony Corrado, an expert on campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, part of the reason higher contribution limits are
gaining currency on Capitol Hill is that a number of independent
experts, including Corrado, have come to believe that the $1,000
limit is simply too low.
</P>
<P>
   While incumbents generally have an easier time of raising money,
even they are chaffing under the requirement of raising money in
$1,000 increments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money chase has gotten out of hand,'' says former Sen. Dan
Coats (R-Ind.), who supports raising the limits. ``You have
senators announcing when they retire that they are just tired of
dialing for dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is much disagreement about who would benefit most by
bumping up the limits, but some evidence suggests Republicans have
the most to gain. In 1997 and 1998, Republicans captured about 54
percent of the $1,000 donors, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at individual campaigns, Corrado and Ornstein argue that
challengers would be the biggest beneficiaries even though
incumbents generally enjoy a fund-raising advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If challengers could raise more money from the people they
knew, it would be much easier for them to build up that seed money
to launch successful campaigns, or at least competitive
campaigns,'' says Corrado.
</P>
<P>
   Corrado says the problem is particularly acute for presidential
candidates, who, on average, now have to raise the maximum $1,000
contribution from four times the number of donors than a candidate
in the 1970s did.
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein blames the eroding value of contributions and the
escalating costs of campaigns for the rise in soft money, ``sham''
issue advertising from third-party groups and other dodges to the
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When supply stays flat and demand goes up you end up with a
black market or a temptation for corruption that becomes
overwhelming,'' Ornstein says.
</P>
<P>
   Only 0.1 of 1 percent of the American public, or about 235,000
individuals, give the maximum $1,000 contribution. Reform advocates
concede that higher limits won't likely increase the numbers of
Americans who give. Those who can afford to give will simply give
more.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the problem, says Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates will not spend less time raising money,'' she says.
``You are still going to have the arms race mentality, but instead
of raising money in $1,000 chunks they will raise it in $3,000
chunks.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Simon, president of Common Cause, notes that even the higher
limits are misleading because an individual can give to a candidate
in the primary, and then the general election, campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Married couples can double their contribution, meaning that if
the limit was raised to $3,000, a couple could give $12,000 _
almost half the average annual income for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   ``By raising the contribution limits you are sending a message
that it's money that counts and big money counts the most,'' Simon
says. ``Twelve-thousand dollars is a huge sum of money to most
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Simon says, Common Cause could buy into higher limits
in exchange for other reforms such as a ban on soft money. ``It
depends on what the whole package looks like,'' he says.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Cigarette smoke may have a more dire impact on young smokers
than those who pick up the habit later in life.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have found that ex-smokers who started smoking
during adolescence have higher levels of DNA damage to their lungs
and blood _ a known risk for lung cancer _ than ex-smokers who
started smoking as adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think how long you smoked and how much you smoked and
how long ago you quit are as important as how young you were when
you started,'' said lead researcher John Wiencke of University of
California San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The findings appear in Wednesday's issue of the Journal of the
National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Blood samples and nontumorous lung tissue were obtained from 143
patients who were being treated for lung cancer. Fifty-seven of the
patients were current smokers, 79 were ex-smokers and seven had
never smoked. The patients provided detailed histories of their
smoking experience, including the age at which they started and the
number of cigarettes smoked over the years.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers adjusted their data on ex-smokers to compensate
for variables such as additional years of smoking, as well as the
intensity of the habit, they found that the actual age at which
smoking began was an unexpectedly significant factor.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the younger the age at which smoking began, the
greater the amount of long-term DNA damage. Highest levels of
damage were observed in individuals who began smoking between the
ages of 9 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   All smokers develop some level of DNA damage, and all people who
quit experience some level of DNA repair. The new finding suggests
that less repair _ or less successful repair _ occurs in people who
smoked as adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers propose two possible explanations for why age might
impact smoking-related DNA changes. One possibility is that young
smokers, whose lungs are undergoing rapid growth and development,
are more susceptible to long-lasting damage. Another possibility is
that very young smokers accumulate more chemically altered DNA,
known as DNA adducts, and the body's repair mechanisms can't catch
up long after smoking ceases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This information tells us in clearer terms than ever about the
importance of preventing smoking initiation in teens,'' said Dr.
Margaret Spitz, who heads the epidemiology department at the
University of Texas M.D. Cancer Center in Houston. Spitz
co-authored an editorial endorsing the study that also appears in
the medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in the United States,
and cigarette smoking is the primary risk factor for developing the
disease. Between 1991 and 1997, smoking among high school students
increased by 32 percent, according to the American Cancer Society.

BOSTON REIT TO BUY 53 PROPERTIES FROM MGI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD KINDLEBERGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The real estate investment firm of Boston Capital
surfaced Tuesday as the buyer of 53 commercial properties being
sold by MGI Properties Inc. in a deal expected to bring at least
$400 million.
</P>
<P>
   MGI, a real estate investment trust based in Boston, is
liquidating its properties in an unusual move aimed at addressing a
share price it has considered depressed, and thereby maximizing the
company's value for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The broker in the deal, Robert Griffin of Fallon Hines &AMP;
O'Connor, Tuesday confirmed industry reports that Boston Capital
had been selected as the buyer. Boston Capital, which as of last
September owned 88,000 units of affordable housing and ranked
fourth nationally in that category, has agreed in writing to
purchase MGI's New England portfolio, Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of a New England transaction, it's one of the largest
that's ever taken place,'' Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   The New England portfolio, estimated to represent about 80
percent of MGI's value, contains few trophy properties. But its
office, research, and retail properties enjoy high occupancy and
are seen as well run. Boston Capital is in a due diligence period
after agreeing to buy the portfolio three weeks ago. Griffin
predicted the deal would close in 35 to 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   George J. Fantini Jr., a partner in the mortgage banking firm of
Fantini &AMP; Gorga, was surprised to learn Boston Capital was the
buyer even though he noted it had branched out from its core
business of syndicating tax credits for the development of
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This in my judgment is clearly going to be the biggest
transaction they've ever done,'' Fantini said. ``They probably had
a competitive advantage because I understand they have been able to
access liquidity, which of course is a struggle for some of the
REITs these days.''
</P>
<P>
   A sell-off of REITs that started a year ago reduced the share
price of many of the publicly traded companies to the point they
were foreclosed from raising capital with secondary offerings.
</P>
<P>
   MGI, founded in 1971 and one of the oldest REITs, has been held
back by not having enough size to attract the attention of

 &HT;    Net.Bank symbolizes change to come in bankingBy Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When she worked at Consumer Credit Counseling Service,
Jessica Long didn't pay much attention to the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she's at Net.Bank, one of metro Atlanta's latest mega
creators of paper wealth, she checks it a little more regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Long keeps a stock quote function on her desktop computer screen
to track her shares in the company. When Net.Bank climbs 34 percent
like it did earlier this week, she pulls out her calculator to
update her net worth. She'll repeat the routine periodically
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my way to lunch the other day, I was thinking how grateful
I am,'' said Long, who runs one of the Alpharetta, Ga. company's
fastest-growing departments _ new accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable, really. It's so exciting to see that stock
price go up and up and up, and just when it's at the point where it
can't go any higher, it just doubles practically,'' Long said
Tuesday. ``It's like winning the lottery. Who gets this chance?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the online banking company are up almost 270 percent
since Jan. 1. The stock hit a high of $106 after the company
announced Monday it added 8,000 accounts in the first quarter. The
company now has 24,634 accounts, nearly three times the number it
had a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank closed Tuesday at $97.87 1/2, down $3.81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer Bobby Bowers said the performance of
Net.Bank's stock ``obviously had something to do with a crazy stock
market for Internet companies. But we really are just doing what we
said we were going to do.'' That's provide banking services more
cheaply than its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has a workforce of only 40 people, offers a
range of traditional banking services. They include free checking,
money market accounts, certificates of deposit, electronic
bill-paying, debit and credit cards, mortgage loans and securities
brokerage services.
</P>
<P>
   But the bank doesn't have the overhead costs associated with a
traditional brick-and-mortar institutions and can pass along the
savings to customers in the form of higher interest rates for their
deposits and investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does represent what I believe is a permanent change in
how banking is going to be done,'' Bowers said. ``We're not big
enough to where we've got Wells Fargo or NationsBank worried. But
it's naive to think they haven't taken notice. ``The banks have
this problem, it's called overhead,'' Bowers added. ``It's the
traditional delivery channel, and banks can't just walk away from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank was created in October 1996 with the idea of starting
the nation's first federally insured bank to operate solely on the
Internet. The company went public in July 1997. It held a second
public offering of 2.4 million shares in February.
</P>
<P>
   On CNBC Tuesday, Chief Executive D.R. Grimes said he expects
profits to grow at a healthy clip this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analysts' expectations this year are for about 100 percent
earnings per share growth and about 90 percent next year. We have
no reason to doubt that,'' Grimes said while being interviewed at a
TV station in Raleigh, where he was visiting colleges with his son.
</P>
<P>
   The bank earned $4.46 million last year, compared with a loss of
$5.58 million in 1997. In the first quarter, it is expected to earn
9 cents a share, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes owned 179,062 shares in the company as of March 29,
according to an Securities and Exchange Commission filing. That
stake was worth $17.5 million at Tuesday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank's growth has been rapid and massive. In 1998, deposits
grew from $58.7 million to $283.6 million. Total assets climbed
from $93.2 million to $388.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank now has more than $500 million in assets. The company
has not yet released data deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The average daily balance for a typical traditional bank account
is between $4,000 and $5,000. Net.Bank's average daily balance for
a typical account is $14,000. The company, however, doesn't allow
more than $100,000 in any one account.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank is strengthening its marketing efforts to make the name
``Net.Bank'' more widely known. Its marketing budget was bumped
from $695,000 to $3.6 million this year. The company is advertising
in newspapers, magazines and on banking and finance Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Keane, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens, said
Net.Bank's continued success will hinge on its ability to
cross-sell other services and products to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's important to understand is what they can do to
create a financial portal, a powerhouse,'' Keane said. ``Consumers
have always said they feel more secure doing e-commerce with their
bank. Net.Bank has started cross-selling, with credit cards and
insurance. I expect to see that increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the sizzle is going to come from,'' Keane added.
``It just makes a lot of sense for people to start at the site
where their funds are held.''
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank's offices take up 7,500-square-feet of a one-story
brick office off North Point Parkway in Alpharetta. Reflecting its
growth, the company is moving this summer into 19,000 square feet
of space at another location about a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 40 people employed at the company, about 20 are in the
call center. The jobs pay between $22,000 and $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers said Net.Bank expects to add 40 more jobs this year, 20
of which will be in the call center.

COLLEGE GROUP ADMITS FAILURES IN PRODUCING TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The state's largest association of colleges Tuesday
conceded for the first time that its schools are largely to blame
for the stunning failure rates on the Massachusetts teacher
certification tests, and vowed to work with state officials to
improve the quality and quantity of public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The association's recommendations on how to improve the teacher
force dovetailed with those supported by state officials, but
marked a sharp contrast to a summit meeting last summer where the
colleges did little more than argue that state leaders were
unfairly bashing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colleges and universities share the concerns of the
citizens about teacher preparation,'' said Marjorie Bakken,
president of Wheelock College and head of the Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities of Massachusetts, which
released the report including the recommendations Tuesday. ``Do we
need standards? Yes. Do we need testing? Yes. The colleges
presidents and members of the faculty agree with everyone in the
Commonwealth that teaching standards are something we believe in; .
. . we are prepared to do something, we want (our schools) to be
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost as fast, members of the 55-college association, known
as AICUM, continued to do what they have done since the teacher
test results were released a year ago: criticize the test itself
and call for a different one to be administered. They also faulted
state leaders for not giving test takers enough information about
the exam in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A part of what we are doing is owning up to the problem, But
having said mea culpa, let me assure you there is enough culpa to
go around.'' said AICUM president Clare Cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledged, ``We need to cut off the circle of
blame.''
</P>
<P>
   The report's recommendations agreed with state officials that
there should be a test for teachers, and that the state should
decertify teacher education programs where too many graduates can't
pass the test. The colleges also asked for more time to improve
their programs before the state begins decertifying. Under
regulations passed last fall, any program where at least 80 percent
don't pass over two years will lose state certification, meaning
its graduates cannot be hired in state schools. The test, of basic
literacy and subject knowledge, has been given four times over the
past year, and each time, about half the candidates failed.
</P>
<P>
   The report asked for five years, and suggested 80 percent may be
too high a rate to expect at first, proposals Chancellor of Higher
Education Stanley Z. Koplik agreed were worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged by this,'' Koplik said. ``I think the fact that
they've said `We've identified some things we can do within our own
institutions' is progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the colleges turnaround is a product of necessity.
Under new federal law, students in programs that lose certification
will not be eligible for most financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``No institution, public or private, can afford the consequences
of running a program in which students can't benefit from federal
student financial aid,'' said Diana Pullin, a professor of
education at Boston College and a co-author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   While the report agrees with the need for a test, it argues that
the test the state used may not be a reliable measure of teachers'
skills. The authors said it was hard to judge the validity of the
test because the state had released so little information about it.
It suggested the company that designed the test produced it so
quickly that it could not be properly scrutinized. The report
suggests the test, which was designed specially for Massachusetts,
be replaced by the Praxis test, a test used in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The authors stopped short of saying the test was unfair.
However, Pullin said, ``There needs to be a better definition of
what teachers need to know and do. There needs to be some comfort
that the tests are valid.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominic Slowey, a spokesman for the company that designed the
test, National Evaluation Services of Amherst, Mass., said the test
had been developed over almost 18 months, from the time the company
first bid. The company asked about 5,000 educators across
Massachusetts to help determine what the test should measure. It
showed test questions to 300 college faculty members, and
pilot-tested those questions with 1,500 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``These same people who are complaining have seen the test,''
Slowey said. ``There is ample information out there about it. It is
not shrouded in secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, at a press conference to release the report,
association members seemed eager to criticize the test while at the
same time insisted it was time to move beyond criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every college president I have talked to has said `Maybe we
weren't doing all that we should have.','' Cotton said. ``Nobody
has said `We were doing it perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged the colleges were late arrivals to the
discussions about improvement, but explained, ``It's a new high
stakes world. It takes a while to adjust to this.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As a samurai, Hakuo Yanagisawa would have never bothered
to sheathe his sword. He spends his time feinting and darting and
backing his adversary _ Japan's banking system _ against the wall.
The establishment seems ready to yield.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Yanagisawa took over as chief regulator of
Japan's banking system in October, word raced through town that two
bank presidents had committed suicide. It wasn't true, but it
captured the fear felt by bank executives that Yanagisawa's demands
on them would be unbearably taxing and that their jobs might no
longer be secure.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa has suggested that he wants fewer banks. He has
bullied five banks into pulling out completely from international
business. And others have caved in to his demand that they abolish
the deeply ingrained practice of ``sodanyaku,'' in which former top
executives continue to draw large salaries and retain a
company-paid car and driver until the day they die.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Yanagisawa, a 63-year-old member of Parliament,
shrugs off the talk of suicides and undue pressure. He argues that
his rule is harsh only in comparison to the Finance Ministry
officials who, he says, governed the banks for years ``tenderly,
like a mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely not giving the Japanese financial
institutions the cruel treatment or giving them an impossible or
unsolvable agenda,'' he said. But, he added pointedly, ``I am
convinced that this is a time of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Resolution Trust Corp. in the United States, which
simultaneously shut down numerous savings institutions and bailed
out many others, the Financial Reconstruction Commission that
Yanagisawa heads will rely on a combination of carrots and sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa and other government officials say the banks wiped
off all the bad debt from their books on March 31, the end of the
fiscal year. They set aside $77 billion, enough both to cover the
bad debt and provide a cushion for good debt that might go bad.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, the banks buttressed their weak cushion of
capital when the government funneled in large chunks of cash in a
bid to restart the recessionary economy. The government hopes that
the infusion of $64 billion will encourage banks to take more
lending risks, thus easing the credit squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa is attaching some strings to the money. He demanded
agendas for restructuring, which now include cutting one in three
board directors on average.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, when banks distribute their preferred shares to the
government, in return for taxpayers' money, they will have to watch
their stock prices closely. If a bank's stock slides, then the
government could increase its stake when it converts its preferred
shares, which do not carry voting rights, into common stock. In
some cases, like that of Daiwa Bank, the government could start
stepping up its voting stake beginning as early as June.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in Japanese banking history that the
share price is important to management,'' said Robert Zielinski, a
banking analyst at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. ``If they let the
share price drop, they might be owned by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Yanagisawa is hardly a radical. A former Finance
Ministry official, he rose in the bureaucracy as an elite graduate
of Tokyo University. As a politician he has defended farmers, a key
constituency. He rarely drinks more than one beer at a time and he
does not play golf. His idea of a good time is a walk through a
modern art museum with his wife, a woodblock artist.
</P>
<P>
   And though his aides leap when Yanagisawa calls, especially to
nightly meetings that often end at 10 p.m., they say he takes good
care of them, sometimes ordering take-out for those who work until
2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa contends that Japan is near the end of its eight-year
battle with bad debt, and an increasing number of financial experts
_ while still worried about Japan's enormous economic problems _
are encouraged by the growing sense that banks will not collapse
and throw the system into shock.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Yanagisawa has been winning plaudits where it
counts _ in the marketplace. The stock market is up some 20 percent
from its low in October and bank shares have leapt about 60 percent
since then. Some overseas hedge funds and other investors are
betting that the worst has passed and that the potential for gains
now outweighs the risk of further losses.
</P>
<P>
   The changes inside the banking system may seem to come slowly,
but progress is being made. Bank executives are losing their
bonuses, salaries are being cut, and more and more employees are
afraid of being fired. Banks are re-evaluating their customers,
writing off loans, calling in others or demanding partial
repayment. They are unloading unwanted real estate, as well as
selling some bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Supervisory Agency, which Yanagisawa's commission
oversees, says it plans to set up an electronic monitoring system
at the banks over the summer, and it is considering sending in
full-time inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has been a lot more talk than action, and
Yanagisawa has critics. For one thing, no one believes that the
banks' books are clean just yet. The present estimate of $77
billion in bad debt is only a tiny fraction of the various
estimates that previously made the rounds _ $650 billion and higher
_ though it is unclear whether previous estimates were too high or
the present one too low.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the banks need to anticipate at least another
$85 billion in bad-debt disposal next year, and even more public
money, especially if the economy retreats again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've put some stability under the tottering structure, but
they haven't repaired it,'' said Alicia Ogawa, managing director at
Nikko Salomon Smith Barney. ``They have a lot of good policy out
there. The question is: Is the government really going to enforce
it? Judging from recent history, there's not a lot of good hope.''

 &HT;    Barnes: GRTA no miracle cure
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apowerful new state agency to tackle metro Atlanta's
traffic and pollution problems became law Tuesday with a flourish
of Gov. Roy Barnes' pen.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes cautioned Atlantans weary of gridlocked commutes and
blankets of smog hanging over the downtown skyline not to expect
immediate relief from the new Georgia Regional Transportation
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of our problems. I want to make sure
everybody understands that up front,'' Barnes told a cheering group
of business and community leaders gathered to witness the event.
``It's not even the beginning of the end. But it does give us the
tools to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how those tools will be used _ and who will use them _ are
the unknowns that will determine whether GRTA actually helps
improve traffic congestion and air quality or becomes simply
another acronym in the alphabet soup of state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has yet to announce any members to the 15-member GRTA
board, saying the appointments will come within the next 45 days.
He expects the authority to begin working with the state Department
of Transportation and Atlanta Regional Commission planning body
this summer to produce a transportation plan by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   But until the board is in place, GRTA can't begin to determine
how aggressively it will approach commuter gridlock and reigning in
the urban sprawl that continually expands Atlanta's regional
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a very tough task,'' said John Williams, the
Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce chairman and likely GRTA
candidate. ``GRTA could be required to negotiate in a very tough
way with local governments and neighborhoods. Sometimes people
don't like to do things differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, for one, expects an expanded network of High Occupancy
Vehicle (HOV) lanes and more bus service linked with passenger rail
corridors. In addition, he said he wants GRTA to recommend a
package of tax cuts and other incentives for business and
individuals to encourage use of transportation alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he hasn't talked with Barnes about an appointment,
but is open to an offer. Also considered potential candidates are
Ray Weeks, a developer and head of the Regional Business Coalition,
Pete Correll, the Metro Atlanta chamber official who pushed the
state to address traffic and pollution, and DeKalb County CEO Liane
Levetan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go on the way we have, with gridlock and
development,'' said Levetan, an early supporter of the initiative.
But she acknowledged that county officials may have to accept some
tough decisions as the new authority gets into its work.
</P>
<P>
   Other more cautious supporters agreed. ``This was the easy
part,'' House Minority Leader Bob Irvin (R-Atlanta) said of the
tussles to pass the legislation ``The hard part is what it's going
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   GRTA, which Barnes made the cornerstone of his legislative
agenda this year, has broad powers. It can start and run a new mass
transit agency, levy $2 billion in revenue bonds, influence local
zoning decisions and prod local governments into raising money _
including taxes _ to pay for regional transportation projects.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, GRTA will have final say on transportation projects
in 13 metro Atlanta communities now facing a loss of federal
highway funds because of chronic pollution, but it will expand to
cover other areas of the state as their pollution problems grow.
Governments that refuse to comply could lose a variety of state
grants, a major change in policy that gives teeth to previously
unenforced regional plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous first step, almost a leap,'' said Mark
Woodall of the Georgia Sierra Club.

 TOKYO: good hope.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Others complain that key decisions about the banks were based on
hasty inspections. Teams of 10 inspectors from the Financial
Supervisory Agency spent more than two months pouring over the
books of each bank, but their work may be suspect because many had
previously worked in the Finance Ministry, which has been seen as
too gentle on the banks.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa has been trying to boost the credibility of his
watchdogs, and he refused to move into the same office compound as
the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bankers themselves are skeptical about rapid change.
One Japanese executive said real change could come only when his
generation retired. Another banker said that unless senior
management sets a good example, it would be hard to impose changes
in pay scales, eradicate lifetime employment or curb pension and
other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worry is that by the time the FSA says they will fire
management, I think it will be too late,'' said the banker. ``The
problem that many banks face is that they can't make the tough
decisions to invest in new businesses when their mission now is to
fire and get rid of the bad loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's banking system faces a number of obstacles before it
regains its balance, much less before it becomes internationally
competitive. Banks need to catch up in technology _ they are not
even fully linked to the Internet _ and transform the way they
perceive and perform their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in the Japanese banking system now is that they
are not making money,'' said a senior official at the Financial
Supervisory Agency. ``The challenge they face is to look for new
businesses where they can expect higher profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time in Japan, there are new young entrepreneurs,'' he
added, speaking on the condition he not be identified. ``I hope the
banks would help people take over old traditional sectors and
enterprises in Japan, so that each enterprise becomes more active
in taking risks.''
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts are encouraged by the new direction, they
say Yanagisawa's commission, which is supposed to oversee the
supervisory agency for another two years before its mandate
expires, must keep up the pressure. Otherwise, the banks will lapse
into old habits.
</P>
<P>
   One worry is that the financial supervisors are stretched too
thin. With banking reform on track, the agency now wants to turn to
the problems at smaller, local financial institutions, as well as
to the billions of dollars in bad debts burdening the insurance
industry. But it cannot afford to ignore the banks.
</P>
<P>
   The government demanded detailed plans from the banks on how
they would refocus their businesses, but Yanagisawa was
disheartened to find that almost all of them chose the same path:
to strengthen their retail business. The problem, he says, is that
banks still aim to protect stakeholders _ employees in particular _
rather than the shareholders who nominally are the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call it the Japanese character if you want, but I can
definitely say that all of corporate management, not just the
management at banks, is stakeholder management, not shareholder
management,'' said Yanagisawa. ``And they are inclined all to look
at what other banks are doing. They want to be in a stable
condition together. And considering the future of the Japanese
industry, that is a little bit of a headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone acknowledges that any progress will be slow. Hideichiro
Hamanaka, deputy commissioner at the supervisory agency, lit some
incense _ perhaps for good luck _ and likened Japanese banks to
aircraft carriers, which require time to adjust to a new heading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new direction for the Japanese financial companies has
been set,'' he said. ``One or two years down the road the new
direction will be evident.''

CLINTON URGES BROADENING OF HATE-CRIMES LAW &HT;    
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, linking the ethnic slaughter in
Yugoslavia to hate crimes in the United States, urged Congress on
Tuesday to add women, homosexuals and the disabled to those covered
by a federal hate-crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very humbling, I think, for those of us who think we have
brought the modern world and prosperity and rationality to all of
human affairs to see what is going on in the Balkans and to see
these terrible examples here in our own country,'' Clinton said in
endorsing bipartisan legislation. ``We have to be, in the United
States, absolutely resolute about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed 1999 Hate Crimes Prevention Act, pending in both
houses of Congress, would broaden the U.S. hate-crime statute by
making violence against women, gay men and lesbians, and disabled
people a federal offense.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the law applies to violence only against racial and
religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, identical to one that died in Congress last year,
would also remove a provision that limits federal jurisdiction to
instances when the violent act interfered with the victim's
exercise of a federally protected right, such as voting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a White House speech that the Justice and
Education departments will develop with private companies an
educational program for middle-school students to teach them the
evils of intolerance and the value of diversity, the president
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice and Education departments will also begin to include
data on hate crimes among youngsters in the agencies' annual
reports on school safety, Clinton said. The Education Department
also will collect data on hate crimes and bias on college campuses,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another cruel irony, isn't it?'' Clinton said. ``College, the
place where we're supposed to have the most freedom, the place
where we're supposed to be the most rational, the place where we're
supposed to be able to think the highest thoughts with the greatest
amount of space, we have significant hate-crime problems there. And
we need to shine the light on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's endorsement of the legislation and his call for more
information about campus violence followed the killings last year
of James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man from Jasper, Texas, and
Matthew Shepard, a gay 21-year-old University of Wyoming student.
</P>
<P>
   One white supremacist has been convicted and sentenced to death
and two others face murder trials in the June 7 death of Byrd, who
was beaten, tied to the back of a pickup truck and dragged for
nearly three miles.
</P>
<P>
   In the Shepard case, Russell Arthur Henderson pleaded guilty
Monday to kidnapping and murdering the student. Wyoming District
Judge Jeffrey Donnell sentenced Henderson to two consecutive life
terms in prison.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL ADD END)
</P>
<P>
   Despite its bipartisan support, the legislation has spurred
controversy in legal circles over whether Congress can outlaw
violent crime, historically subject only to state criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   To make a state offense a federal crime, Congress must cite a
power it has under the Constitution. To satisfy this requirement,
the bill cites Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce
as the basis for allowing U.S. lawmakers to federalize hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill point to the compelling need for federal
officials to assist cash-strapped states in prosecuting hate
crimes. Opponents counter that, while the bill has a noble intent,
it may be unconstitutional and would further burden an already
overworked federal judiciary.

SCOTLAND FORMALLY CHARGES TWO LIBYANS IN LOCKERBIE BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands _ In a short session that the United
States and Britain had awaited for more than a decade, the Scottish
police formally charged two former Libyan intelligence agents on
Tuesday with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men were charged with conspiracy, murder and contravention
of the Aviation Security Act of 1982,'' a court official said.
</P>
<P>
   The listing of the charges included one other step: A police
officer read out, one by one, the names of the 270 people who died
in the air and on the ground after the jet exploded over the
Scottish village of Lockerbie. The victims, from 21 nations,
included 189 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the aircraft, believed to have been ordered by
Libya, brought severe U.N. sanctions against the country in 1992,
including an air embargo and a freeze of foreign assets. The
sanctions were suspended on Monday, hours after Libya handed over
the two suspects to a U.N. envoy in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
</P>
<P>
   The two Libyans suspected of planting the bomb, Abdel Basset
al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima, arrived in the Netherlands
on Monday. They now await trial by three Scottish judges, who will
hear the case without a jury on a former air base here.
</P>
<P>
   The base will be considered Scottish soil for the duration of
the process, which is likely to take more than a year. It was an
agreement to hold the trial in a country other than Britain or the
United States that finally ended Libya's resistance to handing over
the two men.
</P>
<P>
   The two Libyans were also brought separately before a Scottish
judge. A court official said that each defendant was accompanied by
his lawyers and an interpreter, who translated the proceedings into
Arabic. Neither man made a plea or a declaration, court officials
said. Both men have said in the past that they are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants' appearance before the police and the judge were
part of closed pretrial proceedings. The trial itself will be open
to the public. Under Scottish law, authorities have until April 15
to commit the defendants to trial, and the trial should then begin
within 110 days. But the start may be postponed for several more
months, Scottish officials here said, because defense lawyers have
asked for extra time to prepare their case.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy security surrounded Tuesday's events at Camp Zeist, a
former military base near Utrecht in the center of the country. The
base, set in quiet woodlands, is tightly sealed by metal fencing
and patrolled by Scottish police officers with heavy weapons and
trained dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are being kept in temporary cells until a more
permanent prison is finished. If they are convicted, they will
serve their sentence in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Several other buildings on the base are being converted for the
procedures. A police station and quarters for the more than 100
Scottish police officers and guards who have arrived here are
ready. But work is only just starting to convert a former school
into a courthouse and to adapt other quarters for offices and a
press center.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of converting the base and holding the trial has been
estimated at close to $200 million, which will be shared by Britain
and the United States. Dutch officials said that some of the work
was held off until the Scottish authorities were reasonably sure
that the two men would be handed over.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, many police officers and two prosecutors arrived here
from Scotland only this weekend. Scottish officials have not
announced who the judges will be.

 &HT;    Braves bullpen takes another hit
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The bullpen woes continue.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon the Braves put left-hander Mike Remlinger
on the 15-day disabled list for a pulled muscle in his back,
retroactive to last Friday. Remlinger's back had bothered him the
past few times he'd thrown but when he warmed up in the bullpen
during the Braves game Monday night it got worse.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing for trainers on Tuesday, the Braves activated
minor league left-handed pitcher Derrin Ebert, who was on his way
to Class AAA Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the last thing I wanted, but it's probably the
smartest thing,'' said Remlinger, who will be eligible to return on
April 18. ``We don't have the luxury of being able to say `Let's go
a couple days and see where we are.'''
</P>
<P>
   This time of year starters aren't able to go as long, so manager
Bobby Cox needs as many innings out of his relievers as possible.
Ebert will be used in the same situations as Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   This on the heels of Kerry Ligtenberg's season-ending arm injury
and Mark Wohlers' continued struggles is not what Atlanta needs.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger, who came to the Braves from the Cincinnati Reds as
part of the Denny Neagle-Bret Boone deal, made nine appearances in
spring training with a 5.28 ERA and 13 strikeouts in 15.1 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger said he doesn't feel the twinge in his latissimus
dorsi muscle throwing fastballs but it bothers him on his breaking
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time it happened I thought I had a cramp,''
Remlinger said. ``Once I got loose it went away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg surgery
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Birmingham, Ala. were that Ligtenberg had
successful ``Tommy John'' surgery on his elbow Tuesday afternoon.
In the process, Dr. James Andrews discovered Ligtenberg had nearly
a complete tear of his medial colateral ligament. Andrews
transplanted a tendon from Ligtenberg's wrist to repair his elbow.
Ligtenberg is expected to need a full year to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty good-sized tear, pretty much all the way
through,'' Braves trainer Dave Pursley said. ``It probably never
would have healed (on its own), so we were way ahead of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg figures to be ready at the start of next season.
</P>
<P>
   Ebert excitement
</P>
<P>
   Ebert's big league call-up came on his cellular phone in a Rack
Room shoe store at the Haywood Mall in Greenville, S.C. He was with
his wife Stacy, who was shopping for shoes to wear in a friend's
wedding when Richmond trainer Jim Lovell called to tell Ebert to
head south on I-85 for Atlanta instead of north toward Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``(At first) I thought I was traded to Florida in the
player-to-be-named later,'' said Ebert, referring to the recent
deal in which the Braves acquired pitcher Justin Speier.
</P>
<P>
   After sleeping for about three hours, Ebert woke up Tuesday
morning and drove to Atlanta. He showed up at the ballpark at 10:30
a.m. to find no one around. So he checked into a hotel and came
back around 1 p.m. He was excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing professional baseball for almost six years
now,'' Ebert said. ``I want to make it on my ability not because
I'm a filler, but if this is the best way to break in, I'll take
any chance I can to pitch on that mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebert got word that he would in fact be activated after batting
practice on Tuesday when Remlinger walked up and shook his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ask for anything better,'' said Ebert, a native of
Anaheim, Calif. ``I've dreamed of this every since I was 4 years
old. And the best part is I get to make the trip and (I may get to)
go home and play in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will play in Los Angeles April 19-21. That's one day
after Remlinger is eligible to come off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Ebert made one start with the big league club this spring when
Tom Glavine had a cut finger and responded with three scoreless
innings against the Indians, striking out five of the 11 batters he
faced. Last year in Richmond, Ebert went 9-9 with a 4.51 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Said rookie reliever Kevin McGlinchy about his major league
debut on Opening Day against the Phillies: ``I was fired up all
day. When they played the Star-Spangled Banner, I felt like I could
got to war for my country.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy said by the time he got out on the mound in the
seventh inning, he had relaxed, but he made a point not to look up
in the crowd. ``I was totally focused,'' he said. So much so that
he didn't realize who the hitter was until after he coaxed a pop-up
from Scott Rolen on his third consecutive fastball....

Tuesday night.

RUSSIA STARTING KEY TALKS WITH IMF 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The International Monetary Fund and the Russian
government will begin a critical round of negotiations later on
Wednesday that is aimed at completing an economic program and loan
package to avert a threatened default on Russia's foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   Its Treasury and central bank reserves vastly depleted by the
financial crisis that began last August, Russia hopes to get the
fund to refinance about $4.8 billion in loans coming due this year,
most of that in the second and third quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The country also needs an economic program approved by the IMF
to successfully restructure nearly $17 billion in debt payments it
owes to a group of Western lenders.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails to get the fund's approval, Russia is likely to
default on all its foreign debt payments. ``Time is running out for
Russia,'' said Christopher Granville, a strategist for the Russian
subsidiary of Robert Fleming, a British brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been wrangling with the fund for months to win new
loans to refinance its debts. A breakthrough of sorts came last
week when Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, and Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov issued a joint statement after a meeting
in Moscow that noted that both sides had agreed to a primary budget
surplus of 2 percent of the gross domestic product in 1999 ``and
most of the measures needed to achieve it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is now up to the IMF delegation of economists that arrived
here on Tuesday and the Russian Cabinet to work out the details of
those measures, which are of a sort that is consistently among the
toughest obstacles to completing aid packages.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the problem is a budget shortage of around 30
billion rubles, or $1.2 billion, Moscow economists estimate. To
reach an agreement with the monetary fund, Moscow must find ways to
raise enough revenue to fill the gap, including taking such
unpopular steps as imposing a tax on gasoline or export tariffs on
metals and other raw material.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the tax code must be approved by the
communist-controlled lower house of Parliament, which vigorously
opposes legislation linked to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's strained relations with the West, especially the United
States, over NATO attacks in Yugoslavia will make things even
harder. Indeed, the Russian legislators recently undermined IMF
talks by voting for a cut in the value-added tax, which accounts
for nearly half of budget revenue, according to the
Russian-European Center for Economic Policy, a research group here.
</P>
<P>
   Skittish so far about entering into a long battle with
Parliament, Primakov's Cabinet has taken ``a salami-slicing
approach to negotiations with the IMF,'' said a Western diplomat,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Instead of developing a few
major efforts to discuss with the IMF,'' the envoy said, ``the
Russians come up with 400 nickel-and-dime measures that grind down
their opponents across the table. It shows a political weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the government's waffling, most economists in Moscow
believe that the IMF and the Russians will announce an economic
program in the coming days, and that the IMF's board will approve
the new credits at its meeting at the end of this month. Clearly,
neither side wants a default. Russia owes the IMF $19 billion,
making it one of the lender's largest debtors.
</P>
<P>
   For Moscow, default could cause another round of possibly
disastrous economic and political upheaval. For the IMF and its
major contributing nations, a default by Russia would signal the
failure of their efforts to nurture market capitalism here.
</P>
<P>
   But after lending Russia money for years, often on the strength
of just its promises, the IMF is expected to be much tougher this
time. It may insist, for example, on a trial period to see if
Russia can make good on the conditions of the economic program
before the first installment of aid is released.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the differences from the past is that the IMF is
demanding that certain laws be passed before the money is
released,'' said Rudiger Ahrend, director of the Russian-European
Center for Economic Policy. ``The IMF doesn't want to be seen as
giving money to countries heading for another failure.''

U.S. TAKES STEP TOWARD TOBACCO SUIT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)   (nk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had hired a law
firm that represented Minnesota in its lawsuit against cigarette
makers to consult with government officials as they consider legal
action of their own against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of the firm, Robins, Kaplan, Miller &AMP; Ciresi, of
Minneapolis, is a signal that the government is intensifying its
preparation of a lawsuit that would seek to to recover Medicare
costs from tobacco producers.
</P>
<P>
   The firm played the lead role in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota in
1994 to recover Medicaid costs spent treating smoking-related
illnesses. The case was settled for $6.5 billion last May, just as
it went to a jury. The sum was the biggest recovery per capita for
any state that sued the cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, one of several hoping to snare the high-profile role,
is held in high regard by both anti-tobacco advocates and tobacco
lawyers for the quality of its work and intensive pretrial
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have devoted thousands of hours to uncovering and
learning the facts relating to tobacco litigation,'' the acting
assistant attorney general, David W. Ogden, who heads the
department's tobacco litigation task force, said in a statement.
``Their extraordinary experience in this area will be very valuable
to the department's tobacco litigation team.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, President Clinton said in his State of the Union
message that the Justice Department would file an action seeking
the recovery of federal money, from Medicare and other programs,
spent on smoking-related illnesses. He said the money would be used
to strengthen Medicare, the federal program that provides health
care to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the tobacco industry has reached
settlements to resolve state claims for Medicaid reimbursements
worth $246 billion. Federal officials have tried unsuccessfully to
recover the federal share. Now, the federal government is
contemplating recovering costs from a different pool of federal
money, Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams, a tobacco industry spokesman, said that
producers did not believe that the Justice Department had the legal
grounds to bring a tobacco claim and that the appointment of the
Minnesota firm suggested that it was turning to plaintiffs' lawyers
as a political step.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has handed the keys to the Justice
Department over to the trial lawyers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said that the law firm had agreed
to advise and assist agency lawyers through June 30 at a rate of
$75 per hour plus travel costs and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said they also did not contemplate a future
contingency fee arrangement under which the law firm would get a
portion of any money that the Justice Department won if the
government pursued a lawsuit and prevailed in court or settled the
case.
</P>
<P>
   In the Minnesota case, the firm had a contract which would have
paid it 25 percent of the $6.5 billion, or $1.6 billion. The
lawyers agreed to take $427 million, or 7.1 percent, though under
an arrangement that paid them more quickly.

 &HT;    Masters Notebook: Nicklaus gone fishin'
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ A Masters without Jack Nicklaus is like ``losing
the diamond out of the wedding ring,'' Greg Norman said Tuesday,
and golf fans feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Recovering from hip replacement surgery ended the Golden Bear's
streak of 40 straight Masters (he won six). The last time he spent
this week elsewhere, he was a freshman at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Cards and calls from other players have been nice, he said.
``Twenty years ago, they'd be happy to see me go,'' he said, with
no trace of sentimentality. He's not that emotional about missing
Augusta, he said, because it's part of a more significant streak of
146 majors that ended last summer when hip pain forced him to miss
the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus will fly to the Bahamas Wednesday for a fishing
vacation, and expects a return to ``solid golf'' in a few weeks, in
time for his Memorial Tournament next month.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday threesomes
</P>
<P>
   The unusually large field of 96 players is scheduled to go off
in threesomes Thursday for the first time since 1962. That's only
happened a few times at Augusta, and usually because of weather. On
Friday, those groupings will remain the same, only their teetimes
will be reversed so the early groups play late and the late groups
play early. On past Fridays, players were paired by first-round
scores. The changes have been made to accomodate a field that is
expected to grow larger in the future. 1992 winner Fred Couples
said playing with an extra partner could help him with club
selection on par 3's or reading a putt on a similar line, but he
expects the duration of the rounds to increase by 45 minutes
because threesomes will take longer to putt out.
</P>
<P>
   Unlucky 13
</P>
<P>
   Couples says he's not haunted by finishing second last year, so
let's just say he's thought a lot about it. ``It's probably
bothered me for a year and 10 days so far, and it's climbing,'' he
said. ``And it'll bother me because I'm sure Thursday I'll hit a
perfect 3-wood on 13 and hit an iron into the green.'' That's the
hole that undid him last year, when he hooked his drive, chipped
out of the woods, hurriedly smacked a 6-iron into the water and
double bogeyed. He caught a break, though, when preparing this
week: he missed Friday's cut at the BellSouth Clasic . ``A
blessing,'' he called it, because of the arduous trek around the
TPC at Sugarloaf in Duluth. He hurt his back earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   You're unbelieveable
</P>
<P>
   Amateur Hank Kuehne's massive drives have put him in a class
beyond even Tiger Woods and John Daly, according to Nicklaus. He
watched the U.S. Amateur champion on the back nine par 5's, and
Kuehne flew the trees on the dogleg 13 and hit a wedge into 15.
``Unbelievable,'' said Nicklaus, watching from a cart with
tournament chairman Hootie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Toms Zone
</P>
<P>
   David Toms walked off the 18th green with a new appreciation of
the 64 he shot in last year's final round. He fired a 29 on the
back nine, including six birdies in a row. ``I'm not sure how I did
it, to be honest with you,'' he said. ``You just get it going and
get in a zone.'' Did he predict a repeat of that low score this
year? ``Absolutely not,'' he said. But after a tie for ninth at the
BellSouth, he wouldn't be a bad player to have in the office pool.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar's weakness
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kuchar's Masters smile finally has dimmed. It took a
persistent virus to bring down the Georgia Tech amateur, a
sensation last year because of his play and disposition. Kuchar
managed only nine holes of his practice round with Steve Pate and
Ben Crenshaw Tuesday before leaving the course to seek medical
attention. He had fallen ill during last weekend's Carpet Capital
Collegiate in Rocky Face, Ga., and has yet to rally. ``He had a
tough time just walking up No. 8,`` said his father, Peter Kuchar,
who once again is serving as caddy. ``It really has sapped his
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Multicultural dining
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Mark O'Meara served sushi and sashimi
appetizers followed by steak and chicken fajitas, as the host of
Tuesday night's Champions Dinner. ``Sandy Lyle (of Scotland) had
haggis (or sheep stomach),'' O'Meara said. ``I know you've got to
put hot sauce up there for the haggis.''
</P>
<P>
   Round numbers
</P>
<P>
   Some featured groupings for Thursday and Friday: David Duval,
Nick Price and Bob Tway (1:23 p.m., 10:27 a.m.); Tiger Woods,
Sergio Garcia and Tim Herron (10:38 a.m., 1:34 p.m.); Mark O'Meara,
Hank Kuehne and Lee Westwood (1:12 p.m., 10:16 a.m.); Tom Watson,
Matt Kuchar and Stuart Appleby (10:16 a.m., 1:12 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Here today, gone tomorrow
</P>
<P>
   You might see players in practice rounds who won't be around for
the tournament They are honorary invitees, mostly players who have
major championships and are not eligible for the Masters field. For
example, New Zealand's Bob Charles, who won the 1963 British Open,
played a practice round Monday.

US FACES TOUGH SELL IN MOVING REFUGEES TO GUANTANAMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD AND TERESA MEARS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The massive US airlift of refugees to Guantanamo
Bay could begin by the weekend, provided relief workers can
convince the Kosovars it is in their best interest to leave their
homeland and family members behind for an undetermined stay at
military base in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   J. Brian Atwood, the head of the US refugee operation,
acknowledged Tuesday that relocating as many as 20,000 Kosovar
Albanians to the US naval base at Guantanamo ``is not an ideal
solution.'' He said it is a temporary, emergency measure aimed
primarily at saving lives and easing a humanitarian crisis in the
countries where Kosovo's ethnic Albanians have fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly don't like the notion that we have to relocate
people, but there is no other way . . . except to move families
away from the area for a temporary period of time,'' Atwood said in
a telephone interview with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them want to leave the region, all of them want to
return home,'' Atwood added. ``We are going to have to do a bit of
an education job to explain how important this is. It is a major
logistics task.''
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to lead an international effort to relocate
120,000 refugees temporarily, the White House announced Tuesday the
US military was preparing to receive 20,000 at the ``safe haven''
of Guantanamo Bay, the large naval base that housed as many as
51,000 Cubans and Haitans in the early 1990s. Atwood said within 72
hours the military would erect a tent city and provide personnel,
food, and medical services for refugees who agreed to be airlifted
out of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said the task is complicated by the fact that many of the
refugees have been separated from family members as they fled to
makeshift camps in Macedonia and Albania and in many cases, have
lost track of husbands, sons, or brothers left behind in Kosovo.
Atwood, the administrator of the US Agency for International
Development, said his ``top priority'' is keeping Kosovar families
and communities together.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is send a message to the refugees and
to Mr. (Slobodan) Milosevic that this a very temporary solution to
this problem, and we want to do the kind of preparation that will
enable them to live as close to a normal lifestyle as possible,''
Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
   But while US policymakers predict NATO's bombing campaign will
pressure the Yugoslav president to reverse course and let the
ethnic Albanians return, no one can predict how long the refugees
might remain at Guantanamo. Those who know it call it a steamy,
boring base that has not been very hospitable to refugees in the
recent past, and was the scene of some rioting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guantanamo is absolutely inappropriate and unsuitable,'' said
Cheryl Little, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy
Center and an advocate for Haitian refugees. ``It's hot, it's dry,
it's isolated, and most important, it's a prison camp. It's already
proven to be unsuitable as a refugee camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Little said the military was not equipped to provide schools,
counseling, recreation, and other services the refugees will need.
Maria Dominguez, executive director of the Human Rights Institute
at St. Thomas University in Miami, monitored conditions at
Guantanamo during the 1994-95 refugee crisis and said the camps
initially lacked running water, air conditioning, or any way for
refugees to communicate with family off the base.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Herb Josey, spokesman for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet in
Norfolk, Va., said Guantanamo could accommodate 1,300 people
immediately. ``As more refugees come in, we will continue to
build,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of refugees at Guantanamo attempted suicide Dominguez
said, and the military needs to provide more psychological support
this time: ``The issue is hopelessness, because they don't know how
long they are going to be there,''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a place you want to keep people for very long,''
said a spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees
immigration and refugee issues and is expected to have a hearing
next week on the Kosovo crisis. ``Senators generally support what
the administration has done, but they will want to know how long
the refugees will be there, living in tents, with nothing to do.
This is not a long-term solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said US officials had reviewed the record of refugee
unrest at Guantanamo and were convinced the Kosovars ``are not
going to be there that long, and they will be be treated as
guests.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that is exactly what they will be. US officials
confirmed Tuesday that refugees will not be protected under US
immigration law and will have no rights, including the right to
petition for political asylum, because they are not being housed on
US territory. Kosovar refugees in the United States may stay in the
country for 18 months and can apply for asylum and permanent
resettlement during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American
Immigration Reform, a group that advocates stricter immigration
policies, said airlifting Kosovo refugees out of the region is a
``knee-jerk response that will lead to bad results,'' including
eventual permanent relocation of thousands to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we take people, they never go,'' Stein said, noting it
would be more cost-effective and consistent with sound refugee
policy to house the Kosovars closer to home and an eventual
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood could not put a pricetag on the relocation, but he said
it will be ``a very costly operation.'' So far, the United States
commitment to take 20,000 refugees matches that of Turkey, and
exceeds other NATO countries, including Germany (10,000), Canada
(5,000), and Greece (10,000).
</P>
<P>
   According to most recent State Department figures, more than
450,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees have left their homes in the last
two weeks. Some 284,000 are in Albania and 136,000 are in
Macedonia, including many thousands still waiting to cross the
border. Atwood predicted the total could rise to 1 million.

NATO AIRSTRIKES TO CONTINUE DESPITE MILOSEVIC'S CEASE-FIRE &HT;    
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic declared a
unilateral cease-fire in the Kosovo conflict Tuesday in observance
of the Orthodox Easter holiday, but NATO leaders said airstrikes
would continue until he capitulates to the alliance's terms.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire announcement was made in Belgrade as the NATO
campaign entered its 14th day with more intense attacks on military
targets across Yugoslavia and on Serb army and security police
positions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials reported that clearing weather had enhanced
visibility, enabling its aircraft to fly more missions and making
it easier to pick out targets. Thirty targets were hit repeatedly,
including bridges, roads, and Serb troops and weapons in the field
and at staging areas in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Rear Adm. Thomas R. Wilson told reporters that
the Serbian air defense system ``is still a threat'' to NATO planes
but that more missiles sites and Russian-made MiG fighter aircraft
have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   He said that NATO is beginning to see evidence of ``declining
morale'' in the Yugoslav army as increased sorties are flown
against Serb troops and police in Kosovo. He said strikes early
Tuesday morning that destroyed the headquarters in Belgrade of the
Yugoslav special forces and security police had had a devastating
effect on key elements of the Serb military operations.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged, as did NATO officials in Brussels, that the
allied campaign has yet to grind down the Yugoslav military
defenses to a level that that would allow NATO planes to conduct
lower and more focused attacks on key positions.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Wilson, the director of military intelligence for
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the NATO strikes had interrupted
food, fuel, and equipment resupply routes, making it increasingly
difficult for Yugoslav forces to rout the predominantly ethnic
population of Kosovo and drive them from the country.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear, however, whether the bombing campaign had
contributed to Milosevic's decision to implement a unilateral
cease-fire in Kosovo where ethnic Albanian rebels have continued to
engage Serb forces. He also did not say how long the cease-fire
would last.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the United States and the 18 other countries in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization rejected Milosevic's call for an
end to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, who left Tuesday for a meeting
in Brussels with his NATO counterparts, called the cease-fire
``completely unacceptable'' and ``absurd.'' President Clinton,
meanwhile, stressed that the bombing campaign would only intensify
until the Yugoslav dictator withdraws his forces from Kosovo,
accepts the creation of a democratic government there and allows
the resettlement of ethnic Albanian refugees under the protection
of an international security force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States would never choose force as anything other
than a last option,'' Clinton said during a White House event on
hate crimes. ``Mr. Milosevic could end it now by withdrawing his
military police and paramilitary forces, by accepting the
deployment of an international security force to protect not only
the Kosovar Albanians, most but not all of whom are Muslims, but
also the Serbian minority in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's announcement of a cease-fire was expected, and
Clinton conferred with other NATO leaders over the weekend and
again on Monday in anticipation of it. The alliance leaders
decided, according to a senior White House official, to respond
with a determined and united front in order to drive home the point
to Milosevic that the time for negotiations has long passed and
that ``half measures'' aimed at stopping the bombing will not be
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has made clear what we expect ... a mere
cease-fire is clearly not sufficient to meet these conditions,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in his daily briefing for
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO campaign entered its second week, a bomb aimed at a
military facility fell on the Serb coal mining town of Aleksinac
100 miles southeast of Belgrade, killing four civilians and
injuring more than 20. In Brussels, NATO Air Commodore David Wilby
said it was ``possible that one of our weapons fell short of the
target'' due to a guidance system problem or fire from Serb
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the reason, any unintended damage to civilian
property or loss of life is very much regretted,'' Wilby said at
NATO's daily briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has been careful to emphasize that it is targeting
military sites associated with Milosevic's government and has no
quarrel with the Serb people. But the strikes have hardened
sentiments among the Yugoslav population.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening as the air campaign continued, residents of
Belgrade could be seen linking arms and forming a human chain in
the streets and across bridges in the city. Many of them wore
targets pinned to their clothing.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL END)
</P>
<P>
   The strain also was evident in U.S.-Russia relations Tuesday.
Moscow joined with Milosevic's government to condemn the attack on
Aleksinac. In an effort to ease tensions, Vice President Al Gore
telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and urged him
to use his influence with Milosevic to get him to agree to NATO's
terms for ending the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, administration officials said Gore urged
Primakov to intercede on behalf of the three U.S. Army soldiers
captured last week by Serb forces while patrolling along the border
of Macedonia.

 &HT;    Hartsfield International to get busier
 &HT;    By Gary Hendricks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A dramatic 22 percent increase last year in overseas
air travel has prompted Hartsfield International Airport officials
to add four new gates to the international passenger Concourse E,
the airport's chief planner said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Designs are expected to be completed and bids taken this summer
on the project estimated to cost between $20 and $25 million, said
Hartsfield Assistant Manager Andy Bell. The project should be
finished in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The gates are the first major addition to the 24-gate,
1.3-million-square-foot concourse that was built in 1994 at a cost
of $304 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to be out of gate space on E this summer,'' Bell
said. ''We really need them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the number of international passengers increased to 4.3
million annually, up from 3.5 million in 1997 and spurred mainly by
Delta Air Lines adding five South American cities and a new Tokyo
flight to its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Delta also will inaugurate four new European routes this summer
to Barcelona, Athens, Rome and Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, with us expanding this summer with the European
routes, it would justify the airport adding the gates,'' said Delta
spokesman John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield officially gained the title of world's busiest
airport Tuesday when Airports Council International, a Geneva-based
industry group, reported that 73.5 million passengers used the
Atlanta airport in 1998, an increase over 1997 of nearly 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield surpassed Chicago's O'Hare airport, which had 72.3
million passengers, and Los Angeles, which had 61.2 million.
London's Heathrow airport was in fourth position with 60.7 million
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the four gates would be added to Concourse E and the
existing gates will be reconfigured to accommodate new, wider
aircraft, such as the Boeing 777. Delta took delivery of the first
of 13 777s in late March and the plane will figure prominently in
the airline's international service.
</P>
<P>
   The airport already has taken a stop-gap measure to handle
increased international passenger volume. Three ground level doors
have been added to each end of Concourse E so that passengers can
be shuttled to planes on the tarmac in a huge tram, called a
Planemate, that rises on hydraulic lifts to the cabin level of the
plane. Planemates were used extensively during the Atlanta Olympics
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some gates on Concourse E also serve domestic flights during
lulls in international traffic. The peak period for international
flights occurs between mid-afternoon and early evening at
Hartsfield. All the airlines schedule flights to arrive and depart
at the same time. But unlike domestic traffic with high turnover of
planes at gates, international planes sit for several hours at a
gate, preparing for an extended flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``A plane sitting on the ground for four hours eats up gate
space,'' Kennedy said.

YUGOSLAV MILITARY SEEMS TO HAVE MASTERED THE ART OF HIDING FROM
NATO ATTACKS

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ When the skies cleared over the Balkans on
Monday, it seemed to be a promising day for NATO's high tech
warplanes to attack Yugoslav tanks and armor in Kosovo. But
alliance officials acknowledge that few, if any, heavy weapons were
hit.
</P>
<P>
   As they reviewed photos of the day's targets, NATO experts were
unable to confirm the destruction of a single tank or military
vehicle, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav military's ability to conceal its tanks and heavy
weapons from attack _ hiding them in churches, barns, forests and
towns _ has considerably complicated NATO's air campaign, pointing
to some of the self-imposed limits of air strikes alone.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yugoslav military truly believed it faced a land attack,
it would have to position its tanks and armor to cut off the roads
and other avenues of attack. This would give the NATO pilots
something to shoot at.
</P>
<P>
   An allied ground force would also make it possible for military
teams in Kosovo to call in and direct air strikes to their targets
with greater precision.
</P>
<P>
   Further, many of the Serb attacks are being carried out by
relatively small bands of soldiers with automatic weapons. They
would be no match for American ground forces, but they are hard to
find and target from the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are doing is low-tech,'' a NATO military expert
said. ``They can send 20 guys in a truck to terrorize a village.''
</P>
<P>
   But the allies have ruled out sending ground troops into Kosovo
until the fighting stops, largely to avoid political dissent at
home. Paradoxically, the absence of a credible threat to use land
forces may prolong the air campaign and subject NATO to more
political strain.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic appears to be husbanding his
military in hopes that NATO will call off the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic has already accomplished a lot of his objectives in
terms of ethnic cleansing,'' a senior NATO diplomat said. ``Now
Serbs are concealing themselves and preserving themselves to fight
another day. It is going to be a prolonged campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, NATO's relentless bombing is beginning to take its
toll. Allied warplanes have also pounded fuel depots, dropped
bridges, cratered airfields and pummeled surface-to-air missile
sites from one end of Yugoslavia to the other.
</P>
<P>
   But allied warplanes have had only mixed success so far bombing
the Serbs forces involved in assaulting the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Tuesday, for example, that it had
launched an intensive series of raids against the Yugoslav Third
Army, which has been spearheading the offensive in Kosovo. While
Pentagon officials said they had struck the army's ammunition and
fuel, as well some forces in the field, they provided no account of
how many tanks, artillery and other heavy weapons might have been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Rooting out Serb armored units, by all accounts, is not a simple
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   British Air Commodore David Wilby, NATO's military spokesman,
said, for example, that the Serbs are familiar with the pattern of
allied take-offs from Aviano, Italy, and other NATO airbases. They
try to time their assaults against the ethnic Albanians to the
lulls in the bombardment, according to Commodore Wilby, and hide
when they know allied warplanes may be on their way to bomb them.
</P>
<P>
   Even when allied warplanes catch Serb forces in the act of
rounding up ethnic Albanians, they often cannot attack them for
fear or hurting the Albanians or inciting the Serbs to take out
their frustrations on civilians.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case when an allied reconnaissance plane detected
Serb armored forces ringing the village of Glodane in Kosovo. The
Serb aggression was noted, but an attack was ruled out, at least
until the ethnic Albanians were shipped out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are also technical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Allied warplanes used infra-red targeting devices to find Iraqi
tanks during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Though the tanks were dug
up to their turrets in the desert, allied targeting equipment
detected the heat from the tanks against the cool desert night.
After finding the tanks, allied warplanes blasted with them
laser-guided bombs, a technique known as ``tank plinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo is not a desert. Western military officials have to
careful about bombing civilian buildings since they cannot always
tell if civilians are inside. And because the Serbs often turn tank
engines off to conserve fuel, they often do not produce enough heat
to be detected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tank plinking is not efficient,'' Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, the
vice director of strategic plans and policy for the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO planes can unleash a punishing blow if they find convoys on
the road, and they did blast one Tuesday, according to the Western
European diplomat familiar with classified military briefings.
</P>
<P>
   Allied planners also hope that fuel and other shortages will
force Serb units to relocate, giving NATO warplanes a change to
catch them on the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, they'll have to move to sustain themselves,''
General Wald said. ``Time is on our side.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many Serb units, however, have done their best to hunker down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are hiding armored vehicles in barns, churches, forests
and population centers,'' the Western European diplomat said. ``It
is not easy to attack them even when we know they are in there
because we don't know if civilians are also there.''
</P>
<P>
   The British encountered the problem earlier this week. Now that
the weather has improved, they were hoping their Harrier planes
could strike Serb ground forces, but many of the warplanes were
forced to return to base without dropping bombs because they could
not find any Serb ground units to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect the Serbs realize the advantage the better weather
gives us and are going to great lengths to hide their heavy
equipment and escape,'' said Vice Admiral Sir Ian Garnett, the
chief of joint operations for Britain's Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NATO was unable to confirm the destruction of a single
tank or military vehicle on Monday, according to NATO's military
spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the good weather we have not achieved the level of
damage on these forces that we should have liked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commodore insisted, though, that Tuesday's strikes appeared
to be more successful. The Serbian tactics, in fact, does not mean
that the allies cannot uncover Serbian tanks and artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Allied forces are flying unmanned Pioneer drones over the
battlefield and are trying to use them to target Serb units. Apache
helicopters may also improve the alliance's striking powers. Apache
crews, using night vision systems can hover to the earth and attack
Serb forces with laser-guided Hellfire missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, allied officials sought to put the best face on
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as they are hiding they are not killing,'' said
British Defense Minister George Robertson.

BAY STATE URGES PHILIP MORRIS TO STIFFEN ANTI-SMOKING ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As Massachusetts launches a fierce media attack on the
tobacco industry, it is joining 16 other states in calling on
Philip Morris Cos. to kill its current anti-smoking ads and replace
them with a more aggressive message.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are telling the nation's largest cigarette maker
that its $75 million media campaign, which is mandated as part of
last year's national tobacco settlement and is aimed at
discouraging teenage smoking, is not effective.
</P>
<P>
   Officials cite a study by a Chicago firm, Teenage Research
Unlimited, which found from 20 focus groups that teenagers are not
influenced by the Philip Morris ads and that their messages do not
offer compeling reasons not to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The Philip Morris ads show kids in various settings being lured
to take a cigarette but rejecting the offer. One teenager is on a
school bus, another is on stairs in a school building, and third is
on a playground.
</P>
<P>
   The company's ads, which trumpet the theme ``Think. Don't
Smoke'' and began last December, were tested in the research groups
against smoking prevention ads produced by Massachusetts,
California, Arizona, and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The research firm, which was hired by the states to conduct the
focus groups, concluded that ads aimed at teenagers should not be
developed with so-called ``choice theme'' and in fact such a theme
may dilute the impact of harder anti-smoking ads aired by state
public health officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would appear that Philip Morris's decision not to reveal
the health consequences of smoking has severely impaired the
effectiveness your youth campaign,'' Howard K. Koh, commissioner of
the state Department of Public Health, said in a letter sent this
week to Geoffrey Bible, Philip Morris's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Koh and the other 16 public health officials said they wanted
the cigarette company to hire an independent media company to
develop new ads _ a proposal Philip Morris Tuesday rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Merlo, senior vice president for Philip Morris USA, said
the tobacco giant, whose brands include Marlboro and Virginia
Slims, had no intention of dismantling its current ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think, from our research, that our message does communicate
the message not to smoke and communicates it effectively,'' Merlo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Merlo also noted that as part of the settlement agreement, the
industry would provide $206 billion over the next 25 years to the
states that will allow them to develop their own anti-smoking
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company said Mayor Thomas M. Menino's office had
requested to the Philip Morris commercials to present at an
upcoming teen summit. Merlo said federal public health officials
say that using messages with multiple themes to discourage smoking
is very effective.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as Massachusetts prepares a hard hitting
television and billboard ad campaign. It is called the ``Outrage''
campaign and attempts to further sully the industry's already
tarnished public image.
</P>
<P>
   The media blitz, which begins Thursday, will run for several
months. For the first month, the department is spending $400,000
for the production and airing of the ads, which will appear mostly
on news public affairs and sports programs and selected popular
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spots attack cigarette makers for referring to
cancer as a ``public relations problem.'' They charge the
executives are not out to make a profit but rather a ``killing,''
and then cite statistics showing that 470,000 Americans die each
year from smoking-related diseases. The ads also charge that
environmental laws would prevent the dumping of many of the
additives in cigarettes into a public landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these ads were are going right at the tobacco industry,''
said Mark Leccese, spokesman for the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health. ``The actions of the industry in the past 20 years
have been outrageous and we want people to get outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Merlo said Philip Morris could not respond to ads that she nor
anyone else at the company has viewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can tell you as an tobacco corporation executive I have
never made those statements,'' she said.

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ The Macedonian government sent more refugees
from Kosovo abroad on Tuesday, some of them against their will, and
the stories of families being broken up in the crush and refugees
being sent to unknown destinations bred further fear in the camps
here.
</P>
<P>
   But if the refugees driven out of Kosovo are frightened by where
they are going, they are even more frightened by where they have
been, a feeling compounded by some recent unconfirmed reports that
the Serbian police are ordering refugees on the road to return to
Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign doctors working in the camp in Blace said the refugees,
already severely traumatized by their experience inside Kosovo,
were now in terror of an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are really worried about where they are going,''
said Pierre Micheletti, a medical doctor and director of operations
in Macedonia for Doctors of the World. ``The authorities are not
bothering to keep families united. People are being separated on to
different buses and they do not want to be separated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great anxiety,'' he added. ``They now do not want to
leave the camp because they do not know where they will be sent.''
</P>
<P>
   At the airport Monday evening a man carrying a baby was
following his wife and two other children on to one bus, only to
have the door slammed in his face and the way barred by a
policeman.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's screams could be heard as the bus pulled away toward
a waiting plane. The man, bewildered, kept asking where they were
going. No one told him.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred refugees left for Turkey, and 91 for Norway, on
Monday. Hundreds more followed on Tuesday. Six busloads of refugees
were driven into Skopje airport at mid-afternoon on Tuesday to
board a plane to Turkey. Policemen wearing hygienic masks and
surgical gloves surrounded the buses as the refugees emerged.
</P>
<P>
   More planes were lined up on the tarmac and the transport of
hundreds more was expected to carry on through the night, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the refugees, ethnic Turks, talked through the bus
windows and said they were going willingly. But others said that
they had been forced to go by the police and that they did not even
know where they were headed.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion runs even to patients the doctors were evacuating
to the hospital. ``We have sent out sick people to get them to
hospital,'' Micheletti said. ``The people carrying them out said
they were put on buses, not ambulances. They may have been taken to
other camps or the airport, we do not know.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister of Macedonia, Ljubco Georgievski, railed at
criticism that his authorities were transporting refugees against
their will straight from the border to planes bound for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused European countries and the United States of not
helping his country cope with the enormous flood of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was necessary for Macedonia to take in 50,000 refugees
before we received the first packet of juice or tent from the
West,'' he said at a news conference in Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that closing the border had been aimed at goading
the West into action. ``It took the State Security Council to
announce that the border was closed for the international community
to realize something dramatic was happening in Macedonia and change
their policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he denied that refugees were being sent away
against their will, or without being told of their destination. Yet
his determination to send the remaining refugees stuck at the
border to other countries was clear. ``As fast as other countries
take the refugees, so the problem will be completed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramona Sunderwirth, a midwife from the U.S. branch of Doctors of
the World said the fear whipped up by lack of information and the
rumor mill was one of the worst problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refugees are very traumatized by the lack of information,''
she said. ``They come up and ask all the time `What is going to
happen to us? What does going abroad mean, does it mean never going
home?'''
</P>
<P>
   One report circulating among the refugees is that on Monday some
300 to 400 cars, still waiting to cross into Macedonia from Kosovo,
were ordered back home to Pristina by the Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
they were aware that a line of waiting cars had dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   A young man who spent days trying to get to Macedonia in a
convoy of 10 cars with his parents and brother, said in a telephone
interview on Tuesday from Pristina that his family was ordered back
from the border by the police on Monday. The family was just at the
barrier and two cars had passed through when the rest were suddenly
ordered back, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The young man, who would give his name only as Etrit, said that
he thought the sudden turnaround could have been a stunt for the
press, connected with the announcement by President Slobodan of
Yugoslavia that all Kosovo Albanians could return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   And those who do return will find the Serbs are ruling by
intimidation, said a drama student, Kushtriun Hoxha, who left the
city for Macedonia with hundreds of others by train on Monday. The
police in Pristina have announced that they will shoot on sight
anyone who walks alone in the streets, he said. Only women are
allowed to go out shopping for bread, and ethnic Albanian men spend
the entire day and night inside their apartments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never went out in 12 days,'' he said. ``Everyone is just
sitting terrified in their homes, or are moving from home to home
every day to avoid the police.''
</P>
<P>
   They and their neighbors finally decided to flee after NATO
bombs hit a building very close to their apartment in the Sunny
Hill district of the city. ``The whole building rocked and shook,''
he said.

NATO DECIDES IT WILL KEEP BOMBING, REJECTING MILOSEVIC'S TRUCE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO resolved on Tuesday night that it will
keep bombing Yugoslavia until President Slobodan Milosevic agrees
to withdraw all his attacking forces from Kosovo, to let refugees
return with an international military force to protect them, and to
negotiate a political settlement, Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The allies rejected Milosevic's announcement Tuesday of an
immediate unilateral cease-fire for the Orthodox Easter on Sunday
as ``a propaganda ploy,'' in British Defense Secretary George
Robertson's words, unless it is accompanied by compliance with
their other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to get diplomacy restarted in a series of meetings here
this week, the allies have moved away from their earlier insistence
that before anything else can happen, Yugoslavia must sign the
accords on autonomy for Kosovo that were presented at negotiations
at Rambouillet Castle in France last month.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Tuesday night that his
conditions for an end to bombing are ``the return of all refugees
and therefore the deployment of an international security presence,
the withdrawal of Serb military, police and paramilitary forces,
and putting into place a political framework for Kosovo on the
basis of the Rambouillet accords.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after a peace agreement is reached, according to the
allies' original plan, will the alliance be willing to send a
NATO-led peacekeeping force of 28,000 soldiers into Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, which is the major entity remaining in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Rambouillet agreement made largely inapplicable by
Milosevic's expulsion of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians
from the province in the last two weeks, European diplomats said
the allies are willing to send in peacekeepers to escort the
returning refugees before a final settlement is negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO still insists that the fighting has to stop before it
will send in allied troops, and it is not planning to order
soldiers to fight their way into Kosovo, diplomats say. Military
commanders say that if the allied bombing campaign goes on long
enough, the Serbian forces will eventually be unable to put up much
resistance. But for the moment, the Serbian forces are still
driving the ethnic Albanian majority out of the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unilateral announcement of a cease-fire by Yugoslavia is
essential but insufficient,'' German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
said in a statement Tuesday night. ``What is decisive is the actual
behavior of Yugoslavian troops on the ground in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said NATO still demanded an immediate end to all
military activity and killing, a retreat of Serbian forces from the
region and the stationing of international forces in the region to
allow refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only by meeting these conditions can the humanitarian
catastrophe come to an end and lead the way to a peaceful,
multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo, where its inhabitants can live
in peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia welcomed Milosevic's cease-fire announcement and has
repeatedly demanded an end to the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In deference to vigorous Russian objections, allied officials
said, the alliance would not insist on plastering the NATO label
over the international force they eventually hope to send to Kosovo
to enable the ethnic Albanian population to return home. The allies
also still hope Russia will agree to take part in such a force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that if NATO participates in a peacekeeping force, it
should lead it, but we don't think we need to say that if it
irritates the Russians,'' a European diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to get Russia to resume cooperating with Western nations
to put pressure on Milosevic to agree to peace terms acceptable to
the allies, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and four
high-level European officials plan to meet in Brussels Wednesday
with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Avdeyev.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first meeting of the ``contact group''
countries _ Russia, the United States, France, Britain, Germany,
and Italy _ since NATO began bombing Serbian military targets March
24 in response to Milosevic's refusal to accept the Rambouillet
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the allies expected from the meeting with Avdeyev, a
European diplomat responded, ``To get a sense of whether the
Russians are still willing to work with us.'' Russia stopped all
cooperation with NATO after the bombing started, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, on his way to the United States, turned around in
midair and canceled the visit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials of the six contact group nations, plus Canada and
Japan, also plan to meet this week in Dresden, Germany, to discuss
the Kosovo crisis, a meeting requested by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said on Tuesday night
that if the diplomatic meetings went well enough, a meeting of
Russian and Western foreign ministers on Kosovo, including
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, could be held in Europe by
the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The allies and European Union officials also hope to get Foreign
Minister Aleksandar Dimitrov of Macedonia to agree to speed up his
country's acceptance of ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo when
they meet with him in Brussels Thursday and Friday, officials here
said.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, with a delicate ethnic balance between Orthodox
Christians and Muslim Albanians, barred an estimated 65,000
Albanian refugees from crossing into Macedonian territory from
Kosovo at one border point this week out of fear of being
overwhelmed. European diplomats at NATO said they hoped that the
European Union and international financial institutions would step
up financial aid to Macedonia to encourage it to accept more of the
refugees.

RELIEF AGENCIES SWAMPED WITH OFFERS TO HELP BALKAN REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ People called wanting to know if they could adopt
children orphaned by the Balkan crisis. They wanted to know what
size pants to send, how to conduct food drives, and whether their
homes could be shelter to the refugees flooding across the Kosovo
border.
</P>
<P>
   All day, phone operators at Interaction, an organization helping
the US government direct private donations to non-profit groups,
say the outpouring of support by the American people was remarkable
with thousands of inquiries coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Relief groups and the US government expressed appreciation for
such offers, while also struggling to get across the message that
what is most needed is not food, clothing or shelter, but cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't clean out your closet or attic with (donations)
we can't use,'' said J. Brian Atwood, who, as administrator of the
US Agency for International Development is coordinating the US
government's response to the crisis. In the wake of Hurricane
Mitch, aid groups were overwhelmed by second-hand products and food
they could not use or transport.
</P>
<P>
   Non-profits can't transport things like food or blankets from
the United States quickly enough, explained Renee Bafalis, director
of public affairs for Interaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten dollars or even one dollar is a lot more helpful to groups
working with refugees on the ground in Kosovo because they know
exactly when and where the needs arise,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After President Bill Clinton mentioned that donors should call
1-800-USAID RELIEF during an address Monday, the phone lines were
so swamped with calls, the United States Agency for International
Development recruited the Federal Emergency Management Agency to
help coordinate public efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Having increased the number of phonelines and expanded the
number operators to 160 working around the clock, Atwood said the
lines should no longer be jammed.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood and other non-profit relief groups attribute the
``tremendous response'' to the hotline number to the impact of
televised images of hundreds of thousands of fleeing refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Gross, a spokesperson for US AID, said the agency had not
totalled the number of calls that are referred to the AID webside
(www.info.usaid.gov) or to Interaction, both of which provide
information on how to contact non-profit aid groups receiving
donations.
</P>
<P>
   CARE International said it had received a total of $1.25 million
in donations since Thursday, the bulk _ $850,000 _ from Pew
Charitable Trusts and the William H. Gates Foundation. Like many
non-profits, CARE is using the web to update people on their
efforts in the Balkan region and as donation site. In four days
alone, $80,000 was pledged on their website alone.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Relief Services, the lead US non-profit agency
distributing immediate food assistance to refugees, is receiving
500 to 1,000 calls a day, said Tom Price, director of media
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an overwhelming response,'' he said, ``but it
has not been on the level of Hurricane Mitch.''

 &HT;    Hartsfield International to get busier
 &HT;    By Gary Hendricks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A dramatic 22 percent increase last year in overseas
air travel has prompted Hartsfield International Airport officials
to add four new gates to the international passenger Concourse E,
the airport's chief planner said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Designs are expected to be completed and bids taken this summer
on the project estimated to cost between $20 and $25 million, said
Hartsfield Assistant Manager Andy Bell. The project should be
finished in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The gates are the first major addition to the 24-gate,
1.3-million-square-foot concourse that was built in 1994 at a cost
of $304 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to be out of gate space on E this summer,'' Bell
said. ''We really need them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the number of international passengers increased to 4.3
million annually, up from 3.5 million in 1997 and spurred mainly by
Delta Air Lines adding five South American cities and a new Tokyo
flight to its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Delta also will inaugurate four new European routes this summer
to Barcelona, Athens, Rome and Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, with us expanding this summer with the European
routes, it would justify the airport adding the gates,'' said Delta
spokesman John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield officially gained the title of world's busiest
airport Tuesday when Airports Council International, a Geneva-based
industry group, reported that 73.5 million passengers used the
Atlanta airport in 1998, an increase over 1997 of nearly 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield surpassed Chicago's O'Hare airport, which had 72.3
million passengers, and Los Angeles, which had 61.2 million.
London's Heathrow airport was in fourth position with 60.7 million
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the four gates would be added to Concourse E and the
existing gates will be reconfigured to accommodate new, wider
aircraft, such as the Boeing 777. Delta took delivery of the first
of 13 777s in late March and the plane will figure prominently in
the airline's international service.
</P>
<P>
   The airport already has taken a stop-gap measure to handle
increased international passenger volume. Three ground level doors
have been added to each end of Concourse E so that passengers can
be shuttled to planes on the tarmac in a huge tram, called a
Planemate, that rises on hydraulic lifts to the cabin level of the
plane. Planemates were used extensively during the Atlanta Olympics
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some gates on Concourse E also serve domestic flights during
lulls in international traffic. The peak period for international
flights occurs between mid-afternoon and early evening at
Hartsfield. All the airlines schedule flights to arrive and depart
at the same time. But unlike domestic traffic with high turnover of
planes at gates, international planes sit for several hours at a
gate, preparing for an extended flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``A plane sitting on the ground for four hours eats up gate
space,'' Kennedy said.

 &HT;    What to do to conceive the first baby of 2000
 &HT;    By Pat Thomas
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you are thinking it would be nice to deliver
your next child on Jan. 1, 2000, stop reading and get busy.
</P>
<P>
   Friday has been determined to be the optimal day to conceive if
you're aiming for a due date of 1/1/00. Well, the optimal date give
or take a couple of weeks, human gestation being a somewhat
imprecise process.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of couples around the world are so entranced with the
idea of a millennial baby that an infant industry has sprung up.
There are television documentaries in the works, dozens of
newspaper and magazine articles, thousands of baby-making tips,
even a Millennium Conception Kit that can be yours for $49.99 (it
includes candles, massage oil and a pregnancy test).
</P>
<P>
   And yes, we know all about how the millennium really starts on
Jan. 1, 2001, but why let the facts get in the way of hype? Radio
stations will give prizes to the first Y2K baby and some hotels are
offering special rates for couples hoping that a change of scenery
will get something started.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site www.babycenter.com is one of a number of Internet
sources for all things newborn. Under its ``Millennium Baby
Overview,'' it offers topics such as ``Women Who Want Millennium
Babies,'' ``Media Coverage of Millennium Babies'' and ``Y2K
Worries'' _ after all, you don't want the delivery room lights to
fail just as the doctor says, ``Push!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some advice to would-be millennial moms and dads gets
a whole lot more specific, but it's best to leave some things up to
the imagination. Web sites: www.having-a-baby.com/millenium.htm

 &HT;    For Duval, it's all in a day's work
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ It took two questions. The media, in all its
assembled majesty, can be quicker than a snake and as subtle as a
hammer.
</P>
<P>
   So first David Duval fielded a question on how it feels to win
one of every three times, then this: ``There's kind of a perception
out there that you're somewhat of a dullard,'' a man said to the
world's current No. 1 golfer. ``Why do you think that is?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell me,'' Duval said evenly. ``Is that your impression?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't clarified whether you're talking about my
personality or my golf game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personality,'' the guy said.
</P>
<P>
   And then Duval defined himself. ``If that's a perception,'' he
said, ``then that's fine. That's how I try to play. I try not to
make mistakes. I try to make it a very stress-free round.''
</P>
<P>
   And a stress-free interview.
</P>
<P>
   I can think of 100 players who would either have stood up and
left the room when that grenade was rolled up, or leaped over the
table and made like Stone Cold Steve Austin with the questioner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in that brief exchange, Duval showed the traits that have
brought him to the top of the world golf rankings. He defused it
with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Bogey? Big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Insult him? Big deal.
</P>
<P>
   He has composure. Bank it.
</P>
<P>
   And in this game, you put composure along with an average drive
of 287.5 yards; laser irons and the putting touch of a painter and
you've got a guy with a future.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of. . .let's see, Nicklaus, Watson, Hogan. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Duval is 27, but could still pass for a college kid _ 6-foot,
180 pounds with closely cropped blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the 54-minute exam, he was asked, ``If you hit a bad
shot, it doesn't bother you. You're called a dullard and it doesn't
bother you. What does it take to get you to lose your cool? Do you
remember losing your cool?''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled for a moment, then said, ``I have, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The room roared. How could he not remember the last time he
flipped?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be successful out here,'' he said, ``you have to find the
demeanor and personality under which you perform your best. For me,
that's not worrying about stuff. I can't do something over. I can't
re-hit a shot. I can only move forward. So that's what I try to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharks only move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Duval has been a shark for a year-and-a-half. He has won 11 of
the last 34 times he put his tee in the ground, which is like a
baseball player hitting .500.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a blank line on his resume: Eleven wins, but no
majors.
</P>
<P>
   So here he is at his fourth Masters, coming off consecutive
victories the past two weeks. He knows in golf a man's career is
measured in majors, and he is ready to start collecting his.
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that easy.
</P>
<P>
   Someone mentioned that when Greg Norman was at the top of his
game, he used to stand on the first tee and wonder, ``Who's going
to finish second?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever get that feeling?'' Duval was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Unh unh. No.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Larry Bird. He used to show up for the
three-point shooting contest at the All-Star game and ask the other
players, ``Which one of you is going to finish second?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Bird quote I like best,'' Duval said, ``is when he was
asked if Michael Jordan was the best player ever. He said, 'Well,
one of the two best.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Duval isn't made of that stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you chosen your clothes for Sunday?'' someone asked,
implying something that would go with the green coat given to the
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clean ones,'' he said.

ALL IS HARMONY, ANDERSON, PITINO AVOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- After listening to Rick Pitino and Kenny Anderson
downplay the point guard's one-game ``timeout'' for unprofessional
behavior, all that's left to wonder is when they're going to pick
out the living room furniture together.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was back at practice Tuesday, one day after he missed a
game at Orlando for what both individuals insisted was nothing
major. On four occasions, Pitino called the transgression either
``extremely minor'' or ``no big deal'' while Anderson did the same.
Both men also swore that they were sympatico on everything as well.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: ``It's ludicrous for someone to say that he doesn't
like me or that I don't like the system. We have utmost respect for
each other. I love playing for Rick Pitino. I love being in Boston
with the Celtics. There's no dislike at all. It's frustration, the
wear and tear. A miscommunication, one of those incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino: ``I like the way he plays. Off the court, (he's) one of
the nicest guys on the team. I couldn't like a person any more than
him. On the court, (he's) like everybody else in a losing
situation: we have to get better. . . But he's a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. Now, how about those Wizards?
</P>
<P>
   No one heard any laugh tracks as the two men spoke. No noses
appeared to grow. Pitino insisted that Anderson was singled out
only because he had told the team a few weeks back that any future
dust-ups would be dealt with in such a fashion. Anderson, he
insisted, was Test Case 1.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, it wasn't the first time. Anderson and Antoine
Walker had a very public spat against the Wizards earlier this
season in Washington, during a game, and both men were fined.
Pitino said it wouldn't happen again. Apparently it did last
Sunday, when Anderson did not think he should be spending as much
time on the bench. There also had been a prior ``miscommunication''
as to Anderson's defense against Mark Jackson the previous Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Both men said there was no swearing. It was more a challenge to
Pitino's authority and that is a no-no. In this instance, it meant
not going to Orlando and missing a game, a very public reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino, of course, went out of his way to say it could have been
anyone on the team. Or even him. In fact, the coach said other
players have done it, but did not get similarly spanked because
there was no punishment system in place. The coach said he told his
team a month ago, or three weeks ago &UR;  &LR; -- he said both Tuesday --
that he now expected his men to act like Alistair Cooke on the
court. (Since that time, Walker has gotten seven technicals.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What he (Anderson) did is nothing what some other guys haven't
done to each other on the court, or in a situation that is very
unprofessional,'' Pitino said. ``This is a professional basketball
team. With people watching, from children to media to everyone
else. Everyone has to act like pros at all times. Regardless of
whether we're up 20, down 20, playing great or playing poorly, your
frustrations must be kept behind closed doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said Anderson would be in the starting lineup Wednesday
night against the Wizards when the Celtics begin their first
three-in-three situation since December 1979. He said had the
Celtics been in a playoff chase, he might have taken Anderson on
the trip, but felt that it was more beneficial for the 28-year-old
to stay home and ``reflect on his frustrations about losing and
come back very positively.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson did that. He was the second player on the floor and
smiled all the way through early stretching exercises and layup
drills. Who knows what happened for the 90 minutes behind closed
doors? Afterwards, Pitino said the practice went well, that he was
``100 percent'' satisfied that Anderson had learned his lesson and
that all was well and swell, except for the 10-22 record, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Same for Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those things,'' he said. ``It shouldn't be
taken out of context or blown up out of proporton. The whole season
is wearing on everybody . . . I'm one of the oldest players on the
team. A veteran. I'll take the slap, the slap on my wrist, the slap
on my face. If that means he's going to set an example, whatever,
I'll take that and deal with it.''

RULING ALLOWS TARIFFS BY U.S. OVER BANANAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The World Trade Organization handed the United
States a significant but only partial victory in its long-running
dispute over banana trade on Tuesday, authorizing the Clinton
administration to impose roughly $191 million in sanctions against
European-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   The figure is the organization's estimate of the damage done to
American companies because of Europe's elaborate quota system that
favors the import of bananas from its former colonies, instead of
from Central American nations where Chiquita Brands and other
growers are major players. The United States had argued that the
damage was far higher, amounting to $513 million, and began
collecting 100 percent tariffs on many European luxury goods early
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The trade organization's far lower estimate of damage done to
American companies is based on a different, more conservative
formula than the one employed by the Clinton administration. That
was a win for Europe, whose officials have charged Washington with
exaggerating the effects of its rules. At the same time the panel
of WTO judges determined that Europe's revised rules governing
imports amounted to nothing more that a rewriting of the old rules,
and an effort to avoid compliance with several past WTO rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is running out'' for the Europeans to comply with the
organization's mandate, said Peter Scher, who directs agricultural
negotiations for the U.S. Trade Representative's office.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity of the United States declaring victory over Europe in
a long-running economic dispute, while trying to hold the same
European nations together in the Kosovo crisis, was somewhat
jarring Tuesday _ a dissonance that was rarely seen in the days of
the Cold War, when security always overrode nasty trade spats.
</P>
<P>
   This argument, however, has already gone far beyond questions of
banana trade, and both Europe and the United States have
considerable political capital invested in their positions.
President Clinton, who has argued about the issue for hours with
European officials, has cast it as a test of the authority of the
WTO to mandate that nations change their trading practices. Unless
he can show Americans that Europe can be forced to drop trade
barriers, he argued recently, it will be impossible to forge a
consensus for Congress to comply with rulings that go against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Tuesday's ruling paves the way for a negotiated
settlement. But so far neither side has been willing to back down,
and Scher said Tuesday that the United States would impose the
sanctions against European nations retroactively, to March 3.
Because it can act against only $191 million in imports, however,
the list of products subject to sanction _ everything from pecorino
cheese to expensive European clothing accessories _ will have to be
cut at least in half.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has charged that the United States is acting
arrogantly, pointing out that virtually no American jobs are in
dispute. The whole argument, they charge, has arisen only because
the head of Chiquita, Carl Lindner, is a powerful contributor to
both Democrats and Republicans, and has been pressing the United
States to aid his company.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that Lindner's clout pushed the issue to
the top of the American trade agenda. But the bottom line of
Tuesday's decision is that the trade group's panel found in favor
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday evening, Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. Trade
Representative, said in a statement that the WTO decision ``sends a
clear message'' that Europe cannot use a lengthy legal process to
buy time, keeping its restrictions on imports in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fifth time in six years that an international
trade panel has found the EU's banana policies to be in violation
of international trade rules,'' she said.

WOODS, O'MEARA BECOME PART OF EACH OTHER'S STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Tiger Woods considered the question, shrugged his
shoulders and said yesterday that he was ``cool'' with the idea of
being replaced by David Duval as the world's top-ranked golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Mark O'Meara urged journalists to discount Woods'
attempt to downplay his recent loss of status heading into
tomorrow's opening round of the Masters Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it bother him? Probably, yes,'' O'Meara said. ``He wants
to be the man. He wants to get that No. 1 ranking back.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus ended another session with golf's version of the Odd
Couple: two neighbors from Orlando, Fla. with widely differing ages
and backgrounds who believe they know each other well enough to
clarify the other's unfinished thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   They also play pretty decent golf, as evidenced that O'Meara,
42, is the defending Masters champion and Woods, 23, won the title
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Each credits the other with helping him make improvements in
dealing with life on the PGA Tour. O'Meara points to Woods, who is
single, as a catalyst toward regaining competitive fires. That
allowed O'Meara, in 1998, to record the first two major
championships of his 19-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Woods cites O'Meara, who is married and the father of two, as a
sounding board for helping him in off-course matters.
</P>
<P>
   It was O'Meara, for instance, who first counseled Woods about
curbing his penchant for throwing or slamming clubs. It was O'Meara
who urged Woods, on the way to the 1998 Masters, to stop airing
complaints about his busy off-course schedule because the public
had little sympathy for the time demands on a young millionaire who
enters less than 50 percent of the tournaments on the PGA Tour
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Woods has taken O'Meara's advice to heart. As a
result, Woods points to 1999 as his most enjoyable season on the
PGA Tour, although he has just one victory and has been supplanted
by Duval as the game's top player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually having more fun this year than ever before,''
said Woods, who won five times in his first seven months on the PGA
Tour and topped the 1997 money list with $2,066,833. ``I understand
a lot more about the tour, about how things work, about myself ...
and Mark has been part of that. And it's a beautiful thing right
now because I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   What Woods understands about his golf game is that he has
adopted some of the self-control and discipline that marks
O'Meara's game. Woods' driving distance (291.9-yard average) may be
down by five yards per pop from last season, but he's hitting more
greens in regulation (71 percent) and his putting is better. He
does have only one victory, but he has cracked the top 10 in seven
of eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God, yes,'' Woods said, when asked if he considered
himself a better player today than in 1997. ``I'm more consistent
all around, and that's what you want to do. My bad round isn't 78
or 77 any more ... it's 70 or 69. I've learned that, when I'm not
on, to accept pars and accept trying to get up and down for bogey
if I hit the ball in the trees. That's improving my overall game.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, in turn, has watched his game blossom since Woods moved
to the neighborhood in 1996. After falling short in his first 56
attempts to win major championships, O'Meara won both the Masters
and the British Open, along with player of the year honors, in
1998. Asked if he believed he would have won a major championship
without nurturing their relationship, O'Meara said, ``Probably
not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think spending time around Tiger helped me dramatically,''
O'Meara said. ``It helped me from the standpoint that his burning
desire to want to win tournaments ... told me, `Hey, man, I am
running out of time here.' It rejuvenated me. I know when I'm
playing with him, he has oodles more talent than I've got, but it's
challenging to try and find ways to beat him. Doing that has
elevated my game.''
</P>
<P>
   All the way to the point that O'Meara, ranked No. 4 in the world
golf rankings, joined Woods yesterday in fielding questions about
pursuing Duval for the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's not a burning desire,'' O'Meara said. ``For
Tiger, I think it motivates him.''
</P>
<P>
   Just another example of how golf's Odd Couple are similar, yet
different.

PROMINENT FAMILY SELLS STAKE IN MEXICAN BROADCAST NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a momentous but amicable parting of ways by two
of Mexico's most powerful business dynasties, the Aleman family
announced Tuesday that it was selling its 14 percent stake in the
holding company that controls Grupo Televisa SA, the largest
broadcast network in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Aleman family's decision was disclosed at a ceremonious news
conference by the two scions who recently ascended to the command
of their family empires. Miguel Aleman Magnani, 32, is a Televisa
vice president who is the grandson of a former president of Mexico,
and Emilio Azcarraga Jean, 31, is Televisa's chairman and the son
of a legendary entrepreneur who built the company from a string of
radio stations into a huge conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the Alemans' share of Grupo Televicentro SA de CV,
the holding company, decisively consolidates the dominance of the
Azcarragas in Televisa, reinforcing the control of Azcarraga Jean
in a sometimes uncertain transition after the death of his father
in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Both Aleman Magnani and Azcarraga Jean took pains to insist that
their separation was friendly. They ended their statements with a
bearhug that drew applause from Televisa employees in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, dispelling the rumors of quarrels between the families,
whose Televisa partnership dates back 30 years, appeared to be a
far more significant priority Tuesday than disclosing the financial
details of the transaction. Azcarraga Jean said that since
Televicentro was a private company, the families had agreed not to
disclose the share price to be paid for the Aleman holding.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would he say how Televicentro, which is carrying $533
million of debt after a revamping in February, planned to finance
the purchase, valued at about $200 million based on Tuesday's
Televisa share price. He said only that several options existed and
that the Aleman family was not pressing for a quick decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very surprised if there is any more debt capacity
there,'' said Tim Baker, head of research for Warburg Dillon Read
in Latin America. The agreement with the Alemans leaves open the
door for a major new partner.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier Von Bertrab, a Televisa executive, said there was ``no
way'' that minority shareholders would be hurt by the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman Magnani said it was his choice to leave Televisa to start
a new group of Aleman businesses. He will resign from his post as
of May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's my turn,'' he said, recalling how he had agreed to
stay in Televisa to help Azcarraga Jean secure his grip after his
father's death. Aleman Magnani did not say what kind of enterprise
his new group would undertake.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the dais was Alejandro Burillo Azcarraga, a cousin who
owns 14 percent of Televicentro. He assured Aleman Magnani that
Televisa ``remains your home.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday Azcarraga Jean and his family owned 72 percent of
Televicentro, which controls 26.5 percent of the voting shares of
Televisa.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman Magnani dismissed speculation that his father, Miguel
Aleman Velasco, wanted to get out of Televisa to stifle any
possible criticism if he runs for president of Mexico next year.
Opposition parties complained that favorable coverage of Aleman
Velasco by Televisa helped him win election as governor of the
state of Veracruz last year.
</P>
<P>
   Working against steep odds, Azcarraga Jean has surprised many
analysts with the turnaround he achieved at Televisa, which his
father ran as a personal fief. Azcarraga Jean pared the work force
to 16,500 from a high of 23,000 and shaved other costs while
widening Televisa's ratings advantage over Television Azteca, its
main competitor.

CITING SECURITY CONCERNS, U.S. SUSPENDS WORK ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS
COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ac) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department said Tuesday it had suspended
all scientific work on the computers containing America's most
sensitive weapons secrets at its three nuclear weapons laboratories
over fears that security lapses make the computers vulnerable to
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said he ordered the suspension
on Friday as part of a new effort to improve security in the wake
of charges that China has stolen nuclear secrets from the labs.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of scientists and other researchers at Los Alamos,
Sandia and Lawrence-Livermore national laboratories who rely on the
classified computer networks have been forced to drop their work
and instead attend new training sessions on cyber-security, Energy
Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The computers are connected together in networks, but are not
linked to the outside world. After the United States stopped
testing nuclear weapons, the work of modeling the reliability of
weapons designs has been done with these networks.
</P>
<P>
   One security flaw, according to officials, is that secret
information about nuclear weapons can be copied from the sensitive
computers onto a computer disk and then sent as e-mail among the
thousands of e-mails that leave the laboratory through separate
unclassified computer systems. One proposal is to ``make it
physically impossible to transfer classified information from a
classified computer to an unclassified computer,'' the Los Alamos
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he said he will not allow normal computer
operations, except those needed to insure safety, to resume until
he is satisfied that security has improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that I am dead serious about strengthening
security at the labs,'' Richardson said. ``Our computer security
has been lax, and I want to strengthen it, and the only way to do
that is to stand-down. I want to demonstrate to Congress and the
American people we are serious about upgrading computer security at
the labs, and that there will never be another lapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to suspend all work on sensitive computer networks
at Los Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence-Livermore national laboratories
is one of the most pointed actions taken by the Clinton
Administration since the furor erupted last month over allegations
of Chinese atomic espionage.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes on the heels of an internal review by the Energy
Department, which owns the labs, determined that security measures
at Los Alamos and Lawrence-Livermore were subpar. Los Alamos and
Lawrence Livermore both received ``marginal'' security ratings,
while Sandia received a satisfactory rating, according to the
report released last week. The report cited Los Alamos management
for failing to ``ensure that members of their organization
implement, support and follow safeguards and security policies and
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Taiwan-born computer scientist at Los Alamos, Wen
Ho Lee, was fired for security breaches after being interviewed by
the FBI in connection with China's suspected theft of the design of
America's most advanced, miniaturized nuclear warhead, the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had been one of Los Alamos' leading computer experts on
nuclear weapons design, and had retained access to classified
information until just a few weeks before he was fired, even though
he had been under investigation by the FBI for nearly three years.
Lee has not been arrested or charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's computer expertise was a factor in the decision to order
the broad stand-down of lab computer systems, Richardson said. The
relatively poor ratings received by both Los Alamos and Lawrence
Livermore in the security report also played a role, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, espionage is contributing factor, and the report is a
contributing factor.'' Richardson said. ``The goals are to increase
employee responsibility for security and to implement new measures
for the handling of classified and sensitive information.''
</P>
<P>
   The classified computer networks at the weapons labs are not
connected to the Internet, and are thus not supposed to be
vulnerable to hacking by outsiders. The possibility of secret data
being downloaded from the classified networks and then entered into
the unclassified network and e-mailed to the outside is a key
security concern, according to one U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   The lab plans to impose new audit procedures on unclassified
computer systems in order to control sensitive information. Los
Alamos will also require that two people be involved in the
transfer of files from classified computers.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Alamos lab director John Browne cautioned that the labs
can't allow security to become so stringent that it prevents them
from accomplishing their objectives. ``We have to look at threats
to information security from a risk-benefit standpoint and put in
place additional procedures that make sense,'' Browne said. ``We
can't raise the bar so high we can't get any work done. That
affects national security too.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, there is evidence that China may have used an
American-built high-performance computer in its nuclear weapons
program, according to U.S. officials and outside experts. That
evidence appears to conflict with Clinton Administration statements
that there is no link between U.S. exports of super-computers and
China's efforts to modernize its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   A select Congressional committee investigating illicit transfers
of U.S. high technology to China has been told that U.S. officials
saw a U.S. high-performance computer in use at a Chinese technical
center known to be involved in nuclear weapons design in the early
1990's, officials said. The congressional panel, chaired by Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., has been told that U.S. officials saw
the U.S.-built high-performance computer at China's Institute of
Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics in Beijing. That
facility was identified in 1997 by the Commerce Department as an
``entity of concern'' involved in developing weapons of mass
destruction or missiles used to deliver such weapons.

 &HT;    Couch eyeing Bengals in case No. 1 pick is not him
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ After everything went down Tuesday, University of
Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch pronounced himself ready to be a
Bengal if he doesn't become a Cleveland Brown.
</P>
<P>
   He toured the Bengals' Spinney Field practice facility, visited
Cinergy Field and the new Paul Brown Stadium site, met team
president Mike Brown and most of the coaches, had a brief Xs-and-Os
session with offensive coordinator Ken Anderson and lunched on ribs
at the Montgomery Inn Boathouse.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, Couch discovered that, NFL-wise, the Queen
City isn't so bad after all, and that falling to the Bengals, who
have the No. 3 overall pick in the April 17-18 NFL Draft, isn't the
end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said in his Bluegrass drawl when asked if he could
see himself in a Bengals uniform when the new stadium is completed
for the 2000 season. ``I think it would be great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being so close to Lexington, it would be a great situation for
my family and Kentucky fans that would also become Cincinnati fans.
If I do come here, I'd just be worried about being the best player
I can be. It wouldn't be pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch still wants to be the Browns' No. 1 overall pick. But it
won't crush him if he doesn't go first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice,'' Couch said. ``But I don't think it's the
most important thing to me. Whoever wants me, wherever I end up,
I'm just going to make the best out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think they've (the Browns) got a big investment to make
in whoever they pick with the first pick, and they want to make
sure they can see everything they can out of a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon quarterback Akili Smith is also high on the Browns' list.
So is University of Texas tailback Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner who shed 20 pounds to reach
his 224 playing weight, ran a series of 40-yard dashes for NFL
scouts during a workout in San Diego on Tuesday. He had wind-aided
times of 4.4 and 4.52 seconds. Against a stiff breeze, he ran
between 4.6 and 4.72.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a three-horse race now,'' Browns head coach Chris Palmer
said in a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   Couch, who will conduct a second workout for the Browns on
Sunday in Lexington, said he hasn't been informed about the format.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll just show up with a ball and ask 'em what they
want to see _ like meeting out in the backyard with your buddies,''
Couch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just said they wanted another workout. So I don't know
exactly what I've got to do. I guess just go out and throw the ball
accurately with a lot of velocity. If I come out and put on a
strong show, I think it'll help me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer then challenged Couch, who will be awfully glad he didn't
order a second slab of ribs here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll get his money's worth,'' Palmer said. ``He better make
sure he's rested. I have no place to go Sunday except to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in Bengals management were perplexed that Couch, who
originally wanted to fly from Lexington to Cincinnati, insisted on
being driven back and forth. Assistant trainer Billy Brooks served
as the chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   A prima dona? Maybe. But one with talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got plenty of arm strength _ believe me,'' Bengals head
coach Bruce Coslet said. ``That's been the knock on him. But he can
throw the deep ball. He wasn't asked to do it a lot in college, but
he's got the ability to do it.

 &HT;    NATO, DISMISSING CEASE-FIRE BID, HAMMERS TARGETS ACROSS
YUGOSLAVIA ON WEDNESDAY
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Dismissing Belgrade's latest cease-fire bid as an
empty gesture, NATO hammered dozens of targets across Yugoslavia
early Wednesday in the most intensive strikes yet in the 15-day air
war.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple explosions rocked the area near a military airport
outside of Belgrade around 1 a.m. (6 p.m. EDT). State-run
television in the capital reported other attacks underway to the
southwest and in the industrial town of Cacak, 50 miles south of
Belgrade, where NATO says its planes have hit a major ammunition
factory in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's attacks began hours after Defense Secretary William
Cohen rejected a cease-fire proposal by Serb leader Slobodan
Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia. Cohen, who labeled the offer
``absurd,'' left Tuesday night for Brussels, where he hopes to
shore up NATO support for continuing the air war.
</P>
<P>
   On a second front, U.S. and NATO food, tents and medicine poured
into desperately overcrowded refugee camps in Albania and
Macedonia. The White House announced plans to begin within days to
send 20,000 ethnic Albanians forced from Kosovo to temporary
quarters at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Under operation ``Sustained Hope,'' the U.S. portion of what has
become a global humanitarian mission, officials plan to deliver
half a million tons of food, medicine, tents, cots and sleeping
bags into Albania and Macedonia by this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of a third straight night of clear skies, NATO
beefed up its armada of warplanes, adding 50 strike jets from the
USS Roosevelt aircraft carrier. That brings the number of NATO
combat and support planes in the attacks to roughly 600, half of
them American.
</P>
<P>
   State-run television in Yugoslavia showed footage Tuesday of a
destroyed housing complex where several civilians were reportedly
killed in a Monday air raid outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   NATO air commodore David Wilby said a bomb intended for a
military barracks apparently fell some 600 yards short of its
target, but he would not confirm the civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said U.S. officials were
investigating the incident, in which a 500 pound laser-guided bomb
dropped from a U.S. warplane apparently veered off target Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was being aimed at a military target and it appears to have
hit an apartment building,'' said Bacon. ``One reason it could have
happened was a cloud interfered with the laser-guided mechanism of
the bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon stressed that civilians are not the target of the NATO air
campaign. It is being waged to stop Serb troops, police and
paramilitary units that have conducted a brutal campaign of
repression targeting ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province in the
Yugoslav state of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's Wednesday attacks followed around-the-clock strikes on
Tuesday, with British Harrier jets on search and destroy missions
reportedly hitting Serb tanks in southwest Kosovo, a sign that the
air campaign has become increasingly aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Pentagon displayed the first visual images of
damage to Serb forces in the field the blackened wreckage of a
handful of tanks along with scattered military trucks and armored
personnel carriers hit at a barnyard staging area by armor-piercing
cluster bombs dropped en mass from the supersonic B-1 bomber.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also reported, for the first time, ``significant''
Serb military and police casualties. While officials would not
discuss numbers, the targets outlined barracks, headquarters and
staging areas among them would imply casualties in the hundreds, at
a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said two weeks of air raids had destroyed or
seriously damaged at least 23 targets of Serb troops or police in
and around Kosovo, as well as a half-dozen critical headquarters
operations in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said those strikes, in addition to hits on scores of
ammunition dumps, fuel depots, bridges and airfields, have crimped
the ability of Serb field forces to be resupplied or to coordinate
their activities with central commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Thomas R. Wilson, intelligence director for the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that there is growing evidence of
morale problems among the Serb forces as the air campaign bites
deeper into the marrow of their operations.
</P>
<P>
   A weekend cruise missile attack that destroyed the headquarters
of the elite Special Unit Corps of Serb forces outside of Belgrade
has apparently struck dread in the hearts of the troops, said
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people in it and we have evidence that there was a
morale impact as a result of this strike,'' said Wilson. ``When you
see your comrades killed in strikes in the middle of the night from
afar, it is not conducive to keeping your mind totally on the
business at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   With the NATO strikes gaining traction after Serb forces have
run nearly 1 million ethnic Albanians out of their homes across
Kosovar, Milosevic ordered a cease fire, ostensibly in preparation
for this weekend's Orthodox Christian Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said his troops would halt their offensive in Kosovo
and he would begin immediate negotiations on the return of ethnic
Albanians an estimated 430,000 of which had fled Kosovo's borders
as of Tuesday. He made a similar offer days after the NATO bombing
began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   NATO rejected the offer immediately, saying it fell far short of
the terms NATO has long proscribed: withdrawal of Serb troops from
Kosovo; a return of autonomy in Kosovo to ethnic Albanians there;
acceptance of a NATO-led peacekeeping force there; and concrete
guarantees for the safe return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's cease-fire proposal contained none of those
elements, and NATO gave no pause in the air campaign to so much as
consider it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want some kind of murky or shadowy sham proposal
which, in reality, would simply reward Milosevic for the mayhem
that he has caused,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters at
alliance headquarters in Brussels. ``A cease-fire which says, 'I
finished my work and now I'm going to go home and leave the mayhem
behind me,' is not something that we would be prepared to accept.''

an exploratory committee instead, for a possible run for the

</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Senate, he said, is that he doesn't want to

to deal with the nation's ``serious leadership deficiency.''

   Cain would focus on government bureaucracy, ``which creates
barriers to success, and even worse, the system has become
intrusive, abusive and unfair.'' Although he would be running as a

makes it difficult for a voice of common sense to emerge out of the
political paradigm.''

 &HT;    Glenn to help celebrate century of flight
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Space pioneer and retired U.S. senator John Glenn
will lend his fame to Dayton's 2003 Committee, the organization's
marketing director said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee plans to introduce Glenn as its ``secretary
general of inventing flight'' at an invitation-only party it has
scheduled for April 19 at the U.S. Air Force Museum, marketing
director Lauri McFarlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventing Flight'' is how the committee will identify itself
from now on as it starts firming up and publicizing its plans for a
yearlong series of events to celebrate a century of flight in the
year 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The year will mark the 100th anniversary of the world's first
powered flights by Dayton brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright. The
Wrights invented the airplane in Dayton and made the first powered
flights Dec. 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The museum bash will include live music and videos staged among
the aircraft exhibits for up to 1,700 invited guests. McFarlin said
Glenn will flip a switch to start a ``2003 countdown clock,'' one
of three that will be set up around Dayton to tick off the time
until the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's master plan calls for a yearlong series of
educational and art events, as well as a summer gala built around
the United States Air and Trade Show. McFarlin said the latest
details in its plans will be unveiled at the party.
</P>
<P>
   A native Ohioan, Glenn is a former Marine Corps aviator and
astronaut. He became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962,
then became the oldest person in space last October when he blasted
off on a space shuttle mission at age 77.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Glenn is one of the few people who has that same spirit
and aura'' of the Wright brothers, McFarlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has also been a big booster of Dayton's aviation heritage.
He co-sponsored legislation to create the Dayton Aviation Heritage
National Historical Park and a national Centennial of Flight
Commission, which was established to coordinate first-flight
celebration efforts.
</P>
<P>
   On last year's space shuttle flight, Glenn carried small
swatches of the fabric that covered the wings of the 1903 Wright
Flyer.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will bring name recognition to a committee that has
received little attention outside Dayton. In North Carolina, the
First Flight Centennial Foundation has George Bush, former U.S.
president and World War II Navy combat pilot, as its honorary
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kitty Hawk's fame as the place where the Wrights first
flew has caused many people to mistake it as their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   McFarlin said she ``had no idea'' the Wrights lived in Dayton
until she moved here from Milwaukee in January to work for the 2003
Committee. She said she doesn't have an aviation background, ``but
I haven't been an ostrich, either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This community tends to be very modest about what its history
and accomplishments have been,'' she said.

Supply, comes in two flavors _ Original (lemon-lime) and Ice Cool _
and retails for $1.99-$2.50 per 1.5-liter bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The marketers of this Gatorade for dogs promise it will
replenish your canine's fluids lost in the heat of play and
invigorate older dogs _ all without a smidgen of caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like humans, dogs require essential nutrients to stay healthy
and strong,'' says Gene Reilly, CEO of National Pet Supply. ``It
was based on this belief that our team of veterinarians developed
Rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   The name was inspired by basketball players. The company tested
the product on dogs for a year and a half _ discarding a
meat-flavored drink (``Too much like soup,'' says Reilly) _ in
favor of a fat-free, mineral-rich, semisweet drink palatable to
humans and canines alike.
</P>
<P>
   No Rebound for cats, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a guy running with a cat, then somebody else can have
that market,'' says Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rebound was developed with the help of Dr. Scott Brown
of the University of Georgia veterinary school, some fellow vets
say it's a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Terry Terlep, a canine sports-medicine specialist in Fort
Myers, Fla., is skeptical. ``Unless you're taking your dog for a
run alongside a motorcycle for 13 miles, I don't think it's
necessary,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   According to Terlep, dogs get their energy from solid fats _
``not from drinks and carbohydrates.''
</P>
<P>
   Terlep's suggestion for refreshing a pooped pooch? ``Take him
into the shade and give him a bowl of cool water.''
</P>
<P>
   Terlep's advice notwithstanding, if you still want to try
Rebound, check these stores in Atlanta: the Pet Set, Pet Supplies
Plus and Three Dog Bakery.

   MORINI, Albania _ The long, ragged lines of refugees continued
to cross the border from Kosovo here as darkness fell Tuesday,
despite the cease-fire declared by the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The fleeing ethnic Albanians were taking their cue from the
plumes of smoke pouring from border villages set afire by the
Yugoslavs Tuesday afternoon, rather than from any diplomatic
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   During the day and evening, several refugees spoke of having
been told by the Yugoslav police that the policy toward them had
changed and they could go home. But the somewhat mystifying offer
did not appear to have been widely heeded.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the pace of refugees crossing the border appeared to
pick up rapidly Tuesday afternoon, and by nightfall the twisting
road leading toward the Albanian town of Kukes was jammed with
tractors pulling carts of refugees, nearly all women, children and
old men. More than a dozen horse-drawn wagons crossed Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   With the major cities of Kosovo largely emptied out, it appeared
that many of Tuesday's refugees were from outlying rural districts,
some from around Pec, in the far northwest of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Eqerim Mucaj, like several others, said his group had been told
by Yugoslav police at Szure, the village about two miles north of
the crossing that has been used as a dropping-off point for bus and
truck convoys, that they could turn around and go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We answered: `We have nowhere to go there. We don't have
houses. We have nothing to eat,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another man said he replied, ``My direction is Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of villagers from Koreshe, outside Prizren, accepted an
offer from two carloads of Yugoslav policemen to go back home. But
as they neared their village, they said, they saw the mosque being
blown up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were again frightened and came here,'' said a man still too
fearful to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Some said that after they declined to return to their burned
villages, the Yugoslav police took down their names.
</P>
<P>
   During the day at least four refugees recounted similar stories.
But most refugees crossing the line Tuesday evening said they had
not been told they could turn back and, in any case, were unlikely
to trust such offers from the Yugoslavs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going back,'' said Vec Gjakova from atop the tractor
he had driven toward Albania for the last four days. ``I would go
only if we would be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   As the refugees arrived, they told the strikingly similar tales
that are becoming so familiar here: of being robbed _ sometimes
told to turn over a specific sum like 100, 400 or a thousand German
marks as the price of their lives or a child's life _ of being
ordered out of their homes, of seeing the houses burned down, of
being herded together at gathering points in the larger towns and,
often, of seeing Yugoslav gunmen kill their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Gami Bushati, an old man from the village of Lybenic who was
being treated for gunshot wounds at the jammed hospital here _
which has no anesthetics or much of any other medical supplies _
said he had survived a massacre of about 120 people.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Yugoslav forces arrived at his village about 7:15
a.m. Friday, gathered people together in a barn and began shooting.
He said he and three others had managed to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we were lucky,'' he said, ``because we were the first that
fell down, and the others fell on top of us.''
</P>
<P>
   A second refugee on Tuesday confirmed an account of Yugoslav
forces using a backhoe to dig a mass grave at Mala Krusa, one of
two adjacent villages where a half-dozen witnesses have described
mass killings of roughly a hundred people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The account came toward the end of a long, detailed story by the
refugee _ a warehouse accountant unwilling to give his name _ of
being rounded up with other villagers at a collection point in
Belinica.
</P>
<P>
   As his group passed Mala Krusa, he said, he saw Yugoslavs with a
backhoe digging a big pit into which they were dropping bodies in
white plastic bags. His account dovetails with that of a refugee
interviewed three days ago who followed the same route.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees arriving from Suva Reka said the Yugoslav forces had
executed people from families who had rented offices or apartments
to the observer teams from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe stationed there.
</P>
<P>
   The observers, who monitored the attacks by Yugoslavs on ethnic
Albanians, have been withdrawn, along with all other Western aid
workers and journalists. There have been reports of similar
killings of people who worked with the observer teams in other
towns.
</P>
<P>
   All of the 57 villages in the Suva Reka area have been burned to
the ground, refugees from there said. One man added, ``It's a very
bad smell from the bodies in the burned houses.''
</P>
<P>
   With roughly 80 percent of the refugees women, children and
elderly men, according to Laura Boldrini, spokeswoman for the U.N.
high commissioner for refugees, there is growing concern for men
between the ages of 15 and 50. Some have gone into hiding in the
mountains, but many others were separated out when people were
rounded up and may have been put into holding areas by the
Yugoslavs or killed.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees reported a large concentration of young men held in a
place called Krjlan, Ms. Boldrini said. And a State Department
report said there were a number of other holding centers where
groups of ethnic Albanian men of potential fighting age were being
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:10 Tuesday afternoon, the Yugoslavs torched a cluster of
red-tile-roofed houses just behind their border post, forcing the
long waiting line of refugees to go through one last sight of
destruction on their way out of Kosovo.

MARKET PLACE: MALONE MOVES LIBERTY MEDIA INTO BIG STAKE IN
MURDOCH'S NEWS CORP. 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every time John Malone gets part of a company, the
price seem to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who sold Tele-Communications Inc. to AT&AMP;T, is acquiring
8 percent of News Corp., the media conglomerate controlled by
Rupert Murdoch. Word of those plans have driven the News Corp.'s
American depositary receipts up 15 percent, to $34 Tuesday, from
$29.50 on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Malone remains chairman of the Liberty Media Group, which along
with TCI became part of AT&AMP;T last month. But Liberty retains a
separate market presence, traded on the New York Stock Exchange as
a tracking stock of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of a deal announced Tuesday, Liberty is acquiring
51.8 million shares of the News Corp. in exchange for its
half-interest in Fox/Liberty Sports, which owns regional sports
cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   In a second transaction, it is paying $700 million for 28.1
million shares of the News Corp. from MCI Worldcom, which is
disposing of its entire 5 percent stake in the company. Of MCI's
remaining 28.1 million News shares, Saudi Prince Al Waleed Bin
Talal will buy 8 million, raising his total to about 2 percent of
the company; the News Corp. will buy back the rest.
</P>
<P>
   After that stock buyback is completed, Liberty will own 8
percent of the 991 million shares outstanding, including voting and
nonvoting stock, in the News Corp. _ a stake second only to the
Murdoch family.
</P>
<P>
   Though his position is reminiscent of Ted Turner's in Time
Warner Inc. after Turner sold Turner Broadcasting, Malone appears
to be taking a hands-off approach to dealing with the News Corp..
</P>
<P>
   Liberty is not getting voting stock or a seat on the board.
Malone has also agreed to hold the block of stock acquired in the
sports deal for two years and the stock acquired from MCI for nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Malone is taking the risk of being a passive investor,
clearly he is confident in Rupert Murdoch,'' said John Tinker, an
analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. Investors have been
less convinced of Murdoch's direction, and the stock has lagged in
recent years after Murdoch's acquisitions brought his
family-controlled company to the brink of financial disaster in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, though, has a strong record. His previous success
stories include a 10 percent stake in Time Warner, whose stock is
now trading at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   And his latest moves have already paid off for Liberty. The
company is paying $24.75 a share for the MCI stake and, for its
Fox/Liberty transaction, Liberty gains $1.43 billion in News Corp.
stock at $27.51 a share. With the stock now at $34, each deal
represents a tidy paper gain.
</P>
<P>
   Malone could easily increase his News Corp. stake as well.
Liberty has $5.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet and the
ability to borrow easily. But his strategy has been to take
minority positions in companies and leave the operations to
existing management.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, the News Corp. seems to be paying
serious attention to bolstering its stock price. Its executives
have made themselves more accessible to reporters and analysts, and
it has added public relations executives to explain its strategy
better to institutional shareholders and the public.
</P>
<P>
   The News Corp., though, does not do things any more simply than
Malone does. It is buying 50 percent of Fox/Liberty Networks and
then swapping that stake for stock in Fox Entertainment, its
programming arm, which owns the other 50 percent of Fox/Liberty.
About 20 percent of Fox Entertainment was offered to the public in
an initial offering of stock in November.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Entertainment, thus, will own all of Fox/Liberty, making it
possible to fully include the profits from that operation on its
income statement. The move will ever so slightly streamline the
corporation's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Executives also sought Tuesday to allay investors' concerns
about Murdoch's spending habits. Chase Carey, co-chief operating
officer of the News Corp., for example, said that Fox would not
acquire any more professional sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves investors to fret about Murdoch's desire to create a
a company that could deliver sports, entertainment, news and
children's programming by satellite across Europe. Murdoch has gone
so far as to discuss combining his B Sky B operations with Canal
Plus of France to build an expanded European presence. ``That could
get expensive because Europe is so complicated,'' Tinker of
Nationsbanc Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street prefers to see the News Corp. taking on a more
conservative posture. `` Murdoch seems to have slowed down a bit of
late,'' said Jeffrey Jones, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. ``Right now they are in less of a shopping mode and more
of an operating mode.''

ADMINISTRATION ASKS RUSSIA TO ACT AS DIPLOMATIC GO-BETWEEN IN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has approached Moscow to
serve as a go-between with Slobodan Milosevic in a new attempt to
find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore called Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov by
telephone on Tuesday, asking Russia's help in getting the Yugoslav
leader to take steps that would lead to a resumption of
negotiations, Gore's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's contacts with Russia were reported as the administration
continued to explore other strategies to resolve the conflict. One
plan under consideration would be for NATO troops to usher ethnic
Albanian refugees back into Kosovo once air attacks have
neutralized Serbian forces, NATO officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   Descriptions of the 40-minute conversation between the two
officials contrasted sharply to the dismissive attitude the
administration displayed toward Primakov's diplomatic mission in
Belgrade last week near the beginning of the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore's office did not disclose Primakov's response, an
aide to the vice president said the two talked about ``how we might
cooperate to urge Milosevic to take steps to end the conflict.''
The vice president made ``the point there is a diplomatic track and
we'd prefer diplomacy to bombing,'' the aide added.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Russians as a bridge to the Serbian president would
mean that the administration could avoid the embarrassment of
dealing face to face with Milosevic, whom some have painted as the
incarnation of evil responsible for the forced removals of hundreds
of thousands of ethnic Albanians. And Milosevic, in turn, has told
officials in Europe that he was not willing to deal directly with
the United States at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials said that actively involving the
Russians would help insure that Moscow, which has vehemently
opposed the NATO bombing, not become seriously alienated from the
United States in the longer term.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the Russians would be asked to
push Milosevic to accept the four points that the NATO allies
outlined last weekend. These are: the withdrawal of Serb forces
from Kosovo, the return of refugees, the presence of an
international security force and self government for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Russians obtained the agreement, that would be good for
the Russians,'' a senior administration official said. ``And it
would be good for us because we don't have to meet with
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing these four points, administration officials have
talked of an ``international security force,'' a more palatable
phrase for the Russians, and Milosevic, than the earlier term
``NATO-led'' peacekeeping force. But it would in fact be commanded
by NATO and intended to protect the returning refugees,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have indicated that they now favor
making Kosovo an international protectorate, which would allow the
ethnic Albanians to return. For the moment, officials are rejecting
the idea of a partitioning of Kosovo, with the Serbs being allowed
to keep a northern portion of the province and the remaining
territory given to the ethnic Albanians. This restructuring, they
argue, would reward Milosevic for his strategy of routing the
Albanians and allow him to keep a Serb-dominated section of the
province.
</P>
<P>
   After a speech on Tuesday at the Brookings Institution here,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that the administration
was insisting that there be a ``permissive environment'' for the
international force.
</P>
<P>
   She reiterated that the administration had ``no plans or
intentions for ground forces in a non-permissive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``signed agreement'' was the best sign that there would be a
permissive environment, she said. But she added: ``There has to be
some way to know that it is a permissive environment; so that there
has to be acceptance of the fact that there will not be Serb forces
that will attack the populations or the forces that would go in in
such an environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The first round of diplomatic meetings on Kosovo since the NATO
strikes began will open in Brussels on Wednesday, with meetings of
the representatives of the six-nation Contact Group that includes
Russia, the United States and four NATO allies. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbot was scheduled to attend, the State Department
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians had dropped their demand for a cessation in NATO
bombing before attending such a meeting, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is expected to attend a meeting of the foreign
ministers of the NATO allies in Brussels next Monday. If the
Contact Group meeting in Brussels goes well, it is possible that a
meeting of the group's foreign ministers will convene as well next
week. But for that to happen, a Western diplomat said, the Russians
would have to agree to the four principals laid down by NATO.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   How to deal with Milosevic for a solution to the conflict has
become a sore point for the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress have said that Milosevic should be
declared a war criminal and be dealt with only from the dock at the
International Court for War Crimes in the Hague. A supporter of the
administration's policy, former Sen. Bob Dole, said earlier this
week that Milosevic should be treated as a ``suspect'' and taken to
the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   At the mid-levels of the administration, especially among those
who worked on Balkan issues during the war in Bosnia, there is also
strong opposition to negotiating with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   As the administration works on a diplomatic strategy, which is
being spearheaded by James Steinberg, the deputy national security
adviser, officials have tried to walk a public line between
painting Milosevic as the perpetrator of the forced expulsions but
not going so far as to accuse his forces of committing acts of
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, has stopped just
short of using the word ``genocide,'' saying instead that there
were ``indicators of genocide'' by Milosevic's forces in Kosovo.
Pressed last weekend on whether Milosevic was a war criminal,
Albright said that was a definition that had to be determined after
a trial at the War Crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, one of the officials working on the
diplomatic strategy said that the administration had not ruled out
dealing with Milosevic in person. ``We dealt with Stalin for years
and years,'' the official said. ``We deal with the North Koreans.''

 &HT;    Everglades promised restorationj from Washington
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Sixty-three years after Marjory Stoneman
Douglas proclaimed that the Everglades was in its ``11th hour,''
Florida's precious marsh will finally see relief _ in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   That's the promise from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which
goes public today with an accelerated version of its $7.8 billion
Everglades restoration plan.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: Washington, where Congress is scheduled to receive it
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Like the draft that Vice President Al Gore unveiled in October,
the plan calls for an overhaul of South Florida's 1,600-mile-long
drainage system to undo decades of damage. It would demolish
levees, fill canals and turn more than 200,000 acres of undeveloped
land into reservoirs, filter marshes and well fields, storing
hundreds of billions of gallons of water for the Everglades, farms
and cities.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag _ to be split by Florida and the feds _ also is
about the same as Gore's draft.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal's latest version tries to answer criticism from
environmentalists and scientists, who said the original plan would
move too slowly and give too little water to Everglades National
Park. The new plan would finish crucial projects years ahead of the
old schedule, especially in creating reservoirs to replenish
long-parched stretches of the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas' classic 1947 book The Everglades: River of Grass
popularized awareness of the region's problems, including the
damage wreaked by what she called an ``inadequate and confusing''
drainage system. But the corps' efforts to solve that problem after
World War II only hastened the Everglades' decline, including the
dwindling of bird colonies that once numbered in the hundreds of
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal would do enough by 2010 to stop that downward
slide and allow a long healing to begin, corps engineer Richard
Punnett said.
</P>
<P>
   The corps would finish almost all the work by 2020, except for
two large Miami-Dade County reservoirs set for completion in 2036.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would cost as much as $460 million each year, up from
$400 million in the draft proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it really sets up an opportunity to find a way to
restore the Everglades,'' said Richard Ring, superintendent of
Everglades National Park, whose scientists had issued a scathing
critique of the old proposal. ``It's certainly a lot better than
the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plan still faces skepticism from some environmentalists,
who said the reservoirs wouldn't take over enough Glades sugar cane
land to restore the natural flow of the water. Some said they'll
press for limits on residents' and farmers' water use, the removal
of more levees, and guarantees that the corps will clean polluted
water .
</P>
<P>
   ``They are sort of stepping in the right direction,'' said
Shannon Estenoz of the World Wildlife Fund. ``As far as we're
concerned, we have several weeks to continue to work on this
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rod Tirrell of the Sierra Club said it has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've improved a poor plan a little bit,'' said Tirrell,
speaking for the club's Florida chapter but not its national
organization. ``We don't see restoration in the cards. We see a
water supply plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Corps restoration chief Stu Appelbaum said saving the Everglades
requires a larger water supply for the region's residents _
projected to nearly double to 12 million by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to set up a competition in the future where the
Everglades gets shortchanged again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions about the plan include:
</P>
<P>
   Technology: The plan relies on more than 300 storage wells to
trap billions of gallons of water, a method untested on such a huge
scale.
</P>
<P>
   Money: Nobody knows what mix of state and local taxes and fees
would pay for Florida's $3.9 billion share. South Florida water
managers say they could face a $2.5 billion deficit by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Control: Legislators are proposing a bill to give the state a
greater say in the project's details. But environmentalists say the
bill could create state-federal turf battles, increase costs and
make the Everglades wait in line for water behind cities and
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   How to get the plan
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is making the 4,000-page final
version of its Everglades restoration plan available in the
following ways. All are free:
</P>
<P>
   1) On the Internet at www.restudy.org
</P>
<P>
   2) By phone at (904) 232-3332 _ You can order the entire report
and all appendixes on two CD-ROMs. Or you can get a printed version
of the 600-page main report.

THE NEW BERLIN: VOICES IN THE ARTS WORLD SPEAK ON THE FUTURE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Cote, editor of Zitty, a biweekly guide to cultural events
in Berlin, asked some residents who work in the arts their opinions
of the city's future as a cultural capital. Here is a sampling of
their opinions:
</P>
<P>
   THOMAS OSTERMEIER
</P>
<P>
   Theater Director
</P>
<P>
   I think, yes, Berlin will become the cultural capital of
Germany. The question is what you believe culture to be, though.
</P>
<P>
   West Berlin was unique for a while _ an island city, no military
conscription, a big university, lots of independent theater, a
dream of an alternative life style come true. All this got a second
wind with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Squatted houses, this time
in East Berlin; a new, impulsive music scene. Theater was also part
of it.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible to see a city emerging that was being created
out of itself. But the official cultural policy today is more
directed at drawing big names into the city. Through this so-called
lighthouse principle, a kind of showcase culture is supposed to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   In the theater business there is on the one hand a spreading
hysteria, and on the other a certain overestimation of the value of
what it might mean to produce works here. A number of theater
people believe you've got to be here because what took place here
in the 1920s _ when playing Berlin was the goal of every provincial
actor or director _ is being brought back to life.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is similar now. Policy makers are trying to create
an image of Berlin as the center of German theatrical life.
</P>
<P>
   ANATOL GOTFRYD
</P>
<P>
   Art Collector
</P>
<P>
   I'm afraid Berlin's cultural scene won't amount to much as long
as we don't have a daily newspaper with an arts section that is
influential across the nation. This has always been a problem in
postwar Berlin. Richter and Beuys first exhibited here, Baselitz
and Luepertz lived here, but each had to go elsewhere to become
famous. Culture will not function in a city without influential
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Another point is the presence of institutions that promote
culture, and most of those in Berlin have either disappeared or had
their budgets reduced drastically. There was a microclimate of
culture in West Berlin as long as there were subsidies. As a result
of political lack of interest today, Berlin's culture is in a state
of disintegration. It must be reorganized.
</P>
<P>
   You notice it most in the theater, where there have been
closings. But the real problem is that there's no real vision any
more. In the '60s and '70s, there was upheaval straight across the
board in the arts because there was a vision. And Berlin, West
Berlin, played a role; impulses originated here. But today, what
kind of vision can you expect from sponsors like the Deutsche Bank?
</P>
<P>
   VOLKER DIEHL
</P>
<P>
   Gallery Owner
</P>
<P>
   There are few places in the world where so much is happening on
the social and cultural fronts in such a short period as in Berlin.
The problem for the future is that the whole idea of location is
not so important as it was 30, 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, you couldn't fly to anywhere in the world within
a few hours for a few hundred dollars. In those days, the location,
whether it was New York or Paris, really was important. This is a
danger because many people today won't decide for Berlin, saying
location makes less difference.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem is that development intervals have become so
short, so tight, that if a place hasn't evolved as expected in
three or four years, people lose patience. There were a lot of
investors with cultural interests in Berlin at the start of the
1990s. They looked around for a while, then said: ``This is taking
too much time. The politicians and bureaucracy are slow-moving; we
can't make money; I'll invest somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Today we hardly give a city a chance to develop. From the
formation of the German Reich in the 1870s until the 1920s, we had
five decades to develop into a central, world-class metropolis. The
location issue and the compressed time factor are real burdens for
the city's future cultural development, and I don't know what can
be done to counteract them.
</P>
<P>
   MIRKO HEINEMANN
</P>
<P>
   Rock musician
</P>
<P>
   Berlin is on the way to becoming a cultural capital. There are
signs on the horizon. At the moment, the city is still off the
beaten track in the pop and rock music scene. We're in the east,
far from the music centers of London, Paris and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The big record companies never paid a lot of attention to
Berlin, though that's changing. Columbia Records is planning on
moving here from Frankfurt in September or October. The Sony Corp.
is moving its European headquarters here. These are signs that the
music industry will be placing more importance on Berlin. Virgin is
expanding its presence here. Columbia is searching for talent
scouts. So it's clear the big companies are looking more closely at
the local music scene.
</P>
<P>
   A network of artists is just emerging from the underground and
beginning to earn a bit of money. Booking agencies are also
becoming more important. Earlier they were located in Frankfurt or
Stuttgart or even smaller cities. Now they're moving here or
working with local agencies, who are very busy at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   When the infrastructure is set up, it will draw talent. I
already know of musicians from Hamburg, Cologne and Munich who are
all moving to Berlin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   SASHA WALTZ
</P>
<P>
   Choreographer
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, the audiences are curious, and they are quite open
for unknown performances and artists, so there is a lot of
diversity on the cultural scene. But in other respects the city has
changed a lot since I came here in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   I had a grant and was looking for space, for opportunities to
make things happen. There was plenty of open space in the eastern
part of the city, in Mitte. I had my first studio in the Hackesche
Hof. A lot of artists from different countries were attracted there
too; they could feel the energy. Then we all had to move out. The
investors came in and tore the place apart, and now there is a huge
new complex there.
</P>
<P>
   We're hoping the Sopiensaele, the space where I work now, will
survive. The danger is that money is being redirected to bigger
cultural projects. But when everything is too tightly organized,
when funds are already apportioned in advance, it is very difficult
to give a chance for something new. A city needs a free pool of
artists and opportunities for the arts to take root and grow.
</P>
<P>
   I'm often referred to as a ``young, up-and-coming talent'' but
I'm established now. There has to be something left over for
artists who really are at the beginnings of their careers and need
support.
</P>
<P>
   HANS-JOACHIM NEUMANN
</P>
<P>
   Film Critic
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of everything in Berlin _ plenty on the stage,
lots of film, lots of literature. Quantitatively, there is much,
but in terms of the quality that radiates out of Berlin, it is
less. Compared with what was going on here in the first third of
this century anyway, much less. Quantity is always confused with
quality here.
</P>
<P>
   There is no real metropolitan spirit in Berlin. In Paris, New
York and London there are narrow-minded, dimwitted people, but
there are also business elites, artistic elites, technical elites.
We don't have any of these people in Berlin. They have been
eliminated in steps. It started with the immigration in 1933, then
the murder of the Jews, and continued with the expulsion of the
merchant class after 1945 in the East, and the exodus out of West
Berlin after the wall went up in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's heyday as a cultural capital cannot be reconstructed so
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA BLICKENSDORFF
</P>
<P>
   Gallery Owner
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is living under the impression that the outlook is very
good, that something is happening, developing. But at the moment,
it's more like marching through deep sand. You have to work
incredibly hard to get anything organized.
</P>
<P>
   For visual arts, Berlin is truly tough going. We're missing a
broad, deep layer of private collectors. Sure, there are good
collectors and also highly cultivated people here, but far fewer
than in other places like Cologne or Frankfurt or Duesseldorf.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, people like to look at art; they are interested in
artistic innovation. But buying is not necessarily the next logical
step. So as a gallery owner you have it much harder here than
elsewhere in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, it is more exciting. There is all this
creative potential just flowing into the city. A lot is taking
place here, but only because of the extra-ordinary efforts of
people behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   YOTTA KIPPE
</P>
<P>
   Art Student
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure Berlin will gain in importance as far as the arts
go. There is a lot going on, but the big things are somehow always
subsidized, like the Berlin biennial for contemporary art. You can
always do something with this kind of money, but it's not the same
as money from private individuals, from collectors.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, it's harder to make a living here as an artist
than in other European cities. There is just not a collecting
consciousness. Even established artists here depend on their
professorships for income. Baselitz insists that he gets more for
his teaching assignments. I also work in Brussels, and there,
people are truly interested in collecting. At every opening there
you always see a few red dots on the titles of sold works, which is
not the case in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is difficult for artists here in general, I'm not
pessimistic. There is too much going on that is really positive.
There are plenty of initiatives that are not motivated purely by
profit, so we still have lots of idealistic galleries.
</P>
<P>
   JANE GARBER
</P>
<P>
   Fashion Designer
</P>
<P>
   Berlin is definitely developing into a cultural capital. I can't
say much about the situation earlier in West Berlin; I can only
judge from the perspective of East Berlin's former underground
scene. And what's happening now is a further development of what we
were doing then. Lots of people that I know from those days are
still working, but under different conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, life has become more diverse in many respects, but it was
also diverse back then. In comparison with Paris, I'd say Berlin
has lots more diversity in its arts and cultural life. I find Paris
much more conservative, stuck in a rut in a way. Maybe it's because
here you had these two cities that suddenly came together, and in
the process a clash of two fundamentally different cultures. The
result wasn't a unified German culture that could easily be
interpreted. Instead, you had two that complemented and advanced
each other.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is on the club scene; after all, that's culture,
too. You won't find anything comparable in Paris.

N.Y. POLICE WILL GET WALLET-SIZED REMINDERS TO SAY `PLEASE' AND
`THANK YOU' 
</HEADLINE>
  (ac) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They have been praised as brave and effective, or
condemned as belligerent and brutal. But no one has ever portrayed
New York's police officers as urban Andy Griffiths, aw-shucksing
and ``Mornin' Ma'am-ing'' their way through the mean streets.
</P>
<P>
   But now Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is trying to give the city's
nearly 40,000 police officers a lesson in good manners. He
announced Tuesday that he , was distributing cards to officers
instructing them to be just a little more polite in their dealings
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   The wallet-size cards recommend that officers ``use terms such
as `Mr.,' `Ms.,' `Sir' or Ma'am.''' Teen-agers should be referred
to as ``young lady or young man.'' The cards tell officers to say
``hello'' and ``thank you,'' and urge them to ``Respect each
individual, his or her cultural identity, customs and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The genteel approach is the latest in a series of initiatives by
the mayor to repair frayed relations stemming from the Feb. 4
slaying of Amadou Diallo. The unarmed immigrant was shot 19 times
by four police officers, who fired a total of 41 bullets at him.
His death prompted protests that resulted in the arrests of more
than 1,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city where gruffness is a basic characteristic of urban
discourse the plan drew a markedly unenthusiastic response from
officers on the beat on Tuesday. And some officers insisted that,
contrary to reputation, they didn't need help being nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to believe that a cop is going to have to pull
out a palm card to remember to say hello and thank you,'' said
Police Officer Vincent Martinelli, a union delegate at the 108th
Precinct in Long Island City, Queens. ``I think it's ridiculous.
With your growth as a police officer, as a professional doing a
professional job, courtesy and honesty and politeness should come
naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan did earn polite praise from Letitia Baldrige, the
etiquette expert. ``Anything that is attempted is for the good,''
she said. ``Any attempt by the mayor to make things better, even if
it doesn't work, is terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the plan at Police Headquarters, Giuliani stressed
that politeness was a two-way street, that citizens could benefit
from being a little nicer to officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to ask the people of the city to be more
respectful in dealing with the Police Department,'' he said. ``So
that people refer to police officers as `officer,' not by their
last name, not by some derogatory term. Try to figure out what all
those things on a police officer's arm and shoulder mean _ a
sergeant, a lieutenant, a captain, an inspector _ and refer to the
person as sergeant, captain and inspector. They're entitled to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But to some, the cards seemed to be a superficial fix to the
deeper questions about the police that have arisen since the
slaying of Diallo. The four officers who shot at him have been
charged with second-degree murder in the case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan Borough president, complained
that the new politeness campaign ignores the deeper problems on the
force. She cited the cases of several people who died or were
injured in encounters with the police, saying the plan ``doesn't
begin to get to the heart of the matter, which is how do we prevent
tragedies like the choke-hold death of Anthony Baez, the torture of
Abner Louima or the shooting death of Amadou Diallo.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fields said that she thinks the department should focus on
more substantial changes, such as better training, recruitment of
more minority officers, a requirement that officers live in the
city, and changes to improve investigations of police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But Police Commissioner Howard Safir insisted yesterday that the
campaign marked an important step in changing the nature of
interactions between the police and the public.
</P>
<P>
   And Safir said that he plans to dispatch a team of undercover
police officers _ a kind of politeness police _ to make sure that
their colleagues remember to use honorific titles and do not forget
to say thank you. He said that those who do well would be
commended, and those who do not would face disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   James Savage, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, raised questions about the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm really concerned about is the way they're treated _
not by the public, so much, but by their ranking officers,'' he
said. ``They are under constant pressure to get more and more
numbers, more summonses. Even though the crime rates are down they
have to maintain the same level of activity. There is very little
respect shown to police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is an outgrowth of Commissioner Safir's Courtesy,
Professionalism and Respect campaign _ known by its initials, CPR _
that he announced in 1996 as his program to improve relations
between the police and the community.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to printing palm cards for each police officer as
well as a larger version to go into their memo books, the Police
Department is putting out a 24-page booklet about CPR and a
brochure to be distributed to the public at station houses called,
``Your Rights and Responsibilities When Interacting with the
Police.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the new campaign, Dennis Walcott, the president of
the New York Urban League and a co-chairman of the CPR advisory
board, drew an analogy to the Police Department's broken windows
theory _ that cracking down on small crimes and misdemeanors helps
prevent larger crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the broken windows theory as far as officers are
concerned as well,'' said Walcott, who noted that he had been
stopped by the police himself on occasion. ``The little things can
add up to bigger things.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani appeared to anticipate a negative reaction to the plan
even as he announced it. ``I know there are going to be people who
are cynical about this,'' he said. ``I've been mayor of New York
City for too long not to realize that people will be cynical about
any good step that's made in the direction of decency.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that he was reminded of the civility campaign he
announced last year in an effort to get all New Yorkers to be nicer
to one another. While that campaign was roundly ridiculed, he said,
he considers it successful. He noted that he has been stopped
several times recently by people telling him how nice New Yorkers
have become.
</P>
<P>
   While some critics have called the initiative superficial,
others worried about more far-ranging effects. A senior police
official who supports the plan, for instance, asked, ``What are
they going to do on `NYPD Blue' if this works?''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House said Tuesday that it had selected
the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba as a temporary
home for 20,000 refugees from Kosovo, despite warnings from some
refugee groups that the base will be more like a prison than the
``safe haven'' described by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Navy logistics officers set to work to prepare a tent city at
the base for the first of the ethnic Albanian refugees, who are
expected to be flown there from the Balkans later this week aboard
chartered commercial jets.
</P>
<P>
   The remote, sun-drenched base, which is a legacy of the
Spanish-American War and was leased to the United States in
perpetuity at the turn of the century, has been used repeatedly
over the last decade to house Cubans and Haitians attempting to
flee their countries.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that the base
would serve as ``a safe haven to receive up to 20,000 Kosovar
refugees,'' part of a larger NATO-led effort to evacuate more than
100,000 ethnic Albanians from the turmoil along Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that their relocation to Cuba would last only a
matter of weeks or months and that the refugees were ``fully
expected'' to return home. ``This facility will be temporary, and
we fully intend the Kosovars will ultimately return to their
homes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said Guantanamo Bay was chosen
over other sites, including an Air Force base on the American
island territory of Guam in the western Pacific, because commanders
of the naval base had recent experience in handling tens of
thousands of refugees at once.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, speaking on condition that they not be
identified, acknowledged that the base was selected also to
eliminate the possibility that some of the refugees might be able
to claim political asylum in the United States. Under federal
immigration law, refugees can claim asylum only once they reach
American soil.
</P>
<P>
   Several relief organizations in the United States said they had
no immediate complaint with the administration's decision to place
the Kosovo refugees at Guantanamo Bay, which is hundreds of miles
from the American mainland.
</P>
<P>
   They said that it may be appropriate for now to house the
refugees outside the borders of the United States, if only to
demonstrate to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia that the
relocation is temporary and that his campaign of ``ethnic
cleansing'' in Kosovo will not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Guantanamo Bay a nice place? No,'' said Bill Frelick,
senior policy analyst at the U.S. Committee for Refugees, in
Washington. ``When I've been there, it's looked like a POW camp.
But everything's relative.''
</P>
<P>
   One refugee advocate who has visited Guantanamo Bay, Cheryl
Little of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center in Miami, said she
was ``appalled'' at the thought that Kosovo refugees might be
forced to live in the sort of tent city that housed tens of
thousands of Cuban and Haitian boat people at the base earlier in
the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given everything these folks have been through in Kosovo, I
don't think we should be stashing them out of sight at a military
base where they are far removed from any viable support system,''
she said. ``It's very bleak. When I was there, there was concertina
wire. It's like a jail. It's so unsuitable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While they will be escaping the horrors of the crisis in the
Balkans, the Kosovo refugees will doubtless find the transition to
Guantanamo Bay jarring, in terms both of culture and climate.
</P>
<P>
   The tropical heat can be merciless on the 34-square-mile base,
especially during the summer months, and Cubans and Haitians who
lived in the tent cities earlier in the decade complained
constantly about sanitation, medical care, food and boredom.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government, which has refused since 1960 to accept
payments for the base under a lease signed in 1903, protested the
decision to move the Kosovo refugees to Guantanamo Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American aggressors in Yugoslavia have no right to bring
these people to Cuba,'' Raul Taladrid, Cuba's deputy minister of
foreign investment, told reporters in Havana. ``The refugee problem
is a European problem.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50,000 Cuban and Haitian refugees passed through the camp
earlier in the decade, at a cost to the United States of $250
million. Most of the Haitians housed there between 1991 and 1994
were shipped home when relative stability returned to their
homeland. Nearly all the Cubans housed there from 1994 through 1996
ended up in the United States.

OPENING DAY'S DANGER OF OVERREACTION FULFILLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was baseball's Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   I was ebullient that it again was here. I am an American. I love
Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation, I reread all the George Will books. I memorized
six pages of Bart Giamatti poems. I rented ``Field of Dreams'' and
re-cried.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball still has a unique hold on America, and no day of the
baseball season has a tighter grip on America's heartstrings than
Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   We rise for the national anthem. We applaud for the player
introductions.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever happens after that, we are baseball fans _ we
overreact.
</P>
<P>
   Dateline, Pittsburgh, first inning _ Rookie second baseman
Warren Morris, formerly of the Rangers, grounds into a double play
in his first big-league at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Overreaction reaction: Told you that Esteban Loaiza trade was a
good deal.
</P>
<P>
   Dateline, Baltimore _ Cal Ripken Jr. leaves the game in the
third inning with a stiff back.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: Slacker.
</P>
<P>
   Dateline, Kansas City _ Newest Red Sox Jose Offerman goes
4-for-5 in his Boston debut.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: Mo Vaughn, with half the calories.
</P>
<P>
   Dateline, The Ballpark in Arlington _ Rick Helling throws the
first pitch of the Rangers' season to Detroit's Juan Encarnacion.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: Johnny Oates must go.
</P>
<P>
   We are baseball fans. We watch Opening Day and we scan the
outfield flags for ill winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Curt Schilling _ can I help you?'' the voice on the
other end of the phone said.
</P>
<P>
   The voice was Doug Melvin's. The Rangers general manager was
reacting, tongue in cheekly, to the alleged crisis of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The typical Rangers fan, Melvin knows, woke up yesterday morning
wondering why the home team hadn't consummated an immediate trade
for Schilling, John Smoltz or Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   Dateline, St. Louis _ Third baseman Fernando Tatis, formerly of
the Rangers, homers for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: Rangers will rue the day they traded young Tatis away.
</P>
<P>
   Dateline, Los Angeles _ Kevin Brown, the $105 million man,
cuffed around and knocked out in the sixth inning of first Dodgers
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: Worst Fox decision since ``America's Funniest Police
Chases.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin spent the day on the phone yesterday, but in a bit of a
local surprise, he wasn't trying to reach Red Adair. Melvin had
read the Opening Day box scores and noticed something.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, Jeff Fassero, six innings, eight hits, six runs, lost
8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, Tom Glavine, six-plus innings, seven hits, five runs,
lost 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, Roger Clemens, six-plus innings, five walks, lost 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Seven home teams lost Monday on Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose that's seven clubs out of the pennant race,'' Melvin
observed dryly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of overreaction to Opening Day,'' he conceded.
``And you see the same thing sometimes at the trading deadline.
When a club gets somebody, every team thinks that it just traded
for the pennant.''
</P>
<P>
   Dateline, The Ballpark in Arlington _ Tigers' Brian Moehler
takes no-hit bid into seventh inning against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: Why couldn't Melvin have traded for Albert Belle?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rick Helling is going to battle back just fine from
Monday's game,'' Melvin offered. ``I look at Rick and see a guy who
was 4-0 and the American League's pitcher of the month last
September, and I see a guy who was 7-1 in his last 11 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'd say that those games were a lot bigger than any
Opening Day games.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction, however, to Helling's stunning first pitch and to
the six runs that followed is typical of what happens on Opening
Day. Melvin awoke yesterday to hear fans arguing that Helling was
ill-equipped to start a season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Dateline, Oakland _ Gil Heredia outduels Clemens and Athletics
beat Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: ``I guess I shouldn't have gotten rid of Gil
Heredia,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   He was kidding. Of course. But that's baseball. It takes a sense
of humor to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Dateline, St. Louis _ Mark McGwire homers to launch new assault
on home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: I hope the Maris family now has an unlisted number.
</P>
<P>
   Dateline, Pittsburgh, ninth inning _ Warren Morris, formerly of
the Rangers, doubles off the outfield wall.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: Told you that Loaiza trade stunk.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin woke yesterday morning to discover that the sun, indeed,
had come up. A quick check of the newspaper confirmed another rumor
_ that the Rangers had 161 more games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys will get over this,'' he said of the Opening Day
debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: Easy for Melvin to say. He's a Canadian.

A CHINA TRADE DEAL IS NOW UP TO CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHINA-U.S.) 
 (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With 24 hours remaining before the arrival of
China's prime minister, President Clinton struggled Tuesday night
to decide whether to strike the broadest trade agreement in
Chinese-American history, in return for American agreement to usher
China into the World Trade Organization. But his top advisers were
deeply split about whether to take the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In two days of furious negotiating here preceding Prime Minister
Zhu Rongji's arrival on Wednesday night, American officials have
been locked up with China's trade minister, Long Yongtu, in an
effort to resolve a wide variety of outstanding differences.
President Clinton had several conversations Tuesday about his
bottom-line positions with his trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky, but administration officials said he might try to
resolve the last issues directly with Zhu in their meetings on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they had already concluded accords on a series of
contentious issues involving agriculture, including a Chinese
agreement to allow in American wheat that China previously insisted
was tainted with disease. Rather than barring the wheat altogether,
China agreed to a tolerance level that will permit most of the
American-grown wheat into the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides were still negotiating how large a stake
American companies will be allowed to take in Chinese
telecommunications companies. China has already said it is willing
to sell 30 percent stakes in these companies to foreigners, but
will not permit them to take controlling interests.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday afternoon, both sides were arguing over how much
liberty American banks and brokerage firms would have to operate
throughout China. At the same time, American officials have raised
new issues, including a demand that the United States extend quotas
limiting the import of Chinese-made textiles until 2010, an effort
to win over some members of Congress whose constituencies are bound
to be aroused by any deal. The Chinese have protested the effort,
and _ perhaps in a last-minute negotiating ploy _ appeared to back
off Tuesday on some offers to open the market in the financial
sector and on tariff reductions for some American-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   While negotiators argue over the details, though, Clinton
appears focused on the strategic significance of a deal _ helping
to integrate China into both the global economy and a global set of
legal regulations governing trade. Clinton is also intent on
helping strengthen the authority of Zhu, whom he sees as an
accomplished economic reformer and Washington's best hope of
opening a true channel of communication with the Chinese
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu, under pressure at home, cannot be seen to be giving in
too much to American pressure, especially at the cost of Chinese
jobs. And Clinton, as one of his advisers put it Tuesday, ``is
facing the likelihood of another Nafta fight in Congress'' _ a
reference to the vote in which Clinton defied his own party to push
through the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had a direct vote on the wisdom of Nafta, and most
Democrats opposed it, saying that it would move jobs to Mexico. The
China argument, though, is far more complex. Congress does not have
a direct voice in whether the administration casts its vote to get
China into the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules of
trade and arbitrates disputes. But China's entry would require
congressional action to amend the law that creates an annual
congressional review of China's trading rights, which inevitably
becomes enmeshed in China's human rights record, its stand-off with
Taiwan and now its alleged espionage efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials who have sat in meetings on the negotiations say the
president is leaning strongly toward striking a deal. But the head
of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling, has argued that
anything short of a perfect deal _ and there is no such thing in
trade negotiations _ would undercut the administration's efforts to
unify Democrats on Social Security, Medicare and other issues that
Clinton views as central to his legacy. He has received some
support from John Podesta, the White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night Sperling denied he was opposed to a deal, and
added, ``We're not raising the bar out of politics, but not
lowering the bar to get a deal during the trip, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The strongest advocate of a deal, National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger, has been almost entirely tied up managing the crisis
in Kosovo, the officials say, and that has cast some doubt about
how the final arguments will play out in the Oval Office. ``From
the start, Sandy has wanted this because he realizes it's the only
thing that we can get done with the Chinese before the end of this
administration,'' one White House official said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a case where the most important relationship we
have is getting a lot less attention at a critical moment than it
should because of the military action under way,'' the official
continued, ``and that raises the chances for miscalculation on our
end or the Chinese end.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the concessions the Chinese have made so far go
beyond the road map that American officials gave Beijing three
years ago, when negotiations over China's entry into the World
Trade Organization seemed stalled. For example, China has agreed to
limit its demand that American companies provide technology to
China in return for a right to invest there. The demands for
technology have been a major issue for American companies like
Boeing, which at times have refused to provide the Chinese with
proprietary technology at the cost of large deals.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton decides to sign a deal may depend on his
calculation about how strongly American businesses will support it.
Their willingness to lobby in Congress _ pointing out the benefits
to individual companies in individual congressional districts _ may
well determine the strength of congressional opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But how willing they will be to press the issue depends on what
they get from the deal, which will vary from industry to industry.
``Any deal that doesn't have the seal of approval of the business
community isn't a deal worth doing,'' Ms. Barshefsky said last
week.

 &HT;    Bill takes tough stand on messy protests
 &HT;    Compiled by Austin American-Statesman Staff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ An inmate caught hurling bodily secretions _
known as ``chunking'' _ at a prison official would be committing a
third-degree felony under legislation given preliminary approval by
the House on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill by Rep. Dan Ellis, D-Livingston, was passed by voice
vote and still needs final approval before being sent to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chunking just makes the worst possible kind of messes,'' Ellis
said. ``As of now it is a Class C misdemeanor and as so there is
little or no deterrent to this behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Chunking has become such a problem that guards often avoid
certain prison areas unless wearing a raincoat, Ellis said. If they
are exposed to the secretions, prison officials may have to have
medical treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gun bill doesn't shoot through
</P>
<P>
   When a bill is sent from the Senate to the House, it is said to
be ``finally'' passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   That phrase had extra meaning Tuesday when the Senate ``finally
passed'' a bill to keep cities, counties and other government
entities from suing gun and ammunition makers for the misuse of
their products without legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was debated four times on the Senate floor before
getting a 23-7 vote to send it to the House. The first two times
Senate Bill 717 was debated, there were not enough votes for it to
be officially considered. On the third try, and with changes to
allow the attorney general to sue without lawmakers' OK, the bill
got approval.
</P>
<P>
   Barrientos: It's not your day
</P>
<P>
   Though all Texans want state lawmakers to make them happy, Sen.
Gonzalo Barrientos spread a humorous, real-world message via a
handout Tuesday. ``I can only please one person per day. Today is
not your day, tomorrow doesn't look good either,'' the handout
said. It ended with a more pleasant note from the Austin Democrat:
``Have a wonderful day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmaker attempts shortcut
</P>
<P>
   The reality of time constraints hit home for Senate Republicans
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, asked fellow members to move
a bill from his technology subcommittee to the full Senate Economic
Development Committee. Why? Because Senate Bill 614 faces much
controversy and needs plenty of time to get through the House and
Senate, he said. Moving the bill to the Economic Development
Committee would speed things up by about a week. The session will
end May 31.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow juries to assess liability in civil
lawsuits to people not involved in the case, even if the people
claiming the damage cannot then sue the third party. Under current
law, juries must assign all of the liability in a case to the
defendants sued even if there is clear proof that another person
was partly to blame but cannot be found to be sued.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carlos Truan, D-Corpus Christi, warned that if Fraser were
allowed to move the bill without a subcommittee vote, other members
would ask to do the same thing when they didn't have committee
support for their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser withdrew his request after much objection. The bill will
be voted on in subcommittee this week and considered by the full
committee next week. Senate OKs interest on extra tax
</P>
<P>
   A bill to pay interest to Texas taxpayers when they overpay the
state cleared the Senate on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 1321 would require Comptroller Carole Keeton
Rylander to calculate interest on tax overpayments and give it to
the taxpayer. The interest would amount to the prime rate plus 1
percentage point. Because there is no personal income tax in Texas,
most of the tax money collected by the comptroller's office comes
from businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The state charges 12 percent interest when taxpayers are
delinquent.
</P>
<P>
   Senate OKs lottery reserve cut
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Tuesday to move $15 million from a lottery
reserve fund to the Foundation School Fund. The lottery currently
holds $20 million in reserve just in case a lottery retailer goes
bust and can't pay for tickets it has sold. Sen. Bill Ratliff,
R-Mount Pleasant, said experience has shown that $20 million is too
much. His Senate Bill 1320 would reduce the reserve to $5 million
and move the $15 million to a fund that helps support schools. It
now goes to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedrine bill advances
</P>
<P>
   It would be a crime to sell the much-abused asthma drug
ephedrine to minors without a prescription under a bill that got
preliminary Senate approval Tuesday. Doctors could prescribe the
drug, which has been marketed over the counter as a stimulant,
appetite suppressant and muscle enhancer.
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the day
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carlos Truan, D-Corpus Christi, a member of the Senate's
Special Committee on Border Affairs: ``I assume you didn't want me
to lay out all the bills and listen to my eloquent testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., D-Brownsville, chairman of the committee:
``You assume correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Coppell, on the House's relatively slow
pace this session: ``I just think this is a session where we have a
few specific things we need to do, and I don't think that any of us
feel compelled to do a lot more than those few things.''

CHINA'S PRIME MINISTER BEGINS U.S. VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-U.S.-TRADE, moved in `f' category) 
(sw) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, began his
visit to the United States on Tuesday, determined to defuse rising
tensions between the two countries with a business-like agenda,
trade concessions and an ample supply of good humor.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, who runs China's government day-to-day but ranks third in
the Communist Party hierarchy, is, at age 70, the sprightly star of
China's taciturn leadership team. This trip promises to test his
often-praised skill for communicating with the West as the goodwill
in U.S.-China relations, which was affirmed with President
Clinton's visit last year, has all but given way to restrained
hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu wasted no time setting the tone. Moments after stepping off
his plane, he jumped a security line to shake hands and exchange
pleasantries with reporters. In the process, he firmly pushed aside
one of his guards, a possibly calculated gesture of defiance to the
decorum Chinese leaders almost always observe during public
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's nine-day, six-city tour is slightly longer than a state
visit in 1997 by his boss, President Jiang Zemin, but far less
ceremonial. His plans include attending to down-to-the-wire
negotiations over the terms of China's entry into the World Trade
Organization. He has also scheduled numerous meetings with business
and banking leaders around the country and will seek to address
nearly every hot-button issue in bilateral relations, including
China's human-rights record, its environmental pollution, its huge
trade surplus with the United States, and charges that its agents
have pilfered American military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief stop in Los Angeles before diving into the
diplomatic deep end of his mission in Washington on Thursday, Zhu
met with civic leaders and representatives of the local
Chinese-American community, the largest in the country. He also had
a private audience with Michael Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney
Co. Eisner recently presided over a high-profile bidding war
between two Chinese cities, Hong Kong and Shanghai, to be the venue
for the next Asian Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Bone-chilling drizzle and scattered protests by people seeking
independence for Tibet and Taiwan marred Zhu's arrival. So did his
tardiness at a lunch at the Century Plaza Hotel, where civic and
business leaders waited more than an hour past the appointed time
for Zhu to take his place on the podium. But those setbacks did
nothing to shake the prime minister's upbeat message. In fact, he
used them as fodder for a stream of self-deprecating jokes that are
his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``God does not welcome me that much because it's raining today
and I know that it was very sunny here yesterday,'' he said,
beginning his luncheon remarks. Speaking in Chinese entirely
without notes and with scant trace of the boilerplate phrases about
friendship and warm relations that usually dominate Chinese
diplomatic statements, Zhu used much of his opening speech as an
apology for arriving late to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   He chided Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles and Gov. Gray
Davis of California, explaining that they must shoulder at least
``half the blame'' for his lack of punctuality. Both men had
arranged telephone calls with Zhu, but used that time to raise
weighty issues, he said. ``They asked so many questions and I could
not refuse to answer.`
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, he said, pressed him on China's gaping trade surplus
with the United States. China exported $57 billion more than it
imported from the United States last year, giving it the
second-largest trade surplus with the United States after Japan.
Zhu said he had originally prepared a speech on the issue for
delivery next week at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, Mass., but had no choice but to indulge Riordan's
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister then teased Davis for expanding the 10-minute
call into a 30-minute debate on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained that to do this properly we should start with
Rousseau and the human rights declaration of the United States,''
Zhu said to laughter. ``I spent a long time explaining my views.
But whether or not he is satisfied, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the continuing trade talks in Washington, Zhu
sounded optimistic that the two sides were close to a breakthrough
on China's application for entry into the World Trade Organization.
He said he had received ``good news'' from his top negotiator, Long
Yongtu, on progress on what he called the most important stumbling
block in the talks over dismantling China's ban on importing wheat
and citrus fruit from some parts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such banter will do much to soften the criticism of
China's policies heard from many members of Congress, religious
groups, labor unions and national security experts remains to be
seen. But Zhu seemed primed to disarm hostile audiences.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They have been praised as brave and effective, or
condemned as belligerent and brutal. But no one has ever portrayed
New York's police officers as urban Andy Griffiths, aw-shucksing
and ``Mornin' Ma'am-ing'' their way through the mean streets.
</P>
<P>
   But now Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is trying to give the city's
nearly 40,000 police officers a lesson in good manners. He
announced Tuesday that he , was distributing cards to officers
instructing them to be just a little more polite in their dealings
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   The wallet-size cards recommend that officers ``use terms such
as `Mr.,' `Ms.,' `Sir' or Ma'am.''' Teen-agers should be referred
to as ``young lady or young man.'' The cards tell officers to say
``hello'' and ``thank you,'' and urge them to ``Respect each
individual, his or her cultural identity, customs and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The genteel approach is the latest in a series of initiatives by
the mayor to repair frayed relations stemming from the Feb. 4
slaying of Amadou Diallo. The unarmed immigrant was shot 19 times
by four police officers, who fired a total of 41 bullets at him.
His death prompted protests that resulted in the arrests of more
than 1,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city where gruffness is a basic characteristic of urban
discourse the plan drew a markedly unenthusiastic response from
officers on the beat on Tuesday. And some officers insisted that,
contrary to reputation, they didn't need help being nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to believe that a cop is going to have to pull
out a palm card to remember to say hello and thank you,'' said
Police Officer Vincent Martinelli, a union delegate at the 108th
Precinct in Long Island City, Queens. ``I think it's ridiculous.
With your growth as a police officer, as a professional doing a
professional job, courtesy and honesty and politeness should come
naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan did earn polite praise from Letitia Baldrige, the
etiquette expert. ``Anything that is attempted is for the good,''
she said. ``Any attempt by the mayor to make things better, even if
it doesn't work, is terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the plan at Police Headquarters, Giuliani stressed
that politeness was a two-way street, that citizens could benefit
from being a little nicer to officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to ask the people of the city to be more
respectful in dealing with the Police Department,'' he said. ``So
that people refer to police officers as `officer,' not by their
last name, not by some derogatory term. Try to figure out what all
those things on a police officer's arm and shoulder mean _ a
sergeant, a lieutenant, a captain, an inspector _ and refer to the
person as sergeant, captain and inspector. They're entitled to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But to some, the cards seemed to be a superficial fix to the
deeper questions about the police that have arisen since the
slaying of Diallo. The four officers who shot at him have been
charged with second-degree murder in the case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan Borough president, complained
that the new politeness campaign ignores the deeper problems on the
force. She cited the cases of several people who died or were
injured in encounters with the police, saying the plan ``doesn't
begin to get to the heart of the matter, which is how do we prevent
tragedies like the choke-hold death of Anthony Baez, the torture of
Abner Louima or the shooting death of Amadou Diallo.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fields said that she thinks the department should focus on
more substantial changes, such as better training, recruitment of
more minority officers, a requirement that officers live in the
city, and changes to improve investigations of police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But Police Commissioner Howard Safir insisted yesterday that the
campaign marked an important step in changing the nature of
interactions between the police and the public.
</P>
<P>
   And Safir said that he plans to dispatch a team of undercover
police officers _ a kind of politeness police _ to make sure that
their colleagues remember to use honorific titles and do not forget
to say thank you. He said that those who do well would be
commended, and those who do not would face disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   James Savage, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, raised questions about the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm really concerned about is the way they're treated _
not by the public, so much, but by their ranking officers,'' he
said. ``They are under constant pressure to get more and more
numbers, more summonses. Even though the crime rates are down they
have to maintain the same level of activity. There is very little
respect shown to police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is an outgrowth of Commissioner Safir's Courtesy,
Professionalism and Respect campaign _ known by its initials, CPR _
that he announced in 1996 as his program to improve relations
between the police and the community.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to printing palm cards for each police officer as
well as a larger version to go into their memo books, the Police
Department is putting out a 24-page booklet about CPR and a
brochure to be distributed to the public at station houses called,
``Your Rights and Responsibilities When Interacting with the
Police.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the new campaign, Dennis Walcott, the president of
the New York Urban League and a co-chairman of the CPR advisory
board, drew an analogy to the Police Department's broken windows
theory _ that cracking down on small crimes and misdemeanors helps
prevent larger crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the broken windows theory as far as officers are
concerned as well,'' said Walcott, who noted that he had been
stopped by the police himself on occasion. ``The little things can
add up to bigger things.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani appeared to anticipate a negative reaction to the plan
even as he announced it. ``I know there are going to be people who
are cynical about this,'' he said. ``I've been mayor of New York
City for too long not to realize that people will be cynical about
any good step that's made in the direction of decency.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that he was reminded of the civility campaign he
announced last year in an effort to get all New Yorkers to be nicer
to one another. While that campaign was roundly ridiculed, he said,
he considers it successful. He noted that he has been stopped
several times recently by people telling him how nice New Yorkers
have become.
</P>
<P>
   While some critics have called the initiative superficial,
others worried about more far-ranging effects. A senior police
official who supports the plan, for instance, asked, ``What are
they going to do on `NYPD Blue' if this works?''

N.H. GOVERNOR TO ENDORSE BUSH PRESIDENTIAL RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg will throw his support behind
Texas Governor George W. Bush, sources say, ending the competition
for the most coveted prize in the state's GOP presidential
endorsement game.
</P>
<P>
   Besides receiving Gregg's backing, which may be made official as
early as Thursday, Bush is expected to win the help of Gregg's
chief of staff, Joel W. Maiola, to run his New Hampshire operation.
And Barbara Russell resigned her post as assistant chair of the
state Republican party Tuesday in order to back Bush. Russell is
expected to work with Maiola to organize the state for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg was unavailable for comment Tuesday, but he has said
previously that he would be intimately involved in whichever
campaign he decided to endorse. Most of the Republican candidates
for president have wooed Gregg with intensity, and at one point,
Gregg said he felt like a priest at a confessional, as each sought
his guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Within Republican circles, Gregg is known as ``the big dog,''
because he has a skilled field organization that he has tended to
assiduously over the course of his 20-year political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do people look to him, but a lot of people in the
state have worked for him in a campaign,'' said Will Abbott, who
was former President Bush's political director for the 1988 New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Despite attempts by other candidates to latch onto Gregg, his
decision to support Bush is not surprising. His ties to the Bush
family are longstanding and well known.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, when Gregg was a freshman congressman, he ran former
President Bush's New Hampshire field operation and his father,
former Governor Hugh Gregg, was the campaign chairman. Both Greggs
also supported the former president in 1988 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In another Republican camp, Lamar Alexander is moving his
political operation from Nashville to New Hampshire in an energize
his efforts in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas D. Rath, Alexander's principal adviser and chief backer
in the state, and Brian Kennedy, Alexander's national political
director, will announce the move Wednesday in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really going to enable us to respond well to what
we need to do out here,'' Rath said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The change sounds more dramatic than it is. Only two campaign
workers will move to the state, working out of a leased office in
Manchester. Alexander's press office, finance team and
administrative staff will remain in Nashville.

THE NEW BERLIN: EXPRESSING GOVERNMENT POWER WITHOUT POMPOSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 (See also BERLIN-WALKING, BERLIN-IDENTITY, BERLIN-CULTURE,
BERLIN-SUBCULTURE, BERLIN-REDEVELOP, BERLIN-VOICES)  
 Michael Z. Wise is the author of ``Capital Dilemma: Germany's
Search for a New Architecture of Democracy'' (Princeton
Architectural Press).  
 (bl)  
 By MICHAEL Z. WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ For nearly a half century, the Federal Republic of
Germany studiously avoided creating grand government buildings. The
self-consciously modest, modern West German capital that arose in
Bonn after the demise of Nazi Berlin stood in pointed contrast to
the overblown classicism favored by the Third Reich _ an
architectural declaration of ``Never Again.'' Federal ministries in
the small Rhineland town set up operations in unassuming quarters,
and government chiefs from Ludwig Erhard to Gerhard Schroeder have
occupied a squat, low-slung official residence nicknamed the
Chancellor's Bungalow.
</P>
<P>
   If Bonn's buildings were intended to exude a sense of atonement
_ an architectural hair shirt for a contrite nation _ the German
government is adopting a somewhat different tone for the official
structures it has commissioned for Berlin. These buildings are
consonant with unified Germany's status as the most powerful nation
in Europe and in keeping with the expansive urban scale of the
country's historic capital.
</P>
<P>
   But in planning the government's move from Bonn to Berlin,
German leaders had an acute sense of architecture's symbolic power
and therefore feared an international furor about their aspirations
if they revived an overly monumental official style.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, one of the thorniest official design
challenges was the headquarters of the German chancellor, the first
to govern from Berlin since Adolf Hitler. Drawn up by Berlin
architects Axel Schultes and Charlotte Frank, the new Chancellery's
design marks a clean break with Bonn's anonymous, low-key approach.
``This is no longer understatement,'' Schultes said after winning
the commission in 1995. Now that Germany had become a nation of 82
million people, he declared: ``We are moving forward and we have to
respond. The Republic must show its colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultes and Ms. Frank were obvious choices to design the
Chancellery since it forms a key part of the master plan that the
same architects also created for Berlin's latest government
district. Now under construction in an area known as the
Spreebogen, an arclike bend in the Spree River, the government
district is just northwest of the Reichstag, the former Imperial
Parliament renovated by the British architect Norman Foster as the
new home of the federal legislature, the Bundestag.
</P>
<P>
   The Schultes-Frank-designed district comprises a massive ribbon
of official structures reminiscent of the Mall in Washington.
Called the Federal Strip, it is as wide as a football field, with
the Chancellery and its gardens at the western end and offices and
a library for the Bundestag at the other.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's east-west orientation has symbolic import because the
new government district is rising upon the very same Berlin tract
where Hitler's architect, Albert Speer, envisioned a vast
north-south axis, framed at opposite ends by a gargantuan victory
arch and an even bigger domed hall large enough to accommodate
180,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Strip thus seeks to cancel out Speer's design while
forging a new architectural allegory _ a ribbon of federal offices
that also acts to knit together the once divided city while running
across an area previously traversed by the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Schultes, who wears half-moon glasses and his
shirt collars idiosyncratically flipped upward, describes himself
as owing a considerable debt to the American modernist Louis Kahn.
As did Kahn, Schultes uses 20th-century materials like glass and
smooth concrete to evoke the mystical grandeur of ancient monuments
like the temples of Karnak or Hagia Sofia. He and Ms. Frank
previously designed an art museum in Bonn and a hauntingly
beautiful new set of funeral chapels in the Treptow section of
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For Germany's new Chancellery, the architects had to perform the
equivalent of a high-wire balancing act. They needed distinctive
imagery that could serve as an instantly recognizable backdrop when
foreign statesmen come calling and official pronouncements are
made. The design also had to surpass the functional but nondescript
Chancellery in Bonn. Completed in 1976, that building looks little
different from a corporate office for BMW or Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Schroeder's predecessor, Helmut Kohl, who had
himself hoped to occupy the new Chancellery, was wary of any
architecture that verged on the forbidding or aloof. Schultes, too,
took pains to avoid resuscitating the pretentious corridors of
power like those Charlie Chaplin lampooned in ``The Great
Dictator.'' The design thus went through a half-dozen reworkings
during which Schultes said he and Ms. Frank ``felt our pulse and
that of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The architects strove for a playful, euphoric architecture that
Schultes said ``does not look like a so-called fat Germany.'' This
boldly formulated wish created friction with a client who held a
somewhat different vision. ``Kohl was concerned above all with
dignity,'' Schultes said during a recent visit to the crane-studded
construction site. ``And that involved not just the architecture,
but the dignity of the institution of the chancellor himself. I
told him that dignity was for me a very difficult word. We said,
`This building should not exude dignity, for God's sake, not
dignity.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, Schultes wanted an inviting edifice that would evoke
``sympathy at the first glance.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultes and Ms. Frank fashioned a nine-story cube to house the
executive offices, cabinet meeting rooms, an auditorium for news
conferences and a circular international conference room suitable
for summits of the European Union and the G-7, the group comprising
the world's leading industrial nations. Flanking the cube will be
two lower administrative wings for the Chancellery's 500-member
staff. The five-story wings, their mass leavened by 13
glass-enclosed gardens, form the outer edges of the Federal Strip.
Schultes originally wanted the Federal Strip to be of a uniform
height, but Kohl pushed the architects to double the size of his
office so that it would not be outflanked by the nearby Reichstag.
</P>
<P>
   The main facade of the Chancellery, scheduled for completion by
autumn of 2000, looks onto a large ceremonial court where Germany's
leaders will greet state visitors. Embellishing this entryway will
be a collection of concrete columns up to 46 feet high. But the
prospect of another imposing colonnaded Chancellery in Berlin set
off alarm bells, so to avoid anything that might have Speerian
echoes, the architects devised irregularly shaped and
asymmetrically placed columns that look more like rippling panels
than traditional pillars. The result adds depth and a play of light
and shadow to the facade, while also providing fresh iconography
for a liberal democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance foyer features an immense staircase below an
undulating ceiling whose free-spirited sweep adds vibrancy to what
might otherwise be a cold and intimidating space. On upper floors,
banquet and reception rooms give onto balconies on the east and
west facades and interlock with a central hourglass-shaped
stairwell linked to the chancellor's executive offices. The
interior finishes will aim to retain at least part of the austere
allure of German state architecture in Bonn, consisting neither of
marble nor granite, but raw concrete surfaces mixed with others of
sandstone and white stucco.
</P>
<P>
   Since easily defeating Kohl in last September's election,
Schroeder has argued that the Germans are too ``uptight'' about
their history and should proudly regard themselves as a ``normal''
nation. His comments make one wonder whether the symbol-laden new
Chancellery might have looked different had the younger Social
Democrat _ Schroeder was in diapers at the end of World War II _
been premier when the building was planned. But by the time he took
office last fall, the project was already well into the
construction phase.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has been able to set his own mark upon his
headquarters' design in small, but important ways, nonetheless. He
assented to Schultes' unusual plan, ostensibly rejected by Kohl as
undignified, to plant trees on top of some of the irregular
columns, thus bringing a Tuscan sensibility to the forecourt. ``We
wanted to diminish the pathos of these columns and give them a
southern nonchalance,'' said Schultes. Schroeder says the lofty
trees will render the facade more ``airy and cheerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The current chancellor is also far more open to filling the
building with contemporary artworks than were envisioned under his
predecessor, and Schultes is working with Culture Minister Michael
Naumann to devise an art program that will include foreign as well
as German artists.
</P>
<P>
   Such a carefully calibrated design befits a national capital
that Schroeder touts as being ``self-confident without being
arrogant.'' For it will have neither an aura of undue pomp nor
false modesty, while still offering a far more dramatic setting
than Bonn's muted stage for German history's next act.

STAR WARS CHARACTERS COMING TO CANDY STORES 
</HEADLINE>
 WARS-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If waiting for the new ``Star Wars'' flick has you feeling like
a famished Jabba the Hutt before the big feed, then Scott McWhinnie
has a timely snack to sate your appetite.
</P>
<P>
   McWhinnie is ``PEZident'' of Pez Candy, Inc., the maker of the
popular plastic dispensers featuring toy heads that tilt back and
eject pellet-size sweets. His company, known for its dispensers of
Minnie Mouse, Bugs Bunny and other characters, is heading into a
galaxy far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   Pez this month began selling four new ``Star Wars'' dispensers
in anticipation of the frenzy leading up to the May 19 release of
``Episode I: The Phantom Menace.'' The new dispensers show the
heads of Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett and the
furry-faced Ewoks. The company already has other well-known ``Star
Wars'' faces in its arsenal _ Darth Vader, C-3PO, Stormtroopers,
Yoda and Chewbacca.
</P>
<P>
   More are coming.
</P>
<P>
   McWhinnie said that hooking up with one of the most eagerly
anticipated movies of all time was a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the synergy of all those lovers of ``Star Wars''
collectibles, and those people who want new things to add to their
Pez collection,'' he said Tuesday from company headquarters in
Orange, Conn. ``It's a big thing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It many ways it is deja vu, Pez-style. In 1996, PEZ bigwigs
trekked to Skywalker Ranch, the Northern California corporate
office of ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas, to discuss merging
his characters with the candy that gets its name from the German
word for peppermint _ pfefferminz. ``They loved us, we loved
them,'' McWhinnie explained.
</P>
<P>
   But Pez officials had no idea that in the following year _ 1997
_ the three movies in the ``Star Wars'' series would be restored
and returned to the big screen. So they were pleasantly surprised
when their first wave of ``Star Wars'' Pez characters coincided
with the re-release, generating sales that were out of this world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sales shot up 36 percent,'' McWhinnie said, adding the
Stars Wars' re-release was ``a large factor'' in those gains.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Pez officials hope the release of ``The Phantom Menace'' will
create a similar boost, not to mention add new characters _ on top
of the 150 characters currently in production _ to the Pez family.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, those plastic heads are under wraps _ until the
``Phantom'' appears. ``I can't tell you (about those) characters,''
McWhinnie said with a chuckle. ``I was at a private showing. I had
to sign my name to get in.''

STAGE REVIEW: SCIENTIST DELIVERS STILLBORN `MISCONCEPTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN WINN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What's a busy career woman to do as her
biological clock ticks down? Where to dip into the gene pool if she
decides to have a child on her own? Who gets to play God in the
brave new world of reproductive technology?
</P>
<P>
   In ``An Immaculate Misconception,'' an ambitious but
dramatically sterile problem play at the Eureka Theatre,
scientist-turned-playwright Carl Djerassi wades into the morass of
questions surrounding fertility in the '90s. Djerassi, who
synthesized the first birth control pill in the 1950s, wades out
with a test-tube piece of theater.
</P>
<P>
   This 2 1/2-hour staged debate has its intriguing twists, but the
artificially induced characters never take on an absorbing sense of
life. The show raises enough issues for a course in biomedical
ethics while failing to make an audience care about the people who
play them out onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Balthrop Cassidy portrays Dr. Melanie Laidlaw, the
37-year-old biologist at the heart of the story. Busy with her work
on a new procedure for injecting human sperm directly into the egg,
she's put her own romantic and reproductive life on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Then she meets Menachem (Peter Vilkin), an Israeli nuclear
scientist, and it's pure chemistry in bed. Melanie has found the
perfect biological father for her child, she thinks, but there are
problems. He lives halfway around the world. He's married. And
owing to a nuclear accident, his sperm count is too low for either
conventional fatherhood or in vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Enter ICSI _ intracytoplasmic sperm injection, a method actually
developed by a University of Brussels scientist in the early 1990s.
In her lab, a suitably drab environment by designer Mikiko Uesugi,
Melanie decides to test the procedure on herself. The only thing
missing is Menachem's seed _ that's the title of Djerassi's 1997
novel on which the play is based.
</P>
<P>
   The action turns on a series of deceptions. Menachem lies about
his marriage. Melanie uses cooing e-mail and a canister of liquid
nitrogen to secure what she's after. Her research partner Felix,
played by Paul Sulzman, plays a microscopic shell game with eggs
and sperm. In their own ways, they're all stained by a kind of
scientific original sin.
</P>
<P>
   Djerassi searches out the implications of conception without
sex. Melanie sees ICSI as a breakthrough that will liberate women
by separating sex from reproduction. Through Felix's
``testosterone-tinted glasses,'' it's a boon for infertile men.
</P>
<P>
   A prologue and epilogue by the first ICSI baby (Zach Kenney)
raise questions about the rights of the offspring. The play touches
on the meaning of paternity, the pressure to publish, scientists'
egos and the ethics of self-experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Even the piano music used during scene changes sounds worried.
In director Edward Hastings' production, ``Misconception'' has a
lot on its mind.
</P>
<P>
   The show does invite an audience to stretch into the strange new
territory of reproductive science. Like Jonathan Tolins' gay gene
play ``Twilight of the Golds'' or Jane Anderson's adoption play
``The Baby Dance,'' it uses dramatic suspense to animate real-world
issues of personal and social responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   But Djerassi has created mouthpieces rather than characters with
real dimension. The dialogue has a chilly sense of purpose. The
plot skirts some of the story's emotional depths. Melanie's
assertion that she has wanted a child more than scientific fame is
not enough to explain the risks she takes.
</P>
<P>
   Djerassi has an unfortunate weakness for punning _ a ``widow of
opportunity,'' ``seminal role.'' Even the characters' names _ Adam
for the first ICSI baby, a kindly sperm bank operator named
Motherwell (Maxine Wyman) _ are labels.
</P>
<P>
   The actors work hard but in vain to enliven the proceedings.
Cassidy is focused and serious. Sulzman projects an unfazed sense
of entitlement. Vilkin looks wounded. But even in its stormy
confrontations, ``Misconception'' never takes off. Like the tightly
controlled dance of sperms and eggs projected on a screen, these
characters miss the clench and splendor of life.

US SEES `PLOY' IN MILOSEVIC CEAASE-FIRE OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic declared a
unilateral cease-fire Tuesday in his campaign to crush ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, an offer promptly rejected by US officials,
who dismissed it as a ``ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States began preparing the US naval base
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to shelter 20,000 Kosovo refugees, opting
to use it over Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. Pentagon officials
said refugees from Macedonia will be transported by chartered
aircraft with the first wave arriving in three to four days and all
of them in place within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Milosevic could end the bombing
immediately by withdrawing from Kosovo, accepting a peace agreement
and allowing the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians who have
been forced out of Kosovo to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In related developments:
</P>
<P>
   --Serb officials said a NATO attack on a coal mining town killed
12 civilians and injured dozens.
</P>
<P>
   --Refugees are arriving in Norway and Turkey, as aid flooded
into Macedonia to help with the refugee crisis there.
</P>
<P>
   --Defense Secretary William Cohen headed to Brussels with a
bipartisan group from the House and Senate to meet with NATO
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic made the cease-fire offer in honor of the approaching
Orthodox Easter. Moments after the Serb's unilateral cease-fire
took effect at 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT), air-raid sirens wailed in
Belgrade, heralding new NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At least six explosions could be heard late Tuesday in the
direction of the Batajnica military airport just north of Belgrade
and tracer rounds from anti-aircraft were seen in the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav television stations reported further attacks  &UR; last
night &LR;  at Uzice, 75 miles southwest of Belgrade, and in Cacak, an
industrial town 55 miles to the south, where US officials say a
munitions plant is located.
</P>
<P>
   A statement on the cease-fire released by the Yugoslav
government said, ``All actions of the army and police in Kosovo''
would be discontinued ``in the expectation that this decision will
be accepted as a gesture of good will in support of a peaceful
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration, which had been preparing for
such a move by Milosevic, toughened its resolve. US officials,
joined by British Prime Minister Tony Blair demanded that the Serbs
accept the framework of the peace accord worked out at Rambouillet,
France, including the deployment of an international peacekeeping
force, self-rule for the Kosovar Albanians, and the unconditional
return of all refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated that he might try a plot like this,'' said P.J.
Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton said Milosevic's proposal fell
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States would never choose force as anything other
than a last option,'' he said. ``Mr. Milosevic could end it now by
withdrawing his military police and paramilitary forces; by
accepting the deployment of an international security force to
protect not only the Kosovar Albanians, most but not all of whom
are Muslims, but also the Serbian minority in Kosovo _ everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Before departing for Brussels, Cohen said the cease-fire idea
was ``not only completely unacceptable, but it's absurd.'' In an
interview with the US government-owned Voice of America, Cohen said
it would be an ``abdication of responsibility'' by NATO to accept
it.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said Milosevic's offer of a
unilateral cease-fire in Kosovo may be evidence that NATO's air
campaign is working.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offer may be one sign that he is rattled, but we are
going to continue to rattle him until he makes an offer that meets
our conditions, and he's far away from that right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Greek prime minister, Costas Simitis, called the proposal
``a first step'' and an opening for a political dialogue with
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire offer came nearly two weeks into the conflict, as
allied warplanes blasted fuel storage facilities, oil refineries,
police headquarters, air defense sites, Serbian armored military
units on the ground, and roads and bridges across Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials said that a NATO strike on a coal mining town of
about 17,000 people, 100 miles southeast of Belgrade, killed 12
civilians and injured dozens.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO Air Commodore David Wilby did not confirm
those details. But referring to a military facility housing an
artillery brigade in Aleksinac, a central Serbian town, he said
there was ``evidence of some damage around about 600 meters just
short of the target.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an advance team of 100 US Marines Tuesday moved
into Macedonia to prepare the way for 1,200 Marines aboard ships in
the Aegean Sea who are coming ashore at a Greek port and will
construct and run a refugee camp in northern Macedonia. The Marines
are from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which has been in the
Aegean for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the selection of Guantanamo Bay naval base,
administration officials said the base was a better alternative to
the base in Guam because it has been used for Haitian and Cuban
refugees. ``We've done it before there, we know how to do it,''
said one senior official.
</P>
<P>
   The US government also decided to bar all ships flying
Yugoslavia's flag or under that country's control from US ports and
territories to guard against espionage or sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   As the swirl of humanitarian and war efforts continued, the
Pentagon said the NATO airstrikes so far have failed to eliminate
the Serb's air defense threat, but evidence existed of fuel
shortages among some Serb military units in Kosovo and low morale
among Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright ruled out sending
in US troops. ``We believe that a sustained air campaign can
accomplish the objectives we have laid out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany,
Italy and Russia have agreed to meet in Brussels within a few days
to assess the NATO campaign and reaffirm their determination to
forge a settlement for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore talked for 40 minutes by phone
with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to try to smooth over
differences between the United States and Moscow over Kosovo. The
two men had not talked since Primakov abruptly cut off his planned
visit to Washington the day the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, General Yury Baluyevsky, a senior officer of Russia's
general staff, said Moscow believed NATO would launch a ground
assault from Albania into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, NATO favors conducting a ground operation first
in Kosovo, while locations in Yugoslavia proper will be cut off,''
Baluyevsky said. ``Air strikes will be launched against
administrative and industrial targets. The goal of such an
operation is to make the leadership of Yugoslavia accept the West's
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign minister Igor Ivanov told the briefing that according to
his information, NATO leaders were preparing a ground assault
despite assurances that the alliance was not planning to send its
troops into Kosovo. He said troops from Germany, Italy, France and
Britain were being readied for positioning in Macedonia and
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Baluyevsky repeated the Russian assertion that NATO's airstrikes
are being aimed increasingly at civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 24 hours, airstrikes were carried out against 44
targets. Of them only 20 were military,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also cited unnamed NATO experts as saying that NATO's
operation in Yugoslavia ``could drag on for several years.''

PHYSICIAN PROFILES LACK SIGNIFICANT DATA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The state medical board, under fire for its lax
handling of three doctors facing criminal charges, is also failing
to keep its noted on-line physician profiles updated with such
information as doctors' criminal convictions, paid malpractice
claims, and hospital discipline actions.
</P>
<P>
   A Globe review this week has found missing data on at least two
physicians convicted of Medicaid fraud in the early 1990s and one
physician whose insurer paid approximately $5 million last year in
a malpractice case involving a brain-injured baby.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a comparison of earlier versions of profiles with
more recent ones for some doctors shows an apparent whitewashing of
the record.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a 1996 profile for one physician gave ``academic
research fraud'' as the reason for his 1995 resignation from
Brigham and Women's Hospital, but a 1998 one deleted the reason for
the hospital discipline. That physician, Andrew J. Friedman, has
since had his Massachusetts medical license suspended and does not
currently appear on the board's profiles.
</P>
<P>
   The board's acting executive director, Penelope Wells, had no
explanation for that change, noting that the profiles usually use
the reason for disciplinary action cited by the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in late 1996, the first-in-the-nation on-line
profiles were created in part as a response to a Globe Spotlight
series in 1994 on medical malpractice, and have been considered the
state Board of Registration in Medicine's premier achievement. The
profiles are designed to include such basic information as
education, board certification, as well as malpractice payments
made and hospital or medical board discipline in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Information had been found missing in some of the profiles early
on in their roll-out, and state officials promised in 1997 to
improve them.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``It's becoming more and more difficult to trust the
board,'' said Linda DeBenedictis, president and founder of the
Norwood-based New England Patients' Rights Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're almost at a crisis situation,'' DeBenedictis said. ``I
think the public is losing faith. How can we believe anything
they're going to tell us by their track record?''
</P>
<P>
   State officials defended the profiles, saying they rely on
malpractice insurers, doctors, and courts to provide the relevant
information. If they don't get the information, they can't include
it, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a snapshot, not a biography. There's 97 percent
accuracy,'' said Kim Hinden McDonald, spokeswoman for the state
Office of Consumer Affairs. ``The physician profile is the first
step, not the last step,'' she said. ``It should not be the last
word in choosing a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the imperfections, Wells, who has also been the board's
long-time general counsel, said the Massachusetts physician
profiles continue to lead the nation. ``They include more
information _ by far _ than exists in any other state. Most other
states aspire to have as much information on their profiles as we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who took over the reins from Alexander ``Sandy'' Fleming
after he resigned last month under criticism, added, ``That's the
best we can do. We're not going to certify that we have everything
on a particular physician. We can only include the information that
we have.''
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, attorneys, physicians, and consumer advocates
familiar with the board's workings say even when the board has the
information, it fails to show up on the profiles. If incomplete or
tardy reporting by doctors, courts, or malpractice insurers is a
source of the problem, the board should crack down and enforce the
reporting requirements, they add.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't have to wait for somebody to come knocking on
their doors,'' said attorney Andrew C. Meyer, who specializes in
representing patients who have been harmed by medical malpractice.
``They stick their head in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul D. Weinstein pleaded nolo contendere, or no contest, to
Medicaid fraud in 1992, yet his physician profile says ``Dr.
Weinstein has had no criminal convictions in the past 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Weinstein said he reported his plea
to the board and has obeyed all requirements and regulations since
then. ``They're well aware of it, that situation,'' said Weinstein,
whose medical license was revoked by the board in 1992, but was
reinstated with probation in 1995. ``It was . . . a difficult
chapter in our life, and we've certainly complied with all the
regulations since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Benjamin Weinberg, was convicted of Medicaid fraud in 1991,
but the board's physician profile also says ``Dr. Weinberg has had
no criminal convictions in the past 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney who represented both Weinberg and Weinstein said
that both men have paid their dues and followed all reporting
requirements, and that the board knows of the prior convictions.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the convictions this week, Wells was surprised
to find the information missing from the public profiles. She
checked the board's internal database and found the Medicaid
conviction information there. ``This would be a glitch,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with one of her staff members involved with the
profiles, Wells discovered that the off-site ``web master'' who is
maintaining the database for the board has taken all the criminal
convictions data off line for more than a week, in order to add
information about serious misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no notification of that in the public profiles,
only the misleading statement that there are no criminal
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In another physician profile, for Dr. Dennis Lund of Children's
Hospital, there was no information late on Monday about a
settlement made by his insurer in a case involving a baby injured
by an apparent potassium overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Meyer, who represented the baby's family, remembers
getting the settlement of about $5 million from Lund's insurer
about a year ago and was outraged that the payment hasn't yet been
reported on the board's profile. ``They're simply circumventing
every reporting requirement,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a spokesman for the Risk Management Foundation of the
Harvard Medical Institutions, which services Lund's malpractice
insurer, said the payment had been reported to the state medical
board, although he could not say when or divulge the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Upon checking with her staff late Monday, Wells said she was
surprised to find that the insurer had made the report only that
day, the same day a Globe reporter asked the insurer about it, even
though the payment was made last year. ``Yes, I wonder about'' the
timing, Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Lund's profile was taken off line Tuesday, for about three
weeks, while that information is added and double-checked with the
physician, Wells said.

BMG AND UNIVERSAL SAID TO FORM INTERNET VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's two largest record companies, Universal Music and
BMG, are expected to announce Wednesday that they have formed a
joint venture to create a series of Internet sites to promote and
sell music, record industry executives said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The move recognizes the growing importance of the Internet, both
in building an audience for musicians and for selling music. This
year, an estimated 2 percent of the compact disks sold in the
United States will be bought over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Universal-BMG venture, which is scheduled to be announced at
a news conference in Manhattan on Wednesday morning, will build off
several sites BMG has already started to promote its artists, the
executives said. These include Peeps.com, a rhythm `n' blues site;
Bugjuice.com, for alternative music, and Twangthis.com, for country
music. Universal Music artists in each category will be added to
these and other sites.
</P>
<P>
   These genre-based sites will feature information about and
interviews with artists, chat rooms for fans and live music
broadcasts. The companies hope to attract a big audience because,
as record companies, they have access to better information about
artists than other retail sites. In addition to promoting their own
records, they will probably sell advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, these sites will link users to a new Internet music
store established by BMG and Universal called Getmusic.com. Unlike
the genre sites, which will promote only Universal and BMG artists,
Getmusic will also sell the music of artists from the other major
labels and independent record companies.
</P>
<P>
   BMG is part of Bertelsmann AG, the German media conglomerate,
and has labels such as Arista, Elektra Nonesuch and BMG Classical,
and artists including Whitney Houston, Puff Daddy and Sarah
McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   The Universal Music Group is an arm of Seagram Co., which bought
Polygram NV last fall, and has labels such as MCA, Geffen, Def Jam,
Mercury, Motown and A&AMP;M, with a roster of artists ranging from
Elton John to Herbie Hancock to U2.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Universal is the largest record company,
with a 27 percent share of the market; BMG is second, with 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, it would have raised eyebrows for a
manufacturer of any product to compete with its dealers by opening
an online retail store. But the Internet has caused many companies
to open direct-sales channels.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann, which also owns Random House, the nation's largest
book publishing company, has bought half of Barnesandnoble.com, the
online bookstore. And Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Music and Sony
Music _ the third- and fourth-ranked labels _ have already opened a
joint music store, called Total E, which is run through the
Columbia House music club and is owned by the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Total E, however, has had relatively little effect on the market
so far. The two leaders in online music sales are CDNow, which
recently bought its rival N2K, and Amazon.com, the big online
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The Universal-BMG deal ``is one of the most positive things that
could happen,'' said Jonathan V. Diamond, the chairman of CDNow.
``It is further validation of the Internet as a major promotion and
retail channel.''
</P>
<P>
   This deal sets the stage for record labels to allow people to
download music to their computer. Currently, there is a frenzy
among Internet users who are downloading illegal copies of songs
using a technology called MP3. The record industry is trying to
develop an alternate technology that will prevent copying without
paying royalties to the labels and artists.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Getmusic.com will not offer digital downloads of music,
but they may be added later, when the record industry standards are
settled.
</P>
<P>
   While opening an online store is relatively easy, getting
business is not. Amazon.com, for example, continues to leap further
and further ahead of Barnesandnoble. And in its first full quarter
of selling music, Amazon, with its rapidly growing customer base,
sold more compact disks than either N2K or CDNow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the newly merged CDNow has some advantages that the new
Getmusic.com will not be able to duplicate easily. It has 1.6
million customers (still shy of Amazon's 8 million) and exclusive
promotion deals on most of the more popular Internet sites,
including America Online, Yahoo and Excite.

COMMENTARY: PRESIDENT FRAT BOY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all been exhausted by the faux culture wars of the Clinton
era.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Bill Clinton was elected, conservatives have been
acting as though the Oval Office had been festooned with macrame
and bongs, as if there were some crazy free-love, war-protesting,
pig-hating, Bobby Seale-supporting, Carlos Castaneda-reading, Bob
Dylan-grooving hippie running the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr, Newt Gingrich, Bob Barr, Pat Buchanan and a flock of
other Republicans who look like FBI agents have all tried, without
success, to turn back the clock. But their notion of a big
McGovernick revival was always hallucinatory. The day trippers have
all become day traders. Dylan is singing in Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The phony struggle between the black-and-white 50s and
psychedelic 60s may be coming to an end. Bill and Hillary may be
the last of the hippie-yuppies.
</P>
<P>
   As I scan the Republican horizon for 2000, all I see are frat
boys _ jocks and reformed party animals such as George W. Bush, Dan
Quayle and John McCain, plus one Southern deb who definitely looks
like a throwback to the days of unassailable girdles and unmussable
hairdos.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to picture Al Gore in a Canadian Mountie uniform
than a fringed jacket. He's Dudley Do-right, with a wholesome blond
wife named Tipper who hates dirty rock lyrics and an all-American
brood right out of a ``Pleasantville'' formica kitchen, smiling
serenely behind a stack of golden pancakes. Tipper has already
signaled that she will not be a libber like Hillary; she will spend
her time mothering, not horning in on policy. ``I spend a lot of
time,'' she said, ``on keeping the family together.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the frat pack is Bush, who made his debut in The
New York Times in 1967 in a story about ``frat-branding'' at Delta
Kappa Epsilon, the fraternity where he was once president.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Weisman, a Yale student then stringing for The New York
Times (who is now a member of The Times' editorial board) reported
on a Yale Daily News article accusing campus fraternities of
carrying on ``sadistic and obscene'' initiation procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charge that has caused the most controversy on the Yale
campus,'' Weisman wrote, ``is that Delta Kappa Epsilon applied a
`hot branding iron' to the small of the back of its 40 new members
in ceremonies two weeks ago. A photograph showing a scab in the
shape of the Greek letter delta, approximately a half inch wide,
appeared with the article. A former president of Delta said that
the branding is done with a hot coat hanger. But the former
president, George Bush, a Yale senior, said that the resulting
wound is `only a cigarette burn.''' The fraternities were fined by
the Yale Interfraternity Council.
</P>
<P>
   Frat prankster George told Weisman that he was amazed that
anyone was making a fuss about the branding, that at colleges in
Texas they used cattle prods on pledges.
</P>
<P>
   There's something that doesn't compute about branding irons and
Yale. If there did have to be branding, shouldn't it have been less
Animal House and something more discreetly WASPy, like the logos
for J. Press or Topsiders?
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a newspaper interview, W. explained away the incident,
saying ``There's no scarring mark physically or mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the Republican front-runner's younger, wilder years
has been building and the pressure is on for him to provide details
of just how wild he got. Asked by a reporter recently about whether
he had ever used marijuana or cocaine, Bush replied: ``I'm not
going to talk about what I did as a child. It is irrelevant what I
did 20 to 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokesman, Karen Hughes, dismissed a report in the Star
tabloid suggesting that there exists a photo of the young Bush nude
and drunk and dancing on a bar. ``Yeah,'' she said, ``and green
aliens have landed on the lawn of the governor's mansion.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 30th reunion of the Yale class of '68 last year, there
was disappointment that Bush did not show up and excitement about
his plans to run for president. But his buddies were quick to
assure everyone, ``George has really changed a lot since Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, if frat-branding becomes an issue in his campaign,
Bush will be able to spin the incident by saying that it proves,
even better than pork rinds, that he is a true Texan.

ZILOG ACQUIRES SEATTLE SILICON CORP. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL SHUKOVSKY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ ZiLog, a Campbell, Calif., company which supplies
seminconductor products for home entertainment, communication and
embedded control markets, has acquired Seattle Silicon Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held ZiLog on Tuesday did not reveal terms of the
asset acquisition of the Bellevue, Wash.-based semiconductor
company that does custom design work on analog devices but said it
hopes to use its new Puget Sound base to attract talent that
prefers living in this part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ZiLog chief executive Curtis Crawford said Tuesday that none of
the approximately 15 engineering employees at Seattle Silicon will
lose their jobs and he anticipates modest hiring of new people over
time.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford cited the analog capabilities that Seattle Silicon
brings to ZiLog as a chief reason for the acquisition. Those
capabilities will increase ZiLog's range of possible markets for
embedded microprocessor devices, he said. Products like passive
infra-red detection in home security technology and radio frequency
chips in wireless communications such as those used in cordless
phones are designed by Seattle Silicon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is analog; it's not made of ones and zeros,'' said
Crawford. ``Having the analog, mixed-signal experience is something
we need to grow as a company.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition should also be welcome news for anyone who has
been roused from sleep at 5 a.m. by the backup warning beeps of a
dumpster truck. Among the analog capabilities Seattle Silicon
brings to ZiLog are intelligent sound detection devices which
adjust the volume of the backup beepers. The quieter the ambient
street noise, the softer the beeper.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Seattle Silicon's experienced engineers is
particularly important to ZiLog because ``these analog designers
are difficult to get and difficult to train,'' said Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Silicon's location as a ZiLog design center will give
the company the opportunity ``to attract talent that wants to be in
this very beautiful part of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ZiLog had revenues in 1998 of $204.7 million. It employs about
1,200 people.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic announced a
unilateral Easter cease-fire by Serbian forces starting Tuesday.
But NATO flatly rejected the proposal and seized on another rare
day of clear skies to escalate its aerial bombardment of Serb
forces and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In what was presented by the official Yugoslav news agency
Tanjug as a joint declaration by Yugoslavia and its major republic,
Serbia, Milosevic declared that all actions by the Serbian army and
police against the ``terrorist'' Kosovo Liberation Army would be
halted as of 2 p.m. ET through Orthodox Easter on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But Defense Secretary William Cohen said the cease-fire idea was
``not only completely unacceptable, but it's absurd.'' And
administration officials said there was no evidence that Belgrade
had suspended its attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As the second week of the allied air campaign, came to an end,
NATO warplanes, including, for the first time, Navy fighter-bombers
off the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt in the Adriatic, struck
bridges, air defense radars, police headquarters and fuel depots.
Serb forces in Kosovo were also hit, officials said, but many tanks
evaded attack by hiding in forests or abandoned buildings.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials said the allies had significantly
stepped up the number of bombing missions to take advantage of a
third straight day without fog or rain. By mid-afternoon Tuesday,
the officials said, their warplanes had attacked 30 targets in a
24-hour cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and NATO refused to specify which targets they hit,
but Tuesday night a series of explosions rocked Podgorica, the
capital of the small Yugoslav republic of Montenegro. State radio
reported that a missile fell near an aluminum plant in a suburb of
the city, and that a Yugoslav army firing range was hit near the
village of Fundina, seven miles from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav television stations reported further attacks Tuesday
night around the Kosovo capital of Pristina; at Uzice, 75 miles
southwest of Belgrade; and at Cacak, an industrial town where U.S.
officials said a munitions plant is located.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's bombing also focused on a corridor near the
Albania-Kosovo border, between Pec and Dakovica, where Serb army
and police were concentrating their assault on ethnic Albanians,
the allies said.
</P>
<P>
   Air planners created a rectangular ``kill box'' in that area, a
tactic used effectively against Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf war,
in which scores of allied warplanes hammer enemy targets in a
tightly drawn zone.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Xavier Delcourt, deputy operations chiefs for the
French armed forces, said NATO would carry out more ``massive
strikes'' on Yugoslavia Tuesday and Wednesday, ``greater than
anything done so far.''
</P>
<P>
   To further isolate the Belgrade government and to thwart spying
or sabotage, the White House announced Tuesday night that it had
begun barring Yugoslav ships from U.S. ports and terroritorial
waters. Such an order puts Yugoslavia in the company of such rogue
nations as Iran, Iraq, Libya and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Even as allied officials boasted of the day's triumphs, citing
intelligence reports of flagging morale among Serb troops, they
apologized for at least one laser-guided bomb that went awry and
hit an apartment building in Aleksinac, a mining town of 17,000
people that is 100 miles southeast of Belgrade. Yugoslav officials
said at least seven people were killed and dozens hurt. NATO
officials said four people died.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and U.S. officials said the target was an artillery brigade
headquarters, but the errant bomb hit 1,500 yards short of the
mark. Officials blamed clouds or hostile fire for apparently
interfering with a laser beamed from the plane to the target to
guide the bomb to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said one bomb, either 500 or 2,000 pounds,
fell from an American plane, but it was unclear which one, and an
inquiry was under way. Journalists at the scene reported two
craters near the damaged building, suggesting two bombs went awry.
``Whatever the reason, any unintended damage to civilian property
or loss of life is very much regretted,'' said Air Commodore David
Wilby, a NATO spokesman in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombing campaign ratcheted up, the Clinton administration
announced the United States would take in up to 20,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees and house them temporarily at the U.S. naval base
at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the first refugees, now in
Macedonia, would be flown on commercial airliners hired by the
government, and begin arriving in Cuba in three or four days. Bacon
said it would take about 45 days to bring in all 20,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met Tuesday with his senior national security and
foreign policy advisers. Top Pentagon and State Department
officials, briefed members of Congress here in Washington during
the two-week Easter recess, on military, diplomatic and
humanitarian developments.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president continued to press Milosevic
to withdraw his forces from Kosovo and allow an international
peacekeeping force to escort the hundreds of thousands of Kosovo
Albanians refugees back to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But the president left it to his national security advisers to
denounce in stronger terms Milosevic's proposed cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   In a Voice of America interview at the Pentagon, Cohen said
acceptance of a cease-fire now would amount to ``abdication of
responsibility'' by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the

   WASHINGTON _ NATO announced Tuesday that it was coordinating all
transportation of food, relief supplies and medical care to the
Kosovo refugees, as well as airlifting them to temporary camps,
after two days of relief efforts by individual member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees,
Sadako Ogata, sent a private letter to Javier Solana, the NATO
secretary-general, saying her agency was overwhelmed by the crisis
and asking for immediate military help to bring order to the
deteriorating situation on the Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were overwhelmed; we needed to save lives,'' said Karen
AbuZayd, the refugee agency's representative to the United States.
``We ask the military for help only when we have no other choice
and when we had 350,000 refugees we knew we had reached that
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, NATO troops who were to serve as peacekeepers in Kosovo
have transformed themselves into a relief operation, working round
the clock to throw up tents at six camps in Macedonia and three
camps in Albania. NATO pilots are flying helicopters between
Tirana, Albania, and the border town of Kukes, ferrying emergency
supplies to the refugees and evacuating those who need medical
care, said Jamie Shea, spokesman for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Now NATO will set up headquarters in Tirana to organize the
ground transportation of trucks filled with supplies _ food,
medicine, blankets, sleeping bags, even thermal underwear _ to the
refugees and to establish an airlift operating center outside
Brussels, said Lt. Col. Wilhelm Bocklet, a NATO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   NATO earlier had announced that it would take charge of
airlifting refugees out of Macedonia and flying them to temporary
housing in NATO countries. But NATO had left it up to each
individual country among its 19 members to make contributions to
the relief effort _ be it the United States, with its logistical
support, or Italy, with its camp police. The U.N. refugee agency
had been the sole organization coordinating the relief and rescue
operations on the ground, working with at least 55 private
voluntary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Now NATO will assume military coordination of the relief convoys
overland, as well as transport of supplies by air for the refugees,
whose numbers rose by another 55,000 Tuesday, bringing the total to
480,000 people who have left Kosovo since the bombing began on
March 24, according to Kris Janowski, a refugee agency spokesman in
Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlift in Tirana varies from day to day, about nine to
ten humanitarian flights,'' said Janowski. ``Today's biggest single
load was American military planes _ Hercules _ flying in on six
flights from Ancona, Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   The American contribution of logistical support _ from building
new airstrips in Albania to providing a mobile air traffic control
unit near Tirana _ is critical since at its core the relief
operation has to make sense out of a logistical nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airport at Tirana is very small _ it doesn't even have a
tower,'' said NATO's Bocklet. ``The U.S. air mobility
communications center is crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   As the relief effort grows in size and mission, the skies over
Yugoslavia and the Adriatic Sea have become clogged with aircraft
on combat missions over Yugoslavia and relief flights to Albania
and Macedonia, creating what the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon,
described as a ``sequencing'' problem.
</P>
<P>
   With most of these flights originating from bases in Italy, that
country has closed down all of its civilian airports on the
Adriatic coast, said Ambassador Ferdinando Salleo of the Italian
Embassy here. ``We had to close all civilian traffic from Trieste
all the way down to the south,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the weekend, NATO officials took over managing the air
operations control center for the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva
because it, too, was finding it hard to manage all of the growing
air traffic, said Ms. AbuZayd. She said the congestion would only
get worse with planes carrying supplies in while others carry
refugees out.
</P>
<P>
   Among the countries that have offered to take refugees for
temporary asylum are: Germany, Turkey, Australia, Norway, the
United States, Greece, Austria, Canada, Spain, the Netherlands,
France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The American contribution to the airlift will include
transporting food, tents, blankets and sleeping bags, among other
supplies, to the NATO base in Ancona, where the goods will then be
loaded onto C-130 transport planes and flown into Albania and
Macedonia at the rate of 10 flights a day, said Maj. Gen. Charles
Wald, vice director of strategic plans and policy for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   In Tirana itself, the United States will ``make sure the
airfield is up and running,'' said Wald, as well as oversee the
unloading of the supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Since the American government plays such a key role in both NATO
and the refugee agency, President Clinton established a special
council to coordinate all American civilian and military
contributions to the Kosovo relief effort, said Brian Atwood,
chairman of the new council.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is giving most of its donations to the refugee
agency, as are other foreign nations, including the NATO countries,
Asian nations like Japan and Pakistan, and Middle Eastern nations
like Kuwait, which on Monday donated sugar, flour, blankets and
milk.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 7:
</P>
<P>
   Keeping NATO's 19 members united in their determination to
confront Slobodan Milosevic has been a difficult challenge for
President Clinton, and it got harder on Tuesday. Belgrade's
declaration of an Orthodox Easter cease-fire in Kosovo, coupled
with an errant NATO bombing raid on the Serbian town of Aleksinac,
were just the kinds of developments that can start to unravel a
coalition of disparate nations. NATO properly rejected the
cease-fire, which came with no long-term peace proposal, but the
offer may be the first sign that Milosevic is looking for a way out
of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and NATO must be ready to negotiate with
Milosevic if he makes a serious peace offer, and there were signs
on Tuesday that a negotiating track could quickly develop if he
does. But until he budges, the bombing should persist. Though the
attacks have done little to curtail the Serbian rampage across
Kosovo, Milosevic's military and industrial base is now being hit
hard. That will eventually produce a more comprehensive peace
proposal from him. On Tuesday, he did not offer to withdraw his
forces from Kosovo, allow the return of the refugees or take any
other steps required to undo the damage of the last two weeks.
Wavering NATO members like Italy and Greece must recognize that a
false peace in Kosovo will only embolden Milosevic to turn his
terror against other Balkan peoples.
</P>
<P>
   But if Russia is willing to help settle the conflict, more
serious diplomatic efforts could grow out of a planned meeting on
Wednesday in Brussels between Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott and his Russian counterpart, Alexander Avdeyev, and
European diplomats. The alliance gave Talbott some talking room by
dropping its insistence that as one condition for stopping the
bombing, Milosevic must sign the peace plan prepared last month in
France. The specific autonomy plan for Kosovo outlined in the
agreement has been shattered by the Serbian assault, and NATO has
sensibly decided that a new plan is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The casualties in a residential neighborhood of Aleksinac were
unfortunate. But with the use of precision munitions, the alliance
has kept civilian casualties to a minimum. Serbian forces, by
contrast, have deliberately targeted civilians in their brutal
march across Kosovo. NATO reconnaissance photographs and numerous
accounts from refugees suggest the Serbian units have executed
hundreds of ethnic Albanians as they have forced the people of
Kosovo from their homes.

THE KHADAFY CONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moammar Khadafy's extradition to Holland of two Libyan
intelligence agents who are to stand trial under Scottish law for
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988 may signify the success of
an arduous diplomatic effort, but there remains a long way to go
before justice is done.
</P>
<P>
   It should be obvious that even if the two surrendered agents are
proved guilty as charged in an impeccable judicial proceding, there
is almost no possibility they acted on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Being officers of an intelligence agency in Khadafy's despotic
state, they could not have expected to keep their jobs, or their
heads, if they had taken it upon themselves to imperil Khadafy's
regime by blowing up US citizens in an American airliner.
</P>
<P>
   If they had acted as improvising terrorists who just happened to
be in the employ of Khadafy's security service, they would hardly
have been able to hide from the law for the past decade under the
solicitous protection of the erratic colonel who rules their
country.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the murdered passengers on Pan Am 103 have
expressed a justified expectation that the coming trial will not be
confined to the circumscribed question of whether or not the two
extradited suspects are guilty. True justice demands a
determination of ultimate guilt. That means pursuing a trail of
evidence and logic that is almost certain to lead to Khadafy
himself.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe that Khadafy finally decided to extradite
his two agents without a well-grounded assumption that they will
not implicate him before their Scottish judges. After all, he
retains the power to punish or reward the kinfolk of the two
accused terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the same leverage that compelled Khadafy to honor
the indictments of his intelligence officers could be wielded
against a regime that refuses to admit its guilt for an act of
state terrorism. Libya has been able to import and export under the
UN's economic sanctions, but it desperately needs foreign
investment to revive its oil industry. That investment should be
withheld until the guiltiest parties confess thieir crime.

FIRST-QUARTER AUTO SALES SAID TO BE FASTEST START EVER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ When the General Motors Corp. reports its sales of
cars and trucks in March on Wednesday, the first quarter of 1999
will most likely go into the books as the best start ever to a
sales year for the U.S. auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every auto maker closed March and the first quarter
with sales even higher than last year's healthy levels. Last week,
DaimlerChrysler, Volvo, Honda and Infiniti reported record March
sales. Kia had its best month ever, Volkswagen had its best March
since 1981, and Subaru had its best March since 1988. Audi, BMW
with Land Rover, Isuzu and Nissan also reported higher sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without even knowing GM's numbers, the first quarter has
closed with the fastest sales start in U.S. history,'' said George
Pipas, manager of sales analysis for the Ford Motor Co., which
reported higher-than-expected March sales on Tuesday. Ford said it
sold 399,908 cars and trucks through its Ford, Mercury, Lincoln and
Jaguar dealers in March, up 13 percent compared with sales in the
month a year earlier and surpassing the March record set in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   When GM's sales are added in _ and they are predicted to be
slightly higher than last year's _ the seasonally adjusted average
selling rate likely will rise to more than 17 million cars and
light trucks, an increase of about 12 percent compared with last
year's strong March results, said David Healy, an auto analyst with
Burnham Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pipas noted that the first quarter of 1999 is not a single
quarter phenomenon. The annual selling rate has been running at 16
million vehicles or more every month since last March, except for
July and August, when GM's North American assembly plants were shut
down because of a strike by workers at two parts plants in
Michigan. He sees no end in sight to strong car sales.
</P>
<P>
   What is significant is not only the sheer volume of vehicles
auto makers are selling, but what vehicles they are selling, noted
Healy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most profitable models are showing the strongest sales and
the biggest year-to-year increases,'' he said, noting sales of
Ford's Expedition and DaimlerChrysler's Dodge Durango as well as
luxury car sales are extremely strong. ``It's the best of all
possible worlds for the auto makers. For a change, Detroit is
profit city.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, auto makers have backed off from costly incentives,
and the deflation of car prices that has occurred over the last two
years appears to be ending. Prices will most likely rise and
incentives will continue to slow as auto makers find themselves in
short supply of some vehicles because of the stronger-than-expected
winter sales. March typically marks the start of the best-selling
six months of the year, and auto makers build inventories through
the winter to prepare for the spring selling season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales have been equaling production, so the industry has built
no stock,'' Pipas said. ``That probably will help firm up prices
further.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to strong sales, auto makers have been raising their
industry sales forecasts for the year and increasing vehicle
production. Ford said on Tuesday that it would increase
second-quarter production by 20,000 trucks and 10,000 cars. In
March, after a stronger January and February than expected, Ford
raised its sales forecast for the year to between 15.5 million and
16 million vehicles, from 15 million to 15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things would have to sink quickly in order for the industry to
slump to the low end of that range,'' Pipas said. ``While we do
expect the second half of the year to have a slower sales pace than
the first quarter, a record sales year will be on people's minds by
the end of June.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous record for annual car and truck sales was 16
million vehicles in 1986.

CITING SECURITY CONCERNS, U.S. SUSPENDS WORK ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS
COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 5th graf to give full reference to source of quote. Also
minor changes throughout.)  (ac) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department said Tuesday that it had
suspended all scientific work on the computers containing America's
most sensitive weapons secrets at its three nuclear weapons
laboratories over fears that security lapses make the computers
vulnerable to espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said he ordered the suspension
on Friday as part of a new effort to improve security in the wake
of charges that China has stolen nuclear secrets from the labs.
China denies the spying accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of scientists and other researchers at Los Alamos,
Sandia and Lawrence-Livermore National Laboratories who rely on the
classified computer networks have been forced to drop their work
and instead attend new training sessions on computer security,
Energy Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The computers are connected together in networks, but are not
linked to the outside world. After the United States stopped
testing nuclear weapons, the work of modeling the reliability of
weapons designs has been done with these networks.
</P>
<P>
   One security flaw, according to officials, is that secret
information about nuclear weapons can be copied from the sensitive
computers onto a computer disk and then sent as e-mail among the
thousands of e-mails that leave the laboratory through separate
unclassified computer systems. One proposal is to ``make it
physically impossible to transfer classified information from a
classified computer to an unclassified computer,'' a statement
released Tuesday by Los Alamos officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he said he will not allow normal computer
operations, except those needed to insure safety, to resume until
he is satisfied that security has improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that I am dead serious about strengthening
security at the labs,'' Richardson said. ``Our computer security
has been lax, and I want to strengthen it, and the only way to do
that is to stand-down. I want to demonstrate to Congress and the
American people we are serious about upgrading computer security at
the labs, and that there will never be another lapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to suspend all work on sensitive computer networks
at Los Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence-Livermore national laboratories
is one of the most pointed actions taken by the Clinton
Administration since the furor erupted last month over allegations
of Chinese atomic espionage.
</P>
<P>
   It also follows an internal review by the Energy Department,
owner of the labs, which determined that security measures at Los
Alamos and Lawrence-Livermore were sub par. Los Alamos and Lawrence
Livermore both received ``marginal'' security ratings, while Sandia
received a satisfactory rating, according to the report released
last week. The report cited Los Alamos management for failing to
``ensure that members of their organization implement, support and
follow safeguards and security policies and procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Taiwan-born computer scientist at Los Alamos, Wen
Ho Lee, was fired for security breaches after being interviewed by
the FBI in connection with China's suspected theft of the design of
America's most advanced, miniaturized nuclear warhead, the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had been one of Los Alamos' leading computer experts on
nuclear weapons design, and had retained access to classified
information until just a few weeks before he was fired, though he
had been under investigation by the FBI for nearly three years. Lee
has not been arrested or charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's computer expertise was a factor in the decision to order
the broad stand-down of lab computer systems, Richardson said. The
relatively poor ratings received by both Los Alamos and Lawrence
Livermore in the security report also played a role, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, espionage is contributing factor, and the report is a
contributing factor.'' Richardson said. ``The goals are to increase
employee responsibility for security and to implement new measures
for the handling of classified and sensitive information.''
</P>
<P>
   The classified computer networks at the weapons labs are not
connected to the Internet, and are thus not supposed to be
vulnerable to hacking by outsiders. The possibility of secret data
being downloaded from the classified networks and then entered into
the unclassified network and e-mailed to the outside is a key
security concern, according to one U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   The lab plans to impose new audit procedures on unclassified
computer systems in order to control sensitive information. Los
Alamos will also require that two people be involved in the
transfer of files from classified computers.
</P>
<P>
   But John C. Browne, lab director at Los Alamos, cautioned that
the labs cannot allow security to become so stringent that it
prevents them from accomplishing their objectives. ``We have to
look at threats to information security from a risk-benefit
standpoint and put in place additional procedures that make
sense,'' he said. ``We can't raise the bar so high we can't get any
work done. That affects national security too.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, there is evidence that China may have used an
American-built high-performance computer in its nuclear weapons
program, according to U.S. officials and outside experts. That
evidence appears to conflict with Clinton Administration statements
that there is no link between U.S. exports of super-computers and
China's efforts to modernize its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   A select Congressional committee investigating illicit transfers
of U.S. high technology to China has been told that U.S. officials
saw a U.S. high-performance computer in use at a Chinese technical
center known to be involved in nuclear weapons design in the early
1990's, officials said. The congressional panel, chaired by Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., has been told that U.S. officials saw
the American-built high-performance computer at China's Institute
of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics in Beijing. That
facility was identified in 1997 by the Commerce Department as an
``entity of concern'' involved in developing weapons of mass
destruction or missiles used to deliver such weapons.

HOW THE U.N. MOVED LIBYAN BOMBING SUSPECTS, VERY DISCREETLY, TO
COURT
</HEADLINE>
  (With LOCKERBIE) 
 (nk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The operation was intricate, complex and above
all secret. No one except Hans Corell, the chief legal counsel for
the United Nations _ not even Secretary-General Kofi Annan _ knew
the details surrounding the logistics for the surrender of the two
Libyan suspects charged with planting the bomb that downed Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over the past two days, Annan, Corell and other
senior diplomats described eight months of intense political and
logistical maneuvering that produced the breakthrough, ending a
decadelong diplomatic impasse and giving the increasingly
marginalized United Nations a sorely needed victory.
</P>
<P>
   Annan disclosed, for instance, that all the legal and logistical
problems had been resolved by mid-November. He and Corell had even
asked Italy to lend the United Nations a Boeing 707 jet on which
U.N. markings were painted.
</P>
<P>
   Corell had located and interviewed trustworthy pilots,
personally approved the flight plan to the Netherlands and
recruited doctors and nurses to accompany the two ``passengers,''
as he called them. He had even ordered appropriate food _ no ham,
shellfish or alcohol, in light of Muslim dietary prohibitions _ and
taken steps to insure that the food would not be poisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Then Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Libya's eccentric leader, balked at
the deal that he and the Arab League had originally proposed _
putting the two suspected intelligence agents on trial in a third
country.
</P>
<P>
   So Annan orchestrated a discreet but relentless political
campaign to persuade Gadhafi, including a hitherto secret appeal by
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. As part of this appeal,
the United States assured Libya that the trial would not be used to
undermine the colonel's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he had realized early in his tenure as
secretary-general that Libya was slowly persuading the Organization
of African Unity, the Arab League and other countries that the two
Libyan suspects, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah, would never get a fair trial in Britain or the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Chad, Niger and Gambia, among other African states, began
flouting the U.N. sanctions by flying their leaders or senior
officials into Tripoli airport. And last summer the 53 members of
the Organization for African Unity voted to stop abiding by the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he realized that if NATO didn't find a way forward,
the economic sanctions would lose all legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, by rejecting ``every Libyan
proposal,'' the United States and Britain ``had boxed themselves
into a situation of being the stubborn negative ones.''
</P>
<P>
   What Annan called the ``first crack'' in the impasse occurred
last August when first Britain then, more reluctantly, the United
States agreed to the Libyan-endorsed Arab League proposal that the
two men could stand trial in the Netherlands under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ultimately decided,'' one American official said, ``that
agreeing to the Libyan proposal of a trial in third country would
box Libya in.'' If Gadhafi agreed, ``the impasse would be over,''
the official said. ``If he did not accept a version of his own
proposal, he would be embarrassed and ultimately isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October and November, U.N. lawyers led by Corell and a
Libyan legal team led by Kamel Hassan Maghur, a former foreign
minister, met quietly at the United Nations over several weeks to
``clarify'' the many thorny questions: Who would be authorized to
defend the Libyans in a Scottish court of law in the Netherlands?
Would the suspects would be considered ``passengers'' or
``prisoners'' on the flight from Libya?
</P>
<P>
   Corell quietly began preparing for the surrender and transfer.
All of the legal issues and arrangements were completed by Nov. 13,
Corell said, but still there was no political decision from
Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to work with the technicians and another to get
a political decision,'' Annan said. ``And we needed a political
decision, which is why I went to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In early December, Annan flew to Libya to meet with Gadhafi.
After several hours of one-on-one discussions in the leader's tent
outside Sirte, his desert capital, Annan said, he left convinced
that the colonel had realized that a deal ``had to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Libyan had repeatedly vowed publicly never to turn the
suspects over to a foreign court. ``So he had to manage his own
reality,'' Annan said, ``and reverse the dynamics he had created.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking no chances, Annan flew from Libya to an Arab summit
meeting in the United Arab Emirates, where he enlisted promises of
mediation and other support from President Nelson Mandela of South
Africa and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and their
emissaries. In the ensuing weeks, he said, he recruited dozens of
leaders, including Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Primakov,
to urge Gadhafi to accept the deal.
</P>
<P>
   An American official agreed that Russia, which has opposed
American policy on Iraq and Kosovo, had been ``very helpful'' in
resolving the Libyan impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the diplomats interviewed said they began to believe
that Gadhafi would surrender the suspects as promised only after
Mandela announced it on March 19 in a speech at Gadhafi's side in
Tripoli. Even then, Corell was so secretive that not even Annan
knew exactly when, where and how the Libyans would be moved.
</P>
<P>
   Corell, a meticulous lawyer with a passion for bird-watching and
playing bagpipes, left nothing to chance. An experienced negotiator
and appellate court judge in his native Sweden, he and a Russian
lawyer on his staff checked off item after item on their list, from
jet fuel to devising a seating plan for the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said Corell was obsessed with security, and rightly
so, given Libya's insistence on it and warnings the United Nations
had received about people who wanted to insure that the two men
would never stand trial in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday United Nations and American officials called the
surrender a vindication of the sanctions that many complained would
never work.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we decided to use a multilateral-sanctions
approach on a terrorism issue,'' an American official said. ``Now
there will be a trial, and justice will be done.''

SCOTLAND FORMALLY CHARGES TWO LIBYANS IN LOCKERBIE BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS 5th graf, The two Libyans ..., to conform suspects'
names to AP style.) (nk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands _ In a short session that the United
States and Britain had awaited for more than a decade, the Scottish
police formally charged two former Libyan intelligence agents on
Tuesday with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men were charged with conspiracy, murder and contravention
of the Aviation Security Act of 1982,'' a court official said.
</P>
<P>
   The listing of the charges included one other step: A police
officer read out, one by one, the names of the 270 people who died
in the air and on the ground after the jet exploded over the
Scottish village of Lockerbie. The victims, from 21 nations,
included 189 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the aircraft, believed to have been ordered by
Libya, brought severe U.N. sanctions against the country in 1992,
including an air embargo and a freeze of foreign assets. The
sanctions were suspended on Monday, hours after Libya handed over
the two suspects to a U.N. envoy in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
</P>
<P>
   The two Libyans suspected of planting the bomb, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, arrived in the Netherlands on
Monday. They now await trial by three Scottish judges, who will
hear the case without a jury on a former air base here.
</P>
<P>
   The base will be considered Scottish soil for the duration of
the process, which is likely to take more than a year. It was an
agreement to hold the trial in a country other than Britain or the
United States that finally ended Libya's resistance to handing over
the two men.
</P>
<P>
   The two Libyans were also brought separately before a Scottish
judge. A court official said that each defendant was accompanied by
his lawyers and an interpreter, who translated the proceedings into
Arabic. Neither man made a plea or a declaration, court officials
said. Both men have said in the past that they are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants' appearance before the police and the judge were
part of closed pretrial proceedings. The trial itself will be open
to the public. Under Scottish law, authorities have until April 15
to commit the defendants to trial, and the trial should then begin
within 110 days. But the start may be postponed for several more
months, Scottish officials here said, because defense lawyers have
asked for extra time to prepare their case.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy security surrounded Tuesday's events at Camp Zeist, a
former military base near Utrecht in the center of the country. The
base, set in quiet woodlands, is tightly sealed by metal fencing
and patrolled by Scottish police officers with heavy weapons and
trained dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are being kept in temporary cells until a more
permanent prison is finished. If they are convicted, they will
serve their sentence in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Several other buildings on the base are being converted for the
procedures. A police station and quarters for the more than 100
Scottish police officers and guards who have arrived here are
ready. But work is only just starting to convert a former school
into a courthouse and to adapt other quarters for offices and a
press center.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of converting the base and holding the trial has been
estimated at close to $200 million, which will be shared by Britain
and the United States. Dutch officials said that some of the work
was held off until the Scottish authorities were reasonably sure
that the two men would be handed over.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, many police officers and two prosecutors arrived here
from Scotland only this weekend. Scottish officials have not
announced who the judges will be.

MINING PLAN SPARKS CONTROVERSY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. -- The country's second-largest cement
company has found gray, grainy ``gold'' inside the hills of Soledad
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Transit Mixed Concrete Co., a subsidiary of Houston-based
Southdown Inc., wants to use 500 acres of the canyon in north Los
Angeles County for a $336 million mining project that would be
among the largest in the region. Company officials said the site
would rejuvenate dwindling stores of Portland concrete cement
aggregates, a key ingredient for the construction boom in the
suburban Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The county Regional Planning Commission will decide today
whether or not to delay hearings on the mining plan. Opposition has
been coalescing around the project, and an array of public and
private groups have asked for more time to study the plan's
potential environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials have agreed that more time should be given for
analysis. But they caution that the San Fernando Valley's dwindling
supply could dramatically increase construction costs in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   According to California Department of Conservation estimates,
the San Fernando Valley could run out of aggregates by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious problem,'' said Transit Mixed spokesman Brian
Mastin. ``The San Fernando Valley is going to experience cost
increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastin estimates that the Soledad Canyon mining project will
save developers, including public agencies, about $170 million in
transport costs compared to alternative mining sites in Southern
California's Orange County and the Antelope Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has agreed to pay the federal government $28
million in royalties. Of that money, the state would receive about
$1.1 million and the county would net $560,000.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the 20-year mining plan would eventually produce 56
million tons of high-quality gravel and sand, also known as
Portland cement concrete aggregates.
</P>
<P>
   PCC aggregates are used in everything from freeways to schools
to house foundations. One mile of an eight-lane freeway requires
about 80,000 tons of aggregates.
</P>
<P>
   The material sells for about $6 a ton at a quarry, but that
price increases dramatically if it has to be transported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trucking is the major way, almost the only way, of hauling
aggregate in Southern California, and it's very expensive relative
to the cost of the aggregate,'' said Russell Miller, senior
geologist with the state Department of Conservation. ``Every 35
miles equals the cost of the original aggregate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost concerns prompted the Valley Industry and Commerce
Association to vote last week to support the mining plan.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say the project's impact -- including traffic, air
quality and noise -- outweighs its benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have seized upon the project's environmental report as
proof that it will do irrevocable damage to the environment and
residents' health. The nearest residential area -- a small mobile
home park -- is within one quarter-mile of the project, and
thousands of people live within three or four miles of the site.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the mining plan will create
``unavoidable significant adverse impacts'' to regional air quality
and visual beauty. The project will also use more than 700
acre-feet of water per year in its second 10-year phase. An
acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimates that the mining operation will create up to
1,000 pounds of carbon monoxide and 1,770 pounds of nitrogen oxides
a day. Even after reduction measures, which the company says will
reduce emission by 40 percent, those levels exceed thresholds set
by the Southern California Air Quality Management District.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's environmental consultant, Carolyn Casavan of
West Coast Environmental and Engineering, said the average
emissions from the project will not exceed federal or state ambient
air quality standards for nearby residents.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say seasonal winds could blow those emissions far
beyond the project area, creating problems for residents across the
valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this project will damage a lot of people,'' said
Michael Karbacher, a resident of the nearby town of Agua Dulce.
``They'll get sick, and who's going to pay for that?''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Plambeck, a local environmentalist, agreed that the mine
would create health and environmental problems for years to come.
But she said the project and its problems speak to much deeper
development issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that if we're going to continue to build at the
rate that we're building, we're going to need aggregate,'' she
said. ``This kind of operation is one of the costs of sprawl.''

<P>
   TARZANA, Calif. -- In a deal that expands its footprint as the
state's largest regional independent laboratory, Unilab Corp. said
Tuesday it has agreed to buy competitor Physicians Clinical
Laboratory for about $36 million in stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento-based Physicians Clinical Laboratory, which does
business as Bio-Cypher Laboratories, is the state's second largest
independent laboratory company in terms of annual revenue. In 1998,
the company had revenues of about $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close in 30 to 60 days, pending approval
by federal regulators, said Melissa Mahoney, Unilab's spokeswoman.
Bio-Cypher has facilities in Sacramento, Fresno and Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase includes Bio-Cypher's customer lists and about $12
million in assets, primarily accounts receivable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly excited about the prospects this transaction
presents to Unilab. This acquisition of the BCL business is
consistent with our previously announced top-line growth
strategy,'' David Weavil, Unilab's chairman and chief executive,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1998 fourth quarter, Unilab earned $2.3 million, or 6
cents per share, on sales of $55.3 million. This compares with net
income of $900,000, or 2 cents per share, on sales of $52.7 million
in the 1997 fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 results reflect costs associated with an acquisition
during the year's fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Unilab operates more than 250 facilities throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Unilab jumped 18.75 cents to $3.25.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has approached Moscow to
serve as a go-between with Slobodan Milosevic in a new attempt to
find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore called Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov by
telephone and spoke to him for 40 minutes on Tuesday, asking
Russia's help in getting the Yugoslav leader to take steps that
would lead to a resumption of negotiations, Gore's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's contacts with Russia were reported as the administration
continued to explore other strategies to resolve the conflict
without using allied ground forces to fight the Serbians.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials gave no explanation for the timing of
the overture, and there was no indication of what had led up to it.
Primakov had traveled to Belgrade on March 30, a week after the
NATO bombing began, but that attempt at mediation was rebuffed by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore's office did not disclose Primakov's response on
Tuesday, an aide to the vice president said the two talked about
``how we might cooperate to urge Milosevic to take steps to end the
conflict.'' The vice president made ``the point there is a
diplomatic track and we'd prefer diplomacy to bombing,'' the aide
added.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Russians as a bridge to the Yugoslav president would
help resolve the problem the administration and NATO would have
dealing directly with Milosevic after denouncing him so fiercely
for the operation to drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo.
Milosevic has told officials in Europe that he is not willing to
deal directly with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials also said that actively
involving the Russians would help soothe relations with Moscow,
which has vehemently opposed the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the Russians would be asked to
urge Milosevic to accept the four points that the NATO allies
outlined last weekend as a condition for ending the NATO bombing.
These are the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, the return of
the refugees, the introduction of an international security force
and self-government for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Russians obtained the agreement that would be good for
the Russians,'' said a senior administration official. ``And it
would be good for us because we don't have to meet with
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing these four points in the past few days,
administration officials have talked of an ``international security
force,'' a more palatable phrase for the Russians and for
Milosevic, than the earlier references to a ``NATO-led''
peacekeeping force. But it would in fact be commanded by NATO,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, administration officials also said they were
considering a plan to make Kosovo an ``international
protectorate,'' instead of setting up an autonomous administration
as envisioned in the Rambouillet agreements for which NATO failed
to win Serbia's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   For now, officials are rejecting the idea of partitioning
Kosovo, with the Serbs keeping a northern portion of the province
and the remaining area being given to the ethnic Albanians. They
argued that this would reward Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   After a speech on Tuesday at the Brookings Institution here,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that the administration
was insisting that there be a ``permissive environment'' for the
international force.
</P>
<P>
   She reiterated that the administration had ``no plans or
intentions for ground forces in a non-permissive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The first round of diplomatic meetings on Kosovo since the NATO
strikes began will open in Brussels on Wednesday, with meetings of
the six-nation Contact Group, including Russia, the United States
and four NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians dropped their demand that NATO halt the bombing
before they would attend such a meeting, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is expected to attend a meeting of the foreign
ministers of the NATO allies in Brussels next Monday. If the
Contact Group meeting in Brussels goes well, it is possible that a
meeting of the group's foreign ministers will convene as well next
week. But for that to happen, a Western diplomat said, the Russians
would have to agree to the four principles laid down by NATO.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   How to deal with Milosevic has become a sore point for the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress have said that Milosevic should be
declared a war criminal and be dealt with only as such.
</P>
<P>
   At the middle levels of the administration, especially among
those who worked on Balkan issues during the war in Bosnia, there
is also strong opposition to negotiating with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials have painted Milosevic as the perpetrator of
the forced expulsions, they have not gone so far as to accuse his
forces of committing acts of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, has stopped just
short of using the word ``genocide,'' saying instead that there
were ``indicators of genocide'' by Milosevic's forces in Kosovo.
Pressed last weekend on whether Milosevic was a war criminal,
Albright said that was a definition that had to be determined after
a trial at the War Crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, one official said that the
administration had not ruled out dealing with Milosevic in person.
``We dealt with Stalin for years and years,'' the official said.
``We deal with the North Koreans.''

LAWSUIT CLAIMS CONTRACTORS OVERBILLED U.S. FOR NUCLEAR CLEANUP

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two federal contractors used a computerized
accounting scheme to overbill the Energy Department by at least $85
million for cleanup work at the Hanford nuclear reservation in
Washington state over the last 12 years, a former budget analyst
for the contractors charged in a lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S.
District Court in Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors, one a subsidiary of CBS Corp. and the other a
subsidiary of Fluor Daniel, were allowed to bill 14 cents for every
dollar they paid workers in straight time, to cover vacation, sick
time and holiday pay. But, the suit says, their computerized
accounting system added the 14 percent charge to overtime wages as
well, as if working extra hours created more vacation or holiday
days.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors compounded the improper charges, the suit says,
by plugging the inflated labor costs into formulas for calculating
pension and benefit costs and general overhead. For a Hanford
worker making $50,000 in regular wages and $10,000 in overtime, the
contractors billed the government $2,967 ``in purely nonexistent
costs,'' the suit says. They kept two sets of books and never
divulged the real costs to the government, according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which seeks $240 million in damages, was filed by
David Carbaugh under the False Claims Act, which lets employees
collect 15 to 30 percent of any damages recovered, in order to
encourage whistle-blowers. The Justice Department has decided not
to join the suit, a decision often made separate from the merits of
the claim.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for one of the contractors, Westinghouse Hanford Co., a
subsidiary of CBS Corp., which bought Westinghouse Electric Corp.,
said Carbaugh's accusations were similar to those he made in a
lawsuit filed in 1996 and were untrue. A spokesman for the other
contractor, Fluor Daniel Hanford Inc., a division of Fluor Daniel,
said the company was not aware of Tuesday's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Carbaugh, an accountant, said in a telephone interview that some
of the money was used to pay surplus management employees who were
being laid off from other Energy Department sites as the department
went out of the business of making nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the independent panel that advises the federal
and state governments on Hanford said he believed the accusations.
The official, Gerry Pollet, chairman of a subcommittee of the
Hanford Advisory Board that considers overhead charges, said,
``We've been hounding the Energy Department on how much of our
cleanup dollars go to the contractor's overhead. It's obscene. If
you pay $1 billion a year for cleanup, you'll spend about $300
million for Fluor Daniel's overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   Board members are appointed by the Energy Department, the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Washington state Department
of Ecology.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, which is the investigative arm of
Congress, identified the Energy Department in 1990 as ``a high-risk
area vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement,'' citing
the department's ``history of weak oversight of contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   The department did not have enough personnel ``with the
appropriate skills to effectively oversee the contractors'
operations,'' the accounting office found in a February 1997
report. The accounting office said that the Energy Department had
undertaken a reform program ``unprecedented in scope'' in 1994.
Most of the abuses alleged by Carbaugh would have occurred before
then.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead expenses, also known as indirect costs, have been the
subject of a long-running struggle between the contractors and
critics, among them Pollet and Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash. An Energy
Department report on Fluor Daniel's performance for the 12 months
ending Sept. 30, 1998, said that the company had provided financial
information to Smith ``that was inconsistent with earlier data,''
and that at one point the company had provided ``incorrect indirect
cost numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But department officials say that although they have not seen
the complaint filed Tuesday, they had been working with Carbaugh
and had not found anything that was illegal or violated the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the department, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said, ``We haven't seen the filing yet,'' but he said
that if it contained any information suggesting that the
contractors ``improperly received federal funds, then we will
pursue it vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbaugh, 43, began as an accountant at Hanford in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Carbaugh said that the Justice Department was aware
of the suit and had indicated it might join it later. ``The
government frequently turns down cases that may be difficult to put
together,'' said Cyrus Mehri, one of the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for Westinghouse, Robert Dutton, said that if the
Justice Department did not join the case, ``it generally means
government does not believe there's merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Westinghouse ran the 560-square-mile site for the Energy
Department from June 1, 1987, until Sept. 30, 1996, when Fluor
Daniel took over. Production of weapons material stopped in 1987,
and most work at the site since then has been cleanup, with a
budget now exceeding $1.4 billion a year. According to the suit,
labor accounts for about 60 percent of that cost.
</P>
<P>
   Carbaugh, who worked for Westinghouse and then Fluor Daniel in
the same job, said he complained to his supervisors and later to
Energy Department accountants in Richland, Wash., near the
reservation. ``Some of the people I talked to,'' he said, ``it went
right over their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said it did not go over the head of Westinghouse, which,
he said, retaliated by giving him impossible amounts of work and
then no work, or the head of Fluor Daniel, which fired him shortly
after it took over.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims that the companies may not have kept all extra
money, but used the extra 14 percent to pad their cost estimates,
and then collected performance bonuses for completing work under
budget. The basic management fee was also inflated, since it was
based on the size of the budget, which itself was inflated,
according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims that Carbaugh was driven into depression by
harassment at work.

GENETIC DAMAGE IN YOUNG SMOKERS IS LINKED TO LUNG CANCER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smoking during childhood or adolescence may lead to lasting or
even permanent genetic damage in the lungs that increases the risk
of lung cancer, even after the smoker quits, researchers said in
findings to be published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The developing lungs of young people may be especially
vulnerable to cigarette smoke, the scientists said. They said their
research linked the amount of damage to the age when people started
smoking, regardless of how many years they smoked or how recently
they had quit.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, from the University of California at San
Francisco School of Medicine, said the findings were particularly
alarming, given the number of teen-agers who smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're right,'' said Dr. John K. Wiencke, who led the
research effort, ``it says that something happens in adolescence
that changes you, perhaps forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings, which are being published Wednesday in the Journal
of the National Cancer Institute, are based on an analysis of blood
and tissue from 143 patients with lung cancer. The researchers
looked for alterations in DNA, which are known to be caused by
tobacco and to be linked to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Levels of alterations, called DNA adducts, were lowest among
patients who had never smoked. In ex-smokers they were somewhat
higher and in people who still smoked, higher still. But in
ex-smokers, the highest levels were found in those who started
smoking as children or teen-agers, regardless of when they had
quit.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not compare the patients' adduct levels to those
of people who do not have lung cancer. Nevertheless, other
researchers said it was an important and surprising finding.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Minna, a lung cancer expert and director of the Hamon
Center for Cancer Research at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center in Dallas, said the DNA adducts measured by the
researchers were a good indicator of genetic damage caused by
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now about half of new lung cancer cases are occurring in
former smokers,'' Minna said. ``If it turns out that a very brief
period of smoking during adolescence, or starting then, will have
this long-lasting effect in terms of cancer development, even if
you stop at a young age, that is absolutely frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer experts had thought that smokers who began as children or
teen-agers had higher rates simply because they had been smoking
longer. The new findings, Minna said, ``suggest something entirely
different,'' and cited the many lung cancer patients who get the
disease in their 50s, even though they have not smoked for 20 years
or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of what happens,'' he said. ``We have a generation of
people who smoked as teen-agers, quit, changed their lifestyles and
now are just walking time bombs for cancer to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiencke said he and his colleagues could not immediately explain
their findings. But he noted that chemicals in tobacco smoke
``physically go after DNA and attach themselves to it and
potentially cause problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he and his colleagues had expected to find that
the amount of damage in the lungs was related to the total number
of cigarettes people had smoked in their lifetimes, or to how
recently they had quit, not when they started smoking. Of the 143
people in the study, 57 were smokers, 79 were ex-smokers smokers
and 7 had never smoked.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new findings, cancer experts are unlikely to abandon
their urgent advice that smokers quit, because some of the lung
damage from smoking does heal with time. But the new research
suggests that damage early in life may be the most persistent.
</P>
<P>
   According to surveys by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, more than a third of high school students smoke
regularly, and the percentage has been on the rise. About three
million teenagers are smokers, the government says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids think they are invincible; they're not,'' Minna said.
``We've got to figure out how to get them not to smoke those first
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research has found that smoking by children or
adolescents stunts their lung development, and that tobacco
addictions begun in youth are the hardest to break.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of smokers ultimately die of smoking-related
diseases, including cancer, heart failure, stroke and lung
disorders like emphysema.

<P>
   After climbing to the 22,000-foot summit of a volcano in
northern Argentina, archeologists have found three frozen Inca
mummies, 500-year-old remains of a ritual sacrifice, which are so
well preserved that blood is still present in the heart and lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of two girls and a boy were buried beneath five feet
of rock and dirt, amid a cache of statuettes, pottery and ornate
textiles associated with human sacrifices in the Inca religion.
They had apparently been frozen since immediately after death. Two
of the mummies were in such excellent condition, physicians said,
that all their internal organs were intact. It was as if they had
died only recently.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists and other scholars said that the findings should
yield important insights into the religion and the worship of
sacred mountains in the Inca empire, which spanned most of the
Andes and the western coast of South America at the time of the
Spanish conquest in the early 16th century. They said the mummies
and artifacts were even more impressive than the discovery of the
Peruvian ``Ice Maiden,'' another frozen body of an Inca sacrifice
found in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The new discovery, made on Mount Llullaillaco, at Argentina's
border with Chile, was announced on Tuesday by Dr. Johan Reinhard,
an American archeologist and mountaineer who led an
American-Argentine-Peruvian expedition supported by the National
Geographic Society. He described the mummies and other finds at a
news conference in Salta, Argentina, and in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preservation of the mummies is just fantastic,'' Reinhard
said. ``It's eerie looking at the arms. You can still see the light
hair on their arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The archeologist said that they were the best preserved of any
mummy he had ever seen. In recent years, he has ascended the peaks
of mountains in Argentina, Chile and Peru and come down with 18
mummies, all apparent sacrifices to the sacred mountains.
Physicians so far could not establish how the three individuals,
probably between 8 and 15 years old, met their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the explorers could determine, the mummies and other
offerings to the Inca gods appeared to have been undisturbed
through the centuries. Gold, silver and shell statues, from two to
seven inches tall, were arranged on the burial platform just as
they probably were for the ritual sacrifices. Half of the statues
were clothed. Other artifacts included pottery, some of it still
containing food, and bundles of alpaca textiles that appeared to
establish the sacrifice victims as elite members of the society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The undamaged female has a beautiful, yellow geometrically
designed cover laid over her outer mantle,'' Reinhard said. She
also wore a feathered headdress.
</P>
<P>
   Below the summit, at about the 17,000-foot level, the expedition
found the stone ruins and ceramics of a camp where participants in
the rituals presumably stayed before the final ascent to the peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a scientific point of view,'' said Dr. Craig Morris, an
Andean anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in
New York City, ``these artifacts and the base camp are at least as
important as the mummies in determining the meaning of these
rituals.''
</P>
<P>
   The textiles, for example, were expected to provide clues to the
status and ethnic origins of the young people chosen for human
sacrifice, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Burger, an archeologist of early Andean
civilizations at Yale University, said that the preservation of the
bodies gave medical scientists an opportunity to conduct more
revealing tests of the diet, health and genetics of the victims.
The blood should lead to DNA studies of the genetic composition of
these people.
</P>
<P>
   These and other recent discoveries, Burger said, were important
as established cases of capac cocha, or human offerings, by the
Inca because there had been a suspicion that the Spanish conquerors
had exaggerated their accounts of such practices, as well as
cannibalism and odd sexual mores, to justify their conquests.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhard had explored Mount Llullaillaco several times before,
mapping ruins and trying the trail to the top. Last month, the
expedition battled driving snow and winds near the summit. ``We had
several days of finding nothing,'' he said. ``I was about to give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 16, the team found the first burial. One of the workers
had to be lowered into a hole by his ankles so that he could pull
the mummy out. Then they found the two others. One of the mummies,
a female, had been damaged on the left side by a lightning strike,
but the other two were undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   Calling ahead by cellular phones, the archeologists had
Argentine military vehicles waiting for them when the descended the
mountain with their cargo of mummies wrapped in plastic, snow and
foam insulation. The bodies were still frozen when they reached
Salta, a city about 300 miles away. Some members of the team were
from the Center for the Conservation of High Altitude Cultural
Patrimony, in Salta. Constanza Ceruti, an Argentine archeologist,
was a co-leader of the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   The mummies are to remain refrigerated in Salta for further
tests. Reinhard said he had more mountains to climb in search of
Inca sacrifices.

LOVE, SUCCESS AND HAPPINESS: MORE HOW-TO BOOKS TAKING A

   MILL VALLEY, Calif. _ John Gray makes no bones about it: He
loves all the money and fame he's reaped from ``Men Are From Mars,
Women Are From Venus,'' the hugely successful gender-gap guidebook
on which he's built a lucrative empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love material things,'' says the affable author, whose 1992
best-seller has sold 10 million copies. But all of his ``outer''
success ``would be so hollow if I didn't have the love in my life
or the spirituality,'' says Gray, touching on a central theme of
his new best-seller, ``How to Get What You Want and Want What You
Have: A Practical and Spiritual Guide to Personal Success''
(HarperCollins, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   It's one of a growing crop of self-help books with a spiritual
bent, how-tos that promise ways to achieve worldly ambitions and
inner peace. The market for these books is booming, fueled largely
by aging Baby Boomers searching for deeper meaning in their hectic,
striving lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely seeing more how-to books that have a strong
spiritual element,'' says Daisy Maryles, executive editor of
Publishers Weekly. ``It's not a new trend, but it's a trend that
has mushroomed in the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   Topping the New York Times' how-to best-seller list this week is
Oakland financial guru Suze Orman's ``The Courage to Be Rich:
Creating a Life of Material and Spiritual Abundance'' (Riverhead
Books, $24.95), which proffers that ``in order to become rich, your
self-worth has to rise with your net worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``One Day My Soul Just Opened Up: 40 Days and 40
Nights Toward Spiritual Strength and Personal Growth''
(Fireside/Simon &AMP; Schuster; $13), the best-seller by Iyanla
Vanzant, the minister, empowerment specialist and Yoruban priestess
whose ``In the Meantime: Finding Yourself and the Love You Want''
was one of last year's top 10 nonfiction best-sellers.
</P>
<P>
   So was Sarah Ban Breathnach's ``Something More: Excavating Your
Authentic Self'' (Warner Books; $20), which is still selling. Even
the Dalai Lama, bless his ancient soul, has a hit _ ``The Art of
Happiness'' (Riverhead; $22.95), ``a handbook for living'' written
with psychiatrist Howard C. Cutler that's been on the New York
Times nonfiction best-seller list for 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The approaching millennium and the increased stress of daily
life are ``causing a certain amount of angst, Maryles says, trying
to explain the trend. ``People are focusing on their inner lives,
their personal lives, searching for a balance. Baby Boomers are
getting older and starting to deal with bigger life issues. They're
looking for books that will offer greater meaning. In the fast
'80s, people were interested in making big bucks; now they're
searching for something more spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, writers such as Alan Watts and Ram Dass popularized
the Hindu and Buddhist ideas that are being recycled in current
self-help books such as El Cerrito, Calif., writer Carol Adrienne's
1998 ``The Purpose of Your Life'' _ ``As seen on `Oprah,' says a
sticker on the new paperback edition (Eagle Brook/William Morrow;
$13) _ and spiritualist Barbara Biziou's forthcoming ``The Joy of
Ritual'' (Golden Books; $18.95), endorsed by fans such as fashion
designer Donna Karan.
</P>
<P>
   But Dass and Watts spoke primarily to the counterculture; this
current crop of New Agey books is ``reaching a much wider,
mainstream audience,'' Maryles says. ``It's a huge market.'' Last
year's big spiritual how-to's sold between 500,000 and 750,000
copies each.

   Gray's new book serves up a mix of Eastern meditation,
simplified Western psychology, common sense and fortune-cookie
aphorism (``Money can't buy happiness'').
</P>
<P>
   Gray is a former personal assistant to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
who now works from a woodsy house in Mill Valley, Calif., north of
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are unhappy because they've stopped wanting what they
have, they've disconnected from their essential self,'' says the
boyish, 47-year-old therapist, who lives with his wife and three
kids in a bigger Mill Valley house on three acres at the foot of
Mount Tamalpais.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Mars/Venus'' empire encompasses sequels, videos,
workshops, counseling centers, a board game and a forthcoming
cable-TV talk show. There's obviously a market for the message Gray
and other how-to authors are selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our society, we're not grounded in our feeling self; we
don't have this natural place of happiness that comes from within.
We believe that happiness comes from a bigger car, a bigger house,
a bigger paycheck, a better wardrobe. And if you are happy, the
material world (set ital)will(end ital) make you happier. I (set
ital)love(end ital) my nice new car (a black Lexus). But if I
wasn't already happy, it would make me miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is, you've got to start with yourself, you've got
to be happy with what you've got, then when you start getting more,
you'll be happy with that. ... Outer success magnifies your inner
state.''
</P>
<P>
   He cheerfully acknowledges that many of his ideas aren't
original and sound obvious. ``Everything I say is common sense,''
he says. ``Everything I said in `Men Are From Mars, Women Are
Venus' was common sense. ... People are always saying, `You only
said the obvious. Why did you sell so many books?' I say, `Cause
nobody said the obvious before, quite that way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Books by Gray, Vanzant and other spiritual how-to writers are
stacked prominently at Borders Books in San Rafael, Calif., where
the self-help section is hopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't sell many Bibles, but we sell tons of these,'' says
clerk Dennis Spillane (when a customer asked which way to the
self-help section, the witty Spillane told him he'd have to find it
himself).
</P>
<P>
   ``People want something more than their Mercedes and big houses,
they want some sense of inner happiness.'' These books touch on
some basic truths, Spillane says, ``but most of this is
surface-oriented stuff; it doesn't go very deep. They're all
selling a dream.''

   MILL VALLEY, Calif. _ John Gray does long-distance healing, but
he doesn't use AT&AMP;T, MCI or Sprint. He says he's plugged into a
higher power source.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just think of the person and send them energy,'' says
Gray, a former Transcendental Meditation monk who's far more famous
for his best-selling books about male-female relationships than for
his spiritual activities.
</P>
<P>
   When not on the road, Gray does hands-on healings on Fridays at
the Tamalpais Pain Clinic in Corte Madera, Calif. He calls on the
Virgin Mary to heal certain patients, he says, ``generally women
who have self-esteem issues _ they feel unworthy, they've got
guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary comes to him every week, he says, but ``she doesn't appear
like a physical being; it's a vision in your mind's eye.'' She's
just one of the spirits he's in touch with. ``If somebody has a
Hindu background, I will invite Krishna. If somebody has a Hindu
guru, I'll invite their guru in. ... I'm all religions. I see the
good in all religions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray doesn't get into most of this stuff in his new book, ``How
to Get What You Want and Want What You Have.'' But he's spending
several hours a day doing a meditation-prayer for everyone who
reads the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I send them healing energy and I send them blessings,'' he
says. ``The blessing is helping them to know what they want and get
what they want; the healing energy is to heal the blocks or the
sickness in their bodies. As soon as I even say it, energy is
pouring out of my fingertips. I spend half the time sending out the
energy, half the time drawing out negative energy from their lives.
It's just like I'm doing a long-distance healing on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Having soaked up all that negative energy, Gray has to
``decharge'' it out into nature. ``I sit by the pool, or sit by the
garden and put my hands out. I go for a walk in the oak forests of
Marin County, and it just pours off of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he says, ``I'm a spiritual healer. But I don't say that in
any lofty way. I mean, it's like a job.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing the dangers of ``primitive'' hatreds from
Kosovo to the American South, President Clinton urged Congress
Tuesday to expand the definition of federal hate crimes to include
incidents based on a person's sexual orientation, gender or
disability. The current law covers crimes based on race, color,
religion or national origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``America will not be able to be a force for good abroad unless
we are good at home,'' Clinton said at the White House. He said
that in 1997, more than 8,000 hate crimes were reported in the
United States, almost one per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration backed a similar bill last year and
expected that the murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay Wyoming college
student, would increase support for it. But the bill languished in
the Senate Judiciary Committee without a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement took place the day after Russell
Henderson was sentenced to life in prison for Shepard's murder, but
White House aides said the event had been scheduled a month ago and
was not timed to coincide with the sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton did link hate crimes in America with the ethnic
cleansing in Kosovo and said the United States should at least set
an example by not tolerating such bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone dies in a horrible incident in America,'' Clinton
said, ``or when we see slaughter or ethnic cleansing abroad, we
should remember that we defeat these things by teaching and by
practicing a different way of life and by reacting vigorously when
they occur within our own midst.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that several companies, including AT&AMP;T and Court TV,
would join the federal Departments of Justice and Education to help
teach tolerance to middle-school students.
</P>
<P>
   The current law not only limits the categories of crime that can
be considered hate crimes, it also requires that the victims be
participating in one of six federally protected activities when the
crime occurs. These include attending public school, voting and
traveling on an interstate highway. The proposed legislation would
eliminate these circumstances as a precondition for a hate crime to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for the legislation in Congress are uncertain. Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who has
scheduled a hearing on the subject for this month, said last year
that he had mixed feelings about it. He noted that state and
federal laws already allowed for punishing hate crimes. But he also
said the law might be needed to highlight the fact that ``there's a
punishment that comes from being vicious and vindictive against
people who you might not agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Knight, senior director of cultural studies at the
conservative Family Research Council, said he opposed the law
because it would establish unequal protection for certain citizens
and allow the president to advance a ``homosexual agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the president's real purpose was ``to go into middle
schools and teach children diversity _ as if all children are being
misled at home by their parents and have to be re-educated by the
federal government.'' This, he said, ``is a hate crime against
parents.''

FAVORITE'S ROLE GOES TO DUVAL, THIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ At Tiger Woods' news conference on Tuesday, the
first question referred to David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far different atmosphere from last year, when Woods
arrived at the Masters as the defending champion, the clear-cut
favorite and the center of attention. Since then, the spotlight has
shifted. Mark O'Meara has replaced Woods as the reigning Masters
champion. Duval recently replaced Woods as the world's No. 1-ranked
player. And Duval, with four victories already this year, has
replaced Woods as the favorite this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   So as Woods prepared for Thursday's opening round at Augusta
National Golf Club, motivation was not a problem. Woods is not a
No. 2 kind of guy. For many reasons, he wants another green jacket,
and if he has to stare down Duval on Sunday to get it, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Woods wouldn't mind seeing what many people want to see
_ a final-round showdown between himself and Duval. But let others
worry about the script. Woods simply wants the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm in the lead with nine holes to go, I like my chances,''
said Woods, who won in 1997 by a record-setting 12 strokes, setting
a tournament record (270) in the process. ``David's not going to
play as Tiger vs. me, and I'm not playing against David. I've got
to play against the golf course as well as the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're tied for the lead with nine holes to go, then that's
the way it is. If it comes down to that, it would be nice to play
against the best player in the world right now. But if it doesn't
happen, and I can still win, a win's a win. I'll take a second
green jacket anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods makes no secret of scheduling his year, and his life,
around the year's four major championships. He has money, he has
fame, but what he wants most from his career is a place in history,
and winning majors is the path to that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of defending his title at the BellSouth Classic, which
Duval won, Woods spent last week at home, working with his coach,
Butch Harmon, and mentally preparing for this week's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Before majors, Woods is like a boxer in training, taking great
measures to eliminate outside distractions. But Woods appeared far
more relaxed than last year, when he finished tied for eighth place
and seemed burdened by the weight of defending his championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll be a lot more comfortable at Augusta this
year,'' said Harmon when asked about Woods recently. ``But like he
has said before, he enjoyed putting the green jacket on Mark last
year. This year, he'd like Mark to put the green jacket back on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, there are two keys for Woods _ driving the
ball accurately and making putts. Woods' length off the tee gives
him a tremendous advantage at Augusta, with its wide fairways. But
if Woods drives the ball erratically, he will have trouble
attacking Augusta's fast and undulating greens, where positioning
is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, Woods has not putted recently with the precision and
confidence he showed in 1997, when he played the Masters without a
three-putt. In the past 18 months, Woods has had 18 top-10
finishes, but only two victories. A few more made putts would have
equaled a few more victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating from the standpoint that I was playing well,
but not getting the victories,'' Woods said. ``It hasn't been one
of those stretches where I'm making shots at the right times. But
I'm more consistent all around.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Duval has won 11 times on the PGA Tour since October 1997,
compared with two victories for Woods during that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a little bit of a rivalry between Tiger and David?''
asked O'Meara, one of Woods' closest friends. ``Yeah, probably.
Does Tiger want to get that No. 1 ranking back? Probably.''
</P>
<P>
   Augusta remains a place that plays to Woods' strengths. Having
seen the changes at Augusta _ the new tees at No. 2 and No. 17, the
new green at No. 11, and the new trees at No. 15 _ Woods believes
the course favors longer hitters even more. At No. 17, the tee has
been moved back 20 to 25 yards, but Woods can still clear the
Eisenhower tree with his drive. For shorter hitters, the tree is an
obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   What Woods wants is to play well enough to at least give himself
a chance on Sunday. And having won at Augusta before, Woods knows
he can handle the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives you confidence down the stretch, when you're a
little nervous, hands sweating, eyeballs beating,'' he said. ``You
can summon enough strength to do it, because you've done it before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking to getting this thing going. It's a major, a
little different story than playing the regular tour event. I
really grind and get ready. Because that's really what it's all
about _ winning the big ones.''

Woods remains calm in face of Duval's ascension to No. 1
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUGUSTA, Ga. _ In case anybody was worried, golf's Big Cat hasn't
coughed up a hairball just because he's not the No. 1 player in the
world anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods isn't going berserk about the sequence of events
that has propelled David Duval to the top spot in the sport. He
hasn't started smoking, developed a nervous twitch or looked for
the nearest 10th-floor ledge. No matter what you hear, Woods isn't
driving himself crazy trying to figure out how to recapture the No.
1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as he comes into the Masters, he says he's come to
grips with the reality of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that's cyclical,'' he said.
``Everybody's going to have their runs. David's having his run now.
It's all part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good motivation, the fact that David is playing
extremely well. But you can't get caught up in that and have that
as your only motivating factor. Whether you're No. 1 in the world
or missing cuts, you still have to try to get better and I have
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can say he's good for me. I think he's good
from the standpoint that he's playing so well. And that's what we
all want to do. So as players, we want to get to where he's at
right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing better, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in his next breath, Woods proved he isn't necessarily
thrilled with the idea of having to look up to see the top of the
world rankings. He did so in the only way rock-hard competitors
can. He held up the one argument in his favor that Duval doesn't
have _ a major championship. And tacked on a little intimidating
talk for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps knowing that you have done it,'' Woods said of his
win at Augusta National in 1997. ``You're able to fend off the best
players in the world because you know you've won a major. That
gives you confidence down the stretch when you are a little
nervous, your hands are sweating, your eyeballs are beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can summon enough strength to do it again because you've
done it before.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid, but clearly inferred, is the fact Duval hasn't
conquered those sweaty palms and pounding blood vessels yet.
</P>
<P>
   Gamesmanship is part of every sport. Michael Jordan, Nolan Ryan
and all the other greats didn't get to the top without mastering
the fine art of getting in an opponent's head.
</P>
<P>
   Woods didn't deny that he and many others use the same tricks if
they think it will give them a mental edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's gamesmanship being played every week,'' Woods said.
``I think that the public just doesn't know what to look at. Guys
will pull some things. Either you can't hear it or you don't see
it, but guys definitely are doing it out there. You know, Sam Snead
told me last year at the Champions Dinner that he used to cough
during guys' swings, right on the downswing. It happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seve (Ballesteros) tends to get a little sore throat every
once in a while. You know, clearing the throat. It's just part of
the game. In other sports, it's a little more apparent. But this
sport is a little more subdued. But nevertheless, it's still out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' admission that the mind games have begun is perhaps the
truest sign that being No. 2 for the first time in his golfing life
is just a wee bit unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   He was the best when he was an amateur. He was the best when he
turned pro and ran the table at Augusta National two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was the best in the world for 43 consecutive weeks, according
to the world rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's Avis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating from the standpoint that I've been playing
well and not getting the victories,'' said Woods. ``If you look at
my finishes, I was always in the top five, right around the lead.
But I wasn't able to get a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   He has one this year, coming at San Diego in February. His
one-win season thus far pales in comparison to Duval, who has four
wins including the last two times he's teed it up.
</P>
<P>
   Among the PGA Tour brethren, the feeling is that Woods is primed
to make a rebuttal to Duval's strong showing of the past two years,
during which time he has won 11 of the last 34 tournaments he has
entered. Whether or not this is wishful thinking so that a bona
fide rivalry between the two evolves remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing for certain right now is that Duval is the king
and Woods is the one who has lost the throne in a hostile coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember in 1994 and '95 when I was really playing well
that I walked to the first tee and wondered who was going to finish
second this week,'' Greg Norman said. ``That's not from pure
arrogance. That's from pure confidence. To be playing that well and
be that confident as David is now, it must be an unbelievable
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Woods' case, Norman believes the coming months will be
very telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on if a person wants that spot,'' Norman said.
``Tiger will come back fighting hard. Anybody who wants to be that
No. 1 player in the world, they'll go after it. But again, it
depends on the priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods apparently has his priorities in order. He has been
working hard in the past few weeks, aiming specifically at the
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the hard work leading up to this week) has nothing to do
with the No. 1 thing,'' Woods said. ``It's because this is a major.
It's a little different story with a major than playing the regular
tour event. I really grind and get ready, because that's really
what it's all about is winning the big ones.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a good year so far for Woods on the course, but a
tough one in other respects. Aside from losing the No. 1 ranking to
Duval, he also has come under fire from some corners (Arnold Palmer
in particular) for his emotional style on the course.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the No. 1 ranking is no big deal, Woods claims. But
questioning his etiquette is a little more damaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``My emotions are just the way they are and I can't really hide
them _ nor should I,'' Woods said. ``That's not my personality. I
play best when I let my emotions go. If I'm frustrated, I get them
out of my system. If I'm winning, I show I'm excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's funny growing up and hearing the telecasts of
people saying golfers show no emotions. Then along comes people
like myself who show emotion and they're saying he shouldn't show
any emotion. I just scratch my head at that one. I think golfers
need to be themselves, whoever that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has a supporter for his actions on the course _ Duval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger's a star outside the game,'' Duval said. ``I respect the
burden he's had to carry since he kind of burst onto the scene. I
don't think that, because I've passed him at No. 1, that I've been
given more responsibility. Some people are just more outside the
game. He's who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   And Woods is enjoying himself more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually having more fun (than years past),'' he said.
``I'm having so much fun out here, it's pretty scary because I
understand how things work. I understand a lot more about the Tour
and about myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I look like I'm not having fun out there playing
because I'm not smiling. Well, I'm focused. I'm trying to win. And
you can't always smile when you're trying to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is no question that Woods wants to win _ now more than
ever.

STAR WARS CHARACTERS COMING TO CANDY STORES 
</HEADLINE>
 WARS-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If waiting for the new ``Star Wars'' flick has you feeling like
a famished Jabba the Hutt before the big feed, then Scott McWhinnie
has a timely snack to sate your appetite.
</P>
<P>
   McWhinnie is ``PEZident'' of Pez Candy, Inc., the maker of the
popular plastic dispensers featuring toy heads that tilt back and
eject pellet-size sweets. His company, known for its dispensers of
Minnie Mouse, Bugs Bunny and other characters, is heading into a
galaxy far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   Pez this month began selling four new ``Star Wars'' dispensers
in anticipation of the frenzy leading up to the May 19 release of
``Episode I: The Phantom Menace.'' The new dispensers show the
heads of Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett and the
furry-faced Ewoks. The company already has other well-known ``Star
Wars'' faces in its arsenal _ Darth Vader, C-3PO, Stormtroopers,
Yoda and Chewbacca.
</P>
<P>
   More are coming.
</P>
<P>
   McWhinnie said that hooking up with one of the most eagerly
anticipated movies of all time was a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the synergy of all those lovers of ``Star Wars''
collectibles, and those people who want new things to add to their
Pez collection,'' he said Tuesday from company headquarters in
Orange, Conn. ``It's a big thing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It many ways it is deja vu, Pez-style. In 1996, PEZ bigwigs
trekked to Skywalker Ranch, the Northern California corporate
office of ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas, to discuss merging
his characters with the candy that gets its name from the German
word for peppermint _ pfefferminz. ``They loved us, we loved
them,'' McWhinnie explained.
</P>
<P>
   But Pez officials had no idea that in the following year _ 1997
_ the three movies in the ``Star Wars'' series would be restored
and returned to the big screen. So they were pleasantly surprised
when their first wave of ``Star Wars'' Pez characters coincided
with the re-release, generating sales that were out of this world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sales shot up 36 percent,'' McWhinnie said, adding the
Stars Wars' re-release was ``a large factor'' in those gains.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Pez officials hope the release of ``The Phantom Menace'' will
create a similar boost, not to mention add new characters _ on top
of the 150 characters currently in production _ to the Pez family.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, those plastic heads are under wraps _ until the
``Phantom'' appears. ``I can't tell you (about those) characters,''
McWhinnie said with a chuckle. ``I was at a private showing. I had
to sign my name to get in.''

The stage is set for another year of high drama at Augusta National
Golf Club
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all the places on this planet to play golf, nowhere are the
legends and the memories and the fantasies more alive than Augusta
National Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   It's the little corner of acreage that has given us so much. It
brought Jack Nicklaus to his final glorious victory, and just as
fatefully brought Greg Norman to his knees twice. It's the place in
the mental snapshot where little kids dream of making a 20-foot
putt to win the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It has seen Gene Sarazen's double-eagle on No. 15 and Tom
Weiskopf's 13 on No. 12.
</P>
<P>
   In Caddyshack, when Bill Murray was whacking chrysanthemums with
his cutlass, he was en route to winning a mythical Masters, not the
Greater Milwaukee Open or the Ryder Cup or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta National, home of the Masters. It's golf's most
recognizable shrine. It really is a tradition unlike any other.
</P>
<P>
   Certain sporting events drip with drama. The Masters is flooded
with it. Every year, some of the world's best golfers trounce
around the world's most famous golf course and produce memories
that last generations. There's always a riveting finish or a
thrilling shot or a historic footnote at Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   Why? It's a question that has so many answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holes lend themselves to that sort of thing,'' says Mark
Calcavecchia, usually a contender at Augusta but never a winner.
``With the water on the back nine and those hard greens being the
way they are, there's always going to be something happening there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's historic is what it is. You always get great players. And
with those kind of conditions, weird things can happen. Sandy Lyle
birdied 16 and 18 the year (1988) he beat me. He didn't have to do
that. But that's the kind of stuff that happens at Augusta.''
</P>
<P>
   Golfers young and old on the PGA Tour and around the world know
what to expect when they pass down Magnolia Lane _ also known as
the toughest 250-yard carry in golf if you don't own a Masters
ticket or a world-class golf game.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected is always on tap, just like the afternoon ales in
the men's grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got great golfers in difficult circumstances,'' says
No. 1-ranked David Duval. ``When you have that, crazy things are
going to happen _ both good and bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating yearly mystery and intrigue comes easy for Augusta
National. First, the former nursery is primped to beauty-contest
standards. Then, the grass is shaved off the greens, except for
little stublets that only serve to keep golf balls from rolling
away in a stiff breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Augusta greens are built to require shots that land in
the correct quadrant. If not, you're left with putts up one tier
and/or down another. That simply makes putting the most
nerve-wracking business in a completely white-knuckle week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to let your tail feathers fly there,'' Hal Sutton
says. ``They say the greens there are 13 on the Stimpmeter (10 is
considered dangerously fast). But a lot of times, I think they're
faster than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have any nervousness at all, it's going to show up on
those greens. You can have a four- or five-footer and if you're not
careful, you've got a 20-footer coming back. In that respect, you
can get a lot of drama at that course. I've never played well at
Augusta, so I don't really care for some of the drama I've seen
there.''
</P>
<P>
   At all PGA Tour events, people who manage the golf course best
usually have a great chance of winning. At the Masters, you have to
manage something else _ yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only whoever can hit the shots, but whoever can
maintain things and keep their cool,'' says Davis Love III.
``That's exactly what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will provide us with tomorrow's memories this week at
Augusta National? Fortunately, nobody knows. It would ruin
everything if we did. But it's a sure thing that something wild
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   It could be Tiger Woods coming back strong in response to
Duval's ascension to the No. 1 position in the world and winning
for the second time in three years at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   It could be Duval capturing his first major championship with
some sort of back-nine-on-Sunday heroics that we can only imagine.
</P>
<P>
   It could be Fred Couples or Colin Montgomerie or Nick Price
rising to the top.
</P>
<P>
   It could be amateurs Hank Kuehne or Matt Kuchar or Sergio Garcia
racing up the leader board and threatening to become the first
amateur to win the blessed event, although that seems a bit more of
a long shot than Duval or Woods or Couples wearing green on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was certainly not thinking of winning the tournament when I
was there (as an amateur in 1993),'' says Justin Leonard. ``I was
thinking about not killing somebody. I was as nervous as I could
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose anybody can win the golf tournament because
everybody in it is a great player. But I wouldn't lay big money on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   What people will bet on is thrilling entertainment that has
become traditional. Unlike Super Bowl winners of years past, the
Masters' past glories are easy to recall.
</P>
<P>
   There was Larry Mize rolling in his 45-yard pitch shot from the
side of No. 11, a shot that stabbed Norman and Seve Ballesteros on
the second hole of a playoff in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   There was Norman crashing and burning in '96 when he threw away
a massive six-shot lead and lost by five strokes to Nick Faldo
after shooting 78. To this day, people still call the Augusta crowd
at the back nine on Sunday that year the most stunned they have
ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   There was Woods in '97 defying odds and history to become the
first black to win the tournament, and doing so in magnificent
style with a record 18-under total and 12-stroke margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was Mark O'Meara making his 15th Masters
appearance, a record for number of attempts before a victory. His
20-foot birdie on the 18th beat Duval and Couples by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   There was Nicklaus in '86, at age 46 a true master for the
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very fired up to play the place,'' Ernie Els says. ``The
course, the history, the whole thing makes it a great tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes the Masters so unique is that it confronts
the pros with a golf course for which they usually cannot prepare.
Playing Augusta National in February is not the same as playing it
during the first week in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger got beaten up for saying that he was just gearing up for
the Masters when he was playing at the Players Championship,'' says
Love. ``But it really does take some getting used to on courses
like this. There's just nowhere to prepare for conditions like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Players Championship was about as close as anybody could
come. The greens were hard and fast. The fairways were closely
cropped. The rough was much worse than Augusta, even though they
have given a new head of hair to the usually absent Augusta rough.
</P>
<P>
   But there's really nothing that can prepare a golfer for
Augusta. One of the most telling stories of the place came a decade
ago when a select few media members were allowed to play the course
the Monday after the tournament. One scribe, who has played every
course from Pebble Beach to Doral, but not Augusta, was so nervous,
he left his shoes on top of his car as he pulled out of the hotel
parking lot. Others found themselves incapable of pulling the
trigger on No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, a healthy dose of experience at Augusta is
always helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, guys who have been playing at Augusta for 10 or
15 years should have an advantage,'' Duval says. ``They've been the
ones who have seen those conditions the most and had the most
chance to work on them. The only time you really get to play in
those conditions is that week. This golf course never plays like
this except for one week out of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how many times a player tours around Augusta, it's
those dastardly greens that never can be mastered. The fastest
putting surfaces on the PGA Tour, they are always in impeccable
shape. That's why so many long putts are holed during Masters Week.
The greens are truer than any on Tour.
</P>
<P>
   But they also are more treacherous. A 30-foot putt with 15 feet
of break is not uncommon. On No. 2, the Thursday pin placement is
always on the edge of the ridge separating the upper and lower
tiers. Every year, at least a half-dozen players will run their
ball up the hill, only to see it come back down and settle inches
from the spot where they originally hit it from.
</P>
<P>
   Putts from behind the hole on No. 15 can roll into the pond in
front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens make what already would be hard shots even
harder,'' Love says. ``And the new grass _ whether they're calling
it rough or not _ is going to compound what is already a hard golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all pointing to this time of year partly because it's
such a good test of golf. But that's what makes it tough, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what makes it golf's most anticipated week. You just
know something great is going to happen.

<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Welfare's sudden death has stunned many residents of
the central city here, but few have expressed more dismay than an
elderly gentleman on a poverty-pocked block who has been monitoring
the neighborhood's civic affairs since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   At 86, Frank P. Zeidler is the last of Milwaukee's three
Socialist mayors _ no other major American city has had even one _
and a living link to a time when Wisconsin politics was synonymous
with safety-net expansions, like workers' compensation and
unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wisconsin is known for a seemingly opposite passion, an
anti-welfare campaign that has cut the state's cash assistance
rolls by more than 90 percent. And Zeidler _ learned, courteous,
still sharp as a tack _ is mulling the question that may keep
political scientists busy for the next generation:
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the state's famously progressive traditions?
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing in Wisconsin is a deconstruction of the
progress we made in the first decades of the 20th century,''
Zeidler said in a recent conversation at his home in Milwaukee's
poverty belt. ``It's a kind of neo-anarchism that says, `Nothing
the government can do is right,' and only the profit motive is
justified. This is one manifestation of it: `Get rid of the people
on welfare.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the welfare restrictions have the support of some of
the city's leading Democrats, who say they are building on a
progressive past that celebrated toil and toilers. One of the most
vocal welfare critics here is the current mayor, John Norquist, a
three-term Democrat who has run each time with Zeidler's support.
As Norquist puts it, progressive reforms like unemployment
insurance were designed ``to help workers get through a tough time
and get back to work _ the idea wasn't to keep people constantly on
welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideological disputes aside, most people here agree on one thing:
Zeidler is a civic treasure. A gold mine of local lore _ he
interrupted his welfare talk to help a caller trace the origins of
Milwaukee fish fries (they started in taverns in the Depression) _
Zeidler observes the attack on welfare through a unique set of
lenses.
</P>
<P>
   As an organizer, he has been working the north-side wards since
1932, when German-American factory workers formed the core of the
Socialist vote. As mayor from 1948 to 1960, he fought battles for
public housing that foreshadowed the welfare wars. And as a
central-city homeowner for 53 years, he has endured white flight,
black riots, and a rash of break-ins that now leave him sleeping
behind a saw-horse barricade and as devoted to the neighborhood as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving is a terrible hassle,'' he said. ``And you don't want
to get pushed out of your own house.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Socialist mayor when a Wisconsin senator, Joseph R.
McCarthy, was busy hunting Communists, Zeidler knows that political
heritages are complex. In his view, the city's progressive
traditions have been eroding for more than four decades, partly for
racial reasons. The post-war boom brought poor Southern blacks
streaming into Milwaukee, and a white backlash soon followed.
Indeed, as a leading advocate of public housing, Zeidler himself
was an early target. ``There was a feeling that benefits were
attracting the poor and that cutting benefits would stop it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council blocked his drive to build more subsidized
apartments. (Oprah Winfrey was reared here in one, he notes with
pride.) His 1956 opponent called for time limits for public-housing
residents _ presaging the time limits on cash assistance that
followed 40 years later. And Zeidler won that race despite wildfire
rumors that he was urging blacks to move to town by posting
billboards across the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I was bringing in all the blacks and secretly moving
out,'' said Zeidler, who is white. ``And here I am, 53 years in the
same house.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he is here, but votes for his views are not. Control of the
state has shifted to conservatives in the Milwaukee suburbs and
their rural allies, like Gov. Tommy G. Thompson. Indeed, Thompson,
a Republican from the small town of Elroy, has ridden an
anti-welfare crusade to an unprecedented fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   To Zeidler's chagrin, the drive to end welfare came with early
support from Milwaukee Democrats, the closest thing he has to
political heirs. As early as 1990, Norquist was denouncing welfare
as harmful to the poor and calling for its replacement with public
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed peculiar, but Milwaukee's long tradition of left-wing
politics has always been noted for its conservative quirks. The
city's Socialist pioneers were so pragmatic _ obsessed with
services like sanitation, not revolution _ that real radicals
dismissed them as mere ``sewer Socialists.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the cry of the first Socialist mayor, Emil Seidel, at
his inauguration in 1910. ``The eyes of thousands of stricken
cities are today directed towards our Milwaukee,'' he began in
soaring fashion _ before promising the masses such consolations as
``a complete cost-keeping system'' to ``place the finances of our
city on a sound and sane basis.'' (His assistants included a
Socialist newsman, Carl Sandburg, who later turned his attention to
poetry.)
</P>
<P>
   In holding City Hall for 38 of the next 50 years, Milwaukee's
Socialists were known for clean water, more parks, strict zoning,
low debt and honest and efficient rule _ a sensibility that
elsewhere might have been known more simply as ``good government.''
Working in the state Legislature with their off-and-on allies, the
rural Progressives, they also passed the nation's first programs of
workers' compensation (1911) and unemployment insurance (1932) and
reams of business regulation.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, the Socialists were gone and a war on welfare was under
way. In the view of the frustrated Democrats, Thompson had been
grandstanding for years _ denouncing the program without offering a
credible alternative. One of Norquist's proteges, state Rep.
Antonio Riley (a former welfare recipient himself), introduced a
bill that offered the governor a dare: abolish cash aid and create
public jobs.
</P>
<P>
   By passing the bill (with no Republican votes), most Democrats
simply hoped to goad the governor into an embarrassing veto. But
Thompson shocked the state _ indeed, the country _ in agreeing to
``end welfare'' three years before Congress followed suit. (He
vetoed the jobs provision and fudged the issue later by creating
modest community service positions for those unable to find work.)
Forced now to work for welfare, most recipients have simply left,
to find private jobs or rely on friends.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, another of Norquist's aides paid Zeidler a visit.
As a left-leaning critic of welfare, the aide, David Riemer, brings
a near-religious faith in work programs like those created in the
depths of the Depression. Indeed, it sometimes seems that Riemer
knows every building, bridge, and trail left in Milwaukee by the
public works crews of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Though he wants real jobs for the poor _ not community service,
where those left on welfare simply work off their checks _ he
considers the current system a good start. It is no coincidence, he
argues, that the state now offers low-income workers an impressive
array of work-related benefits: wage supplements, child care
subsidies and subsidized health insurance. Even welfare recipients
have gotten a raise since the work requirements began, to $673 a
month from an average of about $517.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people are seen as workers, it's a lot harder to say no
to them,'' Riemer said. ``That was part of `Sewer Socialism': the
idea that people who could work, should work _ and society then
should help.''
</P>
<P>
   Politely, but firmly, Zeidler disputed the parallels with the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Socialism was a movement of the poor themselves, he said, while
the welfare reductions have mostly come ``from people who want to
punish the poor.'' Socialists and progressives stressed education,
he said, while the welfare reductions have forced many women to
leave school. The early movements protected minors, through
innovations like child labor laws. Their leaders would have been
distressed, he said, by a program that puts infants in day care
when they are just 12 weeks old.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from nearly nine decades of experience, Milwaukee's
last Sewer Socialist warned against simple theories of the poor.
``People are poor for lots of reasons _ you have to have a net to
catch the ones that don't fit your system,'' Zeidler said. ``And I
don't see that anymore. That safety net is gone.''

O'Meara knows duplicating last year's success a tough task
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many people wanted to say it. Greg Norman did.
</P>
<P>
   During a casual conversation a few weeks ago that was bouncing
from course design to his comeback from shoulder surgery and all
things golf-related, Norman was asked about Mark O'Meara pulling
off an encore of his sensational 1998 season, when he was the PGA
Tour's player of the year and won the Masters and British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's going to have an interesting year,'' Norman said. ``It
will be interesting to see how he handles '99 compared to '98. He's
a great player. And I'm sure he's going to handle it to the level
that we all know he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people took that as a less-than-ringing endorsement of
O'Meara. And if the truth be known, a lot of people agree with
Norman's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The view of O'Meara this year is that he's coming off a season
in which he reached the pinnacle of his profession at a time when
he's perilously close to joining the over-the-hill club. It's a sad
reality that virtually all golfers on the PGA Tour learn to deal
with their emotions and games in their 20s, peak during their 30s,
can still capture flashes of greatness in their 40s, then move to
the white tees in their 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Some can accelerate or elongate the pattern, but it's fairly
constant.
</P>
<P>
   So O'Meara, 42, had one terrific year in 1998, perhaps a sendoff
to a rock-solid career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dream year for me,'' O'Meara said. ``At age 41, to
finally break through and win my first major championship, when I
look back at that putt on the 72nd hole at Augusta National, it
gives me goose bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   It no doubt will again this week when O'Meara returns to the
Masters for his title defense. Given the way O'Meara is playing
this year as compared with last year, a repeat performance at the
Masters may not be in the offing. Nobody has won back-to-back
Masters since Nick Faldo in 1989-90.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara believes he's still capable of winning a tournament such
as the Masters. But he also knows that duplicating what he did last
year _ winning nearly $1.8 million and two majors _ may not be in
the cards. To that, he says a big ``so what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten off to a reasonable start this year,'' O'Meara
said. ``I have been bouncing around a little bit and doing some
things. I'm not as happy as I'd like to be with the way I'm
playing. I can play better than what I am playing. I can hit the
ball better. I can feel better standing over the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I have to work on some areas. But I don't know how many
golfers are ever satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't top (player of the year). I am not going to lie to
you. Last year was a special year and if things don't go as well
this year, so what? Life is pretty darn good.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of his glorious season last year, O'Meara said he
hasn't upgraded his expectations of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize I don't hit the golf ball like Tiger Woods or David
Duval or some of the other younger players,'' he said. ``I know I
will never hit the ball like that. So I have to find ways to keep
improving the areas of my game like course management, patience and
understanding what I can and can't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 42 years old. I'm not 27 or 29. I have a game plan on how
much longer I'd like to compete at the highest level and then taper
off. I want to play competitively and try to play well for the next
couple years, try to play well at the U.S. Open and the PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not out there thinking: Hey, if I don't play well,
people are going to think the Masters champion should play better
than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always second-guess yourself. But I'm not going to do
that. I'm going to try to enjoy the things that have happened. I'm
going to try to capitalize on some of those things and whatever
happens, happens. It's not going to be the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing O'Meara does not want to let happen is for him to go
through the post-euphoric letdown that often afflicts players after
a big year or after they win a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have gotten off to a good start this year to make
sure that doesn't happen,'' he said. ``But I need time away from
golf, too. I need time to go snow skiing. I need time to do things
with my family. I think if I do that, then I will play better on
the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the grass is growing out there. So I need to go out there
and cut the grass while it's growing. If I was 10 or 15 years
younger and had done what I did last year, then I might have a
little different game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, O'Meara wants to enjoy the international acclaim
that comes with his victories in '98. But he also wants to make hay
on the PGA Tour while his game remains in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a better perspective on the future because of his
age. He recently was asked if perhaps his name should be included
in talk about the world's best players. He quickly said Duval and
his good friend Woods have earned that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I played last year, I should be ranked in the top
10,'' O'Meara said. ``But the way I played today, I should be
ranked about 200th. That's the way golf is.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, O'Meara has the support of Woods. The two
play golf just about every day when they aren't on the Tour
together. Woods is of the opinion that O'Meara hasn't won his last
major championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely has a few left in him,'' Woods said. ``Now he
knows he can do it. Just give him a chance where he has nine holes
to go, tied for the lead, one back or in the lead. If he leads, he
doesn't ever go backward.''
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business, however, will be to get that first
victory since the British Open, which would go a long way toward
disproving anybody's thoughts that O'Meara put a lid on his career
last year.

Despite critics, Augusta National changes with the times
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are two schools of thought about the changes that have
been made to Augusta National leading into this year's Masters.
</P>
<P>
   And the diverse opinions have been offered eloquently by two of
golf's best-known statesmen.
</P>
<P>
   First on the tee, Greg Norman:
</P>
<P>
   ``Augusta National has so much history. So, you know, I don't
like to see changes, because I like to step up on the tee and say,
`Well, Gene Sarazen did this or Byron Nelson did this,' and feel
the same piece of nostalgia and history under your feet as what
those guys played on. And when you change it, you change all that.
It just blows my mind. I don't understand it. I'm a bit more of a
traditionalist, I guess. I don't like to see that stuff happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Now playing, Davis Love III:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that in the last three years or so, people have
really gotten into the changes in golf courses. But they have
changed that golf course (Augusta National) every year since the
tournament started. They shut it down, take all the sand out of the
bunkers. They rebuilt a few greens. The course has always evolved.
When you shut a course down for the summer, what are you going to
do with it? You're going to fix things. How many times has the
eighth green changed? Nobody talks about that much. You look at the
old pictures sometimes in the clubhouse _ the old black-and-white
pictures _ and there's not a hole on that course that hasn't
changed somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to change the way we play. The greens are
still going to be the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Love and Norman have a kernel of correctness in their
assessments of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Love is right in that the most storied course in golf has been
altered, tweaked and flat-out changed a lot through the years. In
fact, the number of documented changes to Augusta National is
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   There have been revisions 69 times, ranging from new bunkers to
new tee boxes to redesigned greens.
</P>
<P>
   But Norman also has a point. Every time there's a new wrinkle, a
little piece of history dies. That Augusta National tinkered with
one of its most famous holes during the past year is one reason for
Norman's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The 15th hole, which is home to maybe the most famous shot in
golf history, has been made tougher this year. The par-5 hole on
which Gene Sarazen knocked a 3-wood (or 4-wood, depending on which
version of the legend you believe) 230 yards into the hole for a
double-eagle in the 1935 Masters now has more bite than it used to.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what Masters officials hope will be the result
after they reduced the fairway mounds on the right side and added
pine trees to both sides of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Without the mounds, medium and long hitters no longer will be
able to carry their tee shots to the mounds, which have a slingshot
effect on balls that land on them, giving extra distance to those
drives. Now, only the longest hitters will automatically have a
chance to reach the green with their second shots.
</P>
<P>
   At hole No. 2, also a par-5, the tee has been pushed back 25
yards. Also, a fairway bunker has been shifted farther right with
the hope that fewer players will be shooting at the green in two
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Nos. 2 and 15 are the two easiest holes on the course in
tournament history. Even so, Norman doesn't like the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been long hitters that played at Augusta National
before,'' Norman said. ``I have heard what they have done to the
second hole. But the thing about that is that the second shot,
whether it's a 7-iron or a pitching wedge, is still a tough shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with Jack Nicklaus in a lot of practice rounds there
and he use to boom that drive around the corner on that hole and
hit 8-irons into that green. And he told me there were a number of
times when he hit 8-iron into No. 13 (with the second shot). And
they didn't change the golf course in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, they did. No. 13 has been modified eight times,
with the tee box being extended on three of those occasions and the
swales in the back of the green moderated once.
</P>
<P>
   But it's true that the first 65 times the course was changed
didn't receive anywhere close to the fanfare of the four major
changes this year.
</P>
<P>
   How dare they change history? That's the common refrain. In
addition to Nos. 2 and 15, the tee at No. 17 has been lengthened by
25 yards, and the green, pond and bunker on No. 11 have been raised
about a foot.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as the people who actually have to deal with the
latest changes at Augusta are concerned, the wrinkle cream they put
on the course isn't all that bothersome. It's still the Masters and
it's still the greatest golf course in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the second hole, I never birdied that hole anyway, so I
can't play it much worse than I have in the past,'' said Mark
Calcavecchia. ``That one won't bother me a bit. I hate that hole
regardless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the only change that will bother me is No. 17. To
really play that hole now, you're going to have to hit a high hook,
and I'll probably just hit 3-wood off the tee there.''
</P>
<P>
   While the course changes were done in an attempt to equalize
Augusta for shorter hitters, Love predicts the advantage still will
go to the big-knockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't really get it on the green anyway,'' Love said of
No. 2. ``I mean, how many people actually knocked it on in two? So
again, the advantage is to the long hitter. They can hit it to the
top of the hill, hit it down there in the right front bunker like
we always try to do and get it up and down. It will make a
difference to some people. But the longer hitters will figure out a
way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same with 15. They keep changing the 15th green. But
guys still have figured out ways to make birdies and eagles on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 2 tee, you used to come off No. 1 and walk one way. Now
you walk another way. We'll adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   And for other people, Augusta is a constant battle of
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried everything there and haven't had much success,''
said Ernie Els. ``I tried being aggressive, but that didn't work,
either. You have to drive the ball well to be aggressive on that
course. I haven't really driven it well there.
</P>
<P>
   ``On 13, for instance, most players go in there thinking of
making birdie. I'm just trying to keep it out of the creek on the
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very positive way of playing that hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the changes that have been made to Augusta, the one that
might gain the most attention isn't even listed in the official
tournament guide that documents every change, however subtle, that
has been made to the course.
</P>
<P>
   Rough, which has been taboo in the past at Augusta, has
sprouted. But in true Masters tradition, they're calling it the
``second cut'' of grass instead of rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they are calling that stuff, it keeps the ball from
running into the trees,'' said Love. ``So maybe in some respects,
it won't be bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rough probably will affect only shots that miss greens.
And even that long grass won't be anything unusual for the pros,
although the combination of any rough with Augusta's
lightning-quick greens could produce tougher scoring conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the rough takes away another advantage from the
long hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the appeal of Augusta is that you can hit the ball
three miles and have it go three miles left or right and not get
hurt,'' said Tom Lehman. ``Now, you may not be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman hit on perhaps the most cogent point about the changes at
Augusta. In his mind _ and in many other minds, too _ they just
weren't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Augusta, the same score wins just about every year,''
Lehman said. ``We had the one year when Tiger shot really low. But
other than that, it's always about 10 under or close to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a very hard golf course without the rough. Now that
they are trying to give us some rough, it'll be even a shot or two
harder.''

 &HT;    Maddux does all; Phillies battered 11-7
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves' two-day old 1999 season took a serious
turn for the better on Tuesday evening, and Chad Ogea's took a nose
dive.
</P>
<P>
   With Curt Schillling safely out of the way, the Braves proceeded
to bully Ogea, the Phillies' next offering in the rotation, to a
11-3 win. By the time the eight-run fourth inning was over Ogea was
in the showers, because 10 batters into it Greg Maddux was
receiving a standing ovation from the Turner Field crowd on his way
to bat.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux's last trip up had come to lead off the inning, which he
did in grand fashion with his first home run as an Atlanta Brave
and the third of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Not one to disappoint, Maddux proceeded to ground a base hit off
reliever Mike Grace's shin and into right field with the bases
loaded for his second and third RBIs of the evening. That capped
off the Braves biggest offensive inning since Sept. 17, 1997 when
they scored nine runs off the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Ogea gave up seven of those runs, and for him it was the latest
in a trend. In in his last two starts of the spring, the Yankees
and the Pirates pounded Ogea for 20 hits and 13 earned runs in
eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Also in on the offending: Brian Jordan with his second home run
in two days _ a three-run shot to follow Maddux in the fourth, and
Andruw Jones, who collected not only his first hits of the season
but first against the Phillies since 1997 after he went 0 for 37
against the Phillies last year. Ryan Klesko started it off with a
two-run home run off Ogea in the second inning, his first of the
season on his first pitch of the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies, meanwhile, did a little nibbling at Maddux but
only managed one run off him. They got it the second inning,
stringing together three consecutive base hits by Bobby Abreu, Mike
Lieberthal, and Desi Relaford, who pushed a 3-2 pitch into left
center field to score Abreu.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux threw 88 pitches on the night, 60 of them for strikes. In
the process, he struck out five and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   His long ball? It came on a 3-2 pitch from Ogea and went rifling
over the left field wall, rousing the 29,183 fans at Turner Field.
His last home run also came against the Phillies in April of 1992
when Maddux was a Chicago Cub.

`STRANGERS WITH CANDY' IS IRREVERENT, SUBVERSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's have the main character of ``Strangers With Candy''
explain herself, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Jerri Blank, and I'm a 46-year-old high school freshman.
For 32 years, I was a teenage runaway. I was a boozer, a user and a
loser. My friends were dealers, cons and 18-karat pimps. But now
I'm out of jail, pickin' up my life exactly where I left off. I'm
back in high school, livin' at home and discovering all sorts of
things about my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about outsidersville! Jerri makes the kids from the
chemistry club seem cooler than absolute zero.
</P>
<P>
   But such Bunsen-burning table-turning would be too tame for
``Strangers With Candy.'' Remember, this is Comedy Central
programming. And ``Strangers'' premieres Wednesday night at 10:30,
right after the third-season launch of ``South Park,'' the leader
of cable-TV's back-to-baseness initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say irreverent? Can you say subversive?
</P>
<P>
   Judging from one episode, ``Strangers With Candy'' is certainly
both, though it's not nearly as vulgar as ``South Park.'' It's
infinitely funnier, too, maybe because it dares to spoof the soppy
fables of those moralistic ``after-school specials.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Comedy Central's sketch-comedy series ``Exit 57'' of a
few years back will recognize the key players in ``Strangers With
Candy.'' All graduates of Chicago's ``Second City'' improv
incubator, they delight in flouting convention. But they mix up
their floutage so that sometimes it's quite subtle, and sometimes
it's about as subtle as a tire iron.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Subtle: You have to look at the sign on his desk to know
that the principal of Flatpoint High School, a black man, is named
Blackman.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Not subtle: Principal Blackman (Greg Hollimon) is a
clueless despot who stands erect and speaks in Paul Robeson tones.
He solves most problems by applying tortured logic and prescribing
massive doses of vitamin supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Sedaris plays Jerri Blank with a combination of lovability
and loathability reminiscent of Gilda Radner's best characters. At
46, she's your typical outcast, constantly mocked by the cool kids.
But she has an inner coolness that comes from years of living on
the streets. Or in the joint. Or with a joint. She's back home now,
living with her catatonic father and his new wife, who looks
younger than Jerri. (Jerri's mom is dead, but Jerri stays in touch,
talking regularly to the woman's ashes, which she keeps in her
bedroom.)
</P>
<P>
   Like all the after-school specials, ``Strangers With Candy''
tackles the pressing issues of adolescence: drugs, alcohol,
pregnancy, racism, illiteracy, eating disorders, and so on. Just
don't expect the easy, wrapped-in-a-bow resolutions. For instance,
after being responsible for the overdose death of a classmate,
Jerri reflects: ``They never did find out who killed Poppi, so I
guess justice was served.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Strangers With Candy'' isn't mainstream
comedy. But then, most mainstream comedy isn't very funny. Nothing
wrong with a show about a high school freshman who has had a little
fun, done a little time and is just picking up where she left off,
is there?
</P>
<P>
   Education isn't just for kids, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Strangers With Candy. Half-hour comedy series about a
46-year-old woman who returns to high school after 32 years as a
runaway. Starring Amy Sedaris, Stephen Colbert, Paul Dinello and
Greg Hollimon. Premieres Wednesday night, repeats Friday at 11
p.m., on Comedy Central. Parental guideline rating: TV-14.

UCLA BEGINS QB SEARCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA began spring practice on a wet Tuesday with
three items on its agenda: find a quarterback, install a new
defense, and find a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Five players will compete to replace four-year starter Cade
McNown, and only one, junior-to-be Drew Bennett, has ever thrown a
college pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to come out of spring with a quarterback _ that's
everybody's biggest question mark,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said.
``Bennett is the leading candidate. We'll try to create a situation
where they all get the opportunity, but it's hard to get all the
guys repetitions. ''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is 6-foot-5 and one of UCLA's best athletes. He runs a
4.6-second 40-yard dash. He's quick. He has a 38-inch vertical
jump. He's a superb basketball player, he's bright, and although
his passes flutter sometimes, he's accurate. The only thing he
lacks is experience: 11 career attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I'm really anxious to compete,'' he
said. ``From high school to now, it's always been a situation with
Cade in which nothing was going to change unless something drastic
happened. Now, there's competition. Nothing's set in stone. The
coaches have made that clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's competition is raw but talented. Sophomore-to-be Scott
McEwan, of Thousand Oaks, has a strong arm but no experience. Ryan
McCann, a Westlake Village native, and Cory Paus, from New Lenox,
Ill., sat out last season as redshirt freshmen. Toledo likes
McCann's football aptitude, while Paus is a tough leader cut from
the McNown mold.
</P>
<P>
   The final candidate is J.P. Losman, who graduated from Venice
High in February and enrolled for the spring quarter Monday. Losman
is cocky and a prodigious talent with a rocket arm, but the
adjustment to college is massive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be in a state of shock, and he's got to have patience,''
Toledo said. ``But he has a !ital!great!off! arm.... It's not
unrealistic (for Losman to compete for the starting job), because
he has a lot of ability. We want to give him the chance, but we all
know it'll be extremely difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo and his staff have scripted every play of every practice.
They know which quarterback will take the fifth snap of the seventh
drill on the ninth day, and they plan to distribute repetitions
equally. But democracy will only get them so far. At some point,
they must whittle the field: When they break spring on May 1, there
must be a starter and a backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, one will emerge for sure, and maybe two or three,''
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Bruins will install their third system in three
years. When embattled coordinator Nick Aliotti bolted for Oregon,
Toledo promoted longtime assistant and former coordinator Bob
Field, who has scraped Aliotti's 3-4 in favor of a 4-3 alignment
(four linemen, three linebackers).
</P>
<P>
   Field has revamped the assignments and simplified the
terminology. In addition, he'll receive unprecedented input from
Toledo, who said his suggestions to Aliotti ``fell on deaf ears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob and I work very well together,'' Toledo said. ``I think
he'll listen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Field's priorities this month are evaluating personnel _ at
least six starting jobs are undetermined _ and infusing
fundamentals. Under Aliotti, the Bruins had trouble with the
basics: alignments, assignments, shedding blocks and tackling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ways you can line up and be successful in
terms of scheme,'' Field said. ``I'm not as concerned with scheme
so much as how we play.''

IN A STATEMENT FROM HIDING, MEXICAN AIDE CHARGES PLOT
</HEADLINE>

 By SAM DILLON

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHETUMAL, Mexico _ A state governor who stunned Mexico by
abandoning his duties last month has offered his first public
explanation in a letter from the underground, saying he fled into
hiding for fear that his indictment on what he called trumped-up
drug charges was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Villanueva Madrid defended his extraordinary decision in a
letter faxed to Mexican newspapers late on Monday, hours after his
six-year term as governor of the Caribbean state of Quintana Roo
came to an end. He said his enemies within President Ernesto
Zedillo's governing party had invented the drug accusations to
punish him for his maverick political stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hounded by an investigation designed to incriminate me at all
costs, I had to take an extremely difficult personal decision:
abandon my native soil to avoid imprisonment,'' Villanueva said.
``I am not a criminal. They're persecuting me for strictly
political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not disclose his whereabouts, which has remained a
mystery since he dropped from public view on March 26. He left his
state government in chaos after delivering a final speech to
supporters in Chetumal, the Quintana Roo capital.
</P>
<P>
   The letter confirmed what until recent days had seemed almost
unthinkable: that one of Mexico's 31 state governors and a leader
of the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party had fled to
avoid arrest _ and that he would publicly attack the Mexican
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very probably I will be formally charged,'' Villanueva said.
He said he expected to be accused of drug use, smuggling and
trafficking as well as money laundering, illicit enrichment and tax
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``And who knows what else?'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Villanueva was notified that he was the target of a
drug investigation, and Mexico's Special Drug Prosecutor was in
Chetumal pursuing the inquiry on Monday as Villanueva's successor
was sworn into office. Villanueva broke decades of Mexican
political tradition by failing to appear at the inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't wait ingenuously for an injustice to be orchestrated
by federal prosecutors,'' he said. ``I'll plan my defense, but not
at the risk of prison or at the expense of my ability to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``They accuse me of being a cocaine addict, but I'm not, and I
can prove that objectively and scientifically,'' he said. ``They
want to destroy me physically, psychologically and morally.''
</P>
<P>
   The tenure of Villanueva, who is 53, coincided with a surge in
the smuggling of Colombian cocaine through Quintana Roo. Mexican
and U.S. officials have for a year been accusing the governor of
protecting traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his complaint that his prosecution is politically motivated
will ring true for many here because he has quarreled publicly with
powerful party officials and because many Mexicans believe that
other senior party politicians as well as military and police
officials have profited from the drug trade without facing
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar has been unusually dogged
in pursuing the investigation, and Villanueva contends that it is
because the Zedillo administration wants to punish him for defying
top party officials last fall during a dispute over whom the party
would nominate to succeed him in Quintana Roo.
</P>
<P>
   That was part of a broader national squabble that is still
unfolding, in which Villanueva has backed a party faction that is
challenging presidential control of the party.

THE LESSONS OF FAMILY AND TEAM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the sunshine on an otherwise funereal morning,
Donnie Walsh recalled the first time he met Harry Jackson, and the
lasting impression the father of the point guard had made.
</P>
<P>
   This was 1987, and Walsh of the Indiana Pacers by way of the
Bronx and Fordham Prep had come home to scout a St. John's player
whose foot speed was already confusing the so-called experts, few
of whom ever saw the game unfold the way Mark Jackson could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to see if Mark could run the fast break,'' Walsh said
Tuesday, in front of the Mount Sinai Baptist Church on Gates Avenue
in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. ``Harry sat with me
in a workout at Brandeis High School and I remember he never asked
about what I could do for Mark, or anything like that. He just
wasn't that type.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson demonstrated that he could find the open man, and
Harry Jackson's quiet, confident presence gave Walsh the sense that
Harry's unorthodox kid had more going for him than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wound up taking Reggie Miller that year,'' Walsh said.
``But if Reggie hadn't been there, we would've taken Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   On this, the Pacers' president could be believed, because not
only did Walsh eventually bring Jackson to Indiana, he let him go
and admitted his mistake and reacquired Jackson for a team that has
essentially been together long enough now to be a family.
</P>
<P>
   So on the day Harry Jackson would have turned 68 but instead was
eulogized in Brooklyn and buried in Long Island, Walsh caught the
first flight out of Indianapolis, with Mel Daniels, the team's
player personnel director. They stood on Gates Avenue, saying the
Pacers would've all been there had the schedule been kinder, and
did a double-take when Alice Davis walked up to the church.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of the Pacers' rugged big man, Antonio, left her own
ailing mother in Oakland, Calif., to honor the memory of Marie
Jackson's husband, a retired New York City transit worker, who died
of cancer last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacksons became her close friends through the Pacers and the
players' mother's association, she said. Harry Jackson came to the
group's convention in New Orleans last summer, and never gave a
hint of being ill.
</P>
<P>
   He was the point man with security, and he loved when players
would come with their mothers and speak to the group. Antonio Davis
did, and Harry Jackson became a role model for his son's tall
teammate who, according to his mother, has had to be ``father,
uncle, whatever'' to his own younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Davis himself made news this season for inviting Pacers
rookie Al Harrington, right out of high school, to live with him
and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of Tony for that,'' Alice Davis said. ``I know
Harry influenced him, and that tells you a lot about this team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a team stumbling around badly without Jackson two years
ago, as if someone had left the room and turned out the light. Say
what you will about Jackson's speed and outside shot. Even as a
young, immature Knick he could always pass, always lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pacers beat the Knicks on Sunday in Indianapolis,
Jackson was invited by Coach Jeff Van Gundy to fly back to New York
with them. Too bad they couldn't keep him. For the Knicks, trying
again to make some sense of themselves Tuesday night against
Orlando, it must be painful to be so lacking in vision, to be
crying out for someone who just knows how to play.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, traded by Pat Riley for not having enough steak in his
defense, moved on, with the help of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Harry telling Mark: `You can't be bitter; the
Knicks gave you your start,' '' A.B. Whitfield, a former Dallas
Cowboy and close friend of Harry Jackson's, said.
</P>
<P>
   Reunited with his college running mate Chris Mullin, Mark
Jackson, at age 34, plays on with a chance to win it all before he
is done. Tuesday, there was more important unfinished business,
though, the point guard being introduced at Mount Sinai Baptist as
the Rev. Mark Jackson, and offering a raspy oration that had the
passion of a preacher, the sadness of a son.
</P>
<P>
   He looked through teary eyes into a congregation that included
his siblings and sons and pregnant wife, and said he would dedicate
no championship, should it be won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone won one last year,'' Jackson said. ``Someone will win
one next year. There will never be another Harry Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   He was more than a father, Jackson said. He was ``daddy,'' and
there is a difference, and in the church, those who knew why cried
out ``Amen.''

SHARK NO LONGER OUT FOR BLOOD; TIME OFF CHANGES PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ For years, Greg Norman circled the tank instead
of the drain, the Great White Shark leading or looming,
professional golf's most dominant figure always preparing to strike
again.
</P>
<P>
   He still has the flowing blond hair and magnetic charisma, but
Norman is 44 now, the wrinkles as evident as flaws in his game.
Mentally and physically, he has broken down in the past, but the
brassy Australian returns this week attempting to capture the
Masters at one of his most notable graveyards.
</P>
<P>
   Norman is on display at Augusta National as a
before-and-afterthought, removed from his once prominent position
but still commanding attention.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Norman feels more settled and secure than
ever. Shoulder surgery kept him off the driving range and caused a
beneficial change in his outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole career was just being on the first tee and taking the
consequences,'' Norman said. ``It just encapsulates you so much, it
takes everything else out of your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so engulfed in all of this stuff that when I got away
from it, I saw other things out there that I didn't see for 22
years. And now I'm still young enough to enjoy it. Let me see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman had enough money; now he spends time. With his wife,
Laura. With his kids, Morgan-Leigh, 16, and Gregory, 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I really haven't done in 16 years, and that to
me was an eye-opener,'' he said. ``I enjoy that. I wouldn't mind
doing it every weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Norman was either winning tournaments with spectacular
finishes or frittering them away with horrific meltdowns.
Recognized as the world's No. 1 player for a record 331 weeks
during two stretches of the 1980s and '90s, Norman also was a choke
artist and hard-luck loser, three times collapsing or being stunned
at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Norman met with reporters Tuesday wearing one of
his own line of golf shirts instead of a green jacket. He is OK
with what has happened. He has won two major tournaments, both
British Opens, but squandered many others.
</P>
<P>
   Norman is the only player to have lost all four majors in
playoffs. He authored the most lasting memory here, an unfortunate
legacy that follows him and won't leave him alone.
</P>
<P>
   With a six-shot lead after three rounds of the '96 Masters,
Norman shot a 78 and lost to Nick Faldo by five strokes.
</P>
<P>
   As Norman spoke in philosophical tones Tuesday, saying he
wouldn't do anything differently, a reporter wondered: ``You
wouldn't change from a 78 to a 68?''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than bristle, Norman kept his train of thought rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's done,'' he said. ``One thing I realize is golf is
not everything. Yes, I want to win the Masters, absolutely. But
it's not a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he will return to contention this week, exorcizing the
Larry Mize chip-in in '86 or the improbable immortality of Jack
Nicklaus in '86. It's possible. His shoulder is sound, his attitude
good.
</P>
<P>
   His teacher, David Leadbetter, said he has never seen Norman
swinging this well. But his mind is on fast-forward, and there is
only a play button on the golf course. It's difficult because
Norman admits to being a ``quadruple-A personality,'' wanting
results now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the frustration builds up, I expect things a little
quicker than they're coming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is all so humbling to a man with his competitive nature. At
one time, he fearlessly attacked the flagsticks with a
free-wheeling approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk to the first tee and you feel like: `Who's going to
finish second this week?''' he said. ``And that's not from pure
arrogance or being egotistical. That's pure confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   From then to now, Norman is just happy to be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can walk out to the first tee, pull out a driver and swing
it in one swing,'' he said. ``That's a huge leap forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Pain-free at last, Norman has gained yardage and perspective,
noticing more in the distance than a lonely flagstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have the injury, I'd still be grinding away,
hitting balls and not really spending time with my family,'' Norman
said. ``I don't have a sense of urgency anymore. I'm more in
balance. I just want things to keep going the way they are.''

 &HT;    Judge says no bail for doctor in drug case
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Dr. Barbara Mazzella, a family physician
who supporters say saved many patients' lives, was held without
bail Tuesday by a federal magistrate who charged her with operating
``a large-scale drug dealership.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 of Mazzella's supporters _ including her four
children _ gasped and sobbed upon hearing the order. Mazzella will
be held at a federal detention center in Miami until May 3, when
she will enter a plea of not guilty, said her attorney, Jeff
Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he will appeal U.S. Magistrate Lurana Snow's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzella, 61, was arrested Thursday at her Coral Springs, Fla.
office on charges of conspiracy, fraud, making false statements and
illegally distributing prescription drugs. Prosecutors say that
``in excess of 20 patients'' who were treated by Mazzella or
received her prescriptions had died from drug overdoses. Two Palm
Beach County residents were among them.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had asked Snow to let Mazzella post bond, saying, ``These
charges are not proven.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no direct link between the drugs Mazzella gave
her patients and their overdose deaths because investigators also
found drugs she didn't prescribe in the patients' bodies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Robert Nicholson questioned whether Mazzella could
flee the country because large amounts of cash appear to be missing
from her practice; the business' bank account has a $2,000 balance.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Mazzella faces a prison sentence ranging from 20
years to life and fines of up to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Harris said it's ``mere speculation'' to say Mazzella has
piles of cash. Moreover, she would not leave the country, he said,
because she has four children, two grandchildren, a Margate
restaurant called ``Doc's'' and a Parkland house appraised at
$320,710 for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Harris also offered to surrender Mazzella's medical and
prescription drug licenses. ``She will not practice medicine,'' he
said. ``That will take out (concerns of) any danger to the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   But Snow disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This defendant represents a very serious danger to this
community,'' she said. ``The fact that she may have legitimate
patients and provided good care (to them) doesn't change the fact
she's a drug dealer with her own pharmacy that is . . . the fifth
largest pharmacy in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Tuesday that Mazzella's office pharmacy was the
nation's fifth largest buyer of drugs such as the pain-reliever
hydrocodone. Last week, officials had said the pharmacy was the
nation's largest buyer of certain drugs, but they later discovered
its purchases were less than those of Eckerd, Wal-Mart and other
national chains.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzella's friends and relatives packed the courtroom Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've received hundreds of phone calls, flowers, cards from
people in support of her, including patients of hers for the last
20 years,'' said her son Stephan Mazzella, of Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a Lauderhill man treated by Mazzella also
attended. Jessica Coccia, of Boca Raton, said her father, 56, died
of an allergic reaction to a drug prescribed by Mazzella, and the
family settled with Mazzella's insurer last spring for $212,000.
</P>
<P>
   Coccia said she's attending Mazzella's court hearings to ensure
that other patients aren't hurt: ``I don't think she truly cared
about her patients.''

QB THOMAS LEAVES USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As expected, USC freshman quarterback Jason Thomas
was granted his release Tuesday and is free to transfer to another
school.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas formally told USC coach Paul Hackett and athletic
director Mike Garrett during a meeting on campus that he wished to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointing day today,'' Hackett said. ``Too bad. It was
unfortunate. We wish him the very, very best. I just don't want to
play against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never got a chance to see the real Jason Thomas. There's
nothing that could have been done. He had the injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Thomas redshirted this year after having surgery on his
left ankle to remove scar tissue. He fractured the ankle during his
senior year at Dominguez High.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' brother, Charles Jr., who was also at the meeting, said
Jason has not yet decided where he will transfer.

ENRON TO PAY $100 MILLION FOR HOUSTON STADIUM NAMING RIGHTS 
 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enron Corp. will pay the Houston Astros more than $100 million
over 30 years for the naming rights to the baseball stadium under
construction downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The name: Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   The naming rights are part of an integrated agreement, expected
to be announced Wednesday, under which the Houston-based energy
giant will manage much of the ballpark's energy services.
</P>
<P>
   Enron also hopes to build an adjacent garage and sell
electricity to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Astros Senior Vice President Bob McClaren said the team and
Enron are not prepared to announce the terms of the deal other than
it is worth more than $100 million over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   That would fall in the top five naming rights deals companies
have made to have sports facilities named after them.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for example, American Airlines agreed to pay the
Dallas Mavericks and Dallas Stars a record $195 million over 30
years for naming and marketing rights for an arena under
construction in downtown Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix has the highest deal in
baseball _ $66 million over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros will pocket the money as part of the team's contract
with the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority for a new stadium
in downtown's largely vacant east side. In return for paying $4.6
million annually for rent and $2.5 million for repairs, the team
will keep all revenues, including naming rights.
</P>
<P>
   Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. has said that playing in the new
stadium could mean at least $20 million in additional annual
revenues for the team, which faced financial problems during and
after the 1994-95 players' strike.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, McLane threatened to sell a portion of the
Astros and move them to Virginia unless a new stadium was built in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole deal allows us to be financially competitive with
other clubs,'' McClaren said. ``That is why the naming rights are
so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us now to keep our good players, who will want more
money in the future. And it will allow us to go out and get better
players.''
</P>
<P>
   The new name will replace the stadium's working name _ The
Ballpark at Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' offices will be in the adjacent Union Station, which
will be called Union Station at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Enron can earn as much as $200 million over the 30 years for
managing the ballpark's energy services such as the electricity and
air conditioning, and managing all mechanical and electrical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good business transaction from the standpoint of energy
management and facility management,'' said Enron Chairman Ken Lay.
</P>
<P>
   Lay, who threw out the first ball at Tuesday's Astros game
against the Chicago Cubs, is largely responsible for getting the
stadium built downtown.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he put together a consortium that provided $34.7
million in a zero-interest loan to buy downtown land and help
subsidize stadium construction costs. Before then, discussion
revolved around building a new stadium next to the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this will further support the Astros and the
community, through the Astros,'' Lay said of the naming rights
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Enron, with revenue of $32.3 billion last year, is pioneering
the use of marketing contracts to gain entry into selling
electricity to ballparks and get other business from them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the company signed a 10-year marketing
agreement with the San Francisco Giants as part of a package to
sell electricity and manage building services at the team's new
Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Exelon Energy has signed a deal to sell electricity
to and manage the First Union Center and Spectrum in Philadelphia,
and Sempra Energy has signed a marketing deal with the Staples
Center in Los Angeles that includes electricity sales and
facilities management.
</P>
<P>
   Enron may not now sell electricity in Texas, but it is preparing
for that possibility should the Legislature deregulate the industry
and allow other businesses to compete with Reliant Energy in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 16 states have deregulated electricity, representing
service to 40 percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas deregulates electricity sales, Enron-subsidiary Enron
Energy Services will have the first right to sell electricity to
the ballpark, whose retractable-roof can be closed and cool air
introduced on hot days.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Enron will manage the chilled air provided by
competitor Reliant Energy subsidiary Northwind Houston. Reliant
edged Enron in a heated contest for the chilled-water contract last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Enron will need sports authority's approval to build a 4,500 to
5,000-space garage on both sides of U.S. 59 east of the ballpark,
part of the company's agreement with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The sports authority must approve the garage because it would
sit on land the authority is buying. &UR;  &LR; The site was originally
proposed for a 2,500-space surface parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   McClaren said the Astros and Enron would evenly split garage
revenues on game days, and are working out an arrangement for other
events.
</P>
<P>
   Enron believes more area parking will be needed as development
goes up around the ballpark. It is also considering using such a
garage during the daytime for employees working in a new building
the company is constructing on downtown's southwest side.
</P>
<P>
   Lay said Enron is also looking for other investment
opportunities in the ballpark area, which would allow it to
maximize the parking lot and sell energy- and facilities-management
to other buildings.

NICKLAUS: NO MASTERS MOPING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Jack Nicklaus, the only six-time champion in
Masters Tournament history, hit his lone shot of the 1999 event
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   While touring the course with Hootie Johnson, the club chairman,
Nicklaus borrowed a 5-iron from Carlos Franco and deposited a tee
shot on the putting surface at No. 12, a 155-yard par-3. His next
competitive swing at Augusta National Golf Club, Nicklaus vowed,
will come in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, 59, underwent hip replacement surgery in January that
will cause him to break a string of 40 consecutive Masters
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss the Masters. But I'm not going to sit around
and mope,'' said Nicklaus, who placed sixth at the 1998 Masters,
the highest finish ever recorded by a player old enough to compete
on the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Nicklaus said he plans to leave today on a five-day
fishing trip to the Bahamas and will spend little, if any, time
watching the event on television. He traveled to Augusta to attend
last night's champions dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, who completed an 18-hole round Sunday for the first
time since his surgery, has targeted the PGA Tour's Memorial
Tournament (June 3-6) as his probable return to competitive golf
... unless he plays the week before at a Senior Tour stop in
Philadelphia. He said he plans to compete in the U.S. Open, where
his string of consecutive appearances dates to 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Because his string of consecutive appearances in major
championships ended at the 1998 British Open, Nicklaus said
skipping the Masters ``is not as emotional as missing the British
Open. To me, once that streak stopped, they all came to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Others expressed more poignant sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a Masters without Jack Nicklaus is like your wife
losing the diamond out of her wedding ring,'' Greg Norman said.
``Jack put the Masters on the map to my generation of players. This
will be a sad week.'' \Nsubheds:Praise for Kuehne Nicklaus said he
was wowed yesterday by the driving prowess of Hank Kuehne, the U.S.
Amateur champ from SMU. Kuehne hit a driver and a pitching wedge to
the green at No. 15, a 500-yard par-5, in a practice round. Kuehne
also cut the corner at No. 13, a dogleg par-5, by driving over a
tall strand of trees left of the tee box.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where his balls landed, I'd say he'll be 20 yards past
Tiger Woods,'' Nicklaus said. ``It was pretty incredible to
watch.'' \Nsubheds:Format adjusted Because of the 96-player field,
the largest for any Masters since 1966, officials announced
contestants will be grouped in threesomes, rather than twosomes,
for the first two rounds. It marks the first time since 1962 that
tournament officials have used threesomes for reasons other than
weather delays.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, contestants will not be regrouped based on
opening-round scores for Friday's second round, as in years past.
They will play the first two rounds with the same threesome.
</P>

TWO STARS ROOKIES GET VALUABLE ICE TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Jon Sim and Brad Lukowich know all about
competition. They had to fight through a maze of challenges just to
get a chance to play in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created a good system in which it's difficult for a
young player to crack our lineup,'' said Craig Button, the Stars'
director of player personnel. ``We are not going to be putting
players into the NHL who are not ready for the NHL. We don't have
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the mental conditioning of their minor-league challenges
could prove the necessary training to keep the two Stars rookies in
the NHL for the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just getting here was tough,'' said Lukowich, a 22-year-old
defenseman who has outbattled fellow prospects Petr Buzek and
Sergey Gusev to earn the chance to play the past eight games with
the Stars. ``You definitely have to prove yourself to get a chance
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukowich and Sim are Stars prospects who have been learning
their craft at the minor-league level with the Michigan K-Wings _ a
place where they were lumped into large groups of players who were
selected to fill a few small needs.
</P>
<P>
   Lukowich has battled with Buzek and Gusev, as well as
20-year-old prospect Richard Jackman, for the right to be the
Stars' next defenseman in waiting. Gusev spent most of the season
with the Stars, but Lukowich ended up winning a key battle when
Gusev was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning last month for Benoit
Hogue. Now, Lukowich has stepped up as the immediate heir apparent
on defense.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's 3-0 loss to the Detroit Red Wings, Lukowich played
almost 10 minutes while veteran Doug Lidster was limited to just 33
seconds of ice time. Again, as small as it might have seemed,
Lukowich took another victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played well; he's shown he can play this game at the NHL
level,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``Then again, he's a
22-year-old defenseman playing against grown men.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukowich has been trained in the same system the Stars play. He
spent four seasons of junior hockey (1992-96) with the Kamloops
Blazers of the Western Hockey League _ a team that never wavered
much from the style that Hitchcock implemented when he was coach
there from 1984-90. Lukowich also has trained for the past three
seasons in the same system with the K-Wings.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-1, 195 pounds, he's a decent hitter who can also move
the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Sim is less of a known quantity for the Stars. But they like
what they've seen so far. The 5-foot-10, 175-pound left wing was
the Stars' third-round pick in 1996 and was playing his first
season with the K-Wings. A native of Nova Scotia, Sim was a natural
scorer in junior hockey, scoring 156 goals over the past three
seasons with the Sarnia Sting of the Ontario Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Sim draws immediate comparisons to 600 goal-scorer Dino
Ciccarelli as a short, pesky presence in front of the net, and he
has already scored one goal and taken six shots in four games with
the Stars. As a left-handed shooter, he had to work his way past
Jason Botterill and Jamie Wright to get this shot with the Stars.
And Sim has made an impression in his one season with the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't look out of place at all,'' Hitchcock said. ``He
draws comparisons to Ciccarelli, and you can see that in him. The
thing is, he's going to have to be productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock has Sim scheduled to play the left wing next to Joe
Nieuwendyk tonight against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim _ and that
means the coach is letting the rookie have every chance to be
productive.
</P>
<P>
   Because, as healthy bodies begin to return to the lineup,
Hitchcock is going to have some difficult decisions to make going
into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Defensemen Richard Matvichuk (groin and knee) and Shawn Chambers
(hip flexor) are out with injuries but due to return to the lineup
soon. If that happens, Lukowich probably becomes a backup to be
used in case of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   With Mike Modano (hip rotator muscle) and Brian Skrudland
(chest) also expected to play three or four of the final six games,
Sim may be phased out.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock said the two already have proven themselves
through a series of challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really thought much about \Rsending them back to
Kalamazoo\S,'' Hitchcock said. ``I really see both of them as part
of the mix right now.'' nn

MAVERICKS NOT READY TO START ALL OVER AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ This season started with so much promise for the
Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson, the team's coach and general manager, was confident
his team would be in playoff contention. Several Mavericks players
said the team had the ingredients to advance to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with less than a month remaining in the regular season, the
Mavericks are where they usually are this time of the year: close
to the Midwest Division basement.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, the Mavericks can't even improve their
position in the NBA draft lottery as the losses mount. That's
because Nelson traded their first-round pick to the Phoenix Suns
last summer for Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was so sure Nash was going to be an immediate hit _ and
that the first-round pick would be a mid- or late-round pick _ that
he went against every general manager's mode of operation and did
not even bother to lottery-protect the first-round pick to the Suns
for at least one year.
</P>
<P>
   Nash, who has been booed this season by Mavericks fans, knows he
hasn't come close to living up to the advance billing Nelson gave
him. He also knows he is part of the reason Mavericks and their
fans are about to miss out on the postseason party once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say anything to the fans, but I'm sorry,'' Nash said.
``I feel for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mavericks brought a lot of people here in the last year or
so. I know the record is not what they expect, but what can you
expect when this team has just been put together, and all of the
other teams are a few years ahead of us?''
</P>
<P>
   One of those teams is the Miami Heat, which plays host to the
Mavericks tonight at Miami Arena.
</P>
<P>
   All the Mavericks need is time together on the court and
everything will be OK, Nash said. Long-suffering Mavericks fans
have heard that lecture for almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Nash said if he were running the team, he wouldn't make
wholesale changes and start over again next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blow it up for what?,'' Nash asked. ``You blow it up to try
again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it some time. I'd still try to add some players. I don't
think this is the final product.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Shawn Bradley, one of the few bright spots on this
season's team, said starting over again is easier said than done,
and doesn't guarantee positive results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some time to rebuild,'' Bradley said. ``It
doesn't happen in one season, but we definitely need to improve and
find a steady improvement and see growth ... in order for it not to
get blown up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has repeatedly said he likes this group. He blames the
Mavericks' free-fall _ they are 11-23 and have lost nine
consecutive road games _ in part on injuries to Cedric Ceballos and
Robert Pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like this team, but we've been inconsistent,'' Nelson
said. ``But that's nothing that wasn't expected with a young team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to have some ups and downs. So a lot of
things that people are worried about, we're not as worried about
it. We just accept it as part of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Mavericks fans simply have to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans know that we've got some good players and good guys
on this team,'' Bradley said. ``I think they also know when you
blow up an organization time and time again, it's not going to get
better overnight.''

CLIPPERS' TAYLOR STILL HOBBLING

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The bilateral Achilles tendinitis that has
discouraged Maurice Taylor from moving around to fetch rebounds
kept him in street clothes for Tuesday night's game with Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still sore, still tight,'' Taylor said while make a commute

</P>
<P>
   That's when the Clippers square off with Kevin Garnett and the

</P>
<P>
   A bruised right knee prevented Phoenix power forward Tom
Gugliotta from getting in his shots at the Clippers. Gugliotta
didn't make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than start veteran Danny Manning, Suns coach Danny
Ainge was expected to start rookie Pat Garrity in Gugilotta's place
to maintain the team's crucial substitution pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns also were without shooting guard Rex Chapman, who
served the last mandatory game on the injured list thanks to a
turf-toe injury that somehow can be traced to the turf at America
West Arena.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: AIRLINES AND TRAVEL AGENCIES WOO SMALLER
BUSINESSES; HOTEL UPDATE
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traditionally not beneficiaries of special discounts and other
travel privileges like large corporations, smaller businesses are
now being wooed with such perks by travel agencies and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, British Airways has established a loyalty
program for small businesses that offers travel and merchandise
rewards, while American Express has set up a travel agency division
focused on the needs of small and medium-sized companies. AMR's
American Airlines, Continental Airlines and UAL's United Airlines
earlier introduced initiatives for smaller corporations similar to
the one offered by British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   According to Norman Sherlock, executive director of the National
Business Travel Association, which represents 1,200 corporate
travel managers, airlines in particular are pursuing small
businesses today because travel by multinational corporations is
declining. ``The business section of aircraft is not as fully
loaded as it once was, especially on flights to Asia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last month of NBTA members found that 53 percent of
their employers had reduced domestic business travel since March
1998, while an additional 20 percent had done so for the first time
this year. One-third of the respondents had reduced international
travel since last March, while 20 percent had reduced such travel
for the first time in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the American Express pursuit of smaller
corporations, Sherlock said, is airlines' continuing efforts to cut
commission payments, which are putting increased pressure on the
agency giant's bottom line. ``This is causing them to reach out
anywhere they can to find revenue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Sherlock suggested the travel companies' initiatives
represent ``smart recognition by good business people that little
seedling companies can become big oaks.'' He added: ``You can see
that with Internet services and technology companies, which are
growing rapidly. They believe these companies will grow into big
accounts someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Benefits offered by airline programs to small businesses
increase as businesses buy more air travel. These programs do not
preclude a company's employees from accruing regular frequent-flier
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some of the programs for small and medium-sized
businesses:
</P>
<P>
   _ American Airlines' Business Extra program is open to companies
that spend $40,000 a year with the carrier and its regional
affiliates. Benefits include free domestic tickets, upgrades on
domestic and international flights, and participation, on a select
basis, in a premium tier of American's frequent-flier plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ The American Express One travel agency division caters to
companies whose annual travel volume is less than $10 million; no
minimum level of travel spending is required. The division manages
travel and negotiates special rates for its clients. Scott Tarte,
American Express One's business unit leader, declined to quantify
service fees charged by the division, stating only that every
account is analyzed according to its merits.
</P>
<P>
   _ British Airways' Venture Club requires that at least three

COUPLE GO ON TRIAL IN THEFT OF PIECE OF A CRASHED JET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Fla.)  (nk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ When Trans World Airlines Flight 800 exploded
and crashed off Long Island in July 1996, killing all 230 people on
board, some investigators initially theorized that the jetliner
might have been brought down by a missile.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who avidly pursued the theory _ to the annoyance of
the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board _ were a
self-styled freelance investigative journalist, James Sanders, 53,
and his wife, Elizabeth, 52, who trained TWA flight attendants and
knew many of the crew members who died aboard the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who live in Williamsburg, Va., were seated Tuesday
at the defense table in U.S. District Court here, charged by the
federal government with conspiracy and aiding in the theft of a
small piece of seat fabric from the plane's wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who ultimately wrote a book about the results of his
own investigation, has said the fabric contains a red dye that
proves the plane was hit by an errant Navy missile. The government,
which has dismissed the missile theory, says the red substance is
fabric glue.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is just one of many reverberations from the crash,
which continues to hold a fascination for conspiracy theorists,
half a dozen of whom were in the courtroom Tuesday for the opening
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   In his argument, the prosecutor insisted that the trial had
nothing to do with the publication of Sanders' 1997 book, ``The
Downing of Flight 800.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case about what caused the crash of TWA Flight
800 or whether their actions obstructed justice,'' said Assistant
U.S. Attorney David B. Pitofsky. ``It's simply about their
involvement in a conspiracy to remove parts of a plane involved in
an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, J. Bruce Maffeo, who is representing Sanders, told
the jury that the prosecution's case was ``much ado about
nothing,'' and represented a continuing effort by the government to
harass the couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their only motive was to get at the truth,'' Maffeo said of
the Sanderses, who are each free on $50,000 bond and face up to 10
years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Gutman, a lawyer representing Mrs. Sanders, told the jury
that his client had trained and worked with many of the crew
members who died in the crash and that her only intent was to help
find the cause of the explosion. ``The government would have you
believe that trying to find out the truth is a conspiracy,'' Gutman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides reminded the jury that no one had yet
determined what caused the explosion and crash of the jet 12
minutes after it took off from Kennedy International Airport for
Paris on the evening of July 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanderses are charged under a relatively new federal law
enacted by Congress in 1996 after a truck driver in Florida was
accused of taking a piece of plane wreckage from the May 1996
Valujet crash as a souvenir. The law makes it illegal to remove,
conceal or withhold parts of a civil aircraft involved in an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the courtroom supporting the Sanderses Tuesday
were several people who said the government was conspiring to
suppress the truth about the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The is a terrible miscarriage of justice,'' said William S.
Donaldson III, a retired Navy crash investigator and attack pilot,
who said during a break in the proceedings that he had proof the
jetliner was brought down by a Chinese-made, shoulder-launched
rocket fired by a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sent a 130-page to the Congress last July, but the
government wants to suppress the truth,'' he said. ``The White
House sent out over 1,000 agents after the crash to prevent the
public from finding out it was done by terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky told the jury that he planned to present 10 to 12
prosecution witnesses, including a former TWA pilot, Capt. Terrell
Stacey, who he said helped obtain the seat fabric from a government
hangar in Calverton, on Long Island, where investigators had
reassembled the wreckage of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Stacey had admitted to taking the plane part and
giving it to Sanders. ``He'll also tell you how he agreed to supply
Jim Sanders with confidential documents.'' Pitofsky told the jury.
``Captain Stacey will take you step by step and tell you about his
and the defendants' participation in the scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said Stacey had agreed to testify in exchange for a
lesser charge, theft of government property, a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's proceedings, the Sanderses held hands,
occasionally exchanging reassuring smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done nothing wrong,'' Sanders said as they left the
courthouse late in the afternoon. ``This is nothing more than a
case of government oppression.''

AMID ALTERED COPIER LANDSCAPE, NEW CHIEF IS NAMED AT XEROX
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that everyone knew was coming, the Xerox Corp. named
G. Richard Thoman, 54, as its chief executive Tuesday. He replaces
Paul A. Allaire, 60, who remains as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was preordained, part of the normal evolution,'' said
Peter J. Enderlin, an analyst with the First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said,
``Let's hope he executes the distribution and cost-cutting plans
that have been articulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoman has been groomed to succeed Allaire ever since he joined
Xerox from the IBM in June 1997, so his ascension is unlikely to
touch off any strategic or cultural shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a change agent,'' Thoman said in an interview
before the announcement. ``But Paul and I evolved a workable style,
so there's no need to change things.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thoman takes the helm at a time of unprecedented change
for Xerox, which is based in Stamford, Conn. Digital technology has
blurred the line between copiers and printers, and has made it
possible to plug printer-copiers into computer networks. That has
moved responsibility for buying the hybrids out of the procurement
department _ once a Xerox stronghold _ and into the purchasing
realm of information systems specialists, who are more familiar
with computer companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Xerox is not only competing with traditional rivals like
Canon and Ricoh but with companies like Hewlett-Packard. It is even
up against Heidelberger Druckmaschinen A.G., the German printing
company that is buying the Eastman Kodak Co.'s copier business.
</P>
<P>
   Every contender in this emerging document processing industry is
trying to establish the densest global distribution and service
networks. And no one is ceding any ground.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Ikon Office Solutions, a large distributor of
copiers, recently stopped selling products made by the Sharp Corp.
of Japan. Since Ikon had been Sharp's primary distributor in the
United States, many analysts left the company for dead in the
American market.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharp carved a $1 billion office-equipment division out of
the hodgepodge of microwaves, videocassette recorders and other
consumer products that the Sharp Electronics Corp., its American
arm, sells in the United States. And it hired Joseph Rickard as the
first American to run it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Setting up the distribution and support to service national
and eventually, global, accounts will be my main focus,'' Rickard
said.
</P>
<P>
   If ``know thine enemy'' is good advice, Rickard was a perfect
choice: He goes to Sharp after 21 years with Xerox, many of them
running its network of independent sales representatives and
distributors.

PENSION FUND AT NISSAN HAS $4.76 BILLION SHORTAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest auto maker,
detailed the extent of its pension financing shortage Tuesday,
disclosing a gap almost twice as large as analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman, Masataka Saito, said the shortage in Nissan's
consolidated pension fund was 580 billion yen, or $4.76 billion at
current exchange rates, based on a relatively conservative assumed
rate of return of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Saito said the shortage's size, first reported in The Financial
Times, could shrink drastically, depending on regulatory changes
the government is now considering that would diminish the effect of
new accounting rules that force companies to disclose pension
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's going to cost them more money in the
future than you would have known before you had this information,''
said Christopher Richter, an auto analyst with HSBC Securities
here. ``Nissan does have a lot of other financial baggage to carry,
so it's significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is not the only Japanese company with notable shortages
in its pension funds. According to newspaper reports, the Toyota
Motor Corp.'s gap is roughly 300 billion yen, and Honda Motor has
said that its pensions are underfunded by about 220 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
   The problem extends far beyond the auto industry. Kathy Matsui,
chief strategist at Goldman Sachs Japan Ltd., who has done
extensive research into the pension problems of corporations, has
estimated that the combined deficit could reach 80 trillion yen, or
$666 billion at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   That is far more than the official level of bad debts at Japan's
troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
   Based on reports about Toyota and Honda, analysts had predicted
that Nissan's pension problem would cost it about 300 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Boardman, an auto analyst at Warburg Dillon Read here,
said the revised figures had actually been included in material
given to analysts at a meeting that followed Renault S.A.'s
announcement on March 27 that it would pay $5.4 billion for a 36.8
percent stake in Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   He said Renault explained that the value of Nissan's land
holdings would almost totally offset its pension shortage. The
French auto maker has valued Nissan's property portfolio between
400 billion and 500 billion yen, according to Boardman, although
Nissan had previously valued it around a trillion yen.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Renault appears to have sharply marked down the
value of Nissan's assets, bringing them more into line with market
realities. Nissan had estimated the value of its assets at $10.4
billion, Boardman said. But Renault cut that by roughly 40 percent,
putting the total _ including the $5.4 billion it is paying Nissan
for its stake _ at $11.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan officials have also been lowering expectations about the
company's profitability in the fiscal year that ended on March 31.
Previously, Nissan had said it expected to lose 10 billion yen, but
Tuesday, Japan's leading business daily, Nihon Keizai Shimbun,
reported that the company now expects a 35 billion yen loss.
</P>
<P>
   That would not be surprising, given the company's weak domestic
sales. In March, Nissan's sales slid 15.9 percent, according to the
Japan Automobile Dealers Association. Nissan has missed out on the
boom in ``mini-vehicles'' _ tiny cars with tiny engines that offer
owners special tax breaks and and easier parking. Toyota also had
no mini-vehicle, although its interest in Daihatsu, which does make
the little cars, effectively gave it a presence in that market. It
also sells the new Vitz, which is not technically a mini-car but
appeals to the same buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is not planning to introduce any new models in the first
half of the new fiscal year _ the period through Sept. 30 _ which
will make it even harder for the company to improve sales. ``I'm
not worried about pension shortfalls,'' Boardman said. ``I'm
worried about sales in April, May, June, July.''

MARKETERS UNITE BEHIND `FAMILY FRIENDLY' PROGRAMMING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A serious effort by marketers to urge more ``family
friendly'' television programming has picked up speed, with more
than a score of leading advertisers now supporting plans to
stimulate producers to develop _ and networks to schedule _ such
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The progress of those plans was outlined Tuesday at the opening
of the annual Television Advertising Forum sponsored by the
Association of National Advertisers. The forum, at the Plaza Hotel
in Manhattan, drew more than 250 executives from consumer-product
companies and TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   New nudges in the push for family-oriented programming _
particularly in the first two hours of prime time _ include
meetings with the Hollywood studios and the broadcast networks;
encouraging production companies, networks and writers with
incentives like awards and scholarships; stepping up promotional
campaigns for designated shows, and paying somewhat higher rates
than usual to run commercials during programs that may not reach as
large an audience as those infused with sex, violence, frank
language and wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Those steps were described in a presentation by Andrea Alstrup,
vice president for advertising at Johnson &AMP; Johnson, and Robert L.
Wehling, corporate officer for global marketing, market research
and government relations at the Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no desire to complain or whine or censor,'' Wehling
said. ``We are simply looking for more choices we don't have to
think twice about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to show this programming has a market,'' he added,
``and to show it can be financially successful for advertisers and
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   The efforts began last year when 10 of them formed a coalition.
In addition to Johnson &AMP; Johnson and P&AMP;G, the marketing behemoths
involved included AT&AMP;T; Coca-Cola; Ford Motor; General Motors; IBM;
McDonald's; Nestle; Pfizer; Sears, Roebuck; Warner-Lambert, and
Wendy's International.
</P>
<P>
   These corporations wield a powerful weapon: the billions of
dollars they spend each year to pitch products on media outlets,
especially on broadcast network TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are opportunities for several advertisers to work
together,'' Ms. Alstrup said, because ``we're finding many of us
have a lot in common.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperative ventures could include jointly producing or
sponsoring programs, she added, rather than attempting the more
difficult task of adopting common guidelines to use in screening
programs for objectionable content.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here for the duration,'' Ms. Alstrup said. ``This is not
a six-month plan; this is a long-term plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the customers most coveted by corporate sponsors
_ the freer-spending shoppers 18 to 49 _ have generally become more
enamored of shows with content deemed too contentious by the
advertisers that have long supported family-friendly fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get into a lot of discussions in this industry,''
Wehling said, asserting that ``family friendly programming, by its
very nature, skews older and would not be an efficient buy for
advertisers seeking the 18-to-49-year-old audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe when there is viable, creatively written
family-friendly programming,'' he added, ``it can do a very decent
rating in the audience we all seek.''
</P>
<P>
   Wehling offered as examples ``Sabrina the Teen-Age Witch,'' a
sitcom on ABC that P&AMP;G helps produce; ``Touched by an Angel'' on
CBS; ``Dilbert,'' a new animated series on UPN; and ``7th Heaven,''
a series on the WB network about a minister and his large family.
</P>
<P>
   The praise for ``7th Heaven'' seemed unusual: Plot lines are
often focused on issues like drug use, adultery and sexual activity
among teen-agers. But those subjects are typically treated in a
context of the minister's teaching his children about right and
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a family orientation ``doesn't mean we don't want to be in
dramatic programming,'' Ms. Alstrup said, ``or not be in
programming with controversial content.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to preach morality,'' she added. ``There are
younger people with younger families paying close attention to what
their kids are seeing and hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wehling agreed that context played an important part in deciding
which shows to embrace or eschew. ``We generally stay away from any
violence,'' he said, ``but we'd be very comfortable with
sponsorship of `Schindler's List' '' because that film about the
Holocaust ``had scenes that made you close your eyes, yet the
context is so compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wehling compared P&AMP;G's concern about prime-time content with
a question from the audience about the content of the daytime soap
operas the company produces like ``Another World'' and ``As the
World Turns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If all of you were soap watchers, I wouldn't have to do much
defending,'' Wehling said. ``The reason we're very comfortable with
our soap-opera sponsorship is that the soap opera in a very real
way is a morality play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a soap opera, you reap what you sow,'' he added, ``and when
you as a character do something wrong, you pay for that. The viewer
knows that. And that is one of the attractions to the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only question is when and how,'' Wehling said, ``and I
will admit it sometimes takes a long time.'' That remark, delivered
with a smile, elicited laughs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As for perceptions among members of minority groups and
nontraditional families that describing programming as family
friendly or family oriented is meant to exclude them, Wehling said
that he was also comfortable with the term ``multigenerational
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   He defined such programming as shows that would be ``interesting
and entertaining'' rather than embarrassing if ``you had your
mother and your daughter with you and you were watching together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an easy issue for the networks,'' Wehling said,
because they ``say they have to be responsive to what they perceive
as viewer demand'' in the form of higher ratings for less
family-oriented programs and ``compete against cable and pay
programming'' with their far less restrictive rules for language
and images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are very clear they're after the teen-age and
young adult urban audience that wants edgier programming, and
that's OK,'' he added. ``We're not trying to take away choices from
viewers, from the advertising community. All we're asking for is an
expansion of the choices available to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards intended to reward those who support family-oriented
programs will be given out at a luncheon planned for Sept. 9 at the
Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif. Among those to be
honored with the Family Programming Awards, to be bestowed
annually, will be ``one or more current successful family-friendly
programs,'' Wehling said, ``and one or more individuals identified
with family-friendly programming over a long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be co-sponsored by the advertiser consortium
along with the advertiser association, the Advertising Council, the
American Advertising Federation and the American Association of
Advertising Agencies. The advertisers hope to produce a television
special covering the awards ceremony, Ms. Alstrup said.

HOW INTERNET MANIA COULD BRING PILOTS' UNION TO HEEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Internet companies can create tremendous
wealth overnight, but can the current Internet mania by investors
help management bring a labor union to heel?
</P>
<P>
   It may be a testament to Wall Street's current faith in the
omnipotence of the World Wide Web that some people are convinced it
can _ at least in the case of AMR Corp., the parent of American
Airlines, which is currently at war with its pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The idea comes in the aftermath of last week's initial public
offering of Priceline.com, which allows customers to name their own
price for airplane tickets on the Web. After less than a year in
business, during which it lost $114 million selling $35 million
worth of airline tickets, Priceline.com is valued at $10 billion,
more than the combined worth of UAL's United Airlines, Northwest
Airlines and Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to American, AMR owns the Sabre Group, an
information technology company that in turn owns Travelocity, which
is the leading seller of airplane tickets over the Web. It too lost
money last year but it sold $285 million worth of airline tickets,
hotel rooms and rental cars. Depending on whom you believe,
Travelocity on its own could be worth _ pick a number _ $1 billion,
$5 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to get at the value of Travelocity is for AMR to
divest Sabre,'' said Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter. ``One of the byproducts of that is that the airline
gets isolated. And if the airline is out there by itself, you would
see the poor return on investment and the lousy operating margins.
The market would force discipline on the management and then on the
union.''
</P>
<P>
   That discipline, he added, would help AMR management convince
the pilots _ as well as its other unions _ that the company cannot
afford to concede too much. ``Right now there is an intangible
situation where the airline gets refuge under the Sabre umbrella,''
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   AMR, which currently owns 82 percent of Sabre, would not comment
on whether it plans to spin off the rest of the company. But the
move may be hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Since Priceline.com began trading last week, Sabre's stock price
has soared 32 percent, or $14.375 a share, closing Tuesday at $58 a
share, up $3. Likewise, AMR stock, which had suffered in recent
weeks after a Feb. protest by its pilots forced it to cancel nearly
6,700 flights, has risen sharply as well. Tuesday it closed at
$65.6875, up $1.0625, and it has increased 16 percent since last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the marketplace leads management's strategic
thinking,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Michael Durham, Sabre's chief
executive, would not say whether Sabre would spin off Travelocity
but he was relishing the temptation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old finance guy,'' said Durham, who was formerly AMR's
chief financial officer. ``If somebody tells me that I can get $10
billion for a company that is losing money, it sort of feels like
you might want to be a seller.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly added that separating Travelocity from Sabre
would remove many of the important benefits that it gets from
Sabre's other businesses. The company, which had $2.3 billion in
revenue last year, operates the world's largest airline computer
reservation system and has a large information-technology
consulting business. Whenever Sabre's software designers come up
with a new feature for the services it offers travel agents and
corporations, it can also add the same functionality to
Travelocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there is a tremendous frenzy in the marketplace
right now,'' Durham said. ``But our shareholders and board of
directors have put us here to optimize the long-term value of
Sabre.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the longer the Internet frenzy lasts, the more AMR appears
to be tugged in two different directions. Sabre now trades at about
30 times expected 1998 earnings, while AMR without Sabre might
trade at about five times earnings. Without the speculation of a
spinoff, Sabre's share price would certainly fall. (It traded as
low as $23 a share last year).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are only getting an airline multiple for Sabre
earnings, you are hurting shareholders,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an
analyst at Paine Webber in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly why Murphy believes that a Sabre spinoff
ultimately would force American's unions to bend by isolating the
airline. But the pilots see things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is probably a counterproductive strategy,'' said
Brian Mayhew, vice president of the Allied Pilots Association, the
American pilots' union. ``I don't think that because they spin off
Sabre tomorrow our professional worth is less.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots and AMR management are in mediation this week in an
attempt to settle a dispute over AMR's purchase of Reno Air, a
small carrier in the West. American's pilots were so upset with the
company for what they say are a series of deliberate contract
violations that when negotiations broke down in early February over
how to merge Reno into American's network, thousands of pilots
called in sick, stranding hundreds of thousands of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   John Pincavage, an airline analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, said
that the unions did not care that airlines were not as profitable
as Internet companies; they just see four consecutive years of
record profits, not the low fuel prices and travel agent commission
cuts that have sustained them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the airlines making the kind of money they are making,
the unions wouldn't buy that,'' he said, referring to the market
discipline described by Murphy. ``All they know is that they gave
in the past and they are not seeing their paychecks go up.''

WHITE EMERGES QUICKLY AS LEADER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Devon White brought problems to management in
years past, he was labeled a complainer.
</P>
<P>
   When Dodgers teammates approached him this spring about problems
they had, it was White who relayed them to manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was a team meeting Sunday, which Johnson welcomed
openly. Then the players had one Monday to discuss the upcoming
season. And White said it was something the team needed if the
Dodgers are going to win with regularity this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a team like this, with so many new guys, you have to go
through it and let them know you're all going to be on the same
page,'' White said before Tuesday's game with the Arizona
Diamondbacks. ``Last year (with Arizona) was unfortunate in that I
was on a team with a lot of young players and they didn't speak up
much. When I spoke up, it looked like I was a troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a team like (the Dodgers), we have a lot of veterans in
here, and they are not afraid to say things. It was people sharing
their feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of his stellar defensive game and his combination of
power and speed, one of the reasons the Dodgers signed White during
the offseason was his clubhouse demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take long for guys to listen to Devon White,'' said
Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield, a teammate of White's in
Florida. ``The respect factor is already there. He brings World
Series rings, and the guy knows how to get it done. Just look at
his rings.''
</P>
<P>
   For those unable to view White's jewelry collection, he has
three World Series rings _ one with the Florida Marlins and two
with the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   A day to remember: When lefty Onan Masaoka left the Dodgers'
bullpen to pitch the eighth inning opening day, he was looking
around the crowd for his mom. He couldn't find her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was way up in the upper deck,'' Masaoka said. ``I forgot
to leave passes for my family, so they sat up there. When I came
out, she couldn't even see that it was me.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Masaoka was presented with a piece of home _ a lei
his aunt sent from his native Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Extra innings: Left-hander Chris Haney, who competed for one of
the Dodgers' lefty spots in the bullpen during spring training,
signed with the Cleveland Indians. . . . Even though five-sixths of
the bullpen worked opening day, Johnson said the only one who
wasn't available for Tuesday's game was converted starter Dave
Mlicki, the only reliever not to appear Monday. ``He had full side
work and I wouldn't want to bring him back after a full day of
getting hot,'' Johnson said.

EDITORIAL: FASTER AID FOR THE REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 7:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has achieved a great deal in recent days to
rush assistance to the desperate refugees from Kosovo, but much
remains to be done. The United States now estimates that nearly a
million of Kosovo's 1.8 million ethnic Albanians have fled their
homes, and nearly half a million of them have left Kosovo.
Medicine, tons of food and hundreds of tents are on the way to the
region, thanks in large part to an American airlift. But the White
House must continue to direct the aid effort to insure that
bureaucratic inertia does not impede the flow of supplies and that
the Balkan area is not destabilized by the sudden population shift.
</P>
<P>
   The least help so far has gone to Montenegro, a tiny Yugoslav
republic at odds with the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, which
may be his next target. In the last year it has absorbed the
equivalent of nearly 15 percent of its population in refugees. But
the war and the presence of Yugoslav troops have blocked NATO
airlifts and closed other channels for help. If this does not
change, financial assistance should be sent to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Albania, the poorest nation in Europe, has taken in a
quarter-million people, and tens of thousands are waiting to cross
the border. The refugees are being moved from the frontier to more
settled areas, where tent cities, with security provided by NATO
troops, are waiting. But these convoys cannot keep up with the
flood of new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, relations between the country's Albanian minority
and its largely pro-Serb majority were always tense, and the
government fears an influx of ethnic Albanians will lead to unrest.
NATO must be sensitive to this danger. Stability in Macedonia keeps
the war from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   But Macedonia's concerns are no excuse for its harsh treatment
of the refugees, and its attempt to limit their number. There are
still more than 65,000 people stuck on the Kosovo side of the
border, hungry, sick and exposed to the cold. Macedonia needs to be
admitting and helping refugees as fast as it can. At the same time
NATO should be carrying out its pledge to move 100,000 of them to
temporary homes in Western Europe. The United States will house
20,000 at the Guantanamo naval base in Cuba. Only a few European
countries have so far volunteered to take refugees. That must
change, and quickly. &QL;

CRIMINOLOGISTS SAY CURFEWS WORK WHERE ENFORCED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Keeping kids off the streets of the northeast San
Fernando Valley through a nighttime curfew has helped drive down
burglary and robbery rates there to the lowest citywide, police
say.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill Division hands out
twice as many curfew citations as other divisions, and it was the
only one with a decline in violent crime during the first three
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of juveniles who burglarize cars and instigate a
lot of violent crimes on the streets,'' said Foothill Division
Capt. Ken Garner. ``The curfews have really worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The division's property crime rate fell by 25 percent,
dramatically below other Valley divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's top police officer, Deputy Chief Mike Bostic, said
tough enforcement of the curfew wouldn't necessarily work as well
elsewhere in the suburban San Fernando Valley northwest of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ordinance doesn't work as much in places like North
Hollywood where the crime patterns show it's more adults causing
problems,'' Bostic said. ``I tell the division commanders to use
whatever tools they can to reduce crime. The curfew isn't a
cure-all issue.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the numbers seem to tell a different story: Property
crimes -- which police say are largely caused by juveniles -- are
down only 4.5 percent in the North Hollywood Division and are up
1.3 percent in the Devonshire Division.
</P>
<P>
   North Hollywood Division Capt. Rick Wahler said his officers
enforced the curfew aggressively, and the juvenile-crime problem
stopped, so now there is no need to continue regular patrols.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't make sense to have officers patrol areas where the
problem had diminished,'' Wahler said. ``They continue to enforce
the curfew on regular patrols, but we don't do any more special
enforcements.''
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime in North Hollywood increased 6.5 percent, caused
by a surge in domestic violence, Wahler said. ``That's an area that
has nothing to do with the curfew,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the Van Nuys Division, officers have focused on stemming
school truancy rather than enforcing nighttime curfews, said
Detective Craig Rhudy. At night, he said, officers are too busy
with emergency calls to deal with curfew violators.
</P>
<P>
   The property crime rate in Rhudy's division declined 8.4
percent, while violent crimes rose 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our crime rate would decline even further if we spent
more time on the curfew,'' Wahler said. ``We might be starting an
enforcement program soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Criminologists insist that curfews work.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide studies show that when police enforce the curfew,
crime drops, said Daniel Glaser, a University of Southern
California professor who specializes in juvenile crime and crime
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more kids getting in trouble these days and, if police
are there to send them home, there's no trouble,'' Glaser said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Los Angeles ACLU questions whether curfew enforcement
decreases crime, said Liz Schroeder, associate director of the Los
Angeles chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to attribute crime drops to things like the curfew,
but it's really jobs and the economy that play a big role,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old Jaime Orosco, who likes to hang out in Hubert
H. Humphrey Memorial Park, laments the fact that his park-loitering
freedom slips away as the sun sets over Lake View Terrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go out at night without getting hassled anymore,''
said Orosco. ``I have some friends that got tickets. They're out
like crazy. The cops just pick on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Most curfews for minors have been upheld in state and federal
courts, despite protests from parents, kids and civil rights groups
that say the rules are discriminatory and don't include enough
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the first U.S. Supreme Court action of its kind involving
curfews, justices allowed police in Charlottesville, Va., to
continue enforcing their ordinance despite claims the law deprived
minors and their parents of their freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder also says there appear to be biases against minorities
in areas where the curfew is enforced heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally we feel that curfew ordinances are enforced
disproportionately in minority areas, like in the Foothill
Division, instead of white areas,'' Schroeder said. ``The
ordinances should be done in a way that they don't interfere with
the rights of kids and they aren't used as an excuse to harass.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument makes sense to Orosco's 19-year-old friend David
Misa, even though he's of legal age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we like to cruise around and just kick it, you know,
on Friday and Saturday,'' Misa said. ``But the cops come and bug
us, and it gets broken up. Some people won't even come out because
they don't want to get hassled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the cops are being racist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy enforcement has nothing to do with race, Garner said. It's
about auto thefts, burglaries and gang violence attributed to the
region's Pacoima gangsters -- most of the crimes committed by
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curfew has been a great tool, especially at places like
Humphrey Park where we were having serious gang problems,'' said
Foothill gang Detective Bob Brophy. ``Since we vigorously started
enforcing the curfew, the gang problem has dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the drop in property crimes, violent crimes fell by 3
percent while the rest of the Valley's divisions have increased.
</P>
<P>
   Foothill Division has issued more than 3,600 citations since
mid-1996 -- almost double the amount written by other Valley
divisions during the same time.
</P>
<P>
   While the curfew ordinance has been on the books for many years,
it didn't begin having an impact until 1996 when heavy enforcement
began, said LAPD Juvenile Division Detective David Berglund.
</P>
<P>
   The state changed the penal code in 1996, allowing officers to
enforce the ordinance by handing out citations instead of taking
kids in and getting wrapped up in delinquency court.
</P>
<P>
   Every juvenile issued a citation must appear in traffic court,
and penalties range from community service to between $250 and $675
in fines.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 7:
</P>
<P>
   In a Cincinnati courtroom this week, Mike Gallagher, a former
investigative reporter for The Cincinnati Enquirer, acknowledged
that protecting the confidentiality of a source was ``one of the
highest responsibilities a journalist has.'' Then he proceeded to
reveal to the court the name of one of his major sources. As a
former colleague of Gallagher said after witnessing the breaking of
one of journalism's most hallowed and least flexible rules,
``Gallagher sold out everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   What led to this sellout was a big investigative story gone
awry. It began when Gallagher and others at The Enquirer were
investigating Chiquita Brands International, one of Cincinnati's
most influential corporations. At some point the reporter learned
access codes to voice mail received by Chiquita executives, and
began listening to their private phone messages. He told the paper
what he was doing; the editors ordered him to stop, but Gallagher
has acknowledged that he continued accessing the phone messages in
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Last May the paper published a large section about Chiquita that
raised important questions about the company's business practices.
About two months later The Enquirer issued a broad apology to
Chiquita not only for Gallagher's unacceptable method of tapping
into voice mail but also for the ``untrue conclusions'' about the
company in his articles. The paper also paid Chiquita an unusually
large settlement of $10 million and dismissed Gallagher. Since then
the former reporter has pleaded guilty to two federal charges of
stealing Chiquita's internal communications and has agreed to
identify his sources in testimony in any other trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher certainly has every right to mount a vigorous defense,
but his decision to disclose sources betrays the most basic code of
what is undoubtedly now his former profession. The contract between
a source and a journalist is one of the sacred bonds, and many a
reporter has promised to go to jail to protect such an agreement.
Gallagher's attorney has argued that when the accused reporter
revealed his source in this convoluted case, the name was already
well known to officials at Chiquita as well as the legal
authorities. Such an argument attempts to sidestep the basic
problem _ that Gallagher reneged on his word.
</P>
<P>
   The instinct to look into the operations of a powerful local
company like Chiquita was a laudable effort, but Gallagher tainted
that effort with unethical reporting techniques and then damaged
his former profession by breaking the contract between reporters
and confidential sources.

3 FACTORS, INCLUDING JURY ANONYMITY, SEEMED PIVOTAL TO GOTTI'S
PLEA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER and JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, government prosecutors and lawyers for John A. Gotti
had haggled over whether the accused Mafia figure would plead
guilty in his upcoming racketeering and extortion case. And every
time he seemed on the verge of agreeing to a such deal, the talks
would collapse, and his lawyers would defiantly declare that the
government's case was weak and that they were heading to trial.
</P>
<P>
   But late last week, something happened to change the calculation
for both sides. In a closed hearing in U.S. District Court in White
Plains, prosecutors told Judge Barrington Parker that Gotti had
hired a private investigator with a history of witness tampering,
and noted pointedly that Gotti's father, John J. Gotti, was ``an
accomplished practitioner of jury tampering.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words, the prosecutors convinced Parker to keep
secret the names of jurors in Gotti's trial. Defense lawyers denied
any allegations of misconduct, but the decision cast a chill over
the defense team, one lawyer said, which feared that an anonymous
jury could create an aura of menace in the courtroom and possibly
tilt the balance against the man prosecutors called the acting boss
of the Gambino crime family.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's lawyers resumed plea talks, and by Monday evening Gotti
was standing before Parker and admitting that he took part in a
criminal racket that used bribery, extortion and threats of
violence to earn its illicit money.
</P>
<P>
   An account of the seesawing negotiations, provided by lawyers
and government authorities close to the case, indicates that there
were three factors pivotal to the outcome beyond the strength of
the government's case: Parker's decision to keep the jurors' names
secret, word from Brooklyn that the U.S. attorney there was about
to indict Gotti for filing false tax returns, and the willingness
of the government to offer Gotti assurances that he would not be
further prosecuted on those tax charges or for any other crimes now
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``John himself said that when he has to say goodbye to his
children he wants to do this once,'' said Gerald Shargel, Gotti's
lawyer. ``He wants to go to jail once. The life of being the prey
of law enforcement is no life for him, and he truly wants to put
this all behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the plea should end the
Gotti family's control over the Gambino family, which officials say
they believe the elder Gotti was trying to run through his son from
a prison cell in Marion, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   And while experts in and out of government largely agreed that
the reign of the Gottis was over, some said the impact on the crime
family would be minimal, in part because the family was already in
disarray after years of successful prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you convict an acting boss of a major crime family,
that's really important,'' said J. Bruce Mouw, former head of the
FBI's Gambino squad in New York. But he said the younger Gotti has
essentially been absent in recent years. ``They've had no
leadership,'' he said. ``The morale is very poor. They are very
disorganized.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Lewis Schiliro, director of the New York office of the
FBI, said that putting Gotti in prison will further disrupt ``the
administration of the family,'' and lessen its influence ``in those
industries they historically controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the plea, Gotti faces a maximum sentence of seven
years and three months and a $1 million fine. In addition, he
agreed to forfeit property and money worth more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But until the government persuaded Parker last Thursday to allow
a secret jury, it looked as though there would be no plea, just a
trial. Some defense lawyers see anonymous juries as a disadvantage
because they can raise fears in jurors' minds about the defendants,
and impose a kind of presumption of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that ruling, though, the deal continued to elude the
two sides for a couple of days. A breakthrough seemed to come
Sunday night when Sarita Kedia, a young defense lawyer in Shargel's
office, talked with Carol Sipperly, the lead prosecutor in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kedia was able to forge a congenial relationship with Ms.
Sipperly, and Shargel has come to rely on her.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Kedia's account of the conversation, Ms.
Sipperly suddenly said, ``I can't believe we're going to trial over
what are minor differences'' in the terms of a plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kedia said she tried to make clear to Ms. Sipperly that the
most important thing to Gotti was what she called ``coverage'' _
language in the plea agreement assuring Gotti that once he pleaded
guilty to specified crimes, the government would promise that he
would not be prosecuted in the future for any matters that federal
or state authorities were now investigating.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Gotti and his lawyers had come close to accepting a
prosecution offer that would have required a jail sentence of 6 1/2
to 8 years. By February, the government had improved its offer to a
sentence ranging from five years and 10 months to seven years and
three months _ identical to what Gotti finally accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti continued to hold out, apparently counting on what he saw
as weaknesses in the government's case. But his attention became
focused, lawyers said, by external events, such as the ruling on
secret juries. Then, in recent days, it became clear that an
investigation by the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn of Gotti's tax
returns was likely to produce an additional indictment against
Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   With the knowledge that he could face a sentence of about 15
years if convicted at trial, Gotti decided that he could plead
guilty to reduced charges and avoid the risk of the longer term and
be assured that he would no longer be the target of prosecutors.

CARDINAL AND PARENTS OF DIALLO SHARE HOPES
</HEADLINE>

 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cardinal John O'Connor met for 40 minutes Tuesday
with Amadou Diallo's parents, and both sides emerged expressing
hope that the public outcry over Diallo's death in a hail of police
gunfire would help heal racial tension in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal also agreed to join the Rev. Al Sharpton and the
Rev. Ruben Diaz of the New York Hispanic Clergy Organization for a
prayer service devoted to Diallo's memory in the Bronx in the
coming weeks, and perhaps to visit the vestibule where the
22-year-old street peddler was gunned down two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows all religion is about healing,'' Kadiadou Diallo,
Diallo's mother, said after the meeting. ``We agreed on one thing:
All of us, we pray to one God. He told us people should leave their
differences and come together, and something good will come out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Saikou Diallo, Diallo's father, said the cardinal spoke
emotionally and with deep empathy. ``He's concerned as if his
grandson died,'' he said. ``He will call all of the religions,
whatever religions, to pray together, for Amadou.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diallos, who are from the West African nation of Guinea,
spent Tuesday as they have much of the last week, shuttling around
New York via limousine to meetings arranged by Sharpton. They spent
more than an hour with the Guinean delegation to the United Nations
in the morning, and were the featured guests Tuesday night in
Brooklyn at the weekly rally sponsored by the National Action
Network, Sharpton's group.
</P>
<P>
   The entourage _ which included Mrs. Diallo's second husband,
Sankarela Diallo, who is not related to her first husband, and
brother, Bobo Diallo _ arrived late to the meeting with O'Connor
because they stopped at their hotels to say the Muslim midday
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so privileged to take the meeting,'' the cardinal said,
holding Mrs. Diallo's hands as he greeted the entourage at the
Catholic Center on Manhattan's East Side. ``I'm so sorry for your
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   After the session, Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of New York, said that ``there is still a need
for healing'' and that the cardinal hoped that the interfaith
service he has planned for April 20 would ``be a beginning on the
road toward reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diallos returned to New York last week to watch as the four
officers who fired 41 shots at their son were arraigned in the
Bronx on charges of second-degree murder. Mrs. Diallo plans another
trip later this month to more than a dozen cities that will hold
rallies against police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadou is the celebrity, not me,'' Mrs. Diallo said as she
stared blankly out a limousine window. ``Whatever I've said, it's
coming from, I don't know where, it's him, it's my son.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diallos said they have no interest in sitting down with
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whose hospitality they rebuffed during
their first visit to the city. ``I don't see what can I meet him
for,'' Mrs. Diallo said simply.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's press office did not return several telephone calls
Tuesday night seeking to discuss whether Giuliani would like to
meet with the Diallos.

EDITORIAL: TRUTH IN BOTTLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 7:
</P>
<P>
   Some people drink bottled water because they think it tastes
better, others because they think it confers special status. But
most people drink it because they believe it is safer than tap
water. Is it? A new study by the Natural Resources Defense Council,
an environmental advocacy group, says that some bottled water
contains contaminants and chemicals and that ``blanket reassurances
from the industry that bottled water is totally safe and pure are
false.'' The group recommends tighter federal oversight as well as
a higher standard of truth in advertising. It makes a compelling
case.
</P>
<P>
   The study tested 103 popular brands of bottled water. In 23 of
the cases, at least one sample violated California's strict limits
for at least one contaminant, usually arsenic or one of several
man-made chemicals. The study said that the ``immediate'' health
risks were very small. It also noted that in 1996, 1 in 10
community tap-water systems violated federal standards. But the
point is that many brands that advertise themselves as pristine are
themselves violating California law.
</P>
<P>
   Industry spokesmen noted that all bottlers met existing federal
regulations and that there had been no confirmed report of illness
or disease linked to bottled water in 37 years of regulation by the
federal Food and Drug Administration. But sales of bottled water
have tripled in the last 10 years, to about $4 billion annually,
and new brands have proliferated. With greater growth comes greater
risk. Moreover, FDA rules do not cover bottled water that is sold
within a single state.
</P>
<P>
   The report asks the FDA to make its rules as strong as
California's, the nation's most stringent. At a minimum the Defense
Council wants bottled water standards to match the federal
standards for tap water set by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The report also asks the FDA to require manufacturers to label the
bottle's contents, including bacteria levels. The FDA's response is
that ``bottled water poses no significant health risk and is,
therefore, safe to consume.'' ``So far, so good'' is not an
acceptable response from a federal health agency. A more aggressive
approach is in order.

FOR A NIGHT ANYWAY, THE METS GET EXACTLY WHAT THEY PAID FOR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ So this was why the Mets opened their checkbooks during
the off season.
</P>
<P>
   One day after stranding 14 runners and going 0 for 9 with
runners in scoring position in an embarrassing opening day defeat,
the Mets' offense came alive Tuesday night, pummeling former World
Series hero Livan Hernandez for seven runs in four and two-thirds
innings en route to a 12-3 rout of the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty good in must-win games,'' Mets General Manager
Steve Phillips said, taking a jab at negative press coverage in New
York following the 6-2 loss in Monday's opener. Phillips even
suggested his own headline for Wednesday's papers: ``Money well
spent.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rick Reed threw no-hit ball for four-plus innings, the
Mets went seven for their first eight with runners in scoring
position. And each member of the starting lineup contributed
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit well as a team and that's the key,'' said Mike Piazza,
who drilled a hanging fast ball from Hernandez for his first home
run of the year. ``Last year, we kind of counted on one guy for one
or two weeks at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was usually that guy, something that was not lost on him
Tuesday. Every member of the starting lineup except for Reed had at
least one hit and scored at least one run. Rickey Henderson created
three runs in one sequence, doubling home a pair before stealing
third with two out in the second inning and then scoring on an
errant catcher's throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd probably be the king of stealing runs and creating runs if
they kept those stats,'' said Henderson, baseball's all-time stolen
base king. ``Making them throw the ball away, I'd probably be the
king of that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For one day, the Mets' world was righted against a low-budget
team they had struggled against last season. And by the smiles in
the bullpen and the jokes in the dugout, it was clear that this was
a laugher almost from the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the first inning, Edgardo Alfonzo doubled off
Hernandez and scored on a John Olerud single.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the second, Rey Ordonez delivered a run-scoring
single after Bobby Bonilla and Brian McRae walked. One out Rickey
Henderson doubled two more runs home, before stealing third and
scoring when Jorge Fabregas's throw sailed into left field.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the fifth, one out after Alfonzo doubled off
Hernandez, Piazza drummed the Marlins' right-hander out of the game
with a two-run home run into the second deck in left. By the time
Reed allowed his first hit, a double to Todd Dunwoody leading off
the bottom of the fifth, the Mets were up by 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins scratched out a run in their fifth when Fabregas was
ruled safe at first on a ball that Olerud had dived for, knocked
down, and recovered almost in time to prevent Dunwoody from scoring
from third base with two out.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura opened the sixth with a double off Kirt Ojala.
McRae tripled Ventura home and then scored on an Ordonez sacrifice
fly. And it was 9-1 Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Mets were feeling any pressure after the 6-2
opening day loss to the Marlins, but the last thing the players
wanted was to struggle as they head back to Shea Stadium next
Monday after three games with the Marlins and four more with the
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I guarantee you, we go in there and we don't have a
pretty good record, we'll hear it,'' Bonilla said before Tuesday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Mets heard cheers from the crowd of 18,075 at Pro
Player Stadium Tuesday night, a considerable number of those in
attendance rooting for the New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Reed cruised through the Marlin order his first time through.
The 33-year-old right-hander's control was precise. And Reed was
perfect through three, with four strikeouts after striking out the
side in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Last June he pitched six and two-thirds perfect innings against
Tampa Bay at Shea Stadium, then tossed six and a third perfect
innings against the Marlins at Shea before losing the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Reed was perfect through three and two-thirds
innings after Alfonzo made a diving stab to his left to rob Alex
Gonzalez of a hit. Reed walked the next batter, Mark Kotsay. But
Reed then struck out Derrek Lee to take the no-hitter into the
fifth. By the time he was removed for a pinch-hitter in the top of
the seventh, Reed had allowed just four hits and one run with two
walks and six strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks to a run-scoring seventh-inning single from Ventura
with the bases loaded followed by a McRae sacrifice fly, the Mets
were up, 11-1.

CHINESE PREMIER STARTS OFFICIAL VISIT IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In the midst of continuing tension with the
United States, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji brought gifts Tuesday --
opening his country's borders to the sale of California citrus and
wheat -- and even some humor over controversies between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
   At a Century City luncheon honoring him at the start of an
eight-day tour, Zhu -- making the first U.S. visit by a Chinese
premier in 15 years -- told the audience of more than 400 people he
hoped to begin to improve relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that, he said the Chinese government had reached
agreement with the wheat industry over a fungus known as TCK to
allow the wheat to be imported to China.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said China had agreed to allow the sale of California
citrus. Both are considered major steps in helping California
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached agreements . . . that I think should go a long
way in helping us work together on future relations,'' Zhu said
through a translator. ``I hope this will help in future dealings
between China and California and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the citrus industry said they were encouraged
by the announcement but wanted to see details.
</P>
<P>
   China, in the past, has refused to allow California citrus
because of fears of the spread of the Mediterranean fruit fly.
Efforts have been under way to make sure any fruit shipped to China
is clean of the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Quarles, a vice president at Sunkist International in
suburban Sherman Oaks, said officials are hopeful of getting a
final agreement, estimating it could be worth up to $100 million in
business in its first year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Fernandez, president of the California Wheat Commission,
said the announcement on wheat goes a long way to help the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 20 to 25 years, China has had a restriction on
wheat coming from the Pacific Northwest because of the fungus and
there have been discussions going on for many, many years,''
Fernandez said. ``This is a very, very big step for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said she could not put a value on the agreement until
more details are available.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said the announcement on citrus imports was particularly
dear to him because of pressure he has received over the years from
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year she comes to China and every year she asks about
citrus,'' Zhu said. ``Now I can have peace with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Feinstein said she was not available to comment, but
would be pleased with the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon, hosted by Mayor Richard Riordan, who also held a
late evening reception for Zhu, was the kickoff of the premier's
visit to the United States, ostensibly to deal with trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   But, he also is expected to run into controversy during a
scheduled meeting Thursday with President Clinton over whether
Chinese military intelligence officers steered money to the
president's re-election campaign as well as over nuclear espionage.
</P>
<P>
   On that last point, Zhu offered a joke. Saying that the mayor's
wife, Nancy Daly Riordan, had asked him about China's plans to
celebrate its 50th year as the People Republic, Zhu said he told
her there would be a display of military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking into English, he said there would be signs ``made in
China. We didn't do it with any American secrets. We built
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu arrived in Los Angeles early Tuesday and was greeted by
Riordan and Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Later, during a closed-door reception before the luncheon, Davis
asked him about the human rights situation in China and if that
government was taking any steps to improve matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him we only had 10 minutes and it would take hours to
discuss,'' Zhu said. ``We would have to discuss Rousseau and your
country's own Declaration of Independence.''

AMBROISE ROUX, 77, POMPIDOU ADVISER AND FRENCH MANAGEMENT
`GODFATHER' 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ambroise Roux, a prominent and influential figure in the French
industrial and financial worlds who was a key adviser to Georges
Pompidou, France's president from 1969 to 1974, died on Sunday in
his home in Montfort-l'Amaury in north central France. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, the newspaper Liberation reported.
</P>
<P>
   Roux's influence was legendary although it was often wielded
behind the scenes. After learning of his death, President Jacques
Chirac said that Roux had been ``one of the great figures of French
capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberation called him ``the `godfather' of management, the
eminence grise of capitalism in France.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Le Monde said he was ``the former eminence grise
of Georges Pompidou,'' and ``the person that Francois Mitterrand,''
another past president, ``spoke with, and listened to.''
</P>
<P>
   Until four months before Roux's death he was president of the
powerful French Association of Private Enterprises, which brings
together the top executives of the 60 largest private enterprises
in France. He was also on the boards of various business concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he was director general and then president and director
general of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, the French
telecommunications, transport and energy conglomerate, which became
Alcatel. He increased its work force to more than 175,000.
</P>
<P>
   Roux was a close confidant of Pompidou, who, as soon as he was
elected president, began addressing his country's economic
problems. The measures taken under him included devaluing the franc
and imposing a freeze on prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Le Monde said, in its Tuesday issue, Roux was
``also the strong man of management, without whom nothing got
done.''
</P>
<P>
   He sometimes sounded an idealistic note. In 1974, the French
government proposed an austerity program that brought expressions
of anxiety from both labor and management. Roux, then high up in
Compagnie Generale, declared: ``There is one point that I see as
positive. The government has chosen to treat the problem of prices
through an appeal to the social partners in asking each to make an
effort, in appealing to the civic sense of us all. ''
</P>
<P>
   His nature had some very human aspects. As he put it, he had a
``horror of hard intelligence that reduces everything to
equations.'' He spent three months each year in Brittany. His
personal interests included parapsychology and the occult. And
while he was a powerful figure at Compagnie General, he directed
laboratory staff to do research on the arcane subject of thought
transference.
</P>
<P>
   Roux was more conservative in his appearance. Liberation said
tartly, ``Everything about Ambroise Roux exuded the past: his
three-piece suit, the trousers rising up to his sternum, his finger
slipped into his watch-pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in the former department of Seine-et-Oise in north
central France, the son of Andre Roux and the former Cecile
Marcilhacy. His higher education included training in technical
subjects, among them civil engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He became an engineer specializing in bridges and roads and
worked his way up to become a high aide to Jean-Marie Louvel,
minister of industry and commerce. In 1955 he joined Compagnie
Generale .
</P>
<P>
   Roux married Francoise Marion in 1946 and they had two children,
a son, Christian; and a daughter, Veronique.

NETS TALK BIG AFTER FOURTH IN A ROW
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Nets are rolling like a boulder down a steep
hill now and their momentum is such that nobody, in their minds,
can stop them. With 4-0 written in big, blue letters on the
chalkboard of the visitors' locker room at the MCI Center on
Tuesday night, they talked about confidence, destiny, intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Has their winning streak gone to their head? Yes. But that might
not be a bad thing. It certainly wasn't Tuesday night, when they
defeated the Washington Wizards, 97-93, for their fourth straight
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' confidence, sky high for a club with a 9-24 record,
was one of the things that helped them overcome the athletic but
disheveled Wizards, who were playing their first game after firing
Bernie Bickerstaff as coach on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After being outplayed for the better part of three quarters, the
Nets were cool down the stretch, while Washington, under interim
coach Jim Brovelli, crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 87-87 and 4 minutes 18 seconds left, the
Nets held the Wizards scoreless for more than three minutes to grab
a 93-87 lead and the game. Stephon Marbury, who led all scorers
with 29 points, was again strong in the clutch, starting the
game-clinching 6-0 run with a 3 pointer. Mark Hendrickson added a
free throw and Kerry Kittles a 9-foot running jumper.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nets got plenty of help from the Wizards, who in
dropping to 13-20 were outscored in the fourth quarter for the 26th
time this season. Rod Strickland (14 points, 14 assists) made a
turnover during the key stretch and Mitch Richmond, a perennial
all-star, inexplicably lost the ball out of bounds while driving
for a wide-open layup.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Gill, who continued his steals' spree with 5 Tuesday
night, said those were signs the Nets' were beginning to intimidate
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can shut people down,'' said Gill, who has 31
steals in the last five games. ``We know people are afraid of us.
We're ball hawkers. We can see it on their faces. They're thinking
_ should I pass this or should I shoot?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but the Wizards blitzed the Nets' defense for 50
percent shooting and committed only 16 turnovers. Washington was
done in by its own lack of aggressiveness _ it was an incredibly
low 4 of 5 from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   But let the Nets' bask. It has been a rough season. Things are
going so well for the Nets that they won even without Keith Van
Horn playing most of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn (26 points, 13 rebounds) tweaked a tendon in his right
ankle with 7 minutes, 9 seconds left and the Nets ahead by 83-80.
Van Horn, who said the injury was not serious and that he would
play Wednesday against Philadelphia, returned to shoot free throws
in the clutch and made 2 of 2.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Feick assisted Van Horn on the backboards with another
strong 12-point, 10-rebound performance. Marbury outscored the
opposing point guard for the 14th time since joining the Nets 14
games ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The film ``Fort Apache, the Bronx'' begins with a
disclaimer: ``The picture you are about to see is a portrayal of
the lives of two policemen working out of a precinct in the South
Bronx, New York. Because the story involves police work, it does
not deal with the law-abiding members of the community nor does it
dramatize the efforts of the individuals and groups who are
struggling to turn the Bronx around.''
</P>
<P>
   From then on, it dramatizes a parade of prostitutes and pimps,
junkies and psychopaths, women on welfare and the men who rob them,
all doing their thing against a backdrop of rubble and decay.
Filmed in 1981, at the height of the South Bronx's ``troubles,''
the movie immortalized the borough as an unparalleled urban
wasteland, as a circle of hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fort Apache'' was not the first movie to transfigure the
Bronx's pain into high drama or low art, nor would it be the last.
Starting in the late 1960s, the Bronx was devastated by arson and
abandonment. Its population dwindled, its poverty deepened. By the
late 1970s, politicians were making pilgrimages to the devastated
area, offering condolences but little else. It was a canvas ripe
for painting with broad strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But today the South Bronx, which was the epicenter of the
decline, is on the upswing, though its rebound has received
considerably less attention than its slide. Many of the vacant lots
and the deserted buildings have been filled or replaced with some
30,000 new homes. Some of the upturn is in the area around what was
nicknamed Fort Apache, the police department's 41st Precinct
station house. This is a heartening contrast to the once desolate
landscape, where the station house took on the name Little House on
the Prairie because of its bleak isolation. There is still ample
poverty and crime, but more and more of the Bronx is surprisingly
normal these days.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is a good time to examine how the Bronx has been
construed in art and mass media over the past three decades, and
the Bronx Museum of the Arts, in a former synagogue on the Grand
Concourse, is doing just that. On Thursday, it unveils ``Urban
Mythologies: The Bronx Represented Since the 1960s,'' which uses a
dizzying array of images to explore how the Bronx has been
perceived.
</P>
<P>
   On view are more than 150 works by about 40 artists, reflecting
the 1960s to the present. The works include film, graffiti,
documentary photography, sculpture and painting.
</P>
<P>
   With its wealth of work by Bronx-based artists, the exhibition
also shows that where the outside world saw only wanton
destruction, there was also plenty of creation. ``Even at its
moments of misery and anguish _ and in some sense, I think, because
of its misery and anguish _ the Bronx became more culturally
creative than it had ever been in its life,'' Marshall Berman, a
political science professor at the City University of New York, who
grew up in the Bronx, writes in the exhibition catalog's
introduction. All sorts of new art forms _ graffiti, hip-hop, rap,
break dancing _ were either born or exploded in the Bronx in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition implicitly raises this question: As the Bronx
changes, how is its art changing as well? The answer, it seems, is
that it is less dramatic, less confrontational, perhaps more
complicated, and certainly more intimate.
</P>
<P>
   And as Berman noted, there is certainly less art about the
Bronx. ``It isn't in the news very much. It doesn't signify the way
it used to. You could say the Bronx has lost its aura,'' he writes.
``Should we be sad? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition that reflects the pain the Bronx endured, and the
distorted way it was often portrayed, would not have been possible
just five years ago, one of its curators, Betti-Sue Hertz, mused
recently; the terrain was just too painful, too personal. ``There
is a renaissance now,'' she said. ``We can look at the negative
imagery.''
</P>
<P>
   But things have changed, and the photographs of Camilo Jose
Vergara encapsulate just how much. Taken at the same spot every few
years, his photographs record, almost clinically, the abandonment,
decay and demolition of buildings, like those at the corner of Vyse
Avenue and 178th Street and along Charlotte Street. But the
sequences of photographs have new codas: freshly built two-story
homes or, on Charlotte Street, incongruous ranch houses.
</P>
<P>
   Like Vergara's photographs, much of the exhibition is
chronological. But the show's point is also to demonstrate that
things were never as linear, as black-and-white as they seemed,
that the ruins did not vanquish lives, love and laughter, but
co-existed with them.
</P>
<P>
   Berman quotes a passage from Grace Paley's story ``Somewhere
Else'': ``You know that nice park in the South Bronx? We have some
film if you ever want to see _ the block is burning down on one
side of the street, and the kids are trying to build something on
the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Which side you saw depended largely on what you were looking
for. Consider Mel Rosenthal, who, photographing ruins, was
confronted by a resident asking why he never took pictures of the
people. He began doing just that, and his pictures capture the joy
amid the rubble. Carlos Ortiz, a Bronx-born photographer who
watched his neighborhood along Longwood Avenue decline, also tried
to capture the decay and his neighbors' resiliency in the face of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Until the late 1960s, the Bronx was known, as the Works Project
Administration guide to New York City put it in the 1930s, for ``a
cocktail, a jeer or a zoo.'' It was not a name that carried meaning
the way Brooklyn did. But deterioration, particularly in the South
Bronx, brought an unshakable identity. It evoked analogies to
Dresden after the war and images like ``Fort Apache, the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   Such extremes drew outsiders, whether from Manhattan or Europe,
to work in the Bronx. Their work was often about the ordinary, not
the extreme. For example, the sculptor John Ahearn, who often
worked with a local sculptor, Rigoberto Torres, cast Bronx
residents to create spirited, expressive sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ahearn worked at Fashion Moda, a Bronx gallery founded in 1978
by an Austrian, Stefan Eins, who sought to give the spirit of
collaboration a physical space. Fashion Moda, on Third Avenue near
147th Street, attracted neighborhood residents, graffiti writers
from the Bronx and downtown artists, building a bridge between
Manhattan and the northern borough. The facade, as painted by a
graffiti artist named Crash, has been re-created at the Bronx
Museum, with artwork from some of its exhibits hung inside.
</P>
<P>
   Other artists tried to build similar bridges. For his series
``Bronx Floors,'' the conceptual artist Gordon Matta-Clark cut
pieces out of buildings hovering between abandonment and
demolition, photographing the cutouts, then making art with the
pieces and displaying it in a SoHo gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, residents living with the crime and decay were
sensitive to the artists, film crews, politicians and journalists
who traipsed through, mouths agape, staring at the burned buildings
but often overlooking the people who lived in them or once did.
</P>
<P>
   So Bronx residents created their own forms of expression, taking
the graffiti that was appearing throughout the city to a new
dimension, and creating hip-hop, rap and break dancing. The
exhibition features the work of graffiti artists like Daze and
Phase 2, who combined dystopic and utopic images, and those who
documented their work.
</P>
<P>
   Graffiti's heyday is over, but its legacy remains in the
cartoonish signage so popular in the Bronx, and in young graffiti
artists like Tats Cru, a South Bronx group that has managed to
combine the vernacular, in the form of memorial walls for local
residents (including one done for the exhibit), and the
entrepreneurial, securing corporate commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over whether graffiti is art or vandalism has abated
with both sides claiming victory. But graffiti is undeniably a form
of self-expression and self-definition, such as in the way graffiti
painters choose their own names and sign them everywhere. That same
desire for self-definition _ culturally as well as geographically _
drives much of the art in the exhibition, which contrasts it with
Hollywood film clips and other myth-making machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Rivera, for example, displays large-scale photographs of
young Latinos who look into the camera, dignity intact. And Pepon
Osorio has re-created a baroque installation from the 1993 Whitney
Biennial, ``The Scene of the Crime: (Whose Crime?),'' which shows a
fabricated crime scene in a Latino home, mixing elements from
reality and Hollywood fiction. The work, Osorio said, was motivated
by the gap between the crude crime scenes he saw on film and
television, where even the victims seemed washed in sin, and those
he visited in real life, where signs of normal family life could
often be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to define one's space as well as one's image motivated
Bronx community groups and activists to become involved in
architecture and urban planning in the 1980s, and the exhibition
includes several of their efforts. The members of Nos Quedamos
(``We Stay'') challenged the city's urban renewal plan for their
Melrose neighborhood, for example, and now are implementing their
own design.
</P>
<P>
   The plans are on display; so is the model for the vision of the
South Bronx Academy of Art, designed by the Italian architect Aldo
Rossi at the behest of the teacher Tim Rollins, who formed the
remarkably successful artists' collective Kids of Survival with a
group of Bronx students.
</P>
<P>
   None of these groups made it into movies like ``Fort Apache, the
Bronx'' as its disclaimer so forthrightly notes. But as this
exhibition so powerfully demonstrates, that does not mean they were
not there.

INJURY TO ARNOTT FORCES DEVILS TO JUGGLE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ A recurring hip injury to Jason Arnott forced
the Devils to break up their most productive line Tuesday night
against the Carolina Hurricanes and the loss of Arnott showed in
the scoring sheet. The Devils suffered a 4-2 loss, ending their
eight-game undefeated streak, and will now have to wait another
game or two before they clinch their third straight Atlantic
Division title.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott has been the center for Petr Sykora and Patrik Elias and
that line had produced 32 points in the previous 10 games for the
Devils, whose record slipped to 42-23-11 with six games to play.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora and Elias came up empty Tuesday night and so did Brendan
Morrison, who took Arnott's place as the center for the two wings
from the Czech Republic. Scott Niedermayer and Sergei Nemchinov
scored the goals for the Devils after Carolina had scored all its
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well with Mo,'' Elias said, referring to Morrison.
``We got better as the game went, but couldn't score and didn't get
any breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We play the same way with Arnie as we play with Mo,'' Sykora
said. ``We had chances, but their goalie was good. They also got a
couple of goals early and we started scoring a little too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Roberts, Keith Primeau, Jeff O'Neill and Ray Sheppard had
the goals for the Hurricanes against Martin Brodeur, who allowed
four goals on only 15 shots, hardly a typical showing for the New
Jersey goaltender. Brodeur's counterpart, Arturs Irbe, made 31
saves.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday night, the Hurricanes had scored more than two
goals only twice in their previous eight games, but they had no
problem scoring early and taking a 3-0 lead after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   On the first goal, Sean Hill dumped the puck from near the
Devils' blue line in an apparent attempt to give the Hurricanes a
chance to change lines. Brodeur went behind his goal to collect the
puck, but it bounced in front directly to Roberts, who put it into
the net while Brodeur was still behind his goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it bounces off the glass, you expect it to come in front
like that, but not off the boards,'' Brodeur said of the goal that
put the Hurricanes on the path to their first victory in four
games. The victory also helped Carolina avoid a series sweep by the
Devils, who won the first four meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have six games left to become the first team since
the Philadelphia Flyers in 1987 to capture a division title for
three consecutive seasons. The Flyers could end up playing the
Devils in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But New Jersey must win all three games left on the road to
break the league record of 27 road victories set by the Montreal
Canadiens in 1977-78. The Devils' road record is 25-10-3 and their
three road games remaining are at Montreal, Buffalo and Nashville.

MICHAEL MANUEL, 70, EXECUTIVE AT METROPOLITAN OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Manuel, a director and writer who worked for a decade at
the Metropolitan Opera in New York, first as the company's
executive stage manager and then as the co-general director of the
Met's national touring company, died on Monday at the Hunterdon
Medical Center in Flemington, N.J. He was 70 and lived in New Hope,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, his brother Julian said.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel was born in London in 1928 and attended the Royal Academy
of Music for a year before joining the Royal Army Service Corps. In
1948, he joined the Royal Opera company, Covent Garden, as an
assistant stage manager. In 1950, he became the stage manager of
the Sadler's Wells Ballet and the next year joined the Royal Ballet
in the same position. During an American tour with the Royal Ballet
he was lured to the Met by Sir Rudolf Bing, its general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel was the Met's executive stage manager from 1957 to 1964
and also directed productions of Gluck's ``Orfeo and Eurydice'' and
''Alcestis'' _ the latter with Eileen Farrell in her company debut
_ and Strauss' ``Elektra.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bing decided to start the Metropolitan Opera National
Company, in 1964, with co-sponsorship from the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, he appointed Manuel
and the mezzo-soprano Rise Stevens as its co-general managers. The
company's first tour, in 1965, offered productions of Bizet's
``Carmen,'' Rossini's ``Cenerentola,'' Puccini's ``Madama
Butterfly'' and Carlisle Floyd's ``Susannah.'' It played 240
performances in 72 cities.
</P>
<P>
   The company lasted only two seasons. By the end of the second
tour, it had run up a deficit of about $1.9 million. Bing, who was
facing a deficit at the Met itself in late 1966, decided to cancel
the third tour and scrap the national company.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel left the Met after the touring company was folded and
became a researcher and scriptwriter for the ``New Media Bible''
and other educational television and video productions. Among his
projects for the New Media Bible were the films ``Genesis'' and
``Gospel of Luke.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his brother Julian, of London, Manuel is survived by a
son, Marc, of New Hope, and another brother, Lionel, of Madrid,
Spain.

GIULIO EINAUDI, ITALIAN AUTHOR AND PUBLISHER, IS DEAD AT 87
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Giulio Einaudi, a doctor, author and founder of the Italian
publishing house he built into a European wellspring of fine
literature, intellectual thought and political theory, died on
Monday at his country house near Rome. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   A scholarly man, Einaudi was one of his country's leading
publishers on the political left and a leading cultural figure.
During his long career he befriended literary and cultural figures
throughout Europe. His stable of authors included Carlo Levi,
Antonio Gramsci, Cesare Pavese, Natalia Ginzburg, Italo Calvino,
Norberto Bobbio and Primo Levi.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Turin, the son of Luigi Einaudi, an economist and
foe of Fascism who served as president of the Italian Republic from
1947 to 1955. The younger Einaudi took a degree in medicine and
surgery but never practiced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933 he founded Giulio Einaudi Editore in Turin, where it
still has its headquarters. His first book was a translation of a
work about New Deal economics in the United States by Henry A.
Wallace. Mussolini, in an article, praised the book but condemned
the foreword added by Luigi Einaudi.
</P>
<P>
   Giulio Einaudi went to jail for 45 days in 1935, an indication
that his fledgling publishing house was in trouble for the duration
of the Fascist dictatorship. But the company flourished with the
dawning of democracy. It poured out fiction and nonfiction, art
books, the classics and translations of American literature. It
also was the first to publish Boris Pasternak's novel ``Dr.
Zhivago'' in 1957 when it was banned in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Einaudi, who had spoken against the creation of NATO, scored a
coup in 1964 with a long interview with the Soviet Premier, Nikita
S. Khrushchev. It was reported worldwide but did not endear the
publisher to the political right at home or to official Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev gave Einaudi permission to publish a collection of
his speeches on international affairs and added a foreword in which
he called for realism in East-West relations. His call for peaceful
coexistence and avoidance of a nuclear catastrophe was one of the
early, post-Stalinist glimmers of East-West detente in the midst of
a Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Einaudi wrote books on literature, history, philosophy, art and
science. Among his pastimes were mountaineering and collecting rare
books and prints.
</P>
<P>
   Despite big sales, he voiced concerns as long as 30 years ago
about the problems of balancing quantity and quality and the fate
of commercial publishing. He admired American university presses as
``a great force,'' saying that the good printing and editing of
commercial houses partly derived from what the university presses
were doing.
</P>
<P>
   Like other family publishing houses caught in merger maneuvers,
Einaudi eventually was unable to continue alone. In 1994, despite
an outcry from Italian writers and intellectuals, its control
passed to Mondadori, part of the media empire of Silvio Berlusconi,
the right-of-center politician and former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Einaudi remained chairman of the house he had built. In an
interview with La Repubblica, the Italian daily, he voiced hope
that editorial independence would be maintained. Although a number
of Einaudi authors deserted, in recent years there were signs of a
revival with a choice list of new authors from the United States,
Britain, France, Germany and even Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Einaudi's survivors include his wife, Renata Aldrovandi; three
sons, Mario, Riccardo and Ludovico; and a daughter, Giuliana.

VAUGHN SHOWS WHO'S BOSS
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- On a grease board in the Angels clubhouse Tuesday
afternoon, the message was short and sweet: ``Players meeting.
5:50. 42. Today!
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Mo Vaughn wasted no time making his presence felt,
calling the players-only meeting. It's something he started with
the Red Sox and now does it before the first game every season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Boston we had a lot of different leaders, Mike
Greenwell, Roger Clemens,'' Vaughn said. ``All of a sudden I looked
up and everybody was gone. I had to address the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's message to his teammates Tuesday was simple -- it's
time to put up or shut up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play with no excuses,'' he said. ``We have injuries, but
there's still a job that's got to be done. That's the message I'm
trying to get across. From here on out, we've got to have that
attitude, that drive. As players, we've got to make sure we're on
the same page.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we got Mo for was leadership,'' manager
Terry Collins said. ``One thing I want to come out of (the meeting)
is to make sure we're ready to play every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had t-shirts made that many of the players wore under
their jerseys. It said: ``Together we can fly. The journey begins
-- 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Jim Edmonds seemed a little depressed Tuesday,
and with good reason. His injuries -- strained right groin, cyst in
right shoulder area -- is keeping him out of the first week of
games.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds' shoulder was sore Tuesday after having a needle stuck
into the shoulder joint Monday to inject dye and get a better look
at the cyst. He says he can't swing a bat now, and is simply
waiting for Dr. Lewis Yocum's decision of whether to drain the cyst
or let it heal on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what to do with it,'' Edmonds said. ``He's
going to talk with some other doctors about it. Until they find out
what's going on, I just have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   He's no Gary DiSarcina, but Andy Sheets knows it. Sheets,
acquired by the Angels last week in a trade with the Padres, is
DiSarcina's replacement at shortstop until DiSarcina returns from a
broken bone in his left forearm sometime around the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be him,'' said Sheets, 27, a career utility player.
``He's a big leaguer on and off the field. I can't step in and do
what he does. I'll do my part on the field. With this lineup, I
don't need to worry about offense. The first thing I have to
provide is defense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an athlete,'' Collins said. ``I think the fact he's going
to be out there on a daily basis, he's going to react to that. He's
a solid ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's game, the Angels paid tribute to former owner
Gene Autry, who passed away Oct. 2. A riderless horse was paraded
onto the field and a video tribute was played on the stadium
Jumbotron.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Angel Mark Langston has signed with the Indians and is
planning to become a starter again. He said reports that he
``retired were untrue. The Padres simply let him go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ridiculous,'' Langston said. ``It's like reading your
obituary before you die.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Rich DeLucia, released by the Angels last week, also
signed with the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Indians continue their series tonight at 7:05 at
Edison Field. Ken Hill (9-6, 4.98 ERA in 1998) starts for Anaheim
against Cleveland's Dave Burba (15-10, 4.11 in '98).

MARY AINSWORTH, 85, THEORIST ON MOTHER-INFANT ATTACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Mary D. Ainsworth, a developmental psychologist whose work
revolutionized the understanding of the bond between mothers and
infants, died in Charlottesville, Va., on March 21. She was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ainsworth's research contributed significantly to attachment
theory, which emphasizes the importance of intimate human
relationships, or attachments, in shaping children's development.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ainsworth, who lived in Charlottesville, worked closely with
Dr. John Bowlby, the British child psychiatrist whose work on
separation, attachment and loss provided the foundation for
attachment theory. She carried on his legacy in the United States,
conducting systematic studies of attachments between mothers and
infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had ever looked at that'' before Dr. Ainsworth's work,
said Jude A. Cassidy, an associate professor of psychology at the
University of Maryland at College Park. ``There had been little
empirical observation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ainsworth also developed methods for assessing the quality
of the mother-infant bond. Attachment theory holds that infants
need a ``secure'' attachment to thrive, and that ``anxious''
attachments can lead to problems later in life. ``She looked at a
way of measuring which babies were securely attached and which were
not,'' Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of Dr. Ainsworth's research was for an academic
audience, it also had a practical side. She argued, on the basis of
her research, that picking up a crying baby does not spoil the
child; rather, it reduces crying in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge controversy over that,'' Cassidy said. ``It
had been thought that picking up a baby spoiled it and led to more
crying. Instead, it teaches the baby that the world is a responsive
place and leads to less crying long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists continue to debate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ainsworth's research also found that feeding an infant on
demand rather than on a strict schedule led to a more secure
attachment between infant and mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings had a big impact on how pediatricians advised
mothers in the second half of the 20th century,'' said Robert S.
Marvin, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville.
</P>
<P>
   Mary D. Salter was born in Glendale, Ohio, on Dec. 1, 1913, and
spent most of her childhood in Toronto. She received her bachelor's
degree in 1935, her master's degree in 1936 and her Ph.D. in 1939,
all from the University of Toronto. She then was a lecturer in the
university's psychology department until 1942, when she was
commissioned in the Canadian Women's Army Corps, attaining the rank
of major. She returned to the university as an assistant professor
in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950 she married Leonard Ainsworth, a graduate student in
psychology. Shortly after their marriage she moved to London, where
she began a lifelong partnership with Bowlby, who was investigating
the impact on institutionalized children of prolonged separation
from their mothers in early childhood. Dr. Ainsworth later moved to
Kampala, Uganda, where she conducted one of the first studies of
mother-infant interaction in the first year of life.
</P>
