<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon and Germany have signed a protocol providing
Lebanon with soft loans and grants totaling 6.75 million
U.S. dollars, the An Nahar daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed by Helmut Farber of the German
Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Mahoud Othman, chairman of
the Council for Development and Reconstruction which oversees a
multi-billion-dollar reconstruction project in Beirut's
war-devastated center.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cypriot government is weighing on rising petrol
prices to keep afloat the island's four oil companies, said
Commerce and Industry Minister Nicos Rolandis.
</P>
<P>
"Because crude oil prices are now in the region 25 or 26
U.S. dollars per barrel, the (island's four) oil companies are
registering a loss," the Cyprus Mail newspaper on Saturday quoted
Rolandis as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It's an urgent issue, and we realize that the oil companies
are suffering because of this," Rolandis said.
</P>
<P>
Under contracts signed with Exxon-Esso, Mobil, BP and
Petrolina, the four major oil companies are guaranteed a 12
percent return on their equity in 1999, which is 2.8 million
Cyprus pounds (5.6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But with crude prices soaring, "they're going to lose 1.2
million pounds (2.4 million dollars). So the red-ink differential
is 4 million pounds (8 million dollars) for the four companies
this year," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is difficult" and "remedial action will have to
be taken."
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Solidere, Lebanon's biggest company, has suffered a
loss of 435,986 dollars in the first half of 1999 compared with a
modest profit of 2 million dollars for the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star newspaper Saturday quoted the company's
half-year financial report as saying that revenues fell to 7.69
million dollars from 11.28 million dollars in 1998 and the cash
liquidity dropped to 118 million dollars from 188 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company, set up in 1994, is responsible for rebuilding the
Beirut Central District which was devastated during the country's
1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
The report said property sales, the firm's main source of
incomes, dropped to 1.6 million dollars in the first six months of
this year compared with 3.2 million dollars in the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Incomes from rentals dropped to 2.3 million dollars compared to
2.9 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Solidere reported a full-year profit of 54 million
dollars, 52 million dollars made in the second half.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cypriot government will be seeking private tender
to run the Paphos Airport in southwestern Cyprus, the Cyprus Mail
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The state had neither the ability nor the resources to run the
airport, said Communications and Works Minister Averof Neophytou.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government announced earlier this year that it
would allocate 600,000 Cyprus pounds (1,200,000 dollars) for
further airport and runway improvements, as well as for building a
new air traffic control tower.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Russia Not to Rise in Near Future: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The foreign investment in
Russia will not grow in the foreseeable future because the West
still considers Russia a poor investment opportunity, said Russian
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"An increase in foreign investment cannot be expected in the
next few years," Putin said to the Big Urals interregional
association in Orenburg. "Western investors will wait till at
least next June" when the presidential elections take place, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"A number of problems, like low investment activity, persistent
non-payments, the continuing contraction in agriculture and slow
restructuring of the country's banking system, still remain
unsolved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Defense spending surged in the third quarter, as did
expenditures on law-enforcement agencies and dealing with the
aftermath of emergency situations. These trends continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The burden of external debt will continue to harm the economy
over the next few years. Russia will have to make between 12 and
13 billion U.S. dollars in debt repayments to foreign lenders
through 2008.
</P>
<P>
Oil production is expected to drop by 30 to 50 million tons in
the next decade, which will also complicate the economic situation,
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia must move away from its orientation to raw materials"
in the future, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> GCC Summit Opens, United Tariffs Accord Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The 20th summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) opens here Saturday amid speculation
that an agreement on united tariffs would be signed to pave the
way for a Gulf customs union.
</P>
<P>
Saudi King Fahd chaired the opening session of the three-day
summit, the last one in the century.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates are to discuss the common challenges this
regional political and economic group faces on the eve of a new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between GCC and Iran, and inter-GCC economic
issues are expected to dominate the summit, which is routinely
held every year.
</P>
<P>
There has been rapid improvement of ties between Iran and some
GCC members including Saudi Arabia, which irritated the UAE, which
has been locked in a dispute over three islands in the mouth of
the strategically important Strait of Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
As to the GCC drive to create a regional economic zone,
however, their finance ministers failed to reach a consensus on
the establishment of a customs union earlier this month as an
initial step toward this goal.
</P>
<P>
But GCC Secretary General Jameel al-Hujailan said he hoped the
issue will finally be resolved in the Riyadh summit.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers had agreed upon items to be included in
the united tariffs but difference still remained over the ceiling
of the tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, which has the lowest tariffs among the six GCC
members, was concerned that a unified tariff package that is
higher than its current customs level would impair its bid to
attract foreign investments. It had asked for various forms of
compensation if it had to raise its customs to a higher GCC
unified tariff.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here expected that a customs agreement could be a
most likely concrete achievement in this routine meeting.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said the other five members had compromised
to the demand of the UAE and agreed, before the summit, to a
unified tariff package of around 7-8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The GCC countries have been trying since 1983 to unify their
customs duties, which now vary between 4 and 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
They have set March 1, 2001 as a target date for a customs
union, aimed eventually at establishing a Gulf common market with
an annual imports of more than 50 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
If the Riyadh summit fails to bring about a framework for
unified tariffs, the Gulf leader have two more chances before the
targeted date. They are expected to meet in mid-2000 in a
scheduled extra summit and then in late next year, November or
December, for their 21st annual summit.

<HEADLINE> IGC Forecasts World Wheat Production In 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) - With Northern Hemisphere
harvests now completed, world wheat production in 1999 is
estimated at 582 million tons, the International Grains Council (
IGC) forecast.
</P>
<P>
In its November issue Grain Market Report, the IGC said this
total outturn would still be 3 million tons below that of 1998,
with smaller crops in the EC, the U.S., Near East Asia and North
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The forecast for world wheat trade is unchanged at 99 million
tons. Imports by Iran are put 0.5 million higher at 6.5 million
tons, but estimates for China and North Africa have been reduced,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
World wheat consumption is forecast 4 million higher at 589
million tons, but still 4 million below the revised figure for
last year.
</P>
<P>
These new figures also are the main reason for a reduction of 4
million to 116 million tons for world wheat stocks, according to
the report.

<P>
TEHRAN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces have
seized over 1,460 kilograms of drugs in the northeastern Khorasan
province in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The drugs, confiscated in the Qaenat and Khashmar regions in
three separate anti-drug operations, included 1,230 kilograms of
opium and 230 kilograms of heroin, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the operations, five traffickers were arrested and some
ammunitions seized, the forces said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 73 drug smugglers from five drug-trafficking
gangs have been captured in the eastern border areas of the
country, said commander of the provincial security forces
Brigadier General Mohammad Kazem Taqavi.
</P>
<P>
He said that 13 Afghans were among the arrested who had been
involved in several armed clashes with the special anti-drug
squad of the security forces.
</P>
<P>
The gangs had brought eight tons of narcotics to Iran and
smuggled two consignments of them to Turkey and Europe, said the
officer.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hails Tunisian President's Upcoming Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine
Al-Abidine Ben Ali's coming visit to Egypt will offer an
opportunity for the two countries to discuss regional issues and
bilateral ties, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before flying to Yemen, Moussa said the
visit will be "a good opportunity" for presidents Hosni Mubarak
and Ben Ali to discuss the situation in the Arab world and the
latest developments in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the Tunisian president will also give a further
momentum to the relations between the two countries, which are
exerting joint efforts to intensify cooperation in both the
economic and political fields, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali is expected to pay a two-day visit to Egypt on Monday
and Tuesday, Egypt's Al-Gomhuria newspaper reported on
Saturday. He will hold talks with Mubarak and other senior Egyptian
officials on seeking ways of further promoting bilateral economic
and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali's visit mirrors the keenness of the two countries'
leaders on boosting bilateral relations in all fields, the
pro-government paper quoted Tunisian Ambassador in Cairo Youssef
Al Moqadim as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Tunisian trade relations witnessed a progress over
the past few years, with the trade volume rising to 75.4 million
U.S. dollars from 3.29 million dollars in 1992. The two sides have
been making efforts to increase the trade volume to 200 million
dollars in the coming years, with the advent of the free trade
zone last year.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian ambassador said a symposium will be held in
January to discuss the role to be played by Egypt's private sector
in enhancing trade in the light of a free trade zone between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will also deal with the prospects for the
establishment of a partnership between the two North African Arab
nations, he added.

<HEADLINE> Russian Units Capture Key Hills North of Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Russian troops captured
dominant hills north of Grozny, capital of the rebelling Chechen
republic and narrowed the encirclement of the city Friday.
</P>
<P>
Militant positions in Grozny "came into a field of vision" from
these hills, specially, from the dominant heights in the Tersky
and Sunzhensky mountain ranges, which allows the federal forces to
efficiently bomb militant positions, the Interfax news agency
quoted the Russian federal headquarters in the North Caucasus as
saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Strikes are being delivered to fortified positions in Grozny's
southern outskirts. Both long-range artillery and Grad missile
systems are used in the assault, said the military.
</P>
<P>
Federal soldiers continue to close their encirclement of Grozny.
"The blockade ring will be narrowed" with the "security corridors"
still available to civilians living in the city, the headquarters
said.
</P>
<P>
Some militants are retreating from the city to previously
readied positions and bases in the mountains, while some 300
terrorists of the Afghan, Albanian and Slav nationalities arrived
in the village of Grushevo. They are armed with assault rifles,
anti-tank rockets and Stinger anti-missile weapons, said the
Russian military.
</P>
<P>
Decisive federal action, insufficient arms and food supplies
provoke conflicts among Chechen commanders, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen stretch of Russia's border with Georgia will be
wholly closed within one or two months to stop the arms and food
supply to Chechen extremists, said Nikolai Khoshman, the Russian
government's representative to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a refugee flow from Grozny toward the Ingush border
has surged due to the massive attack.
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,949 people fled Chechnya to the neighboring
republic of Ingushetia in the past day, raising a total number to
221,822.
</P>
<P>
Over 239,000 migrants now remain in the internal republic,
including those who fled during the previous Chechen war and the
Ossetian-Ingush conflict, said Ingush Interior Minister Khamzat
Gutseriyev Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the recent migrants come from Grozny, which federal
forces have bombed intensively since Friday, he said.

</P>
<P>
A wide range of strategic issues, such as disarmament and arms
control were addressed during the consultations, said the Russian
Foreign Ministry in a statement Saturday.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged their views on current issues of

<HEADLINE> Over 20 African Countries Ratify Ottawa Landmine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 African countries
have ratified the Ottawa Landmine Treaty which seeks to ban the
manufacturing and use of land mines across the world, the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said.
</P>
<P>
Widespread campaigns against the use of land mines on the
continent had sensitized many governments to ratify the treaty,
Jean-Paul Fallet, ICRC regional representative to southern Africa,
told the Zimbabwe News Agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, there were less than 14 African countries that had
ratified the Ottawa Treaty and this year the number has grown to
more than 20, Fallet noted.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) has played a pivotal
role in raising the problem through its various continental
meetings, the ICRC official said.
</P>
<P>
Land mines continue to maim and kill thousands of people in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Zimbabwe has more than three million land
mines that were laid by Rhodesian forces during the liberation
war.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC is holding a two-day regional meeting of information
officers from 14 countries in the sub-region in Kadoma, central
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Youths Urged to Engage in Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean youths should play a
role in the transformation of the country's economy, Minister of
National Affairs, Employment Creation and Cooperatives Thenjiwe
Lesabe said here Saturday
</P>
<P>
"There is need to re-integrate them into society so that they
assume their role in the socio-economic transformation and
development of our economy," the minister told a three-day
national youth workshop on building the nation through sustainable
youth development.
</P>
<P>
"In many ways the future of Zimbabwe rests with the young men
and women and their vision, commitment, enthusiasm and ability to
manage and grasp opportunities to fulfil their potential," she
said.
</P>
<P>
However, she said the major drawback is lack of effective
mechanisms to create such opportunities as most youths could not
satisfy the demands of banking and financial institutions when
they seek loans to start their projects.
</P>
<P>
"The youths are marginalized as a high risk group, yet
investment in young people is necessary to enable them to fulfill
their potential," she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said youths in Zimbabwe are marginalized because
they are viewed by many with suspicion and mistrust because of the
influence of foreign cultures.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Accept Phase Seven of Oil Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Rashid
said Saturday that it would accept a six-month extension of the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Iraq would resume its oil exports if the United Nations renewed
the oil-for-food program, Rashid told reporters after the opening
ceremony of the Oil Equipment Fair, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The oil deal, whose sixth phase expired on November 20, allows
Iraq to sell limited amount of oil every six months to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people
who have been under the crippling U.N. sanctions since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1275 on November
19, deciding to extend the sixth phase for two weeks until
December 4, but Baghdad rejected the resolution and called it
"meaningless."
</P>
<P>
Last week, Iraq stopped its oil exports through the Turkish
port of Ceyhan and its southern terminals after it had finished
all the contracts signed with foreign companies under the sixth
phase.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, Iraqi Finance Minister Hikmet Mizban Ibrahim
renewed Iraq's firm stand not to deal with any U.N. resolution
that falls short of lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq still considers the oil-for-food program as a provisional
measure and lifting the unjust embargo is a legitimate demand
after Iraq has fulfilled all its commitments to relevant
U.N. resolutions adopted after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Baghdad fair has attracted 86 companies from 21 Arab and
foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng, Arafat Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH (West Bank), November 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese
top legislator Li Peng and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Saturday exchanged views on a wide range of issues of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he was very glad to receive Li in the Palestinian
territory and Li's visit to Palestine is of historical
significance.
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed Li on the developments of the Middle East peace
process, saying that some progress has been made in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, but they are facing some
problems now.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress, said China pays great attention to the new
developments of the peace process, and the launching of the
final-status talks between the Palestinians and Israelis merits
welcome.
</P>
<P>
China believes that the Palestinian issue is the core of the
Middle East peace process, and the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks should be conducted on the basis of the principle of "land
for peace" and the relevant U.N. resolutions, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to help move the process forward, Li added.
</P>
<P>
On mutual economic cooperation, Li said it will be further
expanded in the future with the development of China's economy and
the expansion of the Palestinian self-rule territories.
</P>
<P>
China attachs great importance to economic cooperation between
the two sides, and will encourage Chinese enterprises to explore
the Palestinian market while inviting the Palestinian businessmen
to seek cooperative partners in China, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to provide Palestine with technology and
experience to help it build its own economy, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed his thanks, saying the Palestinian side will
try its best to enhance cooperation with China in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after their meeting, Arafat said the
Palestinian side has differences with the Israeli side on Israel's
next troop redeployment in the West Bank, but the two sides are
trying to solve this problem through consultations.
</P>
<P>
But, he added, the Israeli side should implement the agreements
signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The troops redeployment scheduled for November 15 was delayed
due to dispute over which land should be handed over to
Palestinian self-rule.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here Saturday morning for a short visit, left
Ramallah for Israel after attending a special session held in his
honor by the Palestinian Legislative Council.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Macao's Return A Glorious Success of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Abdul Sattar said Saturday that Macao's return to China will be "a
testimony of glorious success of China's sagacious policy of
peace, patience and legality."
</P>
<P>
Macao's return to the motherland on December 20 this year will
be a moment of happiness and pride of the Chinese people, and as a
long-time friend of China, Pakistan will send a high-level
delegation led by a member of the National Security Council to
take part in the celebrations, said Sattar.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Sattar said: "the record
of China's successes over the decades strengthens our confidence
in the capacity of China to ensure political stability and
economic prosperity in Macao."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister spoke highly of the policy of "One Country
and Two Systems" initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"The policy formulated by China's great leader Deng Xiaoping is
a tribute to the imagination and innovation of his intellect and
to the pragmatism and flexibility of his thought," said Sattar.
</P>
<P>
This unique policy has been successful in Hong Kong which
returned to the motherland on July 1, 1997, Sattar noted. Since
then, Hong Kong has maintained stability and prosperity, and its
relations with the mainland stand as a model, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sattar expressed his confidence that the "One Country and Two
Systems" policy will also be successfully implemented in Macao.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Pakistan's One-China policy, saying that Taiwan
is an inalienable part of China. "Any one who tries to change that
accepted position is a crying in the wildness," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan fully recognizes and supports the unity and integrity
of China. We appreciate and admire China's policy of peace,
patience and legality," the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the remarks made by Taiwan's leader Lee Teng-hui
that the relations between Taiwan and the mainland should be
defined as "special state-to-state relations", Sattar said these
remarks are aimed at splitting the Chinese nation. "They are
inconsistent with the recognized position that Taiwan is a part of
China's territory."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Sino-Pakistani relations, the minister said
that resting on the rocksolid foundation of the enduring interests
of the Pakistani and Chinese peoples, "Pakistan-China friendship
has never been disturbed by the changes of governments."
</P>
<P>
"The government of Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf
will maintain and further invigorate efforts for developing our
bilateral relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Paying tribute to China's tremendous successes over the last 50
years, especially during the last two decades, Sattar said China
has become "a strong factor for the maintenance of international
peace and security."
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to note China has developed great economic
strength and its voice is heard with respect by all states around
the world," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan hopes that China will play a more important role in
the United Nations and other international fora, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan remains committed to further developing the good
neighborly and cooperative relations with China, Sattar said,
adding that as foreign minister, he will make unremitting efforts
for this end.

ISLAMABAD -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Adbul Sattar Saturday
said his country has been acting in conformity with the U.N.
Security Council resolution on sanctions against Afghanistan's
ruling Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview by Xinhua, the foreign minister said
that the Taliban have no capital in Pakistan, nor there is an
airline service between the two countries at present.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there are one or two franchises of certain Afghan
banks, but they have only very limited activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In essence, we are abiding by the Security Council resolution,
" Abdul Sattar observed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions have been imposed on Afghanistan since
November 14 according to a Security Council resolution, which
obliged all U.N. members to freeze Taliban capitals and ban Afghan
planes' access, in a bid to press the militia to hand over the
alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden for trial. (Pakistan-Taliban-

WELLINGTON -- The Labor Party, the major opposition party in
New Zealand, and its ally Alliance are able to form a center-left
coalition government, according to the results of Saturday's
general election.
</P>
<P>
In the election, the Labor Party led by Helen Clark got a 38.9
percent share of the nationwide party vote, well ahead of its
rival the National Party headed by the incumbent Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley, which had only 30.7 percent of the party vote.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance with Jim Anderton as its leader gained a 7.9
percent share of the nationwide party vote.
</P>
<P>
Since the last general election, New Zealand has adopted the
Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) electoral system, under which each
party's share of the total number of MPs is decided by its share
of the nationwide party vote. Even if a party doesn't win any
electorate seats, it will gain seats in Parliament if it wins at
least five percent of the nationwide party vote.
</P>
<P>
The votes the Labor Party and the Alliance won plus the votes
they got from the minor parties with less than five percent of the
nationwide party vote are enough for them to hold 63 seats in the
120-seat parliament. They are able to form a coalition government
even without support from other political parties. (New Zealand-

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's leftist Broad
Front coalition candidate Tabare Vazquez and ruling Colorado Party
Jorge Batlle will dispute Sunday in a run-off president election.
</P>
<P>
Calm returned to the country in a ban to proselytist propaganda
that started at midnight Thursday for the 2.4 million electors to
reflect on their preferences.
</P>
<P>
Vazquez, of the Progressive Encounter, and Batlle, of the
Colorado Party, carried untiredly their campaigns to cities and
small towns in the interior of the country to woo the last
undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
The electoral was carried out without public debates or street
rallies, but mainly in the mass communication media.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the campaigns is focused on economic issues. The
income tax proposed by the left evoked strong criticism from the
official party.
</P>
<P>
The left counterattacked Batlle's plan, saying that it would
bring a budget adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The Colorado Party has the backing of its old rival, the
National or Blanco Party, which won 21 percent of the vote in the
October 31 elections.
</P>
<P>
Progressive Encounter has the backing of the New Space party,
with 4.4 percent of suffrages although its leader Rafael Michelin
said that the party members are free to choose.
</P>
<P>
However, none of the two candidates has an obvious advantage
over the other for Sunday's voting.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the soundings of opinion agree that Vazquez and
Batlle are tied in the voting intentions.
</P>
<P>
The 160,000 undecided, 7 percent of the voters roster, will be
those who will decide the triumph for any of the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
Vazquez, 59, an oncologist and former Montevideo mayor, arrives
for the first time to a second presidential election round in
Uruguay.

<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic news
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's external debts reached 5.1 billion Dinar (7.2
billion U.S dollars) by October 31, with the total foreign debts
expected to amount to 95.5 percent of the gross domestic product
this year, Jordanian Finance Minister Michael Marnu has said.
</P>
<P>
He said the upsurge of the Yen accounted for the country's
recent foreign debt increase since Japan was Jordan's biggest
creditor of 1.8 billion U.S dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken several steps such as concluding deals
of exchanging the debt with investment and development projects
with Germany, France, and Spain while talks are underway with some
other creditors for the same purpose, he said.
</P>
<P>
Expecting a GDP growth rate of 3.5 percent next year, Marnu
said taxes, phosphate, cement exports and pharmaceutical
production would be the country's major revenue earners.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- A total of 88 oil companies from 19 Arab and other
foreign countries are participating in the four-day Oil Equipment
Fair in Baghdad as of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The fair coincided with Iraq's decision to halt oil exports on
November 22 in protest at the U.N. Security Council's Resolution
1275, which provides for an extension of the oil for food program
for two weeks instead of totally lifting the nine-year-old
U.N-imposed embargo.
</P>
<P>
The participants are showcasing their quality products in the
fields of oil prospection, drilling, production, and processing.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, whose oil facilities were badly damaged in the 1991 Gulf
War, is trying to renovate those installations.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)'s Planning and
International Cooperation Ministry said it agreed in principle
with the German government in Ramallah on a 100-million-Mark (62
million U.S. dollars) grant to be used in projects in the PNA
territories.
</P>
<P>
The final deal would be signed by the two sides in Berlin next
March, the Arabic daily al-Haiyat quoted a senior Ministry
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said the money will be used in infrastructure
projects of water supplies, sewerage systems, solid waste removal,
vocational training, and PNA institutional set-up.

<HEADLINE> GCC Summit Opens on Economic, Political Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The 20th summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) opens here Saturday night to discuss a
series of economic and political issues facing the group.
</P>
<P>
Economic issues, particularly the efforts to achieve united
tariffs on different goods from abroad and pave the way for a GCC
customs union, are expected to top the agenda of the three-day
summit.
</P>
<P>
The GCC has said it plans to have a customs union in place by
2001. The European Union, the GCC's largest trade partner, said
such a union is a precondition for a free trade pact between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Besides economic topics, a long-standing dispute between the
United Arabe Emirates (UAE) and Iran over three small but
strategic Gulf islands would also be a key issue in the summit.
</P>
<P>
Divisions emerged last June between the UAE and its long-time
ally and the GCC heavyweight Saudi Arabia, due to Riyadh's rapid
rapprochement with Tehran. UAE feared the warming up of ties
between other GCC members and Iran would undermine the alliance's
support to its land claim.
</P>
<P>
The UAE wants better ties with Iran to be linked to a
settlement of the land dispute over Abu Musa and the Greater and
Lesser Tunbs in the mouth of the Strait of Hormuz. The islands are
now controled by Iran.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and Saudi Arabia became reconciled in July and a
committee, grouping foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Oman and
Qatar as well as the GCC secretary general, was established to
represent the UAE in dealing with the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Arab leaders are expected, in a joint statement at the
end of the Riyadh summit, to reiterate their support for the UAE's
claim over the three islands and call on Iran to negotiate with
the UAE for a political solution.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi issue would also be high on the agenda for talks. The
GCC is divided on the United Nations' sanctions on Iraq, imposed
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia insist that the sanctions remain in
place until Baghdad complies with all relevant U.N. resolutions,
which include destruction of all weapons of mass destruction and
the release of Kuwaiti war prisoners.
</P>
<P>
But other GCC members obviously preferred a more stable
relations with Iraq and a lifting of the sanction to ease the
sufferings of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process, strategy to fight terrorism
and violence, defense cooperation and GCC security are also
among the major topics at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The six Gulf Arab countries - Oman, Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia,
Qatar and Bahrain - are in joint possession of nearly 45 percent
of the world's oil deposits and 15 percent of its natural gas
reserves. They formed the regional regional political and economic
alliance in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini Amir Sheikh Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, Omani Sultan
Qabus bin Said, Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa-Thani,
Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber al Ahmed al Sabah arrived in the Saudi
capital earlier in the day to join Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz
in the annual gathering.
</P>
<P>
However, UAE President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayyan was
represented by his deputy, Vice President Sheikh Maktoum bin
Rashid al-Maktoum, who is also prime minister and ruler of Dubai,
one of the UAE's seven emirates.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Zayed, 80, went to the United States in September for
what was described as a routine check-up.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Libya Agree to Link Electrical Grids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Libya reached an
agreement on Saturday to begin work on activating a link to unite
their electrical grids, Egyptian Minister of Electricity and
Energy Ali el-Saeedi said.
</P>
<P>
Electricity will be carried over a 179-kilometer line, which
will join the electrical grids of the two North African Arab
countries, el-Saeedi was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came at the end of a meeting between senior
electricity ministry officials from both countries and is part of
a project to establish a regional electricity network that
eventually may be joined with Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The line will carry 120 megawatts of electricity for a
two-month period starting in December.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan linked their grids in March. The project
includes four cables, 13.3 kilometers long, laid across the Gulf
of Aqaba, which separates Egypt and Jordan. The link provides 130
megawatts of power.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also is to link its grid with Turkey, Lebanon and Syria,
a move which is expected to save a total of 2 billion U.S.
dollars a year for the countries by using excess generating
capacity in each country at non-peak times.

<HEADLINE> Riot Claims Over 50 Lives in Nigeria's Lagos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian police Saturday began
to clear the corpses and debris on the streets of Lagos, the west
African country's economic hub, following an ethnic riot that has
killed at least 50 people.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six people involved in the rioting were arrested, Lagos
Police Commissioner Mike Okiro said Saturday during a visit to the
wounded in a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
The Lagos State government has imposed a dust-to-dawn curfew on
the Kosofe council area in the outskirts of Lagos, where the riot
took place, to forestall further escalations of the killing.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted Thursday between immigrant Hausas from the
north and Yorubas who President Olusegun Obasanjo said were backed
by the militant separatist Oodua People's Congress (OPC).
</P>
<P>
"OPC leaders will be arrested if there is evidence connecting
them. We have not obtained that yet and we are still taking
statements from those who were arrested," Okiro said.
</P>
<P>
In northern Nigeria's main city of Kano, police said they were
on alert against any kind of backlash against Yorubas in the city
dominated by Hausa population.
</P>
<P>
On a long-planned visit to Kano to open a library Saturday,
Obasanjo, a Yoruba, issued a stern warning to anyone helping
militant groups anywhere in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see why hoodlums from any part of the country should
be given encouragement because of where they come from," the
president said. "A criminal is a criminal and should be told so
in clear terms."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Police Inspector-General Musiliu Smith said in
capital Abuja Friday that the police are hunting the militant
Oodua People's Congress leader, Ganiyu Adams, who is suspected to
have involved in the clash in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo on Thursday night ordered security agents
in the west African country to "shoot at sight" perpetrators of
violence.

<HEADLINE> Mexican President Confident of FTA with EU Ratification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo said Friday he is confident of the ratification of a free
trade agreement (FTA) with the European Union (EU), that would go
in force next July 1.
</P>
<P>
The FTA implementation with the EU will bring "more investments,
more enterprises, and consequently more and better jobs in our
country," said Zedillo in his Saturday radio chat "Talk of the
President."
</P>
<P>
"More men and women will find a job in the firms that will
trade with Europe," said the president.
</P>
<P>
The future FTA with the EU will provide Mexico with modern and
efficient technologies that will not pollute the atmosphere, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said Mexico will enter the year 2000 with a strong
international position strengthened by the FTAs in force with six
Latin American countries, the United States and Canada, and the
forthcoming one with the EU, made up of 15 nations.
</P>
<P>
The FTA with the EU will give "a new equilibrium" to the
economic relations of Mexico with the world since the ones
existing now are directed mostly toward the United States and
Canada, said Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
signed in 1994 and the booming U.S. economy, about 80 percent of
Mexico's exports go to the United States, making Mexico
increasingly vulnerable to any U.S. economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
However, the EC accord will reduce the risk of Mexico's being
completely tied to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican president said that the EU is Mexico's second trade
partner and the second source of investments after the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The FTA between Mexico and the EU foresees a gradual custom
tariff elimination in diverse economic aspects after it goes in
force.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and the EU concluded on November 24 last year the
agreement for the FTA, for which the formal signing is foreseen
for the first days of next year, and will go in force on July 1
next year after its ratification by the Mexican Senate and the
respective legislative assemblies of the 15 EU member nations.
</P>
<P>
"Mexico will be the only country in the world with free trade
agreements with six Latin American countries and the world's two
largest markets: North America and Europe," said Zedillo Wednesday.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- One ton of cocaine
has been seized by Colombian maritime authorities during a joint
operation with the U.S. Coast Guard, military sources said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The drug cargo was found aboard a boat in the Caribbean
peninsula of La Guajira. The drug would be sent to the coasts of
some South American country. The boat was abandoned by traffickers
after shooting it out with Colombian military forces.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the drug occurred Friday night near Puerto
Bolivar in the La Guajira, department of the northern coast of the
country, bordering with Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
A total of 27 packages with 30 to 40 kilos of the drug each
were found aboard the boat, as explained to the Radio Caracol
network of Bogota by the military authorities of the region.
</P>
<P>
The ship was intercepted in the sea in an operation supported
by United States Coast Guard speedboats.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the boat crew shot at the military boats,
which started a brief shootout. The operation forced the drug
traffickers to return to the beaches, where they abandoned their
boat.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Voices Solidarity With Palestinian People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina on Sunday expressed solidarity with the Palestinian
people in their just and rightful struggle for an independent and
sovereign homeland with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of the International Day of
Solidarity with the Palestinian People, Hasina said Bangladesh
reiterates its full support to the just and legitimate struggle of
the Palestinian people, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has never shied away from expressing the strongest
solidarity with her Palestinian brethren, she said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has always believed that the United Nations has a
permanent responsibility in solving the Middle East problem, at
the heart of which lies the promise to establish the inalienable
rights of the Palestinian people to an independent state, as
recognized in various U.N. resolutions, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We also believe that implementation of Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338 forms the basis of the Middle East peace
process and is the key to resolving the question of Palestine,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
The achievement of a lasting, just and comprehensive peace in
the Middle East will contribute significantly towards the
strengthening of international security, peace and progress, and
Bangladesh has welcomed all peace initiatives in the Middle East,
she said.
</P>
<P>
"We also appeal to the international community to be
forthcoming in fulfilling their commitment to consolidate the
peace process by extending economic, technical and moral support
to the Palestinian people, so that their sufferings of more than
half a century ceases, their legitimate rights are restored and
international law prevails," she said.

<HEADLINE> China Says E. Asia's Recovery Needs Everyone's Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here Sunday that it requires persistent efforts of all countries
in East Asia to get the regional economy out of the current dire
straits.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing the 3rd Informal Summit between the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China, Japan
and South Korea, which is the only channel for East Asian leaders
to meet and exchange ideas on regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At present, East Asia is under the double pressure of
overcoming all the negative impact of the financial crisis and
meeting new challenges accompanying economic globalization, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
A "profound lesson" drawn from the Asian financial crisis in
1997 is that all countries in the region should press ahead with
their respective reforms and cooperate with each other before the
momentum of development can be brought back, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"In a fairly long period of time to come, East Asian
cooperation should focus on the economic area," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As East Asia may become one of the assault targets of
international capital and in the absence of a rational
international financial system and a full-fledged financial
supervision and regulation system in regional countries, it is
still a heavy task to guard against and prevent financial risks,"
the premier added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu put forward a multi-point proposal at the summit to
strengthen the dialogue mechanism in East Asia, which includes
holding meetings of financial and bank leaders or officials, and
setting up an ad hoc committee to monitor and study the region's
financial situation.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that East Asian countries coordinate positions and
stances on major international financial and economic issues so
that East Asia may play its part in the reform of the
international financial system.
</P>
<P>
Talking about China's link with East Asia, the premier said
"China cannot develop without East Asia, neither can East Asia
prosper without China."
</P>
<P>
"China's political stability, economic development and social
progress constitute the most important contribution China makes to
the development of East Asia," Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, founded in 1967, groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The title race for China's
first division soccer league is going into the final round next
week as both contenders failed to post a victory in the
penultimate round of matches on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
League leaders Liaoning Fushun rallied for a 1-1 away tie with
Sichuan Quanxing to maintain a one-point slender advantage over
Shangdong Luneng, who squandered a golden opportunity to take the
initiative after being forced to a 1-1 draw by strugglers
Shengyang Haishi in freezing sub-zero temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Promoted side Liaoning, who travelled to Sichuan seeking a
victory which would have awarded them the league trophy, now
stands atop with 46 points from 25 matches, with Shandong one
point adrift on 45 and Sichuan third on 42.
</P>
<P>
Home side Sichuan saw their outside chances of landing the
league title for the first time in club history 15 minutes into
the game as winger Yao Xia converted a penalty kick. But their
hopes soon evaporated when center forward Zhang Yuning nodded
Liaoning back into the picture 15 minutes later with a raking
header.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning now has to beat traditional powerhouse Beijing Guo'an
in the last-round encounter to secure the championship while
Shandong, in a bid for a league and Cup double this season, was
handed a relatively easy piece of work to do next week, taking on
already-relegated bottom club Wuhan Heart K.
</P>
<P>
In other actions on Sunday, Chongqing Longxin routed Shenzhen
Ping'an 5-2 to hold on to the fourth place on the table; defending
champions Dalian Wanda lost their last home match this season,
beaten by Beijing Guo'an 1-0; Qingdao Hainiu boosted their chances
of staying above by thrashing Tianjin Taida 4-1 on home soil;
Shanghai Shenhua scored an away 2-1 win over Guangzhou Songri and
Wuhan Heart K fought out a 1-1 tie with Jilin Aodong.

<P>
TEHRAN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Veba Oil Company has
joined the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), Shell and Lasmo to
conduct an oil exploration study in the southern part of the
Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect was inked Sunday by Iranian Oil
Ministry Advisor for the Economy of Energy Hossein Kazempour
Ardebili and a member of Veba's executive board, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The NIOC initially concluded a contract on the southern Caspian
Sea exploration study with Shell and Lasmo on December 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
By joining forces, Veba will hold 15 percent of the contract
and acquire 15 percent share interest and 20 percent financial
interest in this study.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the foreign companies will spend 25 million
U.S. dollars for the first phase of an exploration program and the
reimbursement will be from the revenues of the development phase
of the project.
</P>
<P>
In the event of no discovery of hydrocarbon resources, no
payments will be made to the participating companies by the NIOC,
according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The duration of the agreement is 18 months, but it could be
extended to 24 months if necessary and the study was to be
carried out under the supervision of a steering committee in
which NIOC has veto power.

Meanwhile, the Chechen command headquarters Sunday said,
according to the Interfax, under fine weather conditions Russian
forces intensified the air strikes on Grozny and other populated
areas in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Bombs were dropped on all mans of transportation moving along
the Chechen roads. The air strikes on Urus-Martan were
particularly fierce, and the center of Grozny has been turned into
ruins, said the Chechen sources.
</P>
<P>
A motor column was eliminated, the sources said. Fires broke
out in different parts of the city. The worst fires were on the

village of Alkhazurovo.
</P>
<P>
An Interfax report said that burnt cars and tractors could be
seen on the roads around Urus-Martan. Under incessant fire people

</P>
<P>
It said that no combat operations are being conducted near Urus-
Martan. The nearest village where fighting flared up in the past
few days is the village of Alkhan-Yurt 12 kilometers north of Urus-

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Deepening Cooperation With ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here Sunday that China will expand and deepen its mutually
beneficial cooperation with Southeast Asian countries in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the informal summit between the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China, Zhu said emphasis
should be placed on cooperation in the economic, trade, scientific
and technological, agricultural and financial fields.
</P>
<P>
China also stands ready to strengthen its links with the ASEAN
Free Trade Area and the ASEAN Free Investment Area. It also
supports the development of the Mekong River Basin, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China will maintain and increase friendly contacts with ASEAN
countries at various levels and through various channels to
enhance mutual understanding and trust, he said.
</P>
<P>
In regional and international affairs, he said, China and ASEAN
supported each other and worked closely together to strengthen
dialogue and cooperation and maintain regional peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
China and ASEAN countries will continue to render support to
and cooperate with each other in regional and international
organizations and make joint efforts for the establishment of a
new just and rational world order, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has pursued an independent foreign policy of peace. And
more and more countries have seen more clearly that a developed
China will not pose a threat to any country, but rather it will
contribute to regional and world peace and prosperity, the premier
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"China will never seek hegemony," he said, adding: "China will
forever share weal and woe with the vast number of developing
countries."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Rebel Group Office in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The office of an Ethiopian
rebel group in the Somali capital Mogadishu has officially been
closed down Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The move followed an agreement signed by Somali faction leader
Hussein Mohamed Aidid and the government of Ethiopia in Addis
Ababa in October this year, providing for each of the two sides to
get rid of the opposition groups it is hosting in their respective
country.
</P>
<P>
According to an official statement issued here Sunday with the
presence of the Libyan and Egyptian diplomats, all Oromo
Liberation Front (OLF) soldiers present in southern Somalia have
also been disarmed with the supervision of the Arab League members
as part of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the disarmament of undisclosed number of OLF
soldiers in southern Somalia has been completed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The leadership of the OLF fighters has also been notified to
leave Somalia for a third country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of OLF fighters opposing to the government of
Ethiopia have been deployed on three ferries in southern Somalia
ever since the border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea
worsened and expanded into Somalia a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of those OLF forces have already infiltrated into
Ethiopia where they had made armed confrontations with the
Ethiopian forces in the eastern border region.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Ethiopian government soldiers in collaboration
with some Somali anti-Aidid factions have captured several
strategic towns in Gedo, Bay and Bakol regions, where the
Ethiopian forces presence is still widely visible.

<HEADLINE> Senior Party Leader on Reform, Development and Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, president of the
Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), said here today that "the correct understanding and
handling of the relationship among reform, development and
stability is not an expedient measure, but an important principle
that China must adhere to for a long time to come."
</P>
<P>
Only by handling the relationship among the three, and
correctly maintaining their coordinated development, can a long
period of peace and prosperity be achieved, said Hu, who is a
member of the country's top 7-member decision-making body, the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, at a Party school graduation ceremony attended by
provincial and ministerial level officials here today.
</P>
<P>
In analyzing the present domestic situation, Hu, also the State
vice-president, said: "We should continue to pursue a pro-active
financial policy and combine the task of driving domestic demand
with readjusting the economic structure, promoting scientific
progress, opening to the outside world, developing western China,
and improving people's living standards."
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be concentrated on the reform of State-owned
enterprises to attain the goal of extricating them from
difficulties in the coming three years and laying a solid basis
for the 10-year blueprint set by the Fourth Plenum of the 15th CPC
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
As China's reform and development enter a crucial period, the
maintenance of stability becomes even more important, Hu said, "We
should be based in reality and probe effective ways to solve
contradictions among the people."
</P>
<P>
He urged leading officials at all levels to consider the lives
of the people, pay attention to work methods, and try to solve
problems in their early stages.

JOHANNESBURG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The African, Caribbean
and Pacific (ACP) countries are increasingly speaking with one
voice on world issues, South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The ACP is emerging with a powerful voice in world affairs,"
Zuma told reporters at Johannesburg International Airport shortly
after returning from a two-day ACP summit in the Dominican
Republic last week.
</P>
<P>
The ACP summit discussed the international trading system, the
upcoming World Trade Organization ministerial meeting in Seattle
and the replacement of the Lome Convention between the European
Union and ACP countries.
</P>
<P>
European Union representatives raised the issue of how funding
was related to good governance, Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
Globalization and people-centered development were two other
topics explored by the ACP countries, echoing the themes of the
recent Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Durban, South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said globalization should help to narrow the gaps between
the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
The summit, attended by 71 heads of state, produced a
Declaration of Santo Domingo containing details of the ACP's
objectives for the next decade.

<HEADLINE> Founder of China's Defense Industry Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A forum was held in Beijing
today to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Marshal Nie
Rongzhen (1899-1992), founder of China's defense industry and one
of the founders of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
Attending the forum were General Cao Gangchuan, member of the
Central Military Commission and head of the PLA General Armament
Department, Liu Jibin, minister of the Commission of Science,
Technology and Industry for National Defense, and a group of top
Chinese scientists from the military industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of Nie's remarkable contributions to the
development of the country's defense industry on the occasion,
General Cao urged learning from Nie, who put forward the important
concept that the development of China's defense technology and
armaments must take its own road with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Minister Liu, who also spoke at the forum, said the late
marshal created a series of policies and guiding principles that
have remained great and are of realistic importance today, and
play a guiding role in the development of country's defense
technology.
</P>
<P>
During the forum, military industrial experts recalled Nie's
efforts to create a military industry for China and, in particular,
to help improve the working and living conditions of the
scientists in the 1960s when the country was battered with severe
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Nie was born On December 29, 1899 in Jiangjin in Sichuan
Province and died on May 14, 1992 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He went to study in France in 1919, became a Communist there in
1922, and was sent to study in the former USSR in 1924, returning
to China the following year.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1927, Nie held a series of important positions in
the Communist Party of China (CPC)-led armed forces, and in 1955
became one of the ten PLA officers with the rank of marshal.
</P>
<P>
Nie became the chief of the country's defense industry in 1956,
when he was made a vice premier and, concurrently, minister-in-
charge of the science and technology commission and chairman of
the science and technology committee of defense.
</P>
<P>
The late marshal is remembered for his leading role in the
development of China's nuclear and space programs.

<HEADLINE> No More Flexibility in Stance on bin Laden: Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The supreme leader of
Afghanistan's Taliban militia, Mulla Muhammad Omer, Sunday said
there will be no more flexibility in their stance on the
long-standing issue of the alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
"We can no more soften our stand on bin Laden issue as the
acceptance of the U.S. demand to hand him over would amount to
compromising Islam and national interests," Omer said when talking
to newsmen, according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The bin Laden issue is a big issue for the Taliban but a small
one for the Americans, Omer said, adding: "If the Americans
abandon their stand and adopt another one, it would not be
difficult for them."
</P>
<P>
"But if Taliban accept the U.S. demand, it is very harmful and
dangerous for them," he observed.
</P>
<P>
The reclusive leader said the Taliban do not harbor enmity and
hostility against anyone nor do they interfere in the affairs of
others. But if others want to exert pressure, the Taliban would
resist it, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would resist it not for personal gains rather for the sake
of the country and Islam," he said.

<HEADLINE> Namibia's Ruling Party Confident of Winning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's ruling party
South West African People's Organization (SWAPO) wound up its
election campaign on Sunday, virtually assured of returning to
power for a third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
President Sam Nujoma, who has led SWAPO since its founding 36
years ago, has been packing in large, enthusiastic crowds at party
rallies - a strong show of support which opposition parties have
not managed to emulate.
</P>
<P>
According to a press report reaching here, about 850,000 people
who have registered to vote in this sparsely populated southwest
African country will elect the 72-member National Assembly and the
president next Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 elections SWAPO won 72.7 percent of the vote and the
Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) 20.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
"SWAPO will extend its majority," predicted the 70-year-old
Nujoma, who is seeking re-election after pushing through a
controversial amendment to the Constitution to enable him to serve
a third term.
</P>
<P>
Seven other parties are contesting the general election, but
only the DTA and the newly formed Congress for Democracy are
expected to make an impact.
</P>
<P>
The Congress for Democracy was formed earlier this year by Ben
Ulenga, 47, a former SWAPO stalwart and ambassador to Britain. He
quit the ruling party over Nujoma's commitment of troops to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and the lifting of the two-term
limit for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Henning Melber, director of the Namibian Economic Policy
Research Unit, said the party stood a good chance of becoming the
official opposition, but its support was very difficult to gauge.

<HEADLINE> 22 Shipwreck Survivors Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The 22 survivors from last
Wednesday's "Dashun" shipwreck near the coastal city of Yantai are
now recovering well and some have left the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Their recovery has been attributed to the timely on-the-spot
treatment given by several hundred doctors and nurses who reached
the scene from five nearby hospitals after the rescues were made,
said officials from the city health department.
</P>
<P>
The survivors have received intensive care at the local
hospital, and doctors conducted emergency consultations for the
treatment of Xu Zhichao, one of the most seriously affected, who
contracted acute pulmonary edema after his time in the frigid
water, and his treatment has been successful.
</P>
<P>
At the rescue site, search operations continue with more
professional marine rescue personnel and divers arriving from
Shanghai and Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The auxiliary vessel "Zhifu" from the Shengli Oil Field at the
Bohai Sea shore and a towboat from the North Sea Naval Troop
joined the rescue efforts last night bringing professional sea
rescue outfits.
</P>
<P>
China's largest heavy-lift vessel the "Dali" with 2,500 tons of
pulling ability has left its base in Shanghai for the site to
begin salvaging the remains of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Divers have met difficulties in attempts to locate bodies in
the wreck because of low visibility under the sea as a result of
days of storms and high waves.
</P>
<P>
By this afternoon, only four bodies of the shipwreck victims
had been recovered.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: ASEAN Informal Summit Ends in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Third Informal ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Summit ended here late
Sunday afternoon with ASEAN leaders committing themselves to
promoting regional cooperation and economic integration.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day summit, leaders of the 10 ASEAN nations agreed
to strengthen their cooperation in information technology,
e-commerce, industry, agriculture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said they will continue their countries' structural
reform and strengthen cooperation to sustain the region's economic
growth and guard against the recurrence of economic crises in East
Asia.
</P>
<P>
In a landmark decision, the member countries committed
themselves to eliminating all import duties by 2010, ahead of the
original schedule, for the six original members of ASEAN --
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Brunei Darussalam.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed in principle to advance the schedule from 2018
to 2015 for the new members, but allowed some sensitive products
to follow the original date of 2018.
</P>
<P>
On the social issues, the leaders stressed the need to address
the impact of the crisis, alleviate poverty and solve other social
issues affecting the elderly, women, children and other
disadvantaged sectors.
</P>
<P>
In the political and security areas, the leaders agreed to
continue dialogue, coordination and cooperation to increase mutual
understanding and trust toward forging lasting peace and stability
in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
As regards the future direction of ASEAN, the leaders
emphasized the importance of making efforts to prepare ASEAN for
the challenges of globalization and promote extra-ASEAN relations.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the leaders stressed the need for a more rapid
World Trade Organization accession process for Cambodia, Laos and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, ASEAN leaders gave their seal of approval
to an initiative for fast-tracking the development of the ASEAN
information infrastructure (AII) at the conclusion of their
closed-door session with the private IT sector tasked with
studying the challenge.
</P>
<P>
Former Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo, who led the
private IT sector group for a 45-minute meeting with the ASEAN
leaders, said the leaders gave high priority to the creation of
the AII.
</P>
<P>
"They recognize that information technology is the key to
success of ASEAN in the 21st century," Romulo told the media after
the ASEAN-IT dialogue.
</P>
<P>
During the dialogue, representatives from the world's leading
IT companies presented a white paper which surveyed the state and
prospects of IT in Southeast Asia and outlined a plan on how the
public and private sectors can work together in building the AII,
also dubbed the ASEAN Millennium Initiative.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said at the opening
ceremony of the summit that the meeting will bridge the past and
the future as the leaders will discuss political, economic, social
and security issues facing the group.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said the summit is a bridge which will "help
link the two sides of three divides, namely, those of the past and
the future, of experience and vision, and of promise and
fulfillment."
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the major experience ASEAN has
learned from the past is that "cooperation among the member
countries must be comprehensive."
</P>
<P>
"Greater economic cooperation should lead to and accompany
deeper and broader cooperation on matters of peace and security,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
To transform ASEAN into a true community of Southeast Asian
nations, Estrada said, more openness is needed among ASEAN members
as well as between ASEAN and its Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the considerable resources and assistance
committed by Japan and China have helped contain the Asian
financial crisis, mitigate its adverse impacts and facilitate
economic recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
He urged all ASEAN leaders to work harder to realize the dream
of "an East Asian common market. One East Asian currency. And one
East Asian community -- a family from happy union of the north and
south."
</P>
<P>
Except for Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad, who is
unable to attend the summit because of his nation's election,
heads of state or government of all member countries were present
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is the third ASEAN country to host the ASEAN
Informal Summit. The first informal summit was held in Jakarta on
November 30, 1996, and the second in Kuala Lumpur on December 15
and 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the Fifth ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in 1995, ASEAN leaders
agreed to meet informally every year between two formal summits,
which are held every three years.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1967, ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.

CAIRO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid is expected to visit Egypt in January, an Indonesian
official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Accordign to Egypt's Middle East News Agency, Abdullmalek
Alyoun, presidential envoy to the Middle East, said Wahid will fly
to Egypt after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ends around
January 8.
</P>
<P>
"President Wahid would like to spend days, not hours in Cairo
as Egypt is the biggest country in the Middle East and was the
first (in the region) to recognize Indonesia's independence,"
Alyoun said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Cairo, Wahid is expected to discuss with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak issues in the Muslim world, the
Mideast peace process and ways to boost bilateral economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian president views Egypt as "his second home" and
cherishes his memories in Cairo, where he studied at the Al-Azhar
University, the highest seat of Sunni Islamic studies in the
world, Alyoun said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid, leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim
organization, was elected to a five-year term in October by the
People's Consultative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Wahid will also travel to Saudi Arabia and Iraq after his
Egyptian trip.

<HEADLINE> Remote Sensing Techniques to be Used for Predicting Grain Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are
developing a remote sensing information system which can be used
to monitor the growth of crops and evaluate natural disasters such
as floods and drought.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Institute of Remote Sensing Applications
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have started a five-
year research project on the system, which is composed of large
amounts of remote sensing data and advanced computer network
technology, and can provide information for a variety of uses.
</P>
<P>
The system will be used to monitor the growth of crops and
predict grain output, and make quick evaluations of natural
disasters which may affect grain, said Guo Huadong, director of
the institute.
</P>
<P>
He said that on the basis of domestic grain-growth monitoring
and output prediction, the system may also be capable of being
used worldwide for these purposes.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the institute have already made remarkable
progress in using remote sensing techniques to monitor floods over
the past three years, and have provided more than 100 flood
reports to state organizations and local governments.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Remote Sensing Applications (IRSA),
established in 1979, is a comprehensive research organization
conducting research on fundamental theory and remote sensing
techniques and their applications.

<HEADLINE> 22 Shipwreck Survivors Recovering (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The 22 survivors from last
Wednesday's "Dashun" shipwreck near the coastal city of Yantai are
now recovering well and some have left the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Their recovery has been attributed to the timely on-the-spot
treatment given by several hundred doctors and nurses who reached
the scene from five nearby hospitals after the rescues were made,
said officials from the city health department.
</P>
<P>
The survivors have received intensive care at the local
hospital, and doctors conducted emergency consultations for the
treatment of Xu Zhichao, one of the most seriously affected, who
contracted acute pulmonary edema after his time in the frigid
water, and his treatment has been successful.
</P>
<P>
At the rescue site, search operations continue with more
professional marine rescue personnel and divers arriving from
Shanghai and Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The auxiliary vessel "Zhifu" from the Shengli Oil Field at the
Bohai Sea shore and a towboat from the North Sea Naval Troop
joined the rescue efforts last night bringing professional sea
rescue outfits.
</P>
<P>
China's largest heavy-lift vessel the "Dali" with 2,500 tons of
pulling ability has left its base in Shanghai for the site to
begin salvaging the remains of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Divers have met difficulties in attempts to locate bodies in
the wreck because of low visibility under the sea as a result of
days of storms and high waves.
</P>
<P>
By this afternoon, only four bodies of the shipwreck victims
had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that more than 50 frogmen began underwater salvage
work this morning from a rescue ship to look for those still
missing.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials including Wu Guanzheng, a member of the
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central committee
and secretary of the Shandong CPC Provincial Committee, Huang
Zhendong, minister of communications, and Song Fatang, vice
governor of Shandong Province, also arrived on the scene to direct
the search operations.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five frogmen from the Chinese naval forces are on the way
to the scene, sources said.
</P>
<P>
For the past several days, hundreds of rescue workers have been
searched a 28-mile (45-kilometer) stretch of coastline for the
missing despite sub zero temperatures and high waves.
</P>
<P>
With 262 passengers and 40 crew members on aboard, the "Dashun"
of the Yantai Yanda Automobile Ferry Company caught fire on the
afternoon of November 24 and broke apart and sank by midnight.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Macedonian Supreme Court on
Saturday accepted claims of irregularities at this month's
presidential balloting and ordered a vote rerun in 199 polling
stations.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Social Democrats, whose candidate Tito Petkovshi
lost to the ruling coalition's candidate Boris Trajkovski by a
margin of 70,000 votes in November 14 election, accused the ruling
coalition of perpetrating election fraud in many polling stations,
especially those in the ethnic Albanian-populated western part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian electoral commission last Tuesday turned down
the party's allegation, but it soon appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
According to the court's ruling, the electoral commission will
decide a date for the new vote. Some 150,000 people are eligible
to vote in the 199 stations.

<HEADLINE> China Telecom Passes On-Line Y2K Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China Telecom, the largest
telecommunications company in China, successfully conducted a
whole-network on-line test for Y2K glitches from 10 p.m. yesterday
to 1 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time China used this sort of on-line
troubleshooting.
</P>
<P>
The telephone network, transmission network, data
telecommunication network, and business operation systems all were
found to be problem free, said Leng Rongquan, deputy director of
the company, at a press conference held today after the tests.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom also invited some key data users, consumers using
special networks, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and foreign
telecom operators to join the tests, including the People's Bank
of China, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, and the
Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
On orders from test headquarters, the clock on the telecom net
was adjusted to 23:45, December 31,1999; 23:45, February 28, 2000;
and 23:45, February 29, 2000 to show the operation of the net in
the transition of year 2000, also a leap year.
</P>
<P>
Following the success of the testing, Leng urged local telecom
companies to continue to focus on the Y2K problem to prepare for
emergency measures.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom has paid close attention to the Y2K problem and
set up a special task force in 1998. It launched a large-scale
check of the entire network in April, 1998, and system upgrading
and modifications were accomplished afterwards.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June this year, equipment modification on the
entire network had been basically completed, said one official.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- East Asian leaders have singled
out economy, finance and science and technology as the priorities
for future coordination and cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
At an informal summit held here Sunday, leaders from the
10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and from
the organization's dialogue partners -- China, Japan and South
Korea -- also agreed upon the need of enhancing mutual
understanding, trust and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which was formed in 1967, groups Brunei, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
According to officials close to the summit, some leaders
suggested that coordination and cooperation be strengthened in the
financial sector through various dialogue mechanisms, including a
China-proposed one between financial and central bank leaders or
officials of ASEAN and their three dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
Other leaders proposed active cooperation in human resources
development.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting, the leaders congratulated China on the
signing of a Sino-U.S. agreement in Beijing earlier this month on
China's accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The leaders shared the common view that China's future entry
into the world's largest trade body will be conducive to the
economic development and trade in East Asia and the world as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Outlining China's views on cooperation in East Asia, Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji said the primary task is to concentrate efforts
on economic development and make further efforts to build a
peaceful environment.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN-China, Japan and South Korea informal summit is the
third of its kind since it was first held in Malaysia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At another ASEAN-China summit held later Sunday, regional
leaders expressed their satisfaction with the development of
relations between Southeast Asian countries and China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told ASEAN leaders that China will continue to strengthen
dialogue and cooperation with ASEAN at all levels and in all
areas, particularly in the economic and trade, science and
technology and financial areas.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN leaders spoke highly of China's support and assistance to
some of their countries hit hard by the Asian financial crisis in
1997.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the summit, Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said ASEAN should continue to attach importance to
strengthening ties with China, which he said is a respectable and
influential big country in the world.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Vows to Speed Up Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries said Sunday that their
10-member organization is moving toward a higher level of economic
integration as it faces the challenges of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
In the chairman's statement issued to the press after the end
of the Third Informal ASEAN Summit, Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said ASEAN leaders agreed to continue the reform of the
financial and economic sector to guard against the risks that
could affect the region's economic recovery from the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a landmark decision, the member countries committed
themselves to eliminating all import duties by 2010, ahead of the
original schedule, for the six original members of ASEAN --
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Brunei Darussalam.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed in principle to advance the schedule from 2018
to 2015 for the new members of ASEAN, but allowed some sensitive
products to follow the original date of 2018.
</P>
<P>
As of the social issues, the leaders stressed the need to
address the impact of the crisis and alleviate poverty and other
social issues affecting the elderly, women, children and other
disadvantaged sectors.
</P>
<P>
They also committed themselves to moving forward and
intensifying individual and collective efforts to address
transnational crime, such as drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
On the ASEAN's future direction, the leaders emphasized the
importance of efforts to prepare ASEAN for the challenges of
globalization and promote extra-ASEAN relations.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the leaders also stressed the need for a more
rapid World Trade Organization (WTO) accession process for
Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. They also welcomed China's impending
admission into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, Philippine President Estrada expressed his
confidence in ASEAN's ability to achieve its Vision 2020 goals of
peace, stability and prosperity for the 10 countries of Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also called for the intensification of dialogue and
cooperation between ASEAN and the countries of Northeast Asia to
move the whole East Asian region to higher levels of integration
and partnership.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is the third ASEAN country to host the ASEAN
Informal Summit. The first informal summit was held in Jakarta on
November 30, 1996, and the second in Kuala Lumpur on December 15
and 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the Fifth ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in 1995, ASEAN leaders
agreed to meet informally every year between two formal summits,
which are held every three years.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1967, ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN nations came together with three main objectives in
mind: to promote the economic, social and cultural development of
the region through cooperative programs, to safeguard the
political and economic stability of the region against big power
rivalry, and to serve as a forum for the resolution of
intra-regional differences.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 32 registered

Following are some facts about key political parties:
</P>
<P>
1. The National Front (BN-Barisan Nasional)
</P>
<P>
The National Front (BN) is Malaysia's dominant political force.
The BN, based on the 1955 Alliance formula, was established in

all the leading ethnic groups in a country.
</P>
<P>
The BN attaches importance to economic development and
coordination of the interests among the parties, and the
establishment of social peace, stability, prosperity and justice.
</P>
<P>
The BN has tested its support in six general elections held in
1974, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1995 respectively. In the last
general election in April 1995, the BN won an overwhelming
majority, taking 162 out of the 192 seats in the House of
Representatives, with some 64 percent of the total votes cast.
</P>
<P>
The BN essentially provides the framework for members to
contest elections on a single symbol in each constituency whilst
retaining their separate party identities.

<HEADLINE> Coalition Capable of Fulfilling Promises: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Sunday assured the voters that they would not
lose if they again give the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) (National
Front) the mandate to form the government,
</P>
<P>
"BN is capable of fulfilling its promises and of developing the
country," Mahathir, who is also BN chairman, said in his special
message broadcast over Radio Malaysia from Jitra in the northern
state of Kedah on the eve of the 10th general election on November
29.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir believed that the people would be wise enough to
choose BN because it has many more plans to develop the country so
that Malaysia would become a developed nation in the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that BN would get a two-thirds
majority or even more in the House of Representatives (Dewan
Rakyat) in the polls on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He believed the voters will choose BN because it has an
excellent track record including bringing peace and stability to
the country of multi-racial and multi-religious people who have
different cultures and speak different languages.
</P>
<P>
It is not an easy task but in Malaysia the relationship between
the various races is good and there were no racial riots during
the recent economic slowdown, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident of the ability of the Malaysian people
and the BN government to revive the economy, noting that they had
suffered from recent attack from rogue speculators without asking
for aid from the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Verdict on Nouri Protested by Iran's Moderate Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran's reformist party, the
Party of Constructive Executives of Iran (PCEI), on Sunday lodged
a protest against a court verdict on Abdollah Nouri, a close ally
of moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The party issued a statement calling for revocation of the
verdict on Nouri, who was found guilty by the Special Cleric Court
and sentenced to five years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a reformist cleric and managing director of the
pro-Khatami newspaper Khordad, was put behind bars in Evin prison
in northern Tehran after the sentence was handed down.
</P>
<P>
He was also sentenced to five years of dismissal from his post
as managing director and a cash fine of 15 million rials (5,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nouri was accused of publishing anti-religious materials and
sacrilegious articles, insulting the late Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini and opposing his views and opinions,
disseminating false ideas aimed at disturbing public opinions,
misinformation about the country's system and insulting the
system's officials and related organs.
</P>
<P>
"The deplorable report on the heavy, unconventional and unjust
conviction of Abdollah Nouri, the honorable member of the State
Expediency Council and managing director of the daily Khordad, is
a cause of suffering and concern," the PCEI statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement hailed Nouri, former interior minister and vice
president for development and social affairs, as "one of
reputable, reasonable and popular personalities of the Islamic
Iran."
</P>
<P>
Lack of consideration of his religious and social status in
the verdict will undermine the system, the clergy and the judicial
apparatus of the country, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers said that the Nouri's sentence was
one of the moves by the powerful conservatives in an attempt to
foreclose a possible victory by the moderates in the coming Majlis
(parliament) elections in February.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a top vote-winner in the first local council polling
last February, resigned in September his post as chairman of
Tehran City Council in order to run in the Majlis elections. His
campaign for the Majlis speakership is supported by a number of
moderate parties, which all named him as their candidate.
</P>
<P>
However, under Iranian laws, the court verdict and sentence
would disqualify him from running in the February elections.

"We will provide various districts with extra resources to
improve their environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will strengthen the supervision of the District Council on
the civil service," he said. "We will increase communications
between the District Councils and various government departments,
so that they can respond to the opinion of the public more
directly and offer proper service."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the 798 candidates in this election are of various
political and social backgrounds, he expressed his confidence
about the result of the election because of the higher turnout
than in the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the appointment of some District
Council members, Tung said the appointment does not mean a
backdown from democracy in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it will enable more capable and experienced persons to
sit in the District Councils so that the District Councils will be
more representative and better reflect opinions of the general
public, he said.

<HEADLINE> Two-Thirds Majority Vital for Continued Stability: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 28 (Xinhua) -- There is no reason for
the people to deny the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) (National
Front) a two-thirds majority if they want continued prosperity and
stability, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia goes to the polls Monday (November 29) and the
14-party BN coalition aims at winning a two-thirds majority for
what its Chairman and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called a
strong and stable government.
</P>
<P>
The people should vote wisely for the sake of their own future,
Abdullah said in the northern state of Pulau Pinang, according to
Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia has developed because of a strong and influential
government that is supported by the people and has the experience
to bring it to the desired level of progress," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said this strength had enabled the government to
successfully implement various development programs and tackle the
economic crisis and challenges from outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Giving an assurance that the BN would not abuse the two-thirds
majority if it is returned to power with a strong mandate,
Abdullah said voters should give BN a two-thirds majority if they
want a government that could protect the country's independence
and bring it to greater heights.
</P>
<P>
"To be a government capable of charting the country's future
and leading effectively, the government must have ability and the
strong support of the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the people that they are the ones to determine
whether the government they want is strong, stable and influential
or otherwise.

<HEADLINE> Mysterious Disease Kills 100 Hippos in Lake Kariba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A mysterious disease has killed
more than 100 hippos along the shores of Lake Kariba in the last
three weeks and there are fears among environmentalists that a
disaster is looming in the lake, the Sunday Mail newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The mysterious deaths started about three weeks ago and it is
now suspected that at least ten hippos are dying each day. Lake
Kariba is believed to be holding more than 30,000 hippos.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mail visited the area, 40 km east of Kariba, and was
taken on a tour of a shoreline littered with scores of hippo
carcasses in different stages of decomposition.
</P>
<P>
The Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management in
Kariba confirmed the deaths and said the department was puzzled by
them.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the National Parks head office in Harare were
expected in the town this week to visit the shoreline to assess
the situation.
</P>
<P>
A source at the National Parks said hippos could be dying from
a chemical known as "Round-up 2.4D" which was sprayed in the lake
early this year to kill weeds. The animals were said to be dying
either direct from the chemical or from shortages of food caused
when weeds were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Others also believe that a new grass that poisons the digestive
system of hippos could have started growing in the environs of the
lake following the rains.

<HEADLINE> Drug Abuse Increases in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Admission of new cases
to the Zanzibar Kidongochekundu Mental Hospital has shot up due to
increased effects of drug abuse in the last six years, Tanzania's
Daily News newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator of mental health services in Zanzibar Mahmoud
Ibrahim Mussa told a seminar on drug abuse awareness held in the
island Saturday that the most affected persons are youth in
Zanzibar Urban District.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted him as saying that drug abuse is escalating
and constituting a menace to the youth and to the society.
</P>
<P>
The official, who is also the deputy secretary-general of a
special committee formed to deal with people beset with
psychiatric problems, attributed the increase in drug abuse to
security laxity at entry points into Zanzibar and lack of modern
equipment to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar has been singled out as a conduit for drug traffickers
due to improper security checks at the airport and seaport, and
corruption by some government officials.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say unemployment is another contributing factor to the
increase of drug abuse among young people.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator said 47 patients had been admitted to the mental
hospital in the past ten months, while 11 cases were recorded in
1998 and 24 in 1997 and 31 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Concerted efforts must be made to arrest the trend, he added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese President to Visit India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese President Tran
Duc Luong is scheduled to pay a five-day official visit to India,
during which the two countries will sign six agreements.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which will start next Wednesday, is mainly aimed at
consolidating and giving a new dimension to bilateral relations,
Vietnamese Ambassador to India Pham Si Tam said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While Hanoi has expressed a strong desire to enter into
"long-term cooperation" with New Delhi in the fields of defense,
trade and science and technology, India has offered to collaborate
with Vietnam in setting up software centers in Hanoi and Ho Chi
Minh city.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding to this effect is expected to be
firmed up during Luong' visit, the first by a Vietnamese President
to the South Asian country since 1958 when former president Ho Chi
Minh paid a historic visit to this country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides would also sign accords on maritime
transportation, recycling credit of 1.5 million U.S. dollars to
Hanoi in rupee equivalent and cooperation between diplomatic
services institutions, Tam said.
</P>
<P>
Luong, who will lead a high-power delegation including Deputy
Prime Minister Pham Gia Khiem, Defense Minister Pham Van Tra and
seven other ministers, will hold wide-ranging discussions with
Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan and Prime Minister Atal
Biheri Vajpayee on regional and international issues of mutual
concern, reliable sources here said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Vietnamese envoy, Hanoi is keen to buy smaller
warships from India but is yet to clinch a deal as the price
offered by New Delhi does not suit Hanoi's pocket.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance which is heavily in India's favor should
improve as Hanoi was simplifying its procedures for imports and
exports and encouraging direct contact with businessmen and
industrialists, he said.
</P>
<P>
While India's exports to Vietnam including medicines and
pharmaceutical goods, chemicals, spares for railways, sugar
factories, defense equipment and machinery stood at 130 million
dollars this year, imports from Hanoi were a mere 20 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tam said his country would like to export to India anthracite
coal, crude oil, raw silk, electronic equipment and fine arts
material.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Women Face Higher Risk of AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of Kenyan women
dying of AIDS is higher than that of men, said a professor from
University of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Professor Joseph Mungai told the on-going symposium for the
Members of Parliament on Saturday in Mombasa, a port city in
southeastern Kenya, that available statistics show there are more
school girls suffering from AIDS than boys.
</P>
<P>
Mungai said more girls were HIV/ AIDS positive because they are
exposed to sex earlier than boys.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since boys took time to mature they also engaged
in sexual activities much later than girls, saying the girls are
sexually mature at the age of eight while boys mature by the age
of 10.
</P>
<P>
AIDS has been rampant in Kenya. There are about two million
Kenyans infected with AIDS virus. Since the first AIDS case found
in the country in 1984, so far 760,000 Kenyans have died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi on Thursday declared AIDS a
national disaster and announced emergency measures aimed at
controlling the disease.

<P>
KAMPALA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has bought a fleet of
ultra modern combat helicopters to increase its fighting capacity.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters, equipped with modern weaponry, are said to
have been supplied directly by the reputable military equipment
complex at Kazan, Russia, the New Vision newspaper reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The supplier has already shipped several Mil Mi-8MTV transport
helicopters to the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The new acquisitions are capable of off-loading 36 combat-ready
troops in less than two minutes in the thick of battle.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has been taking its security seriously and now buys
military equipment directly from suppliers without entertaining
the middlemen. This is regarded as a move to curb corruption.

<HEADLINE> Writethrough: ASEAN Informal Summit Opens in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Third Informal Summit of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) opened Sunday
in Manila with developing information technology (IT) and
strengthening regional cooperation topping the agenda.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, ASEAN leaders gave their seal of approval
to the initiative for fast-tracking the development of the ASEAN
information infrastructure (AII) at the conclusion of their
closed-door session with the IT private sector tasked with
studying the challenge.
</P>
<P>
Former Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo, who
led the private IT sector group for a 45-minute meeting with the
ASEAN leaders, said ASEAN leaders place high priority on the
creation of the AII.
</P>
<P>
"They recognize that information technology is the key to
success of ASEAN in the 21st century," Romulo told media after the
ASEAN-IT dialogue.
</P>
<P>
During the dialogue, representatives from the world's leading
IT companies presented a white paper which surveyed the state and
the promise of IT in Southeast Asia and outlined a plan on how the
public and private sectors can work together in building the AII,
also dubbed the Asean Millennium Initiative.
</P>
<P>
"Our white paper has identified the policy and regulatory
issues that must be addressed. We look to our leaders to help us
prepare ourselves and our communities and nations for the global
economy of the 21st century," Romulo said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting with leaders on the AII raised to the highest level
a process that began with the Hanoi Declaration of 1998.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN economic ministers followed up by establishing an ASEAN
Working Group on the AII, which was tasked to define the vision
for the AII and draft the roadmap for its realization. One of the
key recommendations of the working group was the creation of an
E-Asean community.
</P>
<P>
The E-Asean is expected to enhance political, economic, social
and cultural links between the people and governments of the
region, provide potential investors and tourists with easy access
to ASEAN; and open opportunities for collaborative projects to
develop within ASEAN and with business and research institutes
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said in the
opening ceremonies of the summit that the meeting will bridge the
past and the future as the leaders will discuss political,
economic, social and security issues facing the group.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also extended his special welcome to Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid, Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Hun
Sen on their first participation in an ASEAN summit.
</P>
<P>
He said in his welcome remarks that Cambodia's attendance is
particularly meaningful since this is the first time "our
Cambodian brothers are attending an ASEAN summit as full member."
</P>
<P>
The Philippine president said the summit is a bridge which will
"help link the two sides of three divides, namely, those of the
past and the future, of experience and vision, and of promise and
fulfillment."
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the major experience ASEAN learned
from the past is that "cooperation among the member countries must
be comprehensive."
</P>
<P>
"Greater economic cooperation should lead to and accompany
deeper and broader cooperation on matters of peace and security,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
To transform ASEAN into a true community of Southeast Asian
nations, said Estrada, more openness is needed among ASEAN members
as well as between ASEAN and its Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said that the considerable resources and assistance
committed by Japan and China have helped contain the Asian
financial crisis, mitigate its adverse impacts, and facilitate
economic recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
He urged all ASEAN leaders to work harder to realize the dream
of "an East Asian common market."
</P>
<P>
Except Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad, who is
unable to attend the summit because of his nation's election on
Monday, heads of state or government of all the other nine ASEAN
member countries were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is the third ASEAN country to host the ASEAN
Informal Summit. The first such summit was held in Jakarta on
November 30, 1996 while the second in Kuala Lumpur on December
15-16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the Fifth ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in 1995, ASEAN leaders
agreed to meet informally every year between two formal summits,
which are held every three years.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1967, ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and
Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Opposes Establishment of Islamic Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Egyptian official has
reiterated the government's opposition to the establishment of
Islamic parties in the country, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government is opposed to the formation of
political parties on a religious basis, Osman el-Baz, political
advisor for President Hosni Mubarak, told a symposium late Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It is not wise to form political parties which are based on
religion," el-Baz was quoted as saying by the pro-government
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Former Islamic radicals of Egypt's two most militant groups,
al-Gamma al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, and al-Jihad
al-Islami, the Muslim Holy Warriors, asked the government last
October to allow them to set up a political party which they said
will peacefully advocate Islamic principles. El-Baz's remarks have
sent them a clear message.
</P>
<P>
The government has rejected a previous, similar request from a
less-radical group on the grounds that its political agenda
resembled that of existing parties.
</P>
<P>
"There is a national consensus that establishing parties on
religious basis would lead to negative results that may damage
national unity," el-Baz said.
</P>
<P>
The prevention of religion-based parties is not seen by any of
the existing political parties as a deficiency in the current
political system, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government has been cracking down on Islamic
militants who began an insurgency in 1992 to topple the secular
government and install a strict Islamic rule. The government has
also banned Islamic groups from carrying out political activities
for fear that they will shake its secular basis.

<HEADLINE> Voters Enthusiastic With HK's District Council Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- "It's a Hong Kong citizen's
duty to join in the election," said Tsai Teh Bei, an 80-year-old
Hong Kong resident, who was the first arriving at the Queen's
College polling station in downtown Wanchai to cast his ballot in
Hong Kong's first District Councils election.
</P>
<P>
"Electors are well acquainted with the candidates thanks to the
government's efforts in promoting the election," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
Tsai waited at the entrance of the polling station before the
polling started at 7:30 on Sunday morning. He belongs to the Tai
Hang Constituency of downtown Wanchai District.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased to have this opportunity to cast my ballot to
elect district councilors who are truly representative and will
fight for our best interest," a retired accountant in his late
fifties who was unwilling to identify himself told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The polling station at the Queen's College has some 10-odd
polling officers and assistants. Four separate voting compartments
enclosed with white cloth are set up in the polling hall and three
ballot boxes are located by the exit.
</P>
<P>
"The voting procedure is simple," said a polling officer. "Each
voter will get a ballot paper from the polling staff, mark the
ballot, and then put the paper into the ballot box."
</P>
<P>
"As the ballot is secret, no one is allowed to enter a polling
station during poll hours," said the officer, noting that no
canvassing zone and no stay zone are designated in the vicinity of
the station to ensure voters can make their choice without any
interference.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, a chop is introduced to replace a pen to
mark a ballot. Voters just need to stamp a "tick" in the circle
next to the name of the candidate of his choice.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Affairs Commission announced on Friday that there
are some 2.28 million registered electors, who would cast their
votes at 432 polling stations throughout Hong Kong that are open
for 15 hours on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The nominations for District Councils election started on
October 7, and by the end of the two-week nomination period, a
total 798 candidates were verified to have been validly nominated.
In the election, 76 candidates have already been returned
unopposed, and 722 will compete for 314 seats in 18 Districts
Councils, according to the commission.
</P>
<P>
"People in Hong Kong became more interested in participating in
government affairs after Hong Kong's return," said Lee, an elector
at the polling station at the Precious Blood Primary School.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who has lived in Hong Kong for 42 years, said, "Democracy
in Hong Kong is improving, especially after the return of Hong
Kong to the motherland, which is our strong support."
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, many of my neighbors and colleagues will
come to vote," said Lee, a businessman in his sixties who had
attended a number of elections in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
About 9,500 civil servants from various departments have been
geared up to offer necessary help to electors and to count ballot
papers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the public can help make electoral activities fair,
open and honest," said Justice Woo Kwok Hing, chairman of the
Electoral Affairs Commission, after casting his ballot early in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
Mutual monitoring among candidates and their campaign
assistants will ensure that everybody obeys the rules of the game
and competes fairly, Woo said.
</P>
<P>
The commission has received 560 complaints about breaches of
its guidelines, including 155 about election advertisements, 91
about electioneering in private premises and 87 false statements,
according to Woo.

<P>
HONG KONG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Over 2.28 million registered
electors throughout Hong Kong started to cast their votes in the
first District Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
This was the first District Councils election that has ever
been held in Hong Kong since China resumed the exercise of its
sovereignty over it, making it an SAR on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Noting the views collected during a public consultation
exercise on the review of the municipal councils and district
boards in June and July 1998, the SAR government decided that the
structure for delivery of municipal services should be overhauled
after the terms of office of the members of the Provisional
Municipal Councils expire by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The District Administration Scheme commenced in 1982 with the
establishment of a District Board and a District Management
Committee in each district.
</P>
<P>
From July 1, 1997, 18 Provisional District Boards, with 469
members appointed by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, replaced the
former District Boards.
</P>
<P>
The majority of people have favored retaining the District
Boards. It was believed that the boards should be kept and renamed
"District Councils" when their members' terms of office expire on
December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
It was also believed that the new District Councils should be
given extra resources and responsibilities to enhance their role
in advising on food and environmental hygiene and organizing and
subsidizing cultural and recreational activities at the district
level.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Council adopted a bill on the development of
District Councils on March 11, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the first District Councils election of the
HKSAR will be held in November with the number of elected members
to be determined on the basis of one elected seat per 17,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates that a District Council will be established
for each of the 18 districts to replace the corresponding
Provisional District Boards.

<P>
The main function of the District Council is to advise the
government on matters affecting the well-being of the people in
the district, the provision and use of public facilities and
services within the district, and the adequacy and priorities of
the government programs for the district.
</P>
<P>
The council is also to advise the government on matters
relating to the use of public funds allocated to the district for
local public works and community activities and matters relating
to food and environmental hygiene services.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, a District Council is to be composed of
3 categories of members, namely, elected members, ex-officio
members and appointed members.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Council meeting had a heated debate on the
number of elected seats. The total number of elected seats was
increased from 346 before 1997 to 390.
</P>
<P>
For the first term of District Council members, there will be a
total 519 members, comprising 390 elected members, 102 appointed
members and 27 ex-officio members.
</P>
<P>
The new District Councils will have a four-year term starting
from January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
On June 2, 1999, the Hong Kong Electoral Affairs Commission
laid down a regulation on the procedure for the District Councils
election, including the publication of a voter register, the
nomination of candidates, polling arrangements and the counting of
ballots.
</P>
<P>
The regulation was drawn up after the commission considered all
the public views received during a public consultation exercise on
its proposed electoral guidelines between April 12 and May 11,
1999.
</P>
<P>
On June 3, 1999, Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa announced the
SAR's first District Councils election would be held on November
28.

<P>
There are 390 constituencies in 18 districts to return a total
of 390 District Council members, and more than 2.83 million
electors were informed of the address of their designated polling
station near their home.
</P>
<P>
The nominations for District Councils election started on
October 7, 1999, and by the end of the two-week nomination period,
a total 798 candidates were verified to have been validly
nominated. Candidates in 76 of the 390 constituencies have been
returned unopposed. As a result, polling will be conducted in 314
constituencies which have an electorate of about 2.28 million.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the District Councils election is run in a clean and
fair manner, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC)
of Hong Kong has organized a series of educational and publicity
activities to enhance public knowledge and understanding of the
Corrupt and Illegal Practices Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
The Registration and Electoral Office has produced leaflets
containing the photographs, personal particulars and platforms of
the candidates. Every elector was sent a leaflet so that they
could know more about the candidates in their own constituency.
</P>
<P>
A 24-hour hotline was put into service for members of the
public to listen to the platforms of the candidates. A poll card,
a map of a designated polling station and a voting guide were sent
to every elector in the second week of November.
</P>
<P>
Radio and TV commercials, advertisements, posters and the
Internet were also used to highlight the importance of clean
elections.
</P>
<P>
The ICAC, the Registration and Electoral Office and the Police
had established a referral system to ensure that different types
of complaints in relation to the election would be dealt with
expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
Voting is made as simple as possible and chops bearing the mark
of a "tick" is provided at every polling station for electors to
mark their ballot papers. In light of public concern about the
privacy of personal data, address and constituency of an elector
was not published for public inspection. Their identity card
numbers and sex were not made public.
</P>
<P>
The "first past the post" voting system (the candidates who
receives the greatest number of votes will be elected) and a new
voting method was adopted.
</P>
<P>
The results of the District Councils election will be gazetted
on December 3.

<HEADLINE> China Starts to Make Pottery 9,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The history of Chinese pottery-
making may date back as far as 9,000 years, rather than the 8,000
years as Chinese archaeologists formerly believed.
</P>
<P>
Researchers with the archeological department in Beijing
University used carbon dating tests to determine that the 921
pottery items excavated from Zhenpiyan Ruins belonging to the
Neolithic Age (10,000 to 4,000 years ago) are the country's oldest
examples of pottery.
</P>
<P>
The site is located in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region. Prior to this, pottery relics from the
Peiligang Ruins in Henan Province of central China were believed
to be the earliest.
</P>
<P>
The find has stirred up debate among the archeological circle
in China, because many believe that Chinese pottery originated in
the country's culturally-advanced central region.
</P>
<P>
The Zhenpiyan pottery includes sculptured figures with strong
aboriginal features. The thickest clay figurine measures 2.5
centimeters and the thinnest 0.3 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the clay from cracking during firing, ancient
Chinese blended in quartz particles for added strength, according
to Tan Fasheng, a local archeologist.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Guilin, in the far southwestern region of the
country, where the Zhenpiyan Ruins are located, only a few
primitive human records have been verified.
</P>
<P>
However, archeological research in the southern region of China
in recent years has come to suggest that the cultural development
level there was far beyond current experts' realization.
</P>
<P>
Four large kiln workshop relics dating back 2,500 years were
recently unearthed in south China's Guangdong Province. They
occupy a total floor space of 100,000 sq.m. and the roofs were
built of tiles, which was the earliest use of the material in
construction found in the region.
</P>
<P>
A large assortment of bronze weapons and pottery dug out from
the kilns show a relatively high pottery-making craft. They are of
important archeological value in the study of production standards
and human society in southern China during the Spring and Autumn
and the Warring States periods.

<HEADLINE> First-Year Diet Can Influence Children's Height </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Breast feeding and a balanced
diet will help children to grow healthily and taller, according to
recent surveys.
</P>
<P>
Breast feeding, the mother's care, and family income are all
factors affecting children's height in their first and second year,
said Liu Shunian, a researcher of child nutrition and health in
north China's Tianjin Municipality.
</P>
<P>
He said that breast feeding in the first four to six months
will satisfy babies' need for nutrition and calories, while water
and other intakes may cause diarrhea and affect their growth.
</P>
<P>
And babies need meat and vegetables along with rice, and flour-
based food six months later, as rice and flour alone cannot
provide children with the necessary calories, zinc, and iron
elements necessary for healthy growth.
</P>
<P>
However, surveys show that an intake of ten percent more meat
during the 18 to 24 month period can increase children's height by
2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
A survey on children's health in seven Chinese cities showed
that overall Chinese children are growing taller with each passing
decade.

<HEADLINE> Expert: Concept of Aging Changing in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Though people over 60 were
traditionally thought to be close to the tomb in China decades ago,
today many people 60 and over don't consider themselves old, as
experts at a symposium held recently in Beijing pointed out.
</P>
<P>
People's psychological attitudes toward aging have changed
greatly, Gu Danian of the Demography Institute at Beijing
University told the gathering.
</P>
<P>
A survey carried out among people between 40 to 90 shows that
22.7 percent of men and 19.5 percent of women in this age group
said they do not feel old.
</P>
<P>
More older people in Beijing are now attending colleges
including single elders perhaps looking to remarry. Gu said that
many people don't think of themselves as elders even though they
are over 60.
</P>
<P>
Gu believes that it is more scientific to define the aging
population as people over 65 in China.
</P>
<P>
"The new definition will help improve the quality life for
older people and optimize society's human resources," Gu said.
</P>
<P>
It is also possible to adjust the current system of retirement
to allow more elders to continue working if they want and their
health permits, especially those engaged in scientific and
research work, Gu said.
</P>
<P>
The life expectancy for Chinese was 35 before the founding of
new China in 1949, and in 1996 the figure reached 68 for men and
73 for women. Some experts predict that the life expectancy for
Chinese men and women will reach 70 and 74 respectively by the
year 2010, reminding elders that positive attitudes can prolong
life.
</P>
<P>
By this October, the Chinese population over 60 years of age
had reached 126 million, 10 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
According to UN sources, today, one in every 10 people in the
world is 60 or over. Twenty years from now, this figure will be
one in every eight. And by 2150, every third person on the planet
will be over 60 years old.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Leaders Dialogue With I.T. Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) had dialogues here Sunday with
leaders of the information technology (IT) sector to discuss
measures on implementing a Southeast E-Community (E-Asean) and
priming the region's potential as the world's telecommunications
and IT hub.
</P>
<P>
Former foreign affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo, who heads the
private IT sector group meeting with the ASEAN leaders, said the
meeting marked the first time that ASEAN met with the captains of
the industry in the region to discuss IT development and the
setting up of an ASEAN Information Infrastructure (AII).
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN comprises the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
During the 45-minute dialogue, representatives from the world's
leading IT companies presented a white paper outlining their
findings and recommendations on how ASEAN can continue to become a
magnet of IT investments and speed up the implementation of its
AII, also dubbed the Asean Millennium Initiative.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, the AII can foster economic
development in various ASEAN countries and serve the cause of
lifelong learning as well as strengthening national and regional
resilience.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the AII can also facilitate technology transfer
among ASEAN members and help promote regional peace and security
through the development of the new broadband network and other new
information technologies.
</P>
<P>
In sum, the AII would become the apparatus to "raise standards
of living and to promote human development in all its dimensions,
so as to enable the people of ASEAN to have the fullest
opportunity to realize their potentials as envisioned in the Hanoi
Declaration of 1998," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the AII will be a combination of all
national Information Infrastructures of the ASEAN countries with a
specific regional content. It will link ASEAN member national
information infrastructures, thereby creating a platform for a
Southeast Asian e-community.
</P>
<P>
The AII will also be another gateway that will tie Southeast
Asia to the Asia Pacific Information Infrastructure and the Global
Information Infrastructure, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the governments can speed up the development of
the AII by establishing and maintaining a policy environment that
promotes competition in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
The IT companies urged ASEAN nations to ensure open and
universal access of information infrastructures which mean
interconnecting network service at the national, sub-regional,
regional and global level and providing information services to
all sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested the governments promote competition in
telecommunication equipment, services and networks to stimulate
the development of information infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
The private sector recommendations presented to the ASEAN
Leaders were developed by a core group from the IT industry that
has been meeting since early this year to examine the state of IT
deployment and use in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The members of the private-sector core group include
representatives from IBM, Oracle, Cisco Systems, Ericson, Arthur
Andersen, Connect! of Singapore and the Philippines' PLDT System
Standards Inc.
</P>
<P>
During last year's Informal Summit in Hanoi, the Asean leaders
approved the implementation of the AII, which aims to create the
E-ASEAN by linking the national information infrastructures of
member-economies, Romulo said.
</P>
<P>
The E-Asean is expected to enhance political, economic, social
and cultural links between the people and governments of the
region, provide potential investors and tourists easy access to
ASEAN; and open opportunities for collaborative projects to
develop within ASEAN and with business and research institutes
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN has laid out specific target dates for AII's
implementation. Its timetable calls for the development of
networks of science and technology centers of excellence by 2001.
</P>
<P>
By 2004, ASEAN is expected to have developed the content of its
information infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The regional grouping has created the E-ASEAN Task Force headed
by Romulo to help realize these objectives.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Robinson Sidelined with Cervical Spasms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- San Antonio Spurs star
center David Robinson finally has relented to the pain in his back
and is not playing tonight against the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
The Spurs announced that Robinson has cervical spasms where
his right shoulder blade meets his neck, saying they are hopeful
Robinson will not miss any more games. The team's next game is
Tuesday against Detroit. Without Robinson, the Spurs beat Denver
106-87 tonight.
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who teamed with forward Tim Duncan to lead the Spurs
to the NBA title last season, first was hurt Wednesday in a 121-98
victory at Boston. Late in the second quarter, Duncan came down
with an elbow on Robinson's neck.
</P>
<P>
The injury initially was diagnosed as a stinger and Robinson
returned in the second half. He started Friday's 101-78 win over
Chicago but left with neck spasms in the second quarter and did
not return.
</P>
<P>
Robinson teams with Duncan as San Antonio's "Twin Towers." He
is averaging 13.3 points and 8.7 rebounds per game -- both second
on the team to Duncan -- and his 3.1 blocks lead the club.
</P>
<P>
Named one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players in 1996, Robinson
entered this season with career averages of 24.4 points, 11.5
rebounds and 3.4 blocks in 685 games over 10 years. He missed all
but six games in the 1996-97 season with a broken foot and back
problems that required surgery.
</P>
<P>
Robinson was the top overall pick in the 1987 draft and was
NBA Rookie of the Year in 1990 after serving a two-year commitment
to the U.S. Navy. The eight-time All-Star was named Defensive
Player of the Year in 1992 and Most Valuable Player in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Robinson won the rebounding title in 1991 and led the league
in blocks in 1991 and 1992. In 1994, he scored 71 points in the
final game of the season to edge Shaquille O'Neal for his only
scoring title.

<HEADLINE> China's Helicopter Industry Welcomes Entry of WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China's lightweight helicopter
industry is expected to soar with the country's entry into the
World Trade Organization, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited Wang Jianqiu, general manager of China
National Helicopter Corp, as saying that China's accession to the
WTO will create a more favorable environment for the industry,
which has developed soundly during recent decades.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is creating a new plan for the helicopter
industry's development, which is expected to rely on expanded co-
operation with foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
China's helicopter industry is relatively backward, because it
began late when compared to developed countries, Wang said. China
has produced about 500 Z-5 models and is producing other types of
Z-series models, including its Z-11.
</P>
<P>
The country also formed a high-level research team, in charge
of designing and manufacturing new models.
</P>
<P>
"The country is now capable of producing 150 models a year,
while the demand for non-military purposes is nearly zero," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He expects the use for non-military purposes will increase
dramatically following China's WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
China has maintained close relations with foreign helicopter
companies. It has, together with France and Singapore, jointly
developed the EC120 helicopter beginning in 1992, he said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also quoted its source with China National Aero-
technolgoical Import and Export Corp. as saying that the EC120
program was the first project during which China shared investment
and other risks with foreign partners in helicopter production.

<HEADLINE> China's Gold Miners Hit by Price Fluctuations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province in east
China, which produces 25 percent of China's gold, is being heavily
affected by price fluctuations on the world gold market, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China has been able to produce more than 150 tons of gold in
recent years, making it the fifth-largest gold producer in the
world even though the gold industry is still tightly controlled by
the central government.
</P>
<P>
However, the price fluctuations reduced income to Shandong's
gold miners by about 1 billion yuan per year. About 90 percent of
its gold enterprises fell into great difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The State purchases gold at prices set by the People's Bank of
China and sells to gold processing enterprises also at fixed
prices. To support the gold industry , the State increased the
gold purchase price from 48 yuan (5.78 U.S. dollars) to 96.48 yuan
(11.62 U.S. dollars) per gram in 1993. However, the bank has
reduced prices seven times since 1997 in response to fluctuations
on the international market, with a total 25 percent price
decrease.
</P>
<P>
The world gold market suffered the lowest prices in July since
1970. It, however, climbed by 27.8 percent between September and
October. In China, the gold prices increased from 69.6 yuan to 85.
2 yuan per gram in October.
</P>
<P>
The industry is placing emphasis on the development of non-gold
sectors in the province. It has set up more than 300 enterprises
engaged in the manufacturing of machinery, electronics and
building materials as well as hotel business.

BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Personal savings deposits held
in foreign currencies in China's banks have increased steadily
during the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
Individual foreign exchange deposits at the Bank of China were
valued at 30.5 billion U.S. dollars by the end of October, a 6.3
billion U.S. dollars increase over the same period of last year,
an official from the bank said.

official said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange deposits are expected to continue the strong
growth momentum in months to come.
</P>
<P>
The growth stems from many factors, analysts said, including an
increase in the US dollar interest rates relative to the Renminbi,
sentiment strengthening the US dollar and the recently implemented

<HEADLINE> China's Steel City Takes Strong Reform Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China's renowned "steel city"
Anshan is striving to become a flagship for state-owned enterprise
reform as it works to re-invent itself through diversifying
economies and refurbishing infrastructure, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
People in the city discuss two major topics now: pollution
treatment and layoff, while the words: steel and devotion, were
mostly talked of before the 1980s, said Li Huailiang, party
secretary of Anshan.
</P>
<P>
Like the country's other traditional industrial cities, two-
decades of reform has diminished some of Anshan's former glory and
has exposed the city's deep-rooted problems resulting from the
planned economy.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the old steel town plans to invest 1.17 billion
yuan for a facelift of public utilities and infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
The city has the country's largest steel maker, the Anshan
Steel and Iron Corp (Angang), which employs 100,000 employees. It
has contributed 60 billion yuan to the country in the past five
decades. However, the State-owned giant currently suffers a loss
of more than 9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Angang has cut its employees from 180,000 in 1995 to 100,000
this year and will cut more to 70,000 in five years. The laid-offs
are expected to be diverted to other businesses under a re-
employment program.

</P>
<P>
The entire increase in the reserves was due to the growth in

NEW DELHI, November 28 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate
continued its upward trend for the sixth consecutive week to touch
3.12 percent for the week ended on November 13, despite a marginal
fall in the wholesale Price Index (WPI).
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve bank of India, the annual rate of
inflation, based on WPI, recorded a 0.11 percentage points
increase to 3.12 percent as against 3.01 percent in the previous
week and a high of 8.61 percent during the corresponding week of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate of over three percent was recorded on June 5
this year at 3.53 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lower rate of inflation during the most part of the current
year is mainly on account of a comparison with a higher base last
year when prices of vegetables had risen abnormally following the
shortfall in agricultural production.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- New York Knicks forward
Larry Johnson, one of the most durable players over the last
decade, today was placed on the injured list with a pinched nerve
in his back.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks, who evened their record at 7-7 following a 99-96
triumph over Orlando this afternoon, are already without starting
center Patrick Ewing and forward Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
They will have to make due without Johnson for at least the
next five games and possibly longer. Johnson missed two games in
early November with the injury and has sat out the last three
before being placed on the injured list today.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of their three big men, New York turned the
offense over to Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell, who combined
for 60 points in today's victory.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Johnson has made eight starts for the Knicks
this season, averaging 11.8 points, 7.9 rebounds and 3.3 assists
per game. He opened the season with 24 points in a win over the
Cleveland Cavaliers but the career 49 percent shooter had been
held to 45 percent this season due to the injury.

<HEADLINE> Argentina to Ask Rich WTO Members to Stop Subsidizing Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Argentina will ask
industrialized countries to stop subsidizing agriculture at the
forthcoming meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
according to sources of the Argentine agricultural sector on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Subsidies to agriculture in rich WTO countries, especially in
Europe, damage the exports from developing nations, where
agriculture carries great weight in their economy, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture and services are on the agenda of the third WTO
Ministerial Conference, the so-called "Round of the Millennium,"
to be held from November 30 to December 3 in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Argentine president-elect Fernando de la Rua voiced objections
to subsidies to agriculture in the European Union during his
recent visit to France.
</P>
<P>
Argentina is one of the world's main producers of wheat, corn
and other cereal products.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's exports of agricultural products during the first
nine months of this year amounted to 10.48 billion U.S. dollars, a
13 percent of drop compared to the same period of 1998, according
to a spokesman of the sector.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Leaders Discuss Regional Cooperation in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Sunday in the opening of the Third ASEAN (Association
of Southeast Asian Nations) Informal Summit that the meeting will
bridge the past and the future as the leaders will discuss
political, economic, social and security issues facing the group.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremonies, Estrada extended his special welcome
to Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, Cambodian Prime
Minister Samdech Hun Sen "on their first participation in an ASEAN
summit."
</P>
<P>
He said in his welcome speech that Cambodia's attendance is
particularly meaningful since this is the first time "our
Cambodian brothers are attending an ASEAN summit as full member."
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said the summit is a bridge which will "help
link the two sides of three divides, namely, those of the past and
the future, of experience and vision, and of promise and
fulfillment."
</P>
<P>
In the last four decades, Southeast Asian has turned from a
region of states "so close yet so far from one another" to an
integral part of the global village, said the president.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the major experience ASEAN learned
from the past is that "cooperation among the member countries must
be comprehensive."
</P>
<P>
"Greater economic cooperation should lead to and accompany
deeper and broader cooperation on matters of peace and security,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
To transform ASEAN into a true community of Southeast Asian
nations, said Estrada, more openness is needed among ASEAN members
as well as between ASEAN and its Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the considerable resources and assistance
committed by Japan and China have helped contain the Asian
financial crisis, mitigate its adverse impacts, and facilitate
economic recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
He urged all ASEAN leaders to work harder to realize the dream
of "an East Asian common market. One East Asian currency. And on
East Asian community -- a family from happy union of the north and
south."
</P>
<P>
"The informal summit will be about a forward-looking ASEAN
community determined to work more closely together for the
achievement of economic and financial resurgence, and for ensuring
future competitiveness, without losing sight of the need to
address social issues with appropriate and adequate social safety
nets," Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon told reporters
on the eve of the summit.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN leaders will also discuss the developments over the past
year, with regard to regional cooperation, particularly the
progress of economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The regional environmental and security issues are also top on
the meeting's agenda.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day meeting, ASEAN leaders are expected to have
a dialogue with representatives of the information technology
sector.
</P>
<P>
Except Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad, who is
unable to attend the summit because of his nation's election,
heads of states or government of other nine ASEAN member countries
were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was represented by Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, ASEAN leaders will issue a joint
statement for East Asia cooperation containing the framework for
enhancing cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement envisions a heightening of political,
economic financial, social and cultural collaboration among East
Asian countries, including such areas as social safety nets,
science and technology, human resources development,
people-to-people exchange, as well as dialogues on regional
economic and financial issues.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is the third ASEAN country to host the ASEAN
Informal Summit. The first informal summit was held in Jakarta on
November 30, 1996 while the second in Kuala Lumpur on December
15-16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the Fifth ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in 1995, ASEAN leaders
agreed to meet informally every year between two formal summits,
which are held every three years.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1967, ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN nations came together with three main objectives in
mind: to promote the economic, social and cultural development of
the region through cooperative programs; to safeguard the
political and economic stability of the region against big power
rivalry; and to serve as a forum for the resolution of
intra-regional differences.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Rebel Leader Reiterates Terms for peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebel leader
Velupillai Prabhakaran on Saturday reiterated the terms for peace
talks to end the long-running ethnic conflict, said reports
reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Prabhakaran of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) called
on the government to de-escalate the armed conflict and initiate
peace talks under "conditions of normalcy" for a negotiated
political settlement of the ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
In his Heroes' Week message broadcast live over the clandestine
Voice of Tigers Saturday evening, Prabhakaran said the peace talks
would be held in a cordial atmosphere of mutual trust with the
assistance of international third party mediation.
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that talks should be held in the "absence of
economic blockades."
</P>
<P>
The LTTE ended its Heroes' Week remembrance celebrations on
Saturday with a speech by Prabhakaran who turned 45 on Friday and
ordered as a goodwill gesture the release of seven soldiers held
by them.
</P>
<P>
Prabhakaran recalled that in the Heroes' Week message last
year, he had called for a third party mediation and emphasized the
necessity of creating certain "objective conditions conducive for
peace talks."
</P>
<P>
The LTTE chief said the government refused to accept their
proposal for creating a congenial peaceful atmosphere for peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE did not want to engage in a negotiating process with
conditions and time frames, he said, adding that they had not
abandoned the path of peace.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from the government who has
been actively engaged in the campaigning for the reelection of
President Chandrika Kumaratunga in the presidential elections on
December 21.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has said the doors are open for talks if
the LTTE rebels agree to lay down their arms, give up their demand
for a separate homeland and accept a timeframe for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that there was a gap between the LTTE
position of the need for an active mediator and government's
readiness to consider the possibility of a third party solely to
facilitate talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old war between the
majority Sinhalese dominated government troops and the LTTE rebels
who have been fighting for a separate state in the north and east
of the country.

<HEADLINE> China to Have World-Class Weather Radar System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 28 (Xinhua) -- China will install a national
weather radar system in five years to improve the accuracy of
weather forecasting, according to officials with the China
Meteorological Administration.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments will allocate a total of 2
billion yuan to install over 90 Doppler radar units near flood-
prone rivers and lakes and in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
So far, 38 radar units have been installed in Shanghai and east
China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Hunan Province, a province severely affected
by last year's flooding of the Yangtze River, radar will be
installed at a cost of 60 million yuan, and these units will be
connected with 48 meteorological stations and 14 ground control
devices.
</P>
<P>
The province's weather officials expect the radar's ability to
provide early warnings for thunderstorms, hail and tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
Disastrous weather causes 15.3 billion yuan of economic losses
to the agricultural province annually.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the Doppler weather radar system uses the
world's most advanced technology to provide continuous data on the
atmosphere, and can save 40 percent more in economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
China began to work with the U.S. Lockheed Martin Corp. to
develop this technology in 1996 when the first unit was produced
and installed in Shanghai. The new generation of the product,
called the Cinrad Doppler radar, is now ready and will be used as
part of the national meteorological system.

HANGZHOU, November 28 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province will complete construction of 1,000-km of high quality
coastal dikes before the end of the year to cope with
thunderstorms and tidal waves.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the coastal province is hit by several storms and
typhoons, causing heavy casualties and property losses.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, typhoon Number 11, or Typhoon Winnie as it was called,
damaged hundreds of kilometers of coastal dikes killing thousands
of people and causing direct economic losses exceeding 30 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government decided to build the 1,000-km of
dikes at a cost of 4 billion yuan after the 1997 typhoon., and
these dikes are expected to be able to withstand the strongest
storms.

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibition on Macao Opens in Toronto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Chinese Canadians
Saturday gathered at First Markham, Toronto, for the opening of a
photo exhibition marking the return of Macao to China on December
20.
</P>
<P>
Cutting the ribbon at the opening ceremony were Chinese Consul
General in Toronto Zhou Xingbao, Canadian Minister for
International Cooperation Maria Minna, Councilor of Markham Alex
Chiu and Chairman of the Chinese Cultural Center of Greater
Toronto Ming-Tat Cheung.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Prof. Boon Cham, chairman of the
Organizing Committee for Celebrating the Return of Macao to China,
said overseas Chinese are proud and happy to see the return of
Macao to China, two years after the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Canadians, who benefit from China's enhanced status in
the world, also look forward to the reunification of Taiwan with
the mainland in the near future, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Consul General told the gathering that in 23 days,
China will resume exercise of sovereignty over Macao, which is
another victory of the theory of "one country, two systems"
initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
With the return of Macao, China is ever closer to its final
reunification, he said, adding that Lee Teng-hui's "two states"
fallacy is bound to fail.
</P>
<P>
Congratulating China on Macao's home-coming, the Canadian
Minister said that no country in the world today should be allowed
to colonize others.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the Sino-Canadian agreement signed on Friday on China's
accession to the World Trade Organization, she hoped for even
better ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
More than a hundred photos featuring the history of Macao and
events in the process of its upcoming hand-over to China are on
display at the exhibition, which will last till December 19 in
Toronto, where about 10,000 Canadians of Chinese descent from
Macao live.

<HEADLINE> Peru, Colombia to Determine Ownership of Amazon Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Peru and Colombia will hold a
second meeting in December to determine the ownership of three
islands in the Amazon River, a Peruvian Foreign Ministry source
said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Peruvian technical commission will go to Bogota to hold talks
with its Colombian counterpart from December 13 to 15.
</P>
<P>
Two documents will be presented at the meeting: the joint
edition of the hydrological survey of the Amazon River and the
respective technical glossary.
</P>
<P>
The two documents are jointly drafted by technicians of the two
countries in compliance with an agreement reached by the two
commissions at the first meeting held November 15-17 in Lima.
</P>
<P>
The two commissions hope to complete their tasks as soon as
possible so as to present their report to their respective foreign
ministries and define the situation of the three islands, located
some 300 kilometers east of Iquitos, the capital of the Peruvian
department of Loreto.
</P>
<P>
The islands -- Patrullero, Vamos and Korea, covering an area of
five, seven and 18 square kilometers respectively, came into being
in the last decade when the Amazon River changed its course,
during which two other islands (Zancudo I and Zancudo II)
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The Limits and River Navigation Treaty of 1922 signed by both
countries delimited the border and established that seven of the
13 islands that existed then belonged to Peru and six to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Zancudo I, Tigre, Coto, Serra, Yauma, Chinero and Cacao were
assigned to Peruvian sovereignty, and the Colombian jurisdiction
extended to Zancudo II, Loreto Yacu, Santa Sofia, Arara, Rienda
and Leticia.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Growing in Rubyland Encouraged in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities are
encouraging local entrepreneurs to grow coffee in Mogok, which is
also known as the country's rubyland in northern Mandalay
division, in the wake of no-longer prosperous traditional gem
mining business there.
</P>
<P>
Mogok, situated on a plateau at 1,140 meters above sea level,
is recommended as an area next to Pyin Oo Lwin in the same
division to grow coffee as well as tea for its good forest,
fertile soil and availability of sufficient amount of water.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that local people in Mogok are paying more
attention to growing coffee rather than gem mining as it used to
be.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the state-run Myanmar Farm Enterprise,
in fiscal 1998-99 which ended in March, a total of 43.3 hectares
of coffee was grown in the region.
</P>
<P>
The total cultivated area of Mogok is only about 3.4 percent of
its total land area where there is 9,517.5 hectares of virgin
land.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is also striving to turn Pyin Oo Lwin region
in the same division into a coffee growing one where arable land
has been found for the move and the authorities have allotted
1,912 hectares of reclaimed land in the region to thousands of
local private growers for coffee cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is one of Myanmar's main crops. In the past three years,
 Its annual cultivated area was registered as 5,670 hectares and
its annual production of coffee beans was nearly 2,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Army Killed 270,000 Chinese With Germs: Study (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 28 (Xinhua) -- In China, even a child can
tell you horrifying stories of the No. 731 unit of the invading
Japanese troops who in one case killed more than 3,000 Chinese
through "bacteriological experiments" during World War II.
</P>
<P>
This is merely the tip of the iceberg, however, as an in-depth
study by Chinese and Japanese scholars shows that at least 270,000
Chinese soldiers and civilians were slaughtered by Japanese germ-
warfare troops between 1933 and 1945.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scholars, including Guo Chengzhou and Liao Yingchang
from the Academy of Medical Sciences attached to the Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA), put the figure at more than 270,
000, but some Japanese experts believe the total is no less than
the number of people killed in the Nanjing Massacre, in which at
least 300,000 Chinese died.
</P>
<P>
Though differing on the number of victims, both Chinese and
Japanese researchers agree that the germ-war waged by invading
Japanese army was on the largest scale the world has ever seen in
terms of duration, casualties, and impact.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have spent years seeking evidence from the
libraries and archives of the international courts that handled
the cases of Japanese war criminals, and interviewed victims of
the Japanese troops' bacterial operations and their relatives, as
well as former Japanese soldiers who participated in this atrocity.
</P>
<P>
Many articles and books have been published and a dozen
seminars and four international conferences have been held on this
issue. A group of Japanese investigators has visited China four
times to study this "bacteriological experiment war."
</P>
<P>
According to the researchers, Japanese troops who invaded China
between 1932 and 1945 set up a germ-warfare base in Wuchang County
in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province in 1933 and eventually
deployed five "bacteriological experimentation units" with a total
of over 20,000 men in the cities of Harbin, Changchun, Beijing,
Nanjing and Guangzhou.

<P>
A report delivered at a secret meeting held at the headquarters
of the invading Japanese troops in 1943 discloses that the "
bacteriological experimentation units" turned out 75 kilograms of
bacteria a month.
</P>
<P>
During the war, 20 Chinese provinces were attacked by these
Japanese units who spread deadly diseases including typhoid,
cholera, diarrhea fever, anthrax, lockjaw and gangrene.
</P>
<P>
Wang Laiyong, 64, is one of five victims from Yiwu in east
China's Zhejiang Province who survived the "bacteriological
experiment" conducted by Japanese troops in October 1942.
</P>
<P>
Japanese aircraft arrived and sprayed something like a white
fog in the air above Wang's village. Shortly afterwards, many rats
were found dead, followed by many villagers who fell ill, vomiting
foam and blood. This lethal operation killed 386 villagers,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese survivors and victims' relatives as well as many
Japanese soldiers now remember this germ-warfare as a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the "Japanese experimentation units" have
helped investigators collect evidence and find witnesses to these
deadly operations that caused such wide-spread epidemic diseases
and killed so many people.
</P>
<P>
Some former Japanese soldiers who were involved in these
genocidal activities have made special trips to China to offer
their apologies for what they did during those unforgettable years.

<HEADLINE> Sunderland Enter Top Three at Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Sunderland, which was promoted
to the premier league this season, moved into third place after a
3-2 win at struggling Watford on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A 70th minute goal from Gavin McCann sealed victory for the
north-east club who dislodged Arsenal from third.
</P>
<P>
Sunderland have 31 points from 16 matches, just one point
behind second-placed Leeds United and two points behind leaders
Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
The European Cup winners play Brazil's Palmeiras for the world
club title on Tuesday in Tokyo. Leeds face Southampton at home on
Sunday while Arsenal are in action at home against Derby County.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool missed an opportunity to put pressure on the top
three after a 1-0 defeat at West Ham United. Liverpool had gone
into the game having won four of their previous five games.
</P>
<P>
But Leicester City moved into the top five after a 1-0 defeat
of Coventry City.
</P>
<P>
Sunderland striker Kevin Phillips played a major part in
punishing his former club Watford, also promoted last season.
</P>
<P>
After Watford had taken a surprise lead in the fourth minute
with a goal from Michel Ngonge, Phillips had a hand in the
Sunderland equalizer in the 24th minute when his shot was
deflected into the net by Robert Page.
</P>
<P>
The goal was given as an own goal but Phillips got on the
score sheet nine minutes later with a header to put Sunderland 2-1
ahead at the break.
</P>
<P>
After Watford equalized with a Richard Johnson penalty early
in the second half, McCann then struck the crucial winner.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Tottenham Spurs' French star David Ginola said Friday fewer
foreigners should be allowed into the English game.
</P>
<P>
"I am working next to kids and apprentices every day in
training and sometimes I think of their future," he said in an
address to students at the Oxford Union.
</P>
<P>
"You will have to close your frontiers, your borders. I would
not be happy if 10 or 11 foreigners were playing for Marseille.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Saturday, Ginola also criticised
former Newcastle teammate Alan Shearer, and suggested Robbie
Fowler and Michael Owen should be England's frontline strike force.
</P>
<P>
His old manager at St James Park, Kevin Keegan was "not the
best tactician in the world" but "a great guy who I really love".
</P>
<P>
And as for Spurs boss George Graham, the Frenchman admitted
theirs was a cool relationship.
</P>
<P>
"I call him Mr Graham," he said. "We are not sufficiently
friendly."

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Bolstering of Political Initiative in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) must act
vigorously not only to include the Balkan nations in the European
market but to bolster a strong political initiative, Franco
Bernabe, the Italian coordinator of the task force for Balkan
reconstruction, said Saturday in Venice.
</P>
<P>
In an address to a conference on the Balkans and Europe,
Bernabe warned of the absence of a political entity that could
guide and coordinate the process of reconstruction which "cannot
be managed merely on a technical level."
</P>
<P>
The "relative facility" with which the EU can deal with the
region's economic problems "risks frustrating the chief objective:
the creation of a mechanism of self-sustained development," he
told the two-day conference sponsored by the Italian and French
foreign ministries and the Institute for International Political
Studies.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of development in the Balkans, I believe the most
important thing is to first establish the rules of the game" and
then proceed to development itself, Assistant U.N. Secretary-
General Pino Arlacchi said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Arlacchi, the former Italian top anti-Mafia officer, warned
against pumping "colossal resources" into the Balkans which could
fall into the wrong hands, adding that this, in turn, would fuel
corruption and crime which were anathema to development.
</P>
<P>
Strong and efficient institutional structures are required,
including anti-corruption measures coupled with foreign aid, he
said, adding that there is also an urgent need to disarm the
population.
