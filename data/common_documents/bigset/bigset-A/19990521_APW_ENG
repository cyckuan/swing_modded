<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar shoved the euro to within a whisper  
of its lowest level ever Friday as investors continued to support 
the bullish U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar slipped from its seven-month high against the  
Japanese yen as traders took profits and repositioned their bets. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0568, falling from $1.0623 Thursday.  
On April 30, the euro reached $1.0540, its lowest level since its 
January launch. The dollar slumped to 124.01 yen from 124.40 yen 
Thursday, the second day the U.S. currency rose to a seven-month 
high against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Without fresh economic data or political commentary for  
guidance, traders simply looked at the economic realities: The U.S. 
economy remains strongest with a bull market still occupying Wall 
Street, Japan is mired in recession and Europe hasn't harnessed its 
energies to recover from its doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economy is so healthy, the Federal Reserve issued an  
alert Tuesday that it is considering raising interest rates to 
lasso the unharnessed economy and tame inflation before it can 
surface and create damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think basically it's the fundamentals that are in play,''  
said Elena Shperling, chief currency trader at Banco di Sicilia. 
``The U.S. economy is strong. As a result, the dollar is 
stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan assured Congress Thursday 
that the world economy is on track for full recovery from the 
turmoil that began nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin also said that the United States was not going to use  
foreign exchange policy to fix the widening trade deficit. The 
Commerce Department announced Thursday that the trade deficit broke 
a record for the third straight month in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Once markets opened in Asia and Europe Friday, ``a lot of people  
took a look at that and took the dollar up,'' Shperling said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5166 Swiss Francs,  
up from 1.5090; and 1.4610 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4662. The 
British pound fell to $1.6013 from $1.6075. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries that have switched to the  
euro are no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a 
fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth:  
1.8508 German marks, up from 1.8413; 6.2073 French francs, up from 
6.1767; and 1,831.50 Italian lire, up from 1,821.49.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Lead, But Forum Spells Trouble  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Just when San Antonio has reached  
cruising speed with a 2-0 lead over the Los Angeles Lakers in their 
Western Conference semifinal series, the Spurs find themselves at 
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a place Tim Duncan can't remember winning in, because the  
second-year forward never has. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs are 14-34 in regular-season games at the  
soon-to-be-retired building, and have lost their last four games 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a big hurdle for us,'' Duncan said Friday. ``The Lakers  
are a very confident team. They're going to come in here with some 
great emotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their success against the Spurs at home, history isn't  
on the Lakers' side. They haven't recovered from a 2-0 deficit to 
win a best-of-7 series since the trio of Elgin Baylor, Wilt 
Chamberlain and Jerry West helped them do so 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the Lakers are 0-9 in playoff series in which they  
lost the first two games, including losses to Utah each of the last 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't dejected, we aren't feeling like the series is  
over,'' Lakers guard Derek Fisher said. ``We've been in both 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams insist they have yet to play their best basketball  
heading into Game 3 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bounce here or there'' is how Spurs coach Gregg Popovich  
describes the difference in the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody's outplayed the other team,'' he said.  
``I think we've been a little bit more fortunate down the stretch 
in a couple of games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers would agree. They say they beat themselves in losing  
87-81 and 79-76 in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had shots we're very capable of hitting, they just  
haven't gone in for us,'' Lakers forward Glen Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize if we go out and play the way we're capable of  
playing, things could easily turn around. We don't want to get back 
where we were about a month ago talking about it. We've just got to 
go out and do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That means getting Shaquille O'Neal more than the 11 shots he  
took in Game 2. The Spurs don't expect so few from O'Neal on 
Saturday, but they want all his shots to be challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been very aggressive going down there,'' said Spurs  
center David Robinson, who along with fellow 7-footer Duncan has 
frustrated O'Neal. ``If he wants to take tough shots with guys on 
him, then that's a good thing for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just because O'Neal has averaged 18.5 points in the series --  
well below his season average -- doesn't mean the Spurs are 
overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons why we've played him pretty good thus far  
is because we fear him so much,'' Spurs guard Avery Johnson said. 
``He can come in the next game, in our minds, playing like he's 
going to get 38. 
</P>
<P>
	``The minute you start to relax and don't fear him as much, then  
you're going to really be killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, whose job is to get everyone involved in the offense,  
said O'Neal shot the ball better in Game 2 despite taking only 11 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times, the two big guys have caused Shaq some problems, but  
at times Shaq has caused problems for himself,'' Fisher said. 
``He's a good enough player to adjust to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``In tomorrow's game, he'll do a great job of mixing both. He'll  
pass it out when he's supposed to, but he's also going to be the 
dominant player that he's capable of being and take the game 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, Robinson believes, it's best for him to get out of  
O'Neal's way down low. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's so big if he gets the ball down there, it doesn't make a  
lot of sense to pound him all the time. You don't want to foul him 
a lot early in the quarter when you're not in the penalty or when 
he's got a chance to make a good three-point play,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to hack him every time, but there are certain  
times when you're going to want to send him to the line quite a 
bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal has made only 11-of-24 free throws in the two games,  
including 2-of-10 in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good thing for us,'' Robinson said. ``Especially if  
the game is close, those free throws are going to be important. 
That's been a smart strategy if we keep him at the line.''

<HEADLINE> Reds OK Lease for New Ballpark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- In one of her last acts as the Cincinnati Reds  
owner, Marge Schott signed up her team for a new ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott attended a news conference at Cinergy Field today to  
announce that she has signed a 30-year lease for a new ballpark 
along the Ohio River that will open in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The news conference near the pitchers' mound amounted to a  
passing of the torch. Cincinnati financier Carl Lindner, who will 
take over for Schott once major league baseball approves the team's 
sale, stood behind Schott during the 20-minute session. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds managing executive John Allen, who has been running the  
team since 1996 while Schott serves her latest punishments from 
baseball, said revenues from the stadium will allow the club to 
become competitive again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds are located in one of baseball's smallest markets and  
have not been to the playoffs since 1995, the last year before they 
started slashing their payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this signifies with the signing of this lease is we now  
have the capabilities to go to the next level,'' Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lease agreement removes the last major hurdle to getting the  
project underway. Architects are working on a design for the 
45,000-seat ballpark, which will overlap the left field seats at 
Cinergy. A preliminary rendering is expected in July. 
</P>
<P>
	A $403 million stadium project for the Cincinnati Bengals is  
under construction just west of the stadium and is expected to be 
finished for the 2000 NFL season. Voters approved a sales tax hike 
to build both stadiums in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing the stadium lease was one of Schott's final acts as the  
Reds' controlling partner. She agreed to sell all but one of her 6 1/2 
shares to Lindner and two other limited partners for $67 million on 
April 20, ending her 15-year reign. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball has to approve the sale before the team  
switches hands. Lindner declined to answer questions about the 
team's future today because the sale is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner and Schott walked onto the field side-by-side. Schott  
used a cane -- she's still hampered by a broken hip suffered a year 
ago -- and leaned on a table for support throughout the 20-minute 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Schott's first public appearance since she agreed to sell  
the team. She's been back to the stadium only a few times since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if it was a bittersweet moment, Schott said, ``Kind of,  
yeah. But you've got to do things that baseball wants you to do. 
It's a boys' club.''

<HEADLINE> Mike Tyson Granted Parole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mike Tyson, in jail since February for  
assaulting two motorists, was granted parole today and is scheduled 
for release no later than June 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland Parole Commission voted 5-1 to grant the former  
heavyweight champion his release, contingent upon approval by 
Indiana authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact date of Tyson's release will depend on how soon  
Indiana acts. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said it granted parole because it would guarantee  
that Tyson would be supervised upon his release. Had Tyson served 
out his term in Rockville, Md. -- due to expire in September -- he 
could not have been placed under the supervisory terms of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our No. 1 reason for release is to assure that Mr. Tyson will  
reintegrate safely into society and follow the general rules of his 
parole,'' the commission said. ``He needs to be supervised and held 
accountable to public standards of conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Tyson probation officer George Walker was not  
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Shelley Finkel, when asked when Tyson might fight again,  
said, ``I can't tell you when until he gets out and I sit down and 
talk with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has three fights remaining on a deal with the MGM Grand in  
Las Vegas and at least three more fights with Showtime, Finkel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	With good behavior, Tyson would have been released in September  
had he not been granted parole. He will now be on parole until 
September, followed by two years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected it,'' said Douglas Gansler, state's attorney for  
Montgomery County. ``He's being treated like everyone else would be 
treated with the same criminal history and the same criminal 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like he's now sort of scot-free. He will still be  
under parole, and he's going to be under the auspices of the 
criminal justice system for the next two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson last fought Jan. 16 and he was behind on all three cards  
before he stopped Francois Botha in the fifth round at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	He was tentatively scheduled to fight again April 24 against an  
undetermined opponent but was then was sentenced to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The Botha fight was Tyson's first since his license was restored  
by Nevada boxing authorities on Oct. 19. The license had been 
revoked after he was disqualified for biting Evander Holyfield ears 
June 28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges  
following a minor traffic accident in suburban Gaithersburg, Md., 
in August. He was sentenced Feb. 5 on one year in the Montgomery 
County jail, and 60 days were later added as punishment for 
violating probation for a 1992 rape conviction in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his sentence, Tyson spent five days in solitary  
confinement for throwing a TV in a jail recreation room. His 
lawyers said Tyson had not received his antidepressant medication 
for several days before the outburst. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has also undergone counseling while in jail. His  
medication was changed, and he has been studying for a high school 
equivalency diploma. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's hearing was at 9 a.m. The hearing officer then traveled  
to Baltimore to present his findings before the parole commission, 
which informed Tyson of the decision at about 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the opportunity to place Tyson under tighter  
supervision, the commission said it also granted the parole because 
both the assault victims had said they did not want to see the 
boxer jailed.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Backs Off Book Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Responding to e-mail complaints, Amazon.com says  
it will restore a book critical of the Scientology movement to its 
online catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, ``A Piece of Blue Sky,'' by British writer Jon Atack,  
was banned by a British court following a successful 1995 
defamation lawsuit against Atack. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon pulled the book in February, but said Thursday it would  
reinstate it. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the decision in February seemed the right thing to do at  
the time, we thought we could do better by blocking (sale of) it in 
(Britain) rather than everywhere,'' Amazon spokesman Bill Curry 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Amazon's policy is to offer every book from every  
publisher, and still remain in compliance with the laws where it 
does business. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry said the book would be able to be shipped in a matter of  
days, after coding is put in place to make sure copies aren't 
shipped to British addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Amazon worked to find a way to restore the book to its  
site after its absence was noted by Wired News, and complaints 
began arriving on Amazon e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Atack was sued in 1995 by a woman named in a single paragraph of  
the book. The court decided that paragraph was defamatory and ruled 
that copies of the book containing the offending material could not 
be distributed in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Piece of Blue Sky'' is about the Scientology movement from  
its creation in 1959 to the death of its founder, L. Ron Hubbard, 
in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Fear Prompts Man To Move to Va. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLOYD, Va. (AP) -- John Hammell believes Miami will be a  
dangerous place to live if the Year 2000 computer bug plunges 
civilization into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	So the big-city political consultant and sailor has headed for  
the hills of Floyd County, where he is learning to live off the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
	Careful preparation kept Hammell alive through numerous  
hurricanes and storms at sea. Now, with the 21st century about to 
arrive, he is stockpiling food, water and chopped wood and lighting 
his spartan trailer with kerosene lamps. He is getting organic 
vegetables from a community garden and planning to buy solar panels 
and a woodstove he can cook on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be in a place that had a history of  
self-sufficiency, where my neighbors are prepared and not 
panicking,'' said Hammell, who is 41 and single. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Y2K refugees have moved to Floyd County, a sparsely  
populated area of the Blue Ridge Mountains about 230 miles 
southwest of Richmond that has welcomed social dropouts for 
generations, including the hippies of the '60s and the New Agers of 
the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	The land is fertile and cheap, taxes and crime are low, and the  
water is abundant and unpolluted because Floyd County has the 
highest mean elevation in Virginia. But it's the attitude more than 
the altitude that compelled the likes of Hammell to join the 13,200 
residents of Floyd County. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people who come here are interested in getting out of  
the system and trying to become self-sustaining,'' said Bill 
Truitt, who raises chickens and eats what he grows in a greenhouse 
and organic garden. 
</P>
<P>
	There are at least a dozen small communes where people share the  
work and earnings. Most of the communes grow their own food and are 
not connected to the commercial electrical system, Truitt said. 
There is also an established barter system for obtaining 
necessities. 
</P>
<P>
	Truitt, 68, moved in before the Y2K scare but has since become  
the county's point man for the Cassandra Project, a nationwide 
grassroots clearinghouse for Y2K preparedness. In Greek mythology, 
Cassandra had the gift of prophecy, but her warnings of misfortune 
were always disbelieved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem stems from computer programs that use only  
two digits to designate the year. A two-digit program recognizes 99 
as 1999. Some experts fear that when 2000 arrives, computers will 
think it is 1900, causing power systems and communications to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the event is going to be apocalyptic, but there  
will be greater disruptions than the government would lead us to 
believe,'' Truitt said. ``The government is hoping to avoid 
panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around the country, some people are preparing for the worst,  
moving out to the countryside to simplify their lives. The largest 
concentration of refugees in Virginia is in Floyd County. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Nye, a Hollins University sociology professor who lives in  
Floyd County, said the tradition of finding sanctuary in these 
hills goes way back. During the Civil War, deserters came to Floyd 
County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be an attractive attitude here as opposed to a  
rural area like Franklin County, which is less tolerant to 
divergent lifestyles,'' Nye said. ``Franklin County is known for 
its moonshine. Floyd County is known for its pot growing, if that 
tells you anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1960s arrivals were lured by advertisements in Mother Earth  
News, others by the psychic visions of Edgar Cayce, who said Floyd 
County would be one of the few safe places in the event of nuclear 
war. Now it's the Internet that is drawing people. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer programmer Ken Griffith bought 437 acres in Floyd  
County and advertised on the Internet that he is establishing a 
self-sustaining community called Rivendell for people who believe 
in home-schooling their children and need a safe port during the 
Y2K storm. Rivendell takes its name from the refuge and learning 
center in J.R.R. Tolkein's ``Lord of the Rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hair salon owner Carl Mandell of Toledo, Ohio, is building a  
solar-heated home in Rivendell, where about 20 of the 28 lots have 
been sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pray that we're wrong, but this thing has the potential to  
really disrupt our civilization,'' said Mandell, 52. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, the Y2K scare has been good for business in  
Floyd, a one-stoplight county seat with an old-fashioned farmer's 
supply store around the corner from a health food emporium. 
Business is booming at both stores, where clerks scramble to keep 
up with bulk orders for such survival items as Mason jars, canning 
equipment, hand grinders, rice and grain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just got off the phone with a woman who wanted to know when  
we would have more wood cook stoves and kerosene lamps,'' said 
Derek Weeks, a hardware store clerk. ``I asked why, and she just 
said, `Y2K.'''

<HEADLINE>  Italy Fears New Political Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- A briefcase lying on a bloodied sidewalk. A grieving  
widow. A commando communique. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing of a labor official, claimed by the militant Red  
Brigades, terrifies Italians, who worried Friday about a possible 
return to the political violence that marked the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is, why now?  
</P>
<P>
	Italy's economy and government are remarkably stable after years  
of turmoil. But government attempts to bolster the economy by 
winning concessions from labor and its backing of NATO's air 
campaign in Yugoslavia have been denounced by the far left. 
</P>
<P>
	Both issues figured in the 28-page manifesto left by the Red  
Brigades in a trash bin in Rome claiming Thursday's slaying of 
Massimo D'Antona, who was shot repeatedly in the heart as he walked 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
	At D'Antona's funeral Friday, Italian leaders vowed there would  
be no replay of the ``years of lead,'' when assassinations and 
bombings by terrorists from the far left and right terrified the 
country in the 1970s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever did the shooting shouldn't fool themselves,''  
D'Antona's boss, Labor Minister Antonio Bassolino, told the funeral 
congregation. ``We haven't gone back 20 years. Italy wants to go 
ahead with new social and labor rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Antona, he said, was a man ``ready for dialogue, a leftist and  
a reformist. That's why he was struck down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Italy's Cabinet approved an employment package that  
D'Antona had finished just hours before his death. 
</P>
<P>
	A university professor in labor law, D'Antona was a chief  
architect of labor reforms that included an agreement by industry 
and unions to create more jobs by encouraging part-time work. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy has also been enjoying a rare show of cooperation between  
the center-left government and the center-right opposition, 
including on electoral reforms aimed at bringing Rome more in line 
with the rest of Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides were also cooperating in Italy's participation in the  
NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia, which has made extensive use of 
Italian air bases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Brigades' most notorious attack, in 1978, struck at  
another figure of cooperation -- former Premier Aldo Moro, who, just 
before his kidnapping and killing, brokered the ``historic 
compromise'' in which Communists pledged to work together in 
Parliament with the Christian Democrat-dominated coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Two decades later, that accord helped pave the way for the  
appointment of the country's first former Communist premier, 
Massimo D'Alema. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants' goal during their bloody campaign in the 1970s  
was nothing short of destruction of the Italian state and anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the latest attack, D'Alema said: ``We don't want to  
underestimate their message and intent to destabilize our country 
in this delicate moment. But this is a country that will not let 
itself be sent backward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Antona's killing came 11 years after the Red Brigades' last  
claimed assassination, that of a senator, and six years after its 
last claimed act of violence, a bombing at the U.S. air base at 
Aviano, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	In Parliament on Wednesday, the opposition helped D'Alema beat  
back an attempt by some in his government to urge a unilateral 
cease-fire in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	And last week, the center-left and the opposition pulled  
together to elect the nation's president in a first-round vote -- 
only the third time in Italy's postwar history that has happened. 
The new head of state, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, a political 
independent, is a staunch backer of political reform. 
</P>
<P>
	In its manifesto claiming D'Antona's killing, the Red Brigades  
vowed to ``attack and dismantle ... the imperialist state'' and 
target NATO for its ``imperialist war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Antona had been targeted as a shaper of ``neo-corporate  
politics,'' the manifesto said, using the Marxist language of 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A crackdown after Moro's death and the end of the Cold War  
helped cool the guns and passions of the old Red Brigades. The last 
imprisoned major leader, Renato Curcio, a Brigades founder, won 
release last October after 24 years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many Red Brigades members were never captured, with  
many believed to be living abroad.

<HEADLINE>  Italy Fears New Political Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- A briefcase lying on a bloodied sidewalk. A grieving  
widow. A commando communique. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing of a labor official, claimed by the militant Red  
Brigades, terrifies Italians, who worried Friday about a possible 
return to the political violence that marked the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is, why now?  
</P>
<P>
	Italy's economy and government are remarkably stable after years  
of turmoil. But government attempts to bolster the economy by 
winning concessions from labor and its backing of NATO's air 
campaign in Yugoslavia have been denounced by the far left. 
</P>
<P>
	Both issues figured in the 28-page manifesto left by the Red  
Brigades in a trash bin in Rome claiming Thursday's slaying of 
Massimo D'Antona, who was shot repeatedly in the heart as he walked 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
	At D'Antona's funeral Friday, Italian leaders vowed there would  
be no replay of the ``years of lead,'' when assassinations and 
bombings by terrorists from the far left and right terrified the 
country in the 1970s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever did the shooting shouldn't fool themselves,''  
D'Antona's boss, Labor Minister Antonio Bassolino, told the funeral 
congregation. ``We haven't gone back 20 years. Italy wants to go 
ahead with new social and labor rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Antona, he said, was a man ``ready for dialogue, a leftist and  
a reformist. That's why he was struck down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Italy's Cabinet approved an employment package that  
D'Antona had finished just hours before his death. 
</P>
<P>
	A university professor in labor law, D'Antona was a chief  
architect of labor reforms that included an agreement by industry 
and unions to create more jobs by encouraging part-time work. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy has also been enjoying a rare show of cooperation between  
the center-left government and the center-right opposition, 
including on electoral reforms aimed at bringing Rome more in line 
with the rest of Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides were also cooperating in Italy's participation in the  
NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia, which has made extensive use of 
Italian air bases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Brigades' most notorious attack, in 1978, struck at  
another figure of cooperation -- former Premier Aldo Moro, who, just 
before his kidnapping and killing, brokered the ``historic 
compromise'' in which Communists pledged to work together in 
Parliament with the Christian Democrat-dominated coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Two decades later, that accord helped pave the way for the  
appointment of the country's first former Communist premier, 
Massimo D'Alema. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants' goal during their bloody campaign in the 1970s  
was nothing short of destruction of the Italian state and anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the latest attack, D'Alema said: ``We don't want to  
underestimate their message and intent to destabilize our country 
in this delicate moment. But this is a country that will not let 
itself be sent backward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Antona's killing came 11 years after the Red Brigades' last  
claimed assassination, that of a senator, and six years after its 
last claimed act of violence, a bombing at the U.S. air base at 
Aviano, Italy.

<HEADLINE> Greg Maddux Is a Master in a Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Greg Maddux has only himself to blame.  
</P>
<P>
	He's the one who set the bar so high by winning four straight Cy  
Young awards. He's the one who pushed expectations to the limit 
with two of the greatest seasons in pitching history. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with his ERA hovering above 5.00, everyone wants to know  
what's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize that I'm probably under a different standard than  
most pitchers, but that's something I live with,'' the Atlanta 
right-hander said after Braves lost to the Chicago Cubs 6-5 
Thursday night in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux got off to a 4-0 start for the first time in his career,  
but he hasn't won in more than three weeks while his ERA soared to 
5.02 and his record dropped to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last four starts, covering 24 1-3 innings, he's given up  
22 earned runs -- a staggering 8.14 ERA. In his latest start, he 
surrendered nine hits and five runs to the Cubs in seven innings, 
avoiding his fourth straight loss only because Gerald Williams hit 
a ninth-inning home run to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good,'' Maddux insisted. ``I feel capable and I feel  
like I'm concentrating. I feel like I'm doing the things I need to 
do to throw that last pitch. But when I have thrown it, it's gotten 
fouled off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or worse.  
</P>
<P>
	In the first inning Thursday night, Maddux got two strikes on  
Sammy Sosa, missed badly on the next pitch, then ``made a bad pitch 
and give up a home run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like it's the first year it's happened,'' Maddux  
said. ``It's been that way for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's true. Maddux was 18-9 and won his fourth ERA title (2.22)  
last season, but he was a mortal 3-3 with a 3.93 ERA the final two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, who turned 33 last month, is probably the top pitcher of  
this generation along with Roger Clemens. He won the NL Cy Young 
Award every season from 1992-95, setting landmark standards the 
final two seasons by going 16-6 with a 1.56 ERA, followed by 19-2 
and 1.63. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't had an ERA over 3.00 since 1991 and his 146 wins are  
the most in the majors over the last nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, suddenly, he's just another pitcher -- or worse. Maddux has  
given up 88 hits in 57 1-3 innings and opponents are batting .351 
against him, the highest average allowed by any National League 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux said he's failing to put away hitters after he gets ahead  
in the count. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got to regroup, get it together, get it going  
again,'' he said. ``There's still a lot of time left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs chuckled at the suggestion that Maddux is on the  
downside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a joke that they're (the media) trying to find  
something wrong with him,'' said Chicago pitcher Steve Trachsel, 
who beat Maddux 5-1 on a six-hitter last week. ``He's just not 
hitting his spots. I wish I had that kind of problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same guy I've seen. Nothing's changed,'' Sosa added.  
``He'll be all right. He'll be OK. He'll probably win the Cy Young 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Maddux, it's just a matter of making fewer bad pitches.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel like I'm making 20 mistakes a game instead of 12  
or 14,'' he said. ``I'm just not getting away with as many 
mistakes.''

<HEADLINE> Airlines Want Hong Kong Fees Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong is losing its role as Asia's leading  
international aviation hub because of exorbitant airport fees, a 
report by airline representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's nearly year-old Chek Lap Kok airport has lost 82  
weekly flights, resulting in estimated losses of $1.5 billion since 
Chek Lap Kok airport's opening last July, a report by the Board of 
Airline Representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspension of such a large number of services is  
unprecedented in the history of Hong Kong's aviation industry,'' it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Higher charges are encouraging international tour operators to  
use other cheaper hubs in the region as springboards for regional 
travel itineraries,'' said the report prepared for the 
legislature's economic services committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines have been pressuring the airport to cut its charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Airport charges jumped 34.1 percent for large planes and 14.7  
percent for smaller planes since the new airport opened last July 
at the height of Asia's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Many other leading airports have even higher charges, including  
Japan's Kansai, Narita and Osaka airports, London's Heathrow 
airport, and airports in mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
	But the charges to use Hong Kong airport are nearly twice as  
much as Singapore's Changi Airport, Hong Kong's key rival as Asia's 
aviation hub. Singapore slashed charges by 10 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its July opening, Scandinavian Airlines Systems, Varig  
Brazilian Airlines and Russia's Transaero have suspended services 
in Chek Lap Kok airport because the routes had become unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``International airlines do have a choice. The high prices would  
deter airlines from launching new flights and cut existing 
flights,'' said Quince Chong, the corporate communications manager 
at Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Donnelley, a spokesman for the Airport Authority, the  
public body running the airport, called the allegations unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that airport fees contribute to an average of just 4.3  
percent of airline's operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Airlines won't sway their decision to come here or not because  
of that 1 percent saving,'' said Donnelley.

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Not Considering Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt doesn't want anyone to think  
he's pondering retirement just because his contract to drive for 
Richard Childress expires after next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt, 48, said Friday that Childress already has begun  
discussions about keeping the team together, including primary 
sponsor GM Goodwrench Service, through the 2003 Winston Cup season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are going to start happening here soon as far as which  
direction we're going to go,'' Earnhardt said. ``If I can race good 
and win and feel good about myself, about my driving, I think I can 
still do it. I'm there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt won the last of his seven Winston Cup championships in  
1994, and just two of his 72 career race victories have come in the 
past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pretty much feel like I'm a top-five driver,'' said  
Earnhardt, who won at Talladega, Ala., last month and is ninth in 
this year's points standings. ``I can get in there and do it with 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One bonus for Earnhardt staying around in Winston Cup racing  
would be getting to compete against Dale Jr., 24, the reigning 
Busch Series champion who is scheduled to move up to the top 
circuit full time next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable the way your kids grow up and the way things  
change over the years,'' the elder Earnhardt said. ``I'm having fun 
with it, enjoying seeing him do what he's doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	WINSTON OPEN: Tony Stewart and Mike Skinner won 25-lap heat  
races Friday night to determine the starting order for the Winston 
Open, a qualifying race for The Winston, Saturday night's all-star 
event at Lowe's Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the 50-lap Winston Open earns the 21st and final  
spot on the starting grid for The Winston, a 70-lap affair that has 
a purse of more than $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart started on the pole and led the whole way in his heat,  
finishing about 700 yards ahead of Wally Dallenbach. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the race, Stewart was driven to a nearby airport  
and flown to Indiana, where he was scheduled to try to qualify for 
the Indianapolis 500 on Saturday morning. Immediately after Indy 
time trials, he planned to fly back to Charlotte in time for the 
Winston Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner led the final 23 laps of the opening heat and finished  
about 1,000 yards ahead of Jimmy Spencer on the 1.5-mile, 
high-banked trioval. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no cautions in either race.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	NEW LOOK: Continuing a trend that is becoming increasingly  
popular at the all-star weekend, 10 teams have adorned their cars 
with special paint schemes or sponsor logos for The Winston and its 
related activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporting different looks this weekend are the cars of Brett  
Bodine, Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, Dale Jarrett, Terry Labonte, 
Sterling Marlin, Mark Martin, Jimmy Spencer, Darrell Waltrip and 
Michael Waltrip. 
</P>
<P>
	Probably the most recognizable of the paint schemes was on the  
Chevrolet of Earnhardt, who was sporting the yellow and blue 
Wrangler jeans colors that were on his cars from 1981-87.

<HEADLINE> Exhibit Features World of Microbes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An invisible world that can bring disease and  
death or health and pleasure can finally be seen -- at once 
beautiful and yucky -- at the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcoming the visitor to ``Microbes: Invisible Invaders, Amazing  
Allies,'' is a Medieval mask, its long, birdlike beak curving 
downward and providing space for pleasant-smelling flowers to 
protect the wearer from the bad smells and poisoned air thought to 
cause the plague. 
</P>
<P>
	The departing viewer gets a last treat, a glimpse of part of the  
original notebooks of Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming and a 
sample of the mold that he discovered contained penicillin. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, child and adult alike enters the world of microbes,  
sees the toll of death and illness they have inflicted on the world 
and meets their good uses too, from drugs to tasty mushrooms to 
blue cheese and yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think they're having fun, but they're also learning,''  
Dr. Randall E. Kaye of Pfizer Inc., the exhibit's sponsor, said 
Friday as visiting school children raced from exhibit to exhibit 
pressing buttons, playing video games, laughing and asking 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially opening Saturday, the exhibit is to remain in  
Washington through Sept. 6. It then travels to Chicago, Buffalo, 
N.Y., Cleveland, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Indianapolis, with more 
stops still being booked. It premiered in Toronto and visited 
Jersey City, N.J., Los Angeles, San Francisco and Dallas before 
arriving in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	On the exhibit's dark side, a photo of the face of an Egyptian  
mummy clearly shows the scars of smallpox. 
</P>
<P>
	Around a corner is a tiny, baby-size iron lung, a remembrance of  
before the advent of polio vaccines, when thousands of victims were 
confined to those steel drums to help them breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	A highlight is a large room where the viewer can see the world  
from the point of view of a microbe. The surroundings are other 
bacteria and germs and even a giant white blood cell looking for 
invading viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, a series of hologram screens project 3-D images of the  
virus that causes AIDS, e. coli germs, streptococcus, salmonella 
and several other microbes. 
</P>
<P>
	In its own little room a world map invites visitors to press  
buttons marked with diseases such as tuberculosis, dengue fever, 
AIDS and others. The map lights to show where that disease is most 
prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all microbes are bad. The show notes that some help  
return nitrogen to the soil to help plants grow, others clean up 
oil and pesticides in the environment, billions of microbes in the 
intestines help digest food, and yeasts even help make bread rise 
and ferment beer and wine.

<HEADLINE> Couch Learning Browns' Playbook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- There it sat on the top shelf of his locker  
and as always easily within Tim Couch's reach. If not for the 
orange helmet logo decorating its front cover, the Browns' playbook 
could be mistaken for the Cleveland phone book. 
</P>
<P>
	``That thing is getting pretty heavy,'' Couch said. ``I don't  
know how many pages there are, but there's plenty of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since he was drafted No. 1 overall in April's NFL draft by the  
expansion Browns, Couch has spent nearly as much time lugging 
around the thick, spiraled playbook as he has throwing a football. 
</P>
<P>
	And the rookie quarterback wouldn't want it any other way.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm concentrating on learning the playbook,'' Couch  
said. ``Right now, there isn't anything else I want to get involved 
with. The only time I've set it down is when I go out to dinner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Couch began his second minicamp with the Browns, and  
judging by his performance during the morning workout, he's 
beginning to grasp some of the complexities of the pro game. 
</P>
<P>
	During 7-on-7 drills, Couch showed better poise and patience in  
the pocket than he did during last month's minicamp. Instead of 
throwing to a secondary receiver if his first target was covered, 
Couch tended to quickly dump the ball off to a running back at the 
first hint of defensive pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a lot more comfortable,'' he said. ``I now know what  
I'm doing. I'm making strides and things are starting to come 
together. Every day it gets a little bit better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch never had to learn a playbook while playing at Kentucky  
under coach Hal Mumme, who would sometimes draw up plays in the 
dirt. So imagine Couch's surprise when he was handed the Browns' 
playbook by coach Chris Palmer. Needless to say, Palmer used both 
hands to deliver it. 
</P>
<P>
	As Couch began leafing through its pages, he discovered a new  
world of terms, plays and diagrams. Suddenly, everything he had 
previously learned went right out the window. They were X's and O's 
all right, but they weren't in the same formations he was used to. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot like learning a foreign language,'' he said. ``I  
knew there was going to be a playbook when I got here so I was kind 
of prepared for it. I knew it would take a whole lot of extra time 
away from after practice. Going home and spending time with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acting as Couch's playbook interpreter is Ty Detmer, Cleveland's  
starting quarterback until he plays himself out of the job or Couch 
takes it away. 
</P>
<P>
	As Detmer works with the Browns' first unit, Couch waits for his  
turn. He watches Detmer's footwork. He watches how Detmer checks 
off one receiver and finds another. He watches Detmer's release 
point.

<P>
	Then after practice, Couch seeks out Detmer with a laundry list  
of questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for me that he's here,'' Couch said. ``He's  
definitely been more than willing to help me out with all the 
questions that I've had. I've come to him with a lot of questions 
at the end of the day and he's never once hesitated to help me 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is all new to Couch, but in some ways it's similar to  
something he has been through before. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really reminds me a lot of my freshman year in college,''  
he said. ``I came in, I wasn't starting and I had an other guy to 
beat out. It's the same thing. This is my freshman year in the 
pros, and I've got a lot to learn and a lot to prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as any freshman can attest, the books are a lot bigger in  
college.

<HEADLINE> Nurse Accused of Taking Beanie Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Authorities have accused a former nurse of  
stealing a Beanie Baby toyrom a 12-year-old girl's hospital bed 
while the girl was recovering from open-heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just was very floored that it would happen,'' said Michele  
Kiser, the mother of patient Nicole Kiser. ``I just could not 
believe that someone would steal from a sick child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said former Hershey Medical Center nurse Suzanne E.  
Pinkney, 50, stole the ``Halo the angel bear'' Beanie Baby from the 
child Dec. 8, then later struggled with officers who confronted 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	She was charged last week with theft by unlawful taking,  
resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicole, who nearly died from a closed heart valve and  
complications, was given the $70 toy as a gift. Police have since 
returned it to her. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershey Medical Center officials would say only that Ms. Pinkney  
no longer works there. Ms. Pinkney, who faces a July court hearing, 
could not be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Unrelated to Fugitive Hunt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCK SPRINGS, Wyo. (AP) -- Two brothers arrested Friday in a  
Wyoming robbery are not the fugitives authorities have been 
searching for in connection with the killing of a Colorado police 
officer nearly a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, arrested in western Kansas, matched the description of  
two survivalists who have eluded authorities since last year. Hours 
after their arrest, the FBI confirmed their identities and said 
they were not the fugitives, Alan ``Monte'' Pilon and Jason McVean. 
</P>
<P>
	Brendon James Johnson, 21, and Raymond Kendall Johnson, 31, both  
of Hillsdale, Mich., were being held in a Colby, Kan., jail and 
will be charged Saturday, the Fremont County attorney's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The robbery on Wednesday fueled speculation about a link to  
Pilon and McVean. 
</P>
<P>
	For the better part of a year, authorities have been frustrated  
in their search for Pilon and McVean, accused of killing officer 
Dale Claxton during a traffic stop in Cortez, Colo., on May 29, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Claxton died after he tried to stop three men in a stolen water  
truck. They opened fire with automatic weapons, hitting Claxton and 
his cruiser 26 times before he could even unbuckle his seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	One suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot days later in Utah.  
The other two were chased by more than 500 officers at one point 
into the desert country of Four Corners, where New Mexico, 
Colorado, Utah and Arizona meet. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, two men robbed the Rock Shop in Wyoming, a  
combination store, bar and restaurant about four miles east of 
South Pass City and some 300 miles north of Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects, who were wearing military boots and ski masks,  
took about $500 and escaped in a stolen white truck, which was 
crashed into a ditch near Rock Springs. Sheriff's deputies believe 
the two fled on foot and then jumped an eastbound Union Pacific 
train early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Dave King said authorities found evidence the two men  
had been camping in the area for several days. In the truck, they 
seized parts of night vision equipment, sleeping bags, body armor 
and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said a caretaker at a plant near where the truck was  
ditched identified the two men who fled the truck as Pilon and 
McVean based on photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cortez Police Chief Roy Lane said he was disappointed by the  
false report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all along, and I still continue to say that they are  
not too far away from the Four Corners area,'' he said. ``I think 
they are close by.''

<HEADLINE> U.S.-China Trade Presses On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALDWIN PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Tension over espionage allegations  
and the accidental bombing by U.S. planes of China's embassy in 
Yugoslavia is taking a back seat to the nitty-gritty details of 
international trade between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation from China's prosperous Jiangsu province, made up  
of more than 100 Chinese businessmen and government officials, 
arrived in California this week hoping to close deals on the 
purchase of medical technology and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are looking for American companies that want to invest  
in the booming Jiangsu, a province of 72 million people that 
surrounds Shanghai on China's central coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 20 years of an open-door policy, Chinese people know  
better the importance of cooperation with the outside world,'' said 
Ye Jian, director general of Jiangsu's Commission of Foreign 
Economic Relations and Trade and leader of the delegation. 
``America is very important for its developed economy, high-tech 
knowledge and also its capital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The visit, scheduled a year ago, isn't without political  
overtones. The governor of Jiangsu originally was scheduled to lead 
the group but stayed home, in part because of the bombing, Ye said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the big picture, the ongoing tension between China and  
the United States appears to have done little to alter day-to-day 
business between the countries, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost daily, Chinese ships disgorge tons of T-shirts, toys,  
shoes and other cargo in Long Beach and Los Angeles harbors. 
Passenger jets fly from U.S. airports to Beijing, Shanghai and 
other Chinese cities. And trade group's such as the Jiangsu 
delegation make deals with American companies. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the delegation held one-on-one meetings with  
representatives from more than 200 American companies interested in 
doing business in China. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them, Milton Philipson, president and chief executive of  
Domestic and International Electronics Group in Culver City, said 
the political tension was having little effect on the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name of the game is to get good products manufactured at  
very competitive prices,'' said Philipson, who has spent five 
decades in the import-export business. ``You have to separate the 
political problems of all countries, not just America and China. 
Political problems always exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reason trade continues to flow is because China badly needs  
U.S. currency to maintain its domestic economy. And China still 
wants U.S. support for its entry into the World Trade Organization. 
Entry to the body would enable China to trade on more favorable 
terms with WTO nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me that fundamentally, U.S. and Chinese interests  
have not changed that much,'' said Greg Mastel, a China analyst 
with the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. ``It was in 
their interests to negotiate a trade agreement a month ago and it's 
in their interests today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Asian economic crisis began nearly two years ago,  
China has relied heavily on exports to the United States and Europe 
to keep workers employed as the central government privatizes 
costly, inefficient state-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	China also needs trade to generate the foreign currency needed  
to buy Western technology as it modernizes domestic industries and 
builds up its communications and transportation infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're anxious about is their economy is slowing down,''  
said Marcus Noland, a senior fellow at the Institute for 
International Economics in Washington. ``The basic fundamental 
problem they face is they are saddled by these dinosaur state-owned 
enterprises which are incredibly inefficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem is China's lack of financial and marketing  
expertise, said Philipson. By supplying inexpensive textiles, 
electronics and other goods, China built up a huge trade surplus -- 
$56.8 billion in 1998 -- with the United States. But so far, Chinese 
companies have not been able to establish recognized and accepted 
brands that could boost sales further. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a very strong effort now for Chinese industry to  
increase their distribution because they need money, capital but 
they're very, very amateurish'' compared to well-honed Japanese and 
Korean marketing techniques, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really have a lot to learn about world markets,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Finish Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks closed slightly higher today as  
investors fetched bargains following a sharp downturn in share 
prices. The dollar dropped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 92.99  
points, or 0.57 percent, to finish the day at 16,292.98. On 
Thursday, the average closed up 71.81 points, or 0.44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 7.80 points, or 0.60 percent, to 
1,309.67. The TOPIX closed up 1.26 points, or 0.10 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar slipped against the yen after early gains, falling to  
123.76, 0.72 yen below its level late Thursday in Tokyo and also 
below its late New York level of 124.40 overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback had gained early today following remarks from U.S.  
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that the United States had no 
intention to use its currency as a trade policy tool. The remark 
indicated the government had no plans to make American exports 
cheaper by undermining the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar quickly met stiff selling by U.S. banks, some  
large Asian players and large Japanese brokerages seeking to lock 
in profits, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 123.63 yen and 124.60 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei 225 briefly dropped below 16,000  
for the first time since April 1. But with the index down more than 
6 percent from a high set on May 6, further downside risk was 
limited, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 16,000 level provides a very good opportunity for domestic  
institutional investors to start new investment for this fiscal 
year,'' said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, players don't expect a quick rebound in share  
prices either, especially since the U.S. Federal Reserve's hint at 
an interest rate hike has cooled off the action on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 565.65 million shares, up from 550.36 million shares 
Thursday. Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 613 to 585, while 
114 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors bought shares on dips after the Nikkei average  
closed below 17,000 points Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips were mixed. TDK, Tokyo Electron, Kyocera, Honda,  
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and Fuji Photo were weaker, while 
Sony, NEC, Toyota and Bridgestone were up. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in banks and brokerages are generally higher after recent  
declines. Major commercial banks will announce earnings results 
later today. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.17 yen, down  
from 132.44 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.345 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.295 percent, 
driving its price down to 101.37 yen from 101.82 yen.

<HEADLINE> FCC Told To Review Phone-Fee Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A battle over fees that make up a big part of  
long-distance bills is headed back to federal regulators. A federal 
appeals court said the way the fees were calculated wasn't 
adequately explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Friday  
ordered the Federal Communications Commission to review part of a 
1997 decision that resulted in lower phone bills for millions of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``very pleased'' United States Telephone Association, which  
represents local phone companies, had contested the FCC's decision 
in court saying the agency's calculations made unjustified cuts to 
the fees. AT&AMP;T and MCI also challenged the 1997 calculations in 
court but for opposite reasons, arguing the agency should have 
adjusted the formula to result in deeper cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the FCC did not adequately explain certain  
changes to a complex formula that affects the so-called access 
payments that long-distance companies pay local phone companies to 
connect calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The access fees, which are typically passed along to  
long-distance customers, have been going down and now make up about 
30 cents of every $1 of long-distance charges. 
</P>
<P>
	When the FCC periodically orders these fees to be reduced, the  
savings are supposed to be passed along to long-distance customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the FCC made adjustments that caused the access fees to  
be reduced by $1.7 billion to better reflect local phone companies' 
costs to connect long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the court today disagreed with the FCC's rationale  
for making those changes to the so-called ``X Factor.'' Expressed 
as a percentage, the factor aims at ensuring that as a local phone 
company's productivity improves, the company would receive less 
from these access payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, the factor has forced an automatic annual  
reduction in the fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Local phone companies ``argue that the FCC did not give a  
rational explanation ... and we agree,'' the court said in its 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The court didn't say whether the FCC should have made specific  
adjustments that would have resulted in either lower or higher 
access fees, just that some FCC calculations needed to be further 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC will ask the court to suspend its ruling, a commission  
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision -- assuming it stands -- could affect how the FCC  
adjusts access fees later this year, telecommunications attorneys 
said. The fees are still expected to be reduced, but now it's 
unclear by how much. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's decision also could have implications for how the  
FCC compensates for the cost of cheap Internet hookups for schools 
and libraries. The FCC is supposed to approve $2.25 billion in new 
money for the Internet program on Thursday. Payment for this 
program is also passed on to consumers in their phone bills. But a 
new round of expected access fee reductions are supposed to offset 
any potential phone bill increases caused by the Internet program. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth, who disagrees with the  
way the FCC pays for the Internet program, said phone bills will go 
up to pay for the Internet subsidies if the court's action delays 
this new round of access reductions. Senior FCC officials 
disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	The access issue has pitted local phone companies, such as the  
Baby Bells and GTE, against long-distance companies, such as AT&AMP;T 
and consumer groups, which want deep cuts in access fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is likely to be used by both sides to advocate their  
position before the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will use this as an opening to go back and argue for much  
deeper cuts in pricing,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the 
Consumers Union's Washington office. AT&AMP;T agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Local phone company BellSouth believes the ruling ``cries out  
for the FCC to use it as an opportunity to address both access 
charge reform and universal service subsidies in a comprehensive 
way,'' said attorney Robert Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
	A portion of access fees -- there's debate over the exact amount  
-- helps make local phone service more affordable. The FCC is in the 
process of trying to determine how much as part of an overhaul of 
phone subsidies.

<HEADLINE> US Moves Toward Marijuana Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Research with government-grown marijuana is  
expected to become more common by December under new guidelines 
issued by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Under new rules, NIDA, one of the National Institutes of Health,  
will sell government marijuana to privately funded scientists whose 
research proposals have been approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is expected to prompt more studies to see if the drug  
helps people with AIDS, cancer or eye disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Government marijuana is grown on a small plot of land by the  
University of Mississippi under a contract with NIDA. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, only scientists who had won federal grants had  
access to that marijuana. And only a few such federal studies have 
been approved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all thought the time was right'' for the new guidelines,  
Steven W. Gust, a special assistant to the director of NIDA, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidelines were created after Cabinet-level discussions  
among agencies involved in America's war on drugs, including the 
Department of Health and Human Services, NIH's parent agency, plus 
the Justice Department, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the 
White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, Gust said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug control office, headed by Barry McCaffrey, favors  
marijuana studies ``as long as they pass a peer review process to 
make sure the research is good science,'' said Charles Blanchard, 
the office's chief counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey has opposed actions by states to permit medical uses  
of marijuana, claiming that would prejudge serious scientific 
research. Two recent expert reports recommended more research on 
marijuana, citing evidence of its possible benefits to some 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Mississippi grows the government-approved  
marijuana on 1.8 acres at a closely guarded site. A crop is 
harvested on alternate years. So far that has been more than enough 
to supply the few approved researchers, Gust said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new guidelines do prompt more research, the agency is  
prepared to grow more marijuana, opening up additional fields if 
necessary and planting every year instead of alternate years, Gust 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new guidelines, privately funded researchers  
conducting ``scientifically valid investigations'' reviewed and 
approved by the NIH will be allowed to purchase the government 
marijuana. The price for Uncle Sam's pot has not been set, and the 
drug is not expected to be ready for researchers until December. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cancer, AIDS and glaucoma patients already use marijuana,  
often bought illegally on the street. At least six states have 
passed measures to permit the drug's medicinal use if prescribed by 
a physician. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law, however, bans the drug. And many doctors are  
reluctant to approve it for their patients because of the 
controversy over its benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The tough federal stance on medical marijuana prompted some  
doctors in California to get a court injunction to block what they 
feared would be federal reprisals for prescribing marijuana to 
patients under that state's compassionate-use laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts found in two recent reports that marijuana for some  
patients is effective in relieving pain, nausea and vomiting caused 
by cancer and AIDS. Some glaucoma patients also smoke the drug to 
help relieve pressure inside the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 report by a National Institutes of Health panel concluded  
that there is enough evidence about marijuana's benefits to merit 
further research. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the  
National Academy of Sciences, also urged scientific research. The 
institute also favored compassionate permits for use of the drug by 
patients who were not helped by other medications. 
</P>
<P>
	Four federally financed research projects are ongoing, NIDA  
officials said. Three other proposals failed to get federal money 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Thomas of the Marijuana Policy Project said his group is  
pleased the guidelines will encourage more research, but he said 
the action will not help patients in pain who need the drug now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very disappointed that they failed to approve  
single-patient, compassionate use, as the Institute of Medicine had 
recommended,'' Thomas said.

<HEADLINE> Hit Man Manual Publisher Settles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A publisher agreed Friday to stop selling a  
book on how to be a hit man and will pay millions of dollars to two 
families who claimed a hired assassin used the manual to kill their 
loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Paladin Press of Boulder, Colo., settled a federal lawsuit filed  
by the family of Mildred Horn and her 8-year-old quadriplegic son, 
Trevor, and the family of nurse Janice Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which was scheduled to go to trial next week,  
accused Paladin Press of providing James Perry with a 130-page 
blueprint for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry was convicted of killing the Horns and Ms. Saunders in  
1993, a year after ordering the book, ``Hit Man: A Technical Manual 
for Independent Contractors.'' Perry is on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence T. Horn, Mrs. Horn's ex-husband, was sentenced to life  
in prison for hiring Perry so he could inherit the $1.7 million 
estate his son won from a medical malpractice suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of the settlement, in which Paladin agreed to stop  
selling its book, was not made public. John Marshall, an attorney 
for the families, would describe it only as ``a multi-million 
dollar settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paladin lawyer Lee Levine said the recent school shootings in  
Colorado and Georgia could have made it harder to convince a jury 
that the book did not cause the murders or substantially help Perry 
commit them. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 13,000 copies of the book have been sold since it was  
first published in 1983. It offers tips for deadly effectiveness, 
such as shooting victims in the head. Ms. Horn and Ms. Saunders 
were shot in the eye. Trevor's breathing tube was disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	Paladin lawyers claimed the book was intended for a wide  
audience including crime buffs and mystery writers and said there 
were few similarities between Perry's crimes and the book. Paladin 
lawyers said Perry learned what he knew while growing up in a tough 
Detroit neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1997, a federal appeals court allowed the lawsuit, saying  
the book was ``a step-by-step murder manual'' for assassins. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13,500-member Society of Professional Journalists filed a  
court brief in support of Paladin Press, saying the suit threatens 
the right of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the timing for the suit is difficult given our  
recent experience with the Littleton, Colorado, shooting,'' said 
Wendy S. Myers, the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
	And Bob Vanderet, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents movie  
studios, TV producers and book publishers, said the case is making 
the entertainment industry nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	A Louisiana court cited the Paladin case in its decision to  
uphold a lawsuit against director Oliver Stone and his film 
``Natural Born Killers.'' The suit was brought by the family of a 
convenience store clerk who was shot and paralyzed.

<HEADLINE> Senators Push Rural Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm-state Senate Democrats are asking federal  
regulators to consider subsidizing high-speed Internet access in 
rural areas, saying better telecommunications are critical to 
economic survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would come from fees that are imposed on  
telecommunications companies and typically passed on to their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are determined not to end up with a country of haves and  
have-nots with respect to advanced telecommunications,'' Sen. Byron 
Dorgan, D-N.D., said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1996 law, rural areas are supposed to have  
telecommunications services that are ``reasonably comparable'' to 
those in cities, but it was left up to the FCC to decide how to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials said they were already studying ways to improve  
rural service. ``We're looking at how we can bridge the digital 
divide,'' said spokeswoman Joy Howell. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is handing out nearly $1.7 billion in subsidies  
to schools and libraries, including those in rural areas and inner 
cities, for a variety of telecommunications needs, including 
Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard recently called for $2.25 billion to  
fund the program in its second year. That is generating criticism 
mostly from Republicans on Capitol Hill, because of fears that it 
could raise phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators say farmers, rural businesses and small-town  
health-care facilities need access to high-speed Internet services 
for transmitting graphics and large amounts of data. Farmers, for 
example, often use satellite imaging to decide how much fertilizer 
and pesticide to use in their fields. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Kennard, the senators said the FCC should  
consider subsidizing high-speed Internet and data services via 
satellite services, raise the technical requirements for phone 
lines, and encourage cellular companies to serve remote areas and 
Indian reservations where there is little existing phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the senators are introducing legislation to set up  
an office of rural advocacy at the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rural communities need the economic and social benefits that  
high-speed Internet access provides. For some of them, it's a 
matter of basic economic survival,'' said Senate Minority Leader 
Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications companies have been racing each other to  
provide high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	An alliance of computer makers and big telephone companies,  
including US West, wants the FCC to ease regulations they say 
discourage modernization. Rival long-distance companies, including 
AT&AMP;T, oppose the move. AT&AMP;T is seeking to become a major provider 
of Internet service over cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was signed by Daschle and Dorgan and Sens. Tom Harkin  
of Iowa, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Kent 
Conrad of North Dakota, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Paul Wellstone of 
Minnesota, Patty Murray of Washington, and Max Baucus of Montana.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Urges GOP To Cut Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans should set their sights on  
lowering the total tax burden on Americans to 25 percent and not 
waste time campaigning for a fundamental overhaul of the system, 
former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise  
Institute think tank, said at a tax seminar that he will write to 
GOP leaders across the country this fall urging that the 25 percent 
goal in the next 15 years become a ``a moral principle'' in 
national and local Republican Party platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tax reform is a dead end,'' Gingrich said. ``The real goal  
should be to shrink the total government tax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On average, Americans pay about 40 percent of their earnings in  
all types of federal, state and local taxes each year, Gingrich 
said. Taxes should be reduced by shrinking the size of government, 
he said, which would give people more money to spend on their own 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have huge governments, they have their own  
interests,'' Gingrich said. ``Taxes in the end are about power. Who 
has the ability to spend what you earn?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, a Republican from Georgia, resigned as House speaker  
after Republicans lost seats in the 1998 elections. He said he will 
not run for any office in 2000. But he has not ruled out a future 
presidential bid and said Friday that his tax message would be 
financed with his new Friends of Newt Gingrich political action 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans ranging from House Majority Leader Dick Armey,  
R-Texas, to presidential contender Steve Forbes have championed a 
flat income tax to replace the current graduated code. Others favor 
consumption taxes on purchases to replace income taxes, such as a 
national sales tax, while some want a constitutional amendment 
limiting tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, however, said such efforts frequently amount to an  
``enormous black hole into which you pour energy but nothing ever 
comes out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tax reforms that would broaden the tax base, such as a national  
sales tax, run into political thickets because ``you're hitting 
somebody'' with new taxes no matter which road is taken, Gingrich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took 26 years to get welfare reform,'' Gingrich said of the  
laws passed by Congress in 1996. ``Our goal should be to lessen all 
taxes to 25 percent. You could do something every year.''

<HEADLINE> Greenberg Named McDonald's Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's Corp. has named Jack Greenberg, who  
has been credited with helping the fast-food chain make a sharp 
turnaround in recent months, as its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenberg, who had been the company's president and chief  
executive, becomes only the fourth chairman since McDonald's was 
founded in 1955. His promotion was announced at McDonald's annual 
shareholders meeting Thursday and is effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenberg, 56, replaces Michael R. Quinlan, 54, who will remain  
a member of McDonald's board and chairman of its executive 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenberg will relinquish the title of president but said the  
company won't actively seek another executive to fill the position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to know that I have total passion for this  
business,'' Greenberg told shareholders. ``We clearly see the 
growth opportunities that are ahead of us, and we will pursue them 
relentlessly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have praised Greenberg for steering the chain in the  
right direction over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of struggling sales and declining domestic market  
share, the chain last year gained market share and boosted sales at 
stores open at least a year, in part because of such successful 
promotions as Beanie Babies and Monopoly. The company's stock has 
soared more than 30 percent under his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say McDonald's has experienced a remarkable turnaround  
as it decentralized its domestic operations to give grumbling 
franchisees more say in developing their menus and planning 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenberg also has given the green light for McDonald's to  
explore other restaurant concepts. The company early last year 
purchased a stake in fast-growing Mexican food chain Chipotle 
Mexican Grill and last month purchased Aroma Ltd., a British chain 
of 23 shops that sell coffee and sandwiches in a lively atmosphere 
of recorded Caribbean music and bright yellow and orange decor. 
This month, it purchased the privately owned Donatos Pizza chain of 
143 restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has benefited from increased expansion  
overseas, particularly in Europe, where revenues have exceeded 
domestic sales in recent years and where expansion still is 
occurring rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenberg has served as McDonald's president and chief executive  
officer since April 1998. He joined the company in 1982 as 
executive vice president and chief financial officer.

<HEADLINE> Kids Fuel 'Phantom Menace' Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- This weekend's anticipated flood of younger  
viewers to movie theaters to see ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The 
Phantom Menace'' is expected help the movie trounce previous box 
office records. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first two days, the ``Star Wars'' prequel earned nearly  
$41 million, including a record $28.5 million in its debut 
Wednesday, according to 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Historical precedent suggested there would be a significant drop  
on Thursday before a weekend rebound to opening day levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The kid factor should push today's grosses beyond Wednesday,  
setting a new one-day record. Receipts totaling $28,542,349 on 
Wednesday beat the $26.1 million earned in 1997 by previous title 
holder ``Lost World: Jurassic Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Box office comparisons are not adjusted for inflation.  
</P>
<P>
	Youngsters could be the key to the movie's longevity. Some  
critics harped that the film's 8-year-old central character and 
sidekick Jar Jar Binks target little tykes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Show me the kids!'' 20th Century Fox distribution chief Tom  
Sherak said Friday, refusing to predict how much the George Lucas 
film would rake in by Sunday's final showings. 
</P>
<P>
	Movie analysts expect ``The Phantom Menace,'' a $125 million  
film that Lucas financed himself, to gross $120 million to $140 
million by the end of its five-day opening frame. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have our fingers crossed. We've said it's like a  
shooting star and we're holding on to see what it does,'' Sherak 
said. ``Monday will show you the direction we're going, then the 
next weekend is the holiday weekend and, who knows?''

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Support for Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican women have shifted dramatically in  
recent years toward the belief that controlling gun ownership is 
more important than the rights of gun owners, a poll says. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll results were released Thursday as the Senate approved a  
proposal to slap fresh restrictions on gun purchases at gun shows 
and pawn shops, a move pushed by Senate Democrats and opposed by 
most Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press  
was taken before Thursday's school shootings in Conyers, Ga., and 
was released as President Clinton traveled to Littleton, Colo., to 
observe the one-month anniversary of the nation's worst school 
shooting. That attack claimed 15 lives, including the two 
assailants who committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over half of all Republicans, 53 percent, said gun control  
was more important, while 42 percent said protecting the gun 
owners' rights took priority. Six years ago, 47 percent of 
Republicans picked gun control and 45 percent picked protecting gun 
owners' rights, a statistical tie. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican women were key to the shift in overall GOP sentiment  
in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost three-fourths of GOP women said in the poll that  
controlling gun ownership was more important, about the same 
percentage as all women who felt that way. In 1993, about half of 
GOP women said controlling guns was more important, while just over 
four-in-10 said it was important to protect the rights of gun 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-quarters of Democrats in the poll said gun control is more  
important than protecting the rights of gun owners, an increase 
from the two-thirds who felt that way six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of all those questioned in the poll thought gun  
control was more important, slightly higher than in a Pew poll in 
December 1993. The percentage of people who feel television news 
contains too much violence also grew. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll indicated that almost two-thirds of Americans think  
television news contains too much violence, compared with half who 
felt that way in 1993. Seven-of-10 said TV entertainment programs 
have too much violence, the same level as the 1993 Pew poll and a 
1971 Harris poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew poll showed an 8-point increase in support for gun  
control since December 1993. An ABC-Washington Post poll released 
earlier this week showed two-thirds supported tougher gun controls, 
about the same as the percentage when ABC asked that question in 
March 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Associated Press polls taken just before and after the Littleton  
shooting showed a 9-point increase in the percentage of people who 
believe tougher gun controls are a better deterrent than stricter 
enforcement of current laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Pew poll, almost all demographic groups showed increased  
support for giving priority to gun controls, with a shift of more 
than 10 percentage points among women, people over age 65 and those 
with some college education. Men were more evenly divided, with 53 
percent saying restrictions were more important and 42 percent 
saying protection of gun rights was more important. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest school shooting in Georgia highlighted the copycat  
threats that have plagued the nation's schools since the Colorado 
school shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	In another survey released Thursday, the George H. Gallup  
International Institute reported that 46 percent of high school 
students said their school has groups of students who are violent 
or capable of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether they ever fear for their personal safety at  
school, 20 percent in the Gallup poll said they did. That's higher 
than the 13 percent who said that a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gallup telephone poll of 403 teens, ages 13-17, was  
conducted May 5 to May 17. It has a margin of error of plus or 
minus 5 percentage points. The Pew telephone poll of 1,179 adults 
was taken May 12-16 and has an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Sunken Cruise Ship Passengers Saved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- More than 1,100 passengers aboard  
a luxury cruise liner scrambled overboard as the ship caught fire 
and sank off the western coast of Malaysia early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine Rescue and Coordination Center in Port Klang said  
officials believed all passengers and crew aboard the ship had been 
brought to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers -- including Australians, Americans, Britons and  
Japanese -- were rescued from the Bahamian-registered Sun Vista, 
said center spokesman Raja Malik. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no reports of fatalities,'' Raja said.  
</P>
<P>
	A total of 1,104 passengers and crew members of 26 nationalities  
were picked up by a dozen ferries and naval vessels and at least 
one cargo ship. All arrived safely on Penang island in northwestern 
Malaysia, according a statement from Sun Cruises, the operators of 
the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said a power failure resulted from a fire in the  
main engine room, but that an investigation was under way as to why 
the ship sank. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Cruises said all passengers would be accommodated at hotels  
until they could be flown home. They would be given full refunds 
``for the inconvenience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rescued passengers in Penang spoke of panic and chaos, others of  
how they kept up their spirits by singing the song from the movie, 
``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What actually happened is lack of information because the  
captain did not tell us about the fire. All the crew members looked 
panicky,'' passenger Thomas Bonnard, 62, of England, told the 
Malaysian news agency Bernama. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian businessman Ram Yalamanchi, 32, said he would never  
forget the screams of his fellow passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a true nightmare, I thought we all were going to die,''  
Yalamanchi told the Australian Associated Press from his hotel room 
in Penang. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were on one of the last lifeboats, we watched her just slip  
under the water,'' he said. ``People were screaming, praying, it 
was awful, the most terrifying experience of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first distress signal went out at about 6:30 p.m. Thursday.  
Marine police said the ship sank about seven hours later, at 1:20 
a.m., in the Strait of Malacca, about 27 miles off the central 
state of Perak. 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers were moved onto 18 lifeboats and four lift rafts.  
</P>
<P>
	Some Australians faced the trauma by singing the theme song from  
the movie, ``Titanic,'' according to Australian passenger Greg 
Haywood, 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were singing the Celine Dion song, `My Heart Will Go On,'  
trying to keep everyone's spirits up,'' said Haywood, adding that 
people mostly remained calm. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few people were crying and panicking, but everyone behaved  
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten passengers were sent to Penang Hospital for treatment. A  
hospital spokesman said the conditions were not yet known. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bernama news agency reported that the ship's captain was  
taken to a local police station to lodge a report on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Cruises Sydney-based spokesman David Baker said most of the  
Australian and New Zealand passengers were expected to depart 
Singapore Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said the company, with a head office in Singapore and one  
Australian branch in Perth, had been in operation about 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Cruises in its statement said there were 472 passengers and  
632 crew members on board. Other passengers included Americans, 
Britons, Germans, Belgians, French, Indonesians, Japanese, 
Mexicans, Russians, Spanish and Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
	The 700-foot-long Sun Vista can hold more than 1,600 passengers  
and crew in its 547 cabins. It has eight decks, five whirlpool 
baths, a swimming pool, beauty salon, bars and casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship's journey originated in Singapore, stopped to pick up  
more passengers in the Malaysian city of Malacca and then sailed on 
to the resort island of Phuket off the southern coast of Thailand. 
The Sun Vista was on its way back to its base in Singapore when it 
sank on the last leg of its six-day cruise. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman of the Kampung Acheh Marine Police in Lumut said the  
incident occurred in international waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``When our boat arrived at the scene at 12:15 a.m., the cruise  
liner was still on fire,'' said the spokesman. ``Some said that it 
looked like a scene from the film `Titanic.'''

<HEADLINE> Trie Pleads Guilty to 2 Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Presidential friend and fund-raiser Yah  
Lin ``Charlie'' Trie pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations 
Friday and agreed to cooperate in an investigation of illegal Asian 
donations to the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department prosecutors offered immunity and a  
recommendation for probation in exchange for Trie's help in tracing 
the source of Asian contributions funneled through him to the 
Democratic National Committee and to Clinton's legal defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie, 49, became friends with Clinton when he was governor and  
frequented a Chinese restaurant Trie owned near the Arkansas 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie struck the plea bargain in the middle of his trial in  
Arkansas on charges of obstruction of justice for allegedly hiding 
documents from a Senate campaign finance investigation. Trie was 
also charged in Washington with making illegal contributions to buy 
access to Clinton for himself and Asian businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors dropped all of those charges for Trie's guilty plea  
to a felony charge of causing a false statement to be filed with 
the Federal Election Commission and a misdemeanor charge of making 
a political contribution in someone else's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that the DNC had the names of the wrong persons,'' Trie  
admitted to U.S. District Judge George Howard. ``I requested that 
somebody else give the money for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trie is a central figure in the controversy over foreign-linked  
campaign donations to the Democrats. The DNC has returned $640,000 
that Trie raised. Clinton's legal defense fund has returned 
$460,000 raised by Trie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said the plea agreement is a boost to the  
investigation by its Campaign Financing Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows the continuing progress by the task force in  
actively pursuing allegations of campaign financing abuses,'' 
department spokesman Myron Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie faces up to six years in prison and $350,000 in fines,  
although his sentence probably would be less under federal 
sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors agreed to recommend three years' 
probation if Trie cooperates fully and gives substantial 
information. Sentencing was set for Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Trie's lawyer issued a statement in which Trie  
said he was ready to start a new life after fighting the government 
for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Right after his guilty plea, federal marshals served Trie with a  
subpoena to appear June 10 before the House Government Reform 
Committee, which is looking into campaign finance abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, the committee chairman, said he hopes the  
Justice Department will cooperate and let Trie answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people have waited a long time for answers and  
they have a right to know the truth,'' the Indiana Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin said Justice officials will consider the request ``and  
determine what impact it would have on the continuing 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A naturalized U.S. citizen, the Taiwan-born Trie operated the Fu  
Lin Chinese restaurant in Little Rock. In 1991, he began an 
international trading business. He moved to Washington when Clinton 
became president.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Land Treaty Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Future U.N. designations of protected lands in  
the United States would need congressional approval under 
legislation approved by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the bill, passed by voice vote Thursday,  
reconfirms that under the Constitution Congress has the sole 
authority to manage federal lands. Democratic opponents said the 
bill was unneeded and reflected anti-U.N. paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
	It is opposed by the Clinton administration and faces an uphill  
battle in the Senate. ``I am sure we can expect the Senate again to 
ignore it, which is all it deserves,'' Interior Secretary Bruce 
Babbitt said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, which Republicans unsuccessfully offered in the  
last two Congresses, would require congressional consent before any 
federal land could be included in an international land reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	It is aimed specifically at the World Heritage program, which  
since 1972 has identified world sites of exceptional interest and 
universal value, and U.N. biosphere reserves, founded in 1968 to 
foster studies of environments around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 47 biosphere reserves in the United States, including  
the six-state Southern Appalachian Biosphere Reserve, and 20 World 
Heritage sites, mostly in national parks such as Yellowstone, the 
Statue of Liberty and Independence Hall. Sixteen sites under a U.N. 
wetlands program would also be affected by the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, sponsored by House Resources Committee Chairman  
Don Young, R-Alaska, would terminate all existing biosphere 
reserves unless they are specifically authorized by Congress by the 
end of 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democratic opponents said the land designations give the  
United Nations no control over local lands or American laws.

<HEADLINE> More To Mutombo Than Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- There are many sides to this giant man, which  
isn't surprising when you consider his name: 
</P>
<P>
	Dikembe Mutombo Mpolondo Mukamba Jean Jacque Wamutombo.  
</P>
<P>
	He's a humanitarian, but he's not above whining to get his way.  
He's an elegant shot-blocker, but he seems quite awkward at the 
other end of the court. He's a family man, but some opponents have 
called him a dirty player. He's domineering, yet down home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a big guy with a loud voice,'' said Tyrone Corbin,  
Mutombo's teammate with the Atlanta Hawks. ``That intimidates a lot 
of people. But he's a very caring guy. He's very proud of who he 
is, what he's trying to accomplish and where he's going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When having a courtside discussion with Mutombo, there are many  
subjects to cover. 
</P>
<P>
	He might talk about his burning desire to win an NBA  
championship, which seems unlikely this season with the Hawks 
trailing New York 2-0 in a second-round series that continues 
Sunday at Madison Square Garden. Or he might give a discourse on 
the civil strife in his beloved Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	If needed, he can handle the conversation in English, French,  
Portuguese, Spanish or one of five African dialects. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Mutombo's concerns are so varied, his interests so  
widespread, his heart so large, that his coach felt compelled to 
issue a warning to his 7-foot-2 center. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has taken on some awesome responsibilities,'' Lenny Wilkens  
said. ``I told him he really needed to get his focus on his 
basketball. He had too many outside activities. What makes Dikembe 
is his basketball. If that's good, it allows him to provide for all 
the other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Mutombo's basketball has been very good since  
he left Denver in 1996 to sign with the Hawks. Twice, he has been 
named the NBA's defensive player of the year, and he's polished his 
offensive skills to the point where he's a fairly integral part of 
the Atlanta offense. 
</P>
<P>
	But many opponents have been put off by his sharp elbows,  
responsible for three broken noses during the regular season and a 
nasty bruise to Lindsey Hunter's eye in the first round of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's ridiculous,'' Detroit coach Alvin Gentry fumed after  
Hunter's injury. ``Somebody has got to do something about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkens defends his center on the issue of dirty play, but he's  
not as supportive when it comes to Mutombo's constant bickering 
about the officiating. Hardly a call is made that doesn't draw an 
angry glare, a loud roar or a befuddled look. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an emotional guy, and it's hard sometimes,'' Wilkens  
said. ``But I told him that if they're not going to change any 
calls, all you get is them watching every move you make. You don't 
want that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Off the court, Mutombo's life is equally chaotic.  
</P>
<P>
	Mutombo and his wife, Rose, have a 2-year-old daughter of their  
own and legally adopted four of his nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're driving me crazy,'' Mutombo said jokingly the other  
day, but he knew those kids would have a better chance of 
succeeding in America than in the family's native Congo, a 
war-torn, poverty-stricken land in the center of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like they say in Africa, a child is raised in a village, he's  
not just raised by his parents,'' Mutombo said. ``I have been 
productive in society, and I feel like I owe my community for what 
they have given to me. I can't turn my back on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He started a bus company to help the teeming masses get around  
Kinshasa, the capital city where Mutombo was born and raised. He 
also began a telephone company to improve the communications 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's trying to raise $44 million to build a new hospital in  
his native country. He also wants to construct a basketball arena 
and a school, the latter honoring his father, an education 
superintendent for more than three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are so many problems, more than any one man can solve  
on his own. Mutombo's deep, husky voice usually growls like a lion, 
but it grows as soft as a kitten when he ponders Africa's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just moving in the wrong direction,'' he said. ``It's  
not just in the Congo. It's all of Africa. Africa has been hit 
these past two years by all these civil wars. Somebody has got the 
answer on that. I'm not the answer. But the answer is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mutombo wonders why the people of American and other Western  
nations were so willing to turn their attention to other problems, 
such as those in Kosovo, a tiny province compared with the massive 
African continent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very bad to see all these wars going on in Africa, all  
these people dying in Africa,'' he said. ``But nobody is really 
writing about it. Nobody is paying attention to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Congolese conflict became especially personal for Mutombo  
last summer. His mother died after being denied medical care by the 
warring factions. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mutombo was single, his mother would visit the United  
States, cooking his meals while encouraging him to get married and 
have some children. Her wish finally came true, and the couple 
named their first child Carrie Biamba Wamutombo in honor of her 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mutombo's mother died before she could see the child.  
</P>
<P>
	``It still bothers me a lot,'' he said. ``My mom didn't get a  
chance to see my daughter. That's the sad part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mutombo, who will turn 33 on Tuesday, seems too busy with  
day-to-day life to worry about his legacy in the NBA, but he's 
given it some thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, he'll never achieve the same reverence as New York's  
Patrick Ewing, the center who preceded him at Georgetown and is now 
referred to by Mutombo as ``my oldest bother.'' If Ewing is a 
smooth gemstone when he plays the game, Mutombo is an unpolished 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick will be Patrick, Dikembe will be Dikembe,'' Mutombo  
said with a shrug. ``I've always said by the time I finish playing 
this game, I just want people to say I was one of the greatest 
defensive players who ever played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so much more.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Administrator Disarms Ga. Gunman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- Assistant principal Cecil Brinkley was  
enjoying his last day of classes before retirement when he saw 
students dashing from Heritage High School, trying to escape 
another student with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Solomon Jr., 15, had just shot and wounded six students  
Thursday, and Brinkley, 60, saw him run out near the football field 
with a .357 Magnum handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing a shortcut from 23 years of patrolling the halls,  
Brinkley came out a door about 10 feet away from Solomon to find 
him shaking and on his knees. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy put the gun in his own mouth, then pointed it at  
Brinkley as he approached. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little nervous, a little shaky,'' the soft-spoken  
administrator with graying red hair said Friday. ``From looking at 
him, I really thought that if I kept talking to him, he would give 
it to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brinkley stayed calm.  
</P>
<P>
	``I stepped back a couple of steps and I turned to him again and  
I said, `Give me the gun,' and I said again, `Give me the gun,''' 
Brinkley said. ``I saw him lower the barrel of the gun and I kept 
getting closer and closer to him. Then I held out my hands and he 
laid the gun in my hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then he gave me a real big bear hug and said `I'm so scared,  
I'm so scared,'' Brinkley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon was being held in an undisclosed juvenile detention  
center Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brinkley has been working at Heritage High since it opened in  
1976, and Thursday was to be his last full class day before his 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	His role in the surrender was no surprise to students or  
co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great guy -- strict but understanding,'' said senior  
Kent Cason, 19. ``He's by the book, but human about it too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is like a great umpire,'' Rockdale County school  
superintendent Donald Peccia said. ``He's doing a great job, and 
keeping things fair and disciplined, but you don't ever see him. He 
doesn't become the story.''

<HEADLINE> Veterinarian Uses Toy Cat in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLD BRIDGE, N.J. (AP) -- A veterinarian accused of cruelty to  
animals feverishly swung a toy cat in the courtroom to try to prove 
he did not flail a pet to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``My arm's getting tired,'' Howard Baker explained after about  
30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker maintained that he could not have grasped an 8-pound cat  
around the neck and kill it as prosecutors say he did. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker is charged with 16 counts of cruelty to animals.  
Investigators said he battered dogs and cats with a closed fist, 
chokeholds, even a pair of scissors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love animals,'' Baker testified Thursday. ``I don't know how  
I could give so much of my life -- 22 years -- and then be accused of 
abusing animals. It makes no sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, an assistant at his clinic who is a former  
employee of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals came 
forward with hidden-camera videotape of some of the alleged 
cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence includes a recording of Baker twice slapping a  
Dalmatian. The footage does not show the alleged cat-killing, which 
the PETA activist claims she witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Baker could get up to six months in prison and a  
$1,000 fine on each count.

<HEADLINE> No Record Tax Surplus Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers won't have another record-breaking  
``April surprise'' tax surplus to make their budgeting job easier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's $113.5 billion surplus last month was 8.9  
percent lower than the $124.6 billion posted in April 1998, the 
Treasury Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 and 1998, record surpluses for April -- the month that  
government coffers swell as Americans face the deadline to pay 
their income taxes -- provided lawmakers with an unexpected 
windfall. 
</P>
<P>
	That so-called April surprise helped congressional and White  
House negotiators reach agreement in 1997 on a five-year plan to 
balance the federal budget. Last year's surprise helped them 
achieve, ahead of schedule, the first annual budget surplus since 
1969 -- $69.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the lack of an April surprise this year, Clinton  
administration and congressional accountants are still predicting a 
bigger surplus -- between $79 billion and $111 billion -- overall for 
the government's fiscal year 1999, which began Oct. 1. For the 
first seven months of the fiscal year, through April, the surplus 
has totaled $64.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on track to reach the largest annual budget surplus  
ever,'' said President Clinton in a statement. But he added, 
``Despite the good news, this is not a time for complacency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's clear now, analysts say, that there won't be extra wiggle  
room for lawmakers struggling to make difficult choices among 
competing priorities for how to spend the surplus -- including 
shoring up Social Security, tax cuts Republicans want, domestic 
spending requested by Clinton and the conflict in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who was hoping for a sudden boost, a much bigger  
surplus that would provide them a little room to do something, it's 
just not going to be there,'' said Stanley Collender, senior vice 
president of the consulting firm Fleishman Hillard. ``Revenues are 
still growing substantially, they're just not growing as fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for the lower April surplus this year as compared to  
last April was a nearly 59 percent increase in tax refunds, to 
$36.6 billion. That reflects the new $400 per child credit and new 
credits for higher education as well as the increasing popularity 
of electronic filing and direct deposit, which offer speedier 
refunds than paper tax returns and paper checks. Year to date, tax 
refunds are up nearly 33 percent compared to the same period in 
fiscal 1998.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Companies Suing Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Cigarette makers are challenging Massachusetts'  
attempt to curtail tobacco marketing, arguing the multistate 
tobacco settlement already addresses concerns about advertising to 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Two companies filed federal lawsuits Friday against the  
first-in-the-nation effort by the state attorney general's office 
that would restrict tobacco advertising under the office's consumer 
protection powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Porter, an assistant attorney general, said Philip Morris  
and Lorillard filed the suits, and he said R.J. Reynolds and Brown 
&AMP; Williamson planned on filing similar actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter said the Philip Morris complaint claimed that the  
restrictions on cigarette advertising violated the First Amendment 
and were pre-empted by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attorney general intends vigorously to defend these cases  
and is firmly of the view that these regulations are lawful,'' 
Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris spokesman Brendan McCormick said the company had  
challenged sections of the consumer regulations ``which we feel 
unduly restrict our right to market our products to adults who 
choose to smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A message left for Lorillard attorney Richard Zielinski wasn't  
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts was a participant in the nationwide settlement of  
states' lawsuits against the tobacco industry. That settlement of 
claims for the costs of smoking-related illnesses is to bring the 
state $7.6 billion over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the settlement didn't guarantee a truce from the industry,  
said Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University 
who is chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may be the first truly nasty move since the settlement,''  
Daynard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Connolly, director of the state's tobacco control program,  
said the rules that were challenged restricted advertising near 
schools.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Lawyer Asks For New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Saying Dr. Jack Kevorkian's former attorney was  
more interested in talking to the media than performing his duties, 
his current lawyer has asked a judge to throw out Kevorkian's 
murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian attorney Mayer Morganroth filed a motion late Friday  
afternoon, asking Judge Jessica Cooper to throw out Kevorkian's 
conviction on charges of second-degree murder and delivery of a 
controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
	David Gorosh and Lisa Dwyer filed motions and argued for  
Kevorkian during his preliminary hearing. But the night before the 
trial began, Kevorkian decided to represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Morganroth alleged that Kevorkian acted as his own attorney out  
of frustration over the way Gorosh was handling the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he totally represented himself,'' Morganroth  
said. ``There's much more to it than meets the eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his motion, Morganroth wrote that Gorosh ``left his client  
without the legal information necessary to present a competent 
defense. ... Gorosh was more interested in talking to the media 
than the defense team and his client, Dr. Kevorkian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gorosh said there was no basis for Morganroth to make his claim.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see Dr. Kevorkian get a new trial, but not through  
a method that is untrue,'' Gorosh said. ``It was his own choice to 
defend himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who turns 71 next week, is in the Oaks Correctional  
Facility in Manistee, serving a 10- to 25-year sentence. He was 
found guilty March 26 of second-degree murder and delivery of a 
controlled substance in the injection death of Thomas Youk, a Lou 
Gehrig's disease patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian taped Youk's death on Sept. 17 and gave the video to  
CBS' ``60 Minutes.'' The tape and interview with Kevorkian the show 
later aired were the prosecution's key evidence. Kevorkian defended 
himself, making opening and closing arguments to the jury, but 
calling no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Morganroth, who had helped defend Kevorkian in two previous  
trials, dropped in on the last day of the criminal trial. Kevorkian 
asked for his help, and let Morganroth represent him during his 
sentencing. April 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that he (Morganroth) has apparently tried to  
manipulate what happened in this case without contacting me,'' 
Gorosh said.

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A casino security guard has filed a lawsuit  
against basketball star Dennis Rodman, accusing him of grabbing her 
breast while she was working at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>

	``At the time of sexually assaulting the plaintiff, the  
defendant was making lewd comments in the presence of numerous

	Ehlert seeks unspecified damages. A spokesman for Rodman did not  
return a phone call seeking comment Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Gore Hopes Gun Vote Boosts Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore hopes to turn his  
tie-breaking vote on gun control into a momentum-building moment 
that energizes his 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Senate deadlocked, Gore twice asked the clerk to  
announce a tie Thursday before casting the decisive vote to expand 
a system of background checks on firearms purchases so they would 
cover all such buys at gun shows and pawnshops. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could be a turning point for Gore in that he has finally  
shown some leadership on an issue and for once he stands apart from 
President Clinton,'' said Republican strategist Scott Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That vote says, `This is a guy who calls a tough shot,''' said  
Democratic Party chairman Roy Romer, former governor of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls suggest he wasn't taking a major risk. An overwhelming  
number of Americans -- and a slight majority of all Republicans -- 
are telling pollsters they favor some forms of gun control. And 
large majorities of Democratic and Republican women, a key voting 
bloc in the 2000 elections, say gun control is important. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thursday's vote was not about politics, it was about  
protecting America's kids,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said. 
``We'll continue to work to find solutions and answers in the 
aftermath of the school shootings to help give parents the tools 
they need to protect their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's upcoming schedule affords him a chance to build on the  
gun vote. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he'll attend a school safety event in New  
Hampshire, the state that holds the nation's first presidential 
primaries in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Gore plans to address a major labor union and a  
Jewish political action committee -- hitting two key constituencies 
in one day. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be in Atlanta on Monday, near the high school where a  
teen-ager opened fire Thursday and wounded six classmates. The 
topic of his address, the second major speech in eight days, will 
be the importance of faith-based institutions in helping government 
provide services to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the week, he is scheduled to be in Texas, the home of  
GOP front-runner Gov. George W. Bush.

<HEADLINE> O'Donnell Wins Talk Show Host Emmy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A tearful Rosie O'Donnell, fresh from her  
televised fight over gun control with Tom Selleck, won her third 
straight Daytime Emmy Award as best talk show host Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell paid tribute to Oprah Winfrey, who shared the award  
with her last year. Winfrey, who has won seven of the awards, took 
herself out of the running after getting a lifetime achievement 
award last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I one day hope to move through life with the grace and dignity  
of that woman -- Oprah Winfrey,'' said O'Donnell, as tears streamed 
down her face. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell has recently become a vocal advocate for gun control.  
She got into a verbal battle with National Rifle Association member 
Selleck when the actor came on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' this 
week to promote a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26th annual Daytime Emmy Awards were given out during a  
ceremony at New York's Theater at Madison Square Garden, televised 
on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-luck soap star Susan Lucci tried again to win best actress  
for her role as Erica Kane on ``All My Children.'' It was her 19th 
nomination for an award she's never won. 
</P>
<P>
	The irreverent Comedy Central show, ``Win Ben Stein's Money''  
won its first Emmy for best game show, beating more established 
shows like ``Jeopardy!'' and ``Wheel of Fortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Barker, host of ``The Price is Right,'' was given a lifetime  
achievement award and ended a personal Emmy boycott. He's stayed 
away for the past two years, miffed that one of the two major game 
show awards were given away off-camera. This year, the awards for 
best game show and game show host were part of the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker has been on ``The Price is Right'' since 1972, and was  
host of ``Truth or Consequences'' for 18 years before that. He's 
been named best game show host a record 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell ordered Barker, who's taped more than 5,000 shows in

<HEADLINE> Soap Star Lucci Finally Wins Emmy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After 18 nominations and 18 losses, hard-luck  
soap star Susan Lucci finally came up a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucci, whose status as a longtime loser often overshadowed her  
work, won the Daytime Emmy award for best actress Friday for 
portraying the villainous Erica Kane on ``All My Children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She sobbed as she received a standing ovation.  
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you very much. I truly never believed that this would  
happen,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucci's long-sought victory overshadowed a record-setting  
performance by ``General Hospital,'' which won eight awards. Rosie 
O'Donnell swept the major talk show awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucci was clearly the sentimental favorite, and was thought to  
have her best chance this year for her performances in a hospital 
vigil over her TV daughter, Bianca. When music played to get her to 
stop talking as she accepted the award, she plowed right through to 
thank her fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to go back to that studio Monday and I'm going to  
play Erica Kane for all it is worth,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards for ``General Hospital'' included its sixth for best  
soap opera. Anthony Geary, who won best actor in 1982 when his 
character Luke Spencer was a national sensation, won the award 
again. Jonathan Jackson, who plays his son Lucky, won his third 
award as best younger actor. Stuart Damon won best supporting 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
	A tearful O'Donnell won her third straight honor as best talk  
show host and also for best talk show. It was a boost for 
O'Donnell, who had a tense fight with actor Tom Selleck over gun 
control on her show this week. 
</P>
<P>
	She twice paid tribute to Oprah Winfrey, who shared the award  
with her last year. Winfrey, who has won seven of the awards, took 
herself out of the running after getting a lifetime achievement 
award last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I one day hope to move through life with the grace and dignity  
of that woman -- Oprah Winfrey,'' said O'Donnell, as tears streamed 
down her face. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26th annual Daytime Emmy Awards were given out during a  
ceremony at New York's Theater at Madison Square Garden, televised 
on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Barker, host of ``The Price is Right,'' was given a lifetime  
achievement award and ended a personal Emmy boycott. He's stayed 
away for the past two years, miffed that one of the two major game 
show awards were given away off-camera. This year, the awards for 
best game show and game show host were part of the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker has been on ``The Price is Right'' since 1972, and was  
host of ``Truth or Consequences'' for 18 years before that. He's 
been named best game show host a record 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell ordered Barker, who's taped more than 5,000 shows in  
his career, to ``come on down'' for his award. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I had a refrigerator for every one of you,'' Barker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't win a record 11th award, however. Ben Stein and Jimmy  
Kimmel, hosts of Comedy Central's irreverent ``Win Ben Stein's 
Money,'' won their first Emmys. It was also named best game show, 
beating more established fare like ``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of 
Fortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Young and the Restless'' won a total of six awards,  
including Heather Tom as younger actress and Sharon Case as 
supporting actress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disney Presents Bill Nye the Science Guy'' won its first award  
for best childrens' series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to thank everyone for helping us celebrate the  
passion, beauty and joy -- the PB&AMP;J -- of science,'' Nye said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Emmys snubbed top-rated Jerry Springer and his raucous talk  
show. The winners are selected by members of the Academy of 
Television Arts and Sciences and the Academy of Television Arts and 
Sciences.

<HEADLINE> City Schools Escape Shooting Sprees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Every morning, Maria Marino passes gang turf on  
her way to Clemente High School. There she walks through a metal 
detector. There she passes five security guards. There she feels 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
	A shooting in her school? The 17-year-old senior thinks not.  
</P>
<P>
	``It could happen anywhere,'' she conceded Friday, ``but I just  
don't imagine it happening here. I feel comfortable here. I think 
there's more possibilities for it to happen in the neighborhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the mass school shootings that have horrified the nation  
since 1997, a striking similarity has emerged: The tragedies have 
occurred in quiet and mostly white suburban or rural communities -- 
Littleton, Colo., Jonesboro, Ark., Conyers, Ga. -- not big cities 
typically associated with teen violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts say urban schools, while struggling with gangs and  
drugs, have so far escaped random shooting sprees for some basic 
reasons: 
</P>
<P>
	-- In the city, a teen-ager with a gun is automatically thought  
to be up to no good. That's not always the case in rural or 
suburban areas where people go hunting or take target practice. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Violence in the city tends to be aimed at individuals more  
often than it is unleashed indiscriminately. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Perhaps most important, security is tighter.  
</P>
<P>
	``Urban schools have had to deal with the issue of violence for  
a longer period of time,'' said Joanne McDaniel, research director 
of the Center for the Prevention of School Violence in Raleigh, 
N.C. ``They may not be able to make a safe neighborhood, but at 
least they can make school a safe haven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many city schools have conflict and anger management programs,  
mentoring and metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	At Clemente, on Chicago's near West Side, security officials say  
they have not found a gun since metal detectors were installed two 
years ago. ``Mostly it's knives and pagers and lighters,'' said 
Steve Garcia, the school's security supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about a quarter of the nation's largest 55 to 60 districts  
used metal detectors in the early 1990s; more than 95 percent do 
now, according to Ronald Stephens, director of the National School 
Safety Center in Westlake Village, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Stephens cited a recent government study showing that  
only 4 percent of all school districts nationwide had metal 
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The cramped urban setting may itself serve as a deterrent. The  
Jonesboro school, for example, had a wooded area from which the 
attack was launched. Columbine High School in Littleton had a large 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine trying to bring in 30 bombs and all that weaponry in a  
Chicago high school,'' as was done in Columbine, said Laurence 
Steinberg, a psychology professor at Temple University and director 
of the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Adolescent 
Development and Juvenile Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	School safety experts note that while big-city schools still are  
more violent than rural or suburban ones, urban gangs tend to 
target rivals or other specific victims, rather than launching 
random assaults. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, ``gangs in urban areas typically do not see the  
schoolhouse as the place to carry out their turf war,'' Mrs. 
McDaniel said. ``They're going to do that in the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts also say city kids obtain guns usually to commit  
crimes, while suburban and rural teens frequently own weapons for 
hunting and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gun culture is different'' outside the cities, said Paul  
Gray, a professor of sociology at Boston College. ``It normalizes 
the possession and use of a gun.'' He added: ``My kids never see me 
doing target practice. I don't belong to a gun club. I don't 
identify weapons with self-protection or leisure activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the gunmen in the school shootings have been white boys or  
young men, leading some sociologists to speculate about a growing 
sense of isolation and alienation among suburban teens who may 
enjoy material comforts but have troubled relationships with their 
peers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Though urban schools have been spared mass shootings, many  
experts caution against assuming that such tragedies can't -- or 
won't -- happen there. And some also say inner-city violence is 
often overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Columbine High massacre happened in the inner city, ``I'm  
not sure it would have gotten the same media attention,'' said Ron 
Astor, professor of social work and education at the University of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he added, ``If it happens at 3:30, after the bell rings,  
then it's called community violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Chicago's Clemente High, 16-year-old Darnell Ivy shook his  
head Friday when he heard the recent reports about the Georgia 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, `Just more crazy kids.' There's some of those  
here,'' he said. Then he paused and added: ``They're not so 
different from us.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> AOL Chief Faces Microsoft Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steve Case, America Online's billionaire  
chairman and one of the few executives to succeed in the shadow of 
Microsoft, was facing questions under oath today from the software 
giant about his nearly $10 billion purchase of Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Case, who was being questioned by lawyers at a hotel in downtown  
Washington, has already said he doesn't expect to offer any new 
information relevant to the government's antitrust case against 
Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing there (involving Netscape) has anything to do with  
operating systems, which, as best I can tell, is the focus of that 
trial,'' said Case, who also is chief executive officer of America 
Online Inc., the world's largest Internet provider, with nearly 18 
million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge who will deliver the trial's verdict has already  
expressed interest in hearing from Case about his plans for 
Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer that saw its 
business wane after Microsoft started giving away its own browser 
software free with its dominant Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that the purchase of Netscape illustrates  
that competition is healthy in the high-tech industry, and that a 
judge's intervention is unnecessary. It claims the sale undermines 
allegations that Netscape could be prevented from distributing its 
software, saying it expects AOL eventually to ship the Netscape 
browser to all its subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier deposition testimony, AOL's Barry Schuler  
acknowledged that a senior executive privately warned a top 
government lawyer weeks before the trial's start that AOL was 
actively involved in sensitive negotiations with Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schuler, president of AOL's Interactive Services Group,  
denied AOL gave the Justice Department full details of its plans. 
The government said previously that it didn't know about the merger 
until November, after witnesses for both AOL and Netscape had 
testified against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters were being allowed to attend at least part of Case's  
questioning because of an obscure 1913 law covering antitrust 
depositions, which are normally conducted in private. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of the trial in January, weeks after the AOL  
purchase of Netscape was announced, U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson surprised the courtroom when he introduced a 
newspaper interview with Case as Court Exhibit No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge even hinted to lawyers from both sides they might  
consider calling Case as one of the final witnesses in the trial, 
although neither side ultimately agreed. The trial resumes June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In that interview with The Washington Post, Case denied that AOL  
intends to compete with Microsoft in the market for computer 
operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no flight of fancy that we can dent in any way, shape  
or form what is a monopoly in the operating system business,'' Case 
told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Like some other major companies, such as IBM Corp., AOL  
maintains a schizophrenic relationship with Microsoft -- partners in 
some areas but bitter rivals in others. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's software requires Windows, making the company somewhat  
reliant on Microsoft. And under a March 1996 deal, AOL agreed to 
distribute Microsoft's browser to all its subscribers in exchange 
for having its own software made available with Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But AOL has roundly trumped Microsoft in the popularity of its  
MSN online service, which stagnates with about 2 million 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of AOL has always been an aggravation to Microsoft  
Chairman Bill Gates, who warned Case in the early 1990s: ``I can 
buy 20 percent of you or I can buy all of you. Or I can go into 
this business myself and bury you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with its purchase of Netscape, AOL now owns Microsoft's  
chief browser rival and the popular Netcenter Web site. The latest 
figures from Media Metrix Inc., which tracks Internet visitors, 
showed AOL's site was the second-most popular on the Web, and 
Netscape's was sixth. MSN's site was third, and Microsoft's 
corporate page was seventh.

<HEADLINE>  Stars-Avalanche Set To Face Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Ed Belfour of the Dallas Stars is intent on  
shaking his reputation as a goaltender who can't win the big one. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be no better way to do it than by outdueling  
Colorado's Patrick Roy in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	When the series begins Saturday, Belfour and Roy will be going  
head-to-head in the playoffs for the first time since a 1996 
second-round series between Colorado and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour and the Blackhawks won the first game. Then he  
contracted food poisoning and missed Game 2. When he returned, 
Belfour played great, but Roy was even better as the Avalanche went 
on to win the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	That title further cemented Roy's status as the gold standard of  
goalies. It was the third time his name went on the trophy and it 
came under the pressure of having been acquired at midseason 
specifically for that type of postseason leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy did it again last round as Colorado went from being down 2-0  
as the series shifted to Detroit, then winning four straight to 
eliminate the two-time defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no better playoff performer than Patrick,'' Avalanche  
coach Bob Harley said. ``He feels that pressure. He lives for that 
pressure. He can handle that pressure while raising his own game 
and force the guys around him to raise their own game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is what a true leader will do for a hockey club.''  
</P>
<P>
	Dallas gave Belfour a three-year, $10 million contract last  
season to be that kind of leader. He lived up to the challenge as 
the Stars rode their hot goalie to the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with the series 1-1, Belfour made mental blunders in  
consecutive games that led directly to Detroit goals. The Red Wings 
won the series in six games and back came the talk that the 
ultra-intense Belfour couldn't put a team over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour's pattern of grand success followed by failure began in  
1992 when he helped Chicago win 11 straight playoff games, then was 
swept by Pittsburgh in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Belfour became just the fifth goalie with multiple  
40-win seasons, then lost four straight in the playoffs. Another 
one-round exit followed in '94. Chicago reached the finals again in 
1995, but Detroit won three overtime games to advance. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this postseason, Belfour has been superb. His 1.68  
goals-against average is best among the four remaining playoff 
goalies and he and Roy are tied for the best save percentage at 
.929. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little things aren't bothering him,'' said Mike Keane, who was  
traded to Colorado with Roy in 1995 and joined Dallas last season. 
``Some teams have tried to get under Eddie's skin, but he's not 
really worried about stuff like he was last year. He won't take a 
whack at a guy or start chirping at them. He's just stopping pucks. 
That's what we need from Eddie Belfour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Belfour won't be spooked by  
having Roy in the opposite net, but also said he doesn't expect his 
goalie to be motivated by Roy's presence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Eddie's gone a long ways past that now,'' Hitchcock  
said. ``Eddie's more into the light at the end of the tunnel. I 
think his own personal challenges are within, and they're all 
structured around our team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just see him more focused on his job and not on the  
peripheral stuff that comes with this business. I watch his 
routine. He wastes no extra energy on any other area that is not 
relevant to winning hockey games. I think being able to do that is 
what makes special athletes special.''

<HEADLINE> Olivetti Telecom Takeover Nearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Olivetti narrowly clinched a majority stake in  
Telecom Italia today, clearing the way for completion of the 
hostile $64 billion takeover of Italy's No. 1 phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	By garnering 51 percent of Telecom's shares, Olivetti apparently  
avoids having to battle Telecom's current management for control -- 
a contentious outcome that industry analyst Dwayne Taylor of Robert 
Fleming Securities described as a ``lawyers' dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italian stock market officials said late Friday in Milan that  
Olivetti had secured an unspecified majority stake in Telecom. The 
announcement came after officials toted up the results from the 
last day of the offer by Olivetti, a diversified communications and 
office products business. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Olivetti had less than 20 percent of Telecom's  
shares. But on the final day for securing shareholder backing for 
its upstart effort, most of Telecom Italia's strongest supporters 
jumped ship. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a dramatic climax to the largest unfriendly corporate  
takeover ever launched in Europe, in which Olivetti took aim at a 
target five times its size. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud of the market response to our offer. This confirms  
the seriousness and the transparency of Olivetti's industrial 
project,'' Olivetti's chief executive, Roberto Colaninno, said in a 
statement. ``The positive conclusion ... signals the beginning of a 
new, great industrial history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result surpassed the 35 percent threshold Olivetti said it  
needed to press ahead with its plan to acquire Italy's former 
government-run telephone monopoly for 11.5 euros per share, or 
$12.15 at current exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno had said he might call off the bid if his company  
failed to gain 67 percent of Telecom's shares. Now, with a majority 
stake in Telecom, he is almost certain to push ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colaninno has put a lot into this, and he's not going to back  
out,'' said Taylor of the London-based brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti will hold a board meeting Saturday to assess the  
outcome of the takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco Bernabe, the Telecom chief executive, said it is now up  
to the company's shareholders to determine its future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my hope that they can give the company another push in  
the short term, to surpass the goals already reached and to create 
value from the many human and technological resources at their 
disposal,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But another Telecom Italia official held out the possibility  
that Franco Bernabe, the Telecom chief executive, might be willing 
to negotiate a power-sharing arrangement with Colaninno. The 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Bernabe had 
refused until now to negotiate because Colaninno had not made any 
overtures. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the day's biggest disappointments for Telecom were the  
defections of almost all of its core shareholders, an investor 
group organized when Telecom was privatized in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Assicurazioni Generali, Italy's largest insurer, said it  
tendered all its Telecom shares, equal to 1 percent of the total 
number outstanding, while San Paulo IMI, a bank, turned over 0.8 
percent. Another bank, Unicredito, tendered 0.7 percent of 
Telecom's shares, and IFIL, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli 
industrial dynasty, gave up 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one core shareholder, Credit Suisse Group, said it would  
stick with Telecom's current management. 
</P>
<P>
	In another blow to Telecom, Olivetti said Friday that the  
European Union Commission had approved the sale of its stake in 
Italian mobile phone operator Omnitel. Olivetti is counting on the 
sale to Germany's Mannesmann to generate much of the cash it needs 
to finance its takeover of Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's result also appears to doom Telecom Italia's proposed  
defensive merger with its German counterpart, Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies announced plans for a friendly merger in  
April, but since then the deal has met with resistance from Italian 
leaders, who fear that the German government might try to influence 
the merged companies through its majority ownership of Deutsche 
Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	A Deutsche Telekom official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Friday the company still hopes to merge with Telecom Italia 
despite Olivetti's successful offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors also have reacted skeptically to the union,  
saying it lacks commercial logic. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts have raised similar questions about Olivetti's  
own effort. Like the proposed German-Italian merger, Olivetti's bid 
was a deal ``done on the run'' that depended more on personal and 
corporate politics than on economic fundamentals, said Mark Horn of 
the London-based stock brokerage T. Hoare Canaccord. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where along the line here does anyone talk about earnings,  
about value? You need political analysts for this one, not 
financial analysts.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Secrets Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from classified documents that appear in the appendix  
of ``Betrayal,'' an account of Clinton administration national 
security policy by Bill Gertz, a reporter for The Washington Times. 
The book is published by Regnery Publishing Inc. of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	--A Dec. 10, 1996, report by the Air Force National Air  
Intelligence Center stamped ``Secret'' describes how China, under a 
contract with U.S. communications company Motorola, developed a 
space launcher to send satellites into Earth orbit. But the Air 
Force analysis called these satellite launchers a ``technology 
bridge'' to launchers for multiple-warhead missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no data, however, that the Chinese have embarked on  
the development of'' such a missile launcher, the report said. 
``The Chinese have expressed an interest in developing'' such 
technology, the report also noted, ``however, no known testing of 
such a system has occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mostly Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices retreated Friday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid perceptions weather will remain 
favorable for farmer fieldwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures faced continued pressure from the early harvesting  
of winter wheat crops, where farmers were reporting above-average 
yields. Corn futures sank amid expectations the government next 
week will report the pace of planting accelerated following 
generally clear skies in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans retreated after a National Oilseed Processors  
Association report showed an anemic pace for crushing soybeans into 
oil and meal. Futures prices also were pressured by expectations 
the pace of soybean plantings will accelerate next week. Farmers 
are expected to plant record acreage, setting the stage for a 
bumper fall harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 4 cents to $2.52 1/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 3/4 cent to $2.18 1/2 a bushel; July oats fell 1 cent to 
$1.20 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 6 1/4 cents to $4.61 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeder cattle and lean hogs were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while live cattle advanced and pork bellies retreated.

	June live cattle rose .65 cent to 63.52 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .40 cent to 75.02 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .40 cent to 56.90 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .45 
cent to 53.60 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Try to Savor Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Winning the Stanley Cup is the first  
priority for Joe Juneau. Enjoying the experience of the playoffs is 
also important to the Buffalo Sabres center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some games you're not going to win, but you still have to  
catch the moment and be able to look back at it,'' Juneau said. 
``There's always good moments in a hockey game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau hopes there will be more good moments than bad for the  
Sabres when they open the Eastern Conference final Sunday at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau stored away a few highlights last season, when he made it  
to the Stanley Cup final with the Washington Capitals. One was an 
overtime goal in Game 6 that gave the Capitals the Eastern 
Conference title, and ended the season for his current team. 
</P>
<P>
	The center was dealt to Buffalo in March and has nine points --  
two goals, seven assists -- in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau recalled a chat he had a few years back with buddy  
Patrick Roy, the Colorado goalie getting ready to lead the 
Avalanche against Dallas in the Western Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said it was not to win the Cup ... the more fun he had was  
actually during the time -- the good times he had getting there,'' 
Juneau said of Roy, who has played for three Stanley Cup winners. 
``And it's just the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a philosophy shared by coach Lindy Ruff, who encourages his  
team to appreciate its accomplishments while working hard to 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the requirements. You've got to have fun,'' Ruff  
said after Thursday's practice. ``It's work hard, have fun and 
enjoy it. We want them to enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the players know the difference between work and play,  
captain Michael Peca says. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Ruff) gives us the days off to do whatever we want, whether  
it's play some golf or something like that,'' he said, ``but the 
day before the series starts, it's back to business and focus on 
our jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peca said that concentration has been stronger during this  
playoff run than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we thought we accomplished something getting to the  
conference finals. This year we're not satisfied with anything 
we've done,'' he said. ``We're happy with the progress we've made 
over the course of the postseason, but we want to go all the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's being very, very businesslike about it and it's  
good to see that attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres, looking for their first Stanley Cup, play the first  
two games of the best-of-7 series at Toronto, which hasn't won the 
cup since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	In five regular-season meetings, Buffalo won the first three and  
Toronto the next two.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise Sharply After Worry / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds rose sharply Friday after a week of worry  
about rising inflation and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 1/32  
point, or $10.31 1/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.75 percent, down from late 
Thursday's 5.83 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds have struggled over the past week after a report on May 14  
showed a surprisingly big jump in consumer prices during April. 
Then, on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve revealed a shift in stance 
toward boosting interest rates to slow the economy and protect 
against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The news has weighed heavily on fixed-income investments, which  
are less appealing in times of inflation or when rising interest 
rates make the payoff on existing bonds less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Friday, prices of short-term Treasuries ranged  
from 1/8 to 1/4 point higher, and intermediate maturities ranged from 
7/16 to 23/32 point higher, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 4.59 percent from  
late Thursday's 4.60 percent, while its discount fell 0.01 
percentage point to 4.47 percent. Six-month yields were unchanged 
at 4.75 percent as the discount held steady at 4.57 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One-year yields dropped to 4.81 percent from late Thursday's  
4.85 percent, while the discount fell 0.03 percentage point to 4.59 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.69 percent from 4.75 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 3/16 point 122 7/32. The average yield 
to maturity edged lower to 5.35 percent from late Thursday's 5.36 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Lackluster Baseball Crop in Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The search is on for the next Mark McGwire and Randy Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
	And they might be found at the high school level, according to  
major league scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	While the last five No. 1 picks of the amateur draft have been  
college players, the names mentioned most often this year are those 
of high school players. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Beckett, a right-hander from Spring (Texas) H.S., and Josh  
Hamilton, a 6-foot-4, 200-pound outfielder from Athens Drive (N.C.) 
H.S., are pre-draft favorites to be selected first on June 2. B.J. 
Garbe, an outfielder/right-hander from Moses Lake (Wash.) H.S. is 
expected to be a top-five pick. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's college crop lacks position players, scouts say.  
</P>
<P>
	``From a college standpoint, it's a very below-average field,''  
said Dan Jennings, scouting director for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 
who pick first. ``There are some decent college arms in the mix, 
though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	College players expected to be chosen early include: Southern  
California catcher Eric Munson, Northeast Louisiana right-hander 
Ben Sheets, North Carolina righty Kyle Snyder, Mississippi State 
right-hander Matt Ginter and Washington righty Jeff Heaverlo. 
</P>
<P>
	Munson, who missed 21 games with a broken hand, is the top  
college position player available. However, scouts are undecided 
whether he will be a catcher or move elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheets has an outstanding curveball, and his fastball hits 93-94  
mph. Heaverlo is a strikeout artist who has good genes -- his dad, 
Dave, was a major league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, a 6-8, 215-pounder, lost some velocity because of  
tendinitis. Ginter has a terrific sinker and is projected to be a 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami shortstop Bobby Hill, Providence outfielder Keith Reed and  
North Carolina shortstop Brian Roberts are other college position 
players mentioned as possible first-round selections. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor's Jason Jennings, the nation's premier two-way college  
player, is expected to be a first-round pick, but as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scouts predict that up to 20 of the 30 first-round  
selections may be high school players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably talentwise, it could very well shape up that way,''  
Jennings said. ``It really comes down to organizational 
philosophies. With us picking first, we just want to get the best 
player in the country, whether it's a high school player or a 
college player.''

	 *ABSENT EAST:* The expansion of the Division I tournament to 64  
teams this year was aimed at garnering interest in areas that 
traditionally lacked large fan bases. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Division I baseball committee announced the sites  
of the 16 four-team regionals that begin May 28 -- and the Northeast 
was missing from the list. 
</P>
<P>
	The regional hosts are Alabama, Arkansas, Auburn, Baylor,  
Florida State, Houston, Louisiana State, Miami, Notre Dame, Ohio 
State, Southern California, Stanford, Texas A&AMP;M, Texas Tech, Wake 
Forest, and Wichita State. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee chairman Dick Rockwell said 29 schools placed regional  
bids -- none from the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We set up some things basically to help the Northeast and  
nobody stepped forward,'' said Rockwell, athletic director at Le 
Moyne College in Syracuse, N.Y. The bid amount was lowered from 
$50,000 to $35,000, and fields are no longer required to have 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think sooner or later, those of us in the Northeast have to  
realize that we've been given an opportunity to step up to the 
plate, and didn't get it done,'' Rockwell said.

	 *BATTLE OF THE BATS:* The crack of the bat is being heard at the  
NCAA Division III tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The six teams in the Mid-Atlantic regional -- Rowan, Montclair  
St., William Paterson and the College of New Jersey, all members of 
the New Jersey Athletic Conference, as well as Widener (Pa.) and 
Ursinus (Pa.) -- agreed to use wooden bats in the double-elimination 
tournament, which began Thursday. The regional will be the only one 
using wood exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision comes amid controversy. The NJAC banned aluminum  
bats this season and conference athletic directors voted 6-4 to 
boycott the Division III tournament because of the use of aluminum. 
The four schools chosen for the regional decided to participate 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The schools may ultimately face penalties by the conference  
because the winner of the regional advances to the Division III 
World Series in Salem, Va., beginning May 28, and will have to play 
with aluminum bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other schools, Wisconsin-Oshkosh and Wisconsin-Stevens Point  
in the Midwest regional, are also using wooden bats. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SEMINOLE SLUGGER:* Marshall McDougall's stock may have risen a  
bit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida State second baseman, who hit six consecutive homers  
and drove in 16 runs -- both NCAA records -- in a 26-2 rout of 
Maryland on May 10, has already been drafted twice. He is projected 
to be selected in the first few rounds this year. 
</P>
<P>
	McDougall was drafted out of Buchholz (Fla.) High School in the  
33rd round by the Chicago White Sox in 1996. The following year, he 
was drafted out of Santa Fe Community College by the New York 
Yankees in the 37th round. 
</P>
<P>
	McDougall, who hit just 12 homers in his first two college  
seasons at Sante Fe, was hitting .441 with an Atlantic Coast 
Conference-leading 24 homers and 92 RBIs going into the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Susan B. Anthony Dollar Is Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eighteen years after the U.S. Mint stopped  
churning out the Susan B. Anthony dollar -- and just months before a 
gussied-up younger cousin makes its debut -- the once-unloved coin 
is making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy demand for the Susan B in snack machines and subways has  
exhausted the supply, prompting the Mint to decide Thursday to 
produce a final ``1999'' encore run. 
</P>
<P>
	The government struck 857 million coins with the 19th century  
suffragette on the face from 1979 to 1981, but found itself stuck 
with 550 million of them when production ended. Many people 
complained the Susan B dollar was too easily mistaken for a quarter 
because of its look and feel. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, with many vending machines, Postal Service stamp  
dispensers and city subway systems accepting the dollar coin, Mint 
officials are vowing to keep them in supply until the debut early 
next year of the new Sacagawea dollar coin, which also can be used 
in vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're committed to providing an uninterrupted supply of dollar  
coins through this transition,'' Mint Director Philip N. Diehl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new dollar coin, graced with an image of Shoshone Indian  
woman who helped the Lewis and Clark Expedition, also can be used 
in vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sacagawea dollar coin will be the same size as the Susan B,  
but have a gold-colored surface and a smooth rim. The ridge-edged, 
silver-colored Susan B was considered too quarter-like. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the Susan B depicts the women's rights leader in stern  
profile, the Sacagawea coin shows the teen-ager who helped the 
Lewis &AMP; Clark expedition glancing back over her shoulder, her 
infant son asleep in a carrier on her back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mint has not yet determined how many new Susan Bs to strike  
or when the process will begin, and spokesman Michael White wasn't 
sure if officials had estimated how much it would cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Some coin collectors were quick to hail the Susan B's return.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of good news,'' said Ed Rochette, executive director  
of the American Numismatic Association, a 108-year-old society of 
coin collectors. ``It will make it easier for the Sacagawea 
dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rochette, reciting a common collector's prejudice against the $1  
bill, said coins don't stand much chance of wide usage as long as 
the bill remains in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Many coin collectors and some members of Congress long have  
campaigned for an end to the dollar bill, claiming that while paper 
money is cheaper to produce than coins, it wears out more quickly 
and thus costs the government more in the long run.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel OKs `Sweepstakes' Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sweepstakes companies would be required to  
assure consumers that they need not purchase mail-order merchandise 
in order to win big prizes under legislation pending before the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee approved the bill by  
voice vote Thursday, sending it to the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation is aimed at stopping deceptive sweepstakes  
offers designed to induce consumers to spend money on products they 
don't want or need in the mistaken belief the purchases will 
improve their chances of winning, said the bill's sponsor, Sen. 
Susan Collins, R-Maine. Sweepstakes sponsors who fail to comply 
would face stiff fines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sweepstakes in this country for many Americans have become a  
cruel joke,'' Collins said. ``Many Americans are overwhelmed with 
sweepstakes solicitations that promise large winnings and deliver 
only empty entreaties for more purchases of unneeded products and 
entries into even more sweepstakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During hearings in March, elderly people told the Senate  
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations how they sometimes spent 
thousands of dollars buying magazines and merchandise in pursuit of 
multimillion-dollar cash prizes, cars and exotic vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also heard from representatives of Publishers  
Clearing House, Reader's Digest, American Family Enterprises and 
Time who defended their practices, contending they have voluntarily 
changed their mailings and are making efforts to identify the small 
segment of Americans who don't understand the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deception here is disgraceful. It happens too  
frequently,'' bill co-sponsor Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said 
Thursday. ``This will be very protective of people, especially 
senior citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would require sweepstakes companies to include language  
in their mailings that ``clearly and conspicuously'' state that no 
purchase is necessary to win and making a purchase will not 
increase the chances of winning. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would require sweepstakes sponsors to include rules and  
entry procedures in language that is easy to read, understand and 
locate. Consumers also must be told the odds of winning each prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar requirements would be imposed on sponsors of contests --  
puzzles, games or other competitions that require skill to solve 
and may require an entry fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweepstakes sponsors would have to establish a system allowing  
consumers to call a toll-free number to learn how to be removed 
from their mailing lists. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also takes aim at mailed advertisements that look like  
checks or mail from a government agency. The bill would require 
those mailings to include statements that the ``checks'' have no 
cash value and are not negotiable or that the mailings have no 
connection the government. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 335.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Prison Staffer Probed in Escape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Racy photos of a former prison psychologist  
found in the cell of one of two escapees have led to questions 
about whether she helped the men once they scaled a fence topped 
with razor wire and fled. 
</P>
<P>
	State police are investigating Elizabeth Feil, 43, in connection  
with the escape Tuesday of Byron Lester Smoot and Gregory Lee 
Lawrence, said Ms. Feil's lawyer, Isaac Dixon. Both inmates were 
recaptured two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the inmates had at least one accomplice, but they  
wouldn't say if they believed it was Ms. Feil. Dixon declined to 
provide his client's whereabouts, and she has not been charged in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Feil's husband, Glenn Bosshard, accused his wife of having  
an affair with Smoot. Bosshard based his allegations on photos of 
his wife that were found in Smoot's cell at the Maryland 
Correctional Institution in Jessup. 
</P>
<P>
	In the photographs, taken 11 years ago while the couple was on  
vacation, Ms. Feil is dressed in black lingerie and a garter belt, 
Bosshard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are estranged as of two days ago,'' he said Friday. ``Up  
until that point, I thought we were deeply in love. You have no 
idea how devastated I am by this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State troopers came to his Annapolis home early Wednesday  
morning and told him that his wife was a suspect in the escape, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence, 39, was serving a life sentence for murder after  
shooting a man and stealing his shoes in 1978. Smoot, 38, was 
imprisoned for a rash of armed robberies and was sentenced to 29 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men walked past an unmanned guard tower and scaled two  
fences, one topped with razor wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Feil was employed as a psychologist at the Patuxent  
Institution maximum-security prison in Jessup, but was fired over a 
year ago, according to Bosshard. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told me she had been fired because she was trying to  
institute a program for better inmate conditions,'' said Bosshard. 
``I had no reason not to believe her.''

<HEADLINE> Many Plan To Withdraw Cash for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most people in a new survey say they  
anticipate little effect from the Year 2000 computer problem on 
their bank accounts -- but that's not stopping them from setting 
aside a little extra cash in the days before New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
	A new Gallup poll of 1,606 adults, released Friday, showed that  
the vast majority -- nearly 79 percent -- said they fully expect the 
Y2K problem to have ``little or no impact'' on their personal 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
	But almost two-thirds of them said they expect to set aside  
extra cash in the days before the date rollover, though most said 
it won't be a large amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, banking regulators worried about the Y2K readiness of  
a big ATM service company in the West have ordered it to get in 
shape by June 30 or face possible contract cancellations by its 750 
bank customers. The Federal Reserve and four other agencies ordered 
TransAlliance LP to better prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll's findings reflect a shift in the nation's mood -- from  
early fears of Y2K problems causing widespread failures to more 
recent views that the date rollover will more likely present 
scattered inconveniences. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted by telephone, was commissioned by Star  
Systems Inc., the nation's largest electronic banking network, with 
its Honor and Star automated teller machines, which serve 79 
million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the public is becoming more confident as they learn  
more about Y2K preparations, including testing, that the financial 
and electronic funds transfer industries have been making,'' said 
Ronald V. Congemi, Star's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Congemi said the results showed 80 percent of people expect to  
be able to conduct transactions at ATMs or grocery stores and gas 
stations on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're excited that consumer confidence has risen so high,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government experts have lauded the nation's financial industry  
for its work preparing for the technology problem, when some 
computers originally programmed to recognize only the last two 
digits of a year could interpret 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Most financial institutions -- which are federally regulated --  
have set June 30 as a target date for completing all their Y2K 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-four percent of those surveyed said they plan to withdraw  
extra cash before Jan. 1, but 52 percent said the amount won't 
exceed what they typically spend for a weekday, weekend or holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, these people will follow the advice of numerous  
government and consumer organizations, recommending that people 
make any withdrawals in small increments well in advance of Dec. 
31,'' Congemi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey was conducted April 7-22, and has a margin  
of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> GE Recalls 9,100 Light Fixtures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Electric is recalling about 9,100  
fluorescent light fixtures because they were improperly assembled 
and could give consumers electrical shocks, the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12- and 24-inch models of GE ``Ultra Thin Line'' products  
fit beneath cabinets and are wired directly into the electrical 
system of the home. No injuries resulting from the use of the 
lights have been reported, CPSC said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fixtures being recalled are white and have ``GE Lighting''  
and a model number written on a sticker beneath the plastic bulb 
guard. The models subject to the recall are 23039, 27278, 23045 and 
27281. Fixtures plugged into wall sockets are not included in the 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
	The lights were sold from February 1998 through April 1999 for  
about $35 at Home Depot, Hechingers, Payless Cashways and other 
home center and hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are advised to turn power off at the breaker switch  
before examining the product. They should also call GE Home 
Electric Products to have an electrician replace the fixture. For 
more information, they may call GE at (800) 517-9602 weekdays 
between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. CDT.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Pushing Ahead on Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux stuck to his decision not to  
work for SMG and Fox Sports Pittsburgh when he met with the 
companies regarding their proposals to save the bankrupt Pittsburgh 
Penguins, his attorney said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, the former center who led the team to two Stanley Cups,  
and the two companies have released rival plans for reorganizing 
the team and keeping it in Pittsburgh. The SMG-Fox plan would have 
Lemieux work for the companies, but Lemieux is still pushing for 
his own plan, said attorney Chuck Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mario made clear to them that he intends to pursue the Lemieux  
plan but that he intends to resolve issues with SMG and Fox so that 
the Lemieux plan can go,'' Greenberg said. ``He discussed with them 
ways of working out issues within the context of the Lemieux 
plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Tom Murphy urged Lemieux and the companies this week to  
somehow combine their two plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``SMG won't comment publicly on negotiations but we are  
cooperating fully with Mayor Murphy and will talk with any group 
that shares our goal of saving the Penguins for Pittsburgh,'' SMG 
spokesman Steve Halvonik said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Fox spokesman did not immediately return a call for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	A plan from the NHL calls for breaking up the team and moving it  
from Pittsburgh if neither of the other plans are approved. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG's $24 million lease and the Penguins' broadcasting deal with  
Fox have been cited as reasons the team filed for protection from 
its creditors last October. 
</P>
<P>
	In his plan, submitted to U.S. Bankruptcy Court in March,  
Lemieux anticipates new agreements between the team and the 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In their plan, submitted Tuesday, SMG and Fox say they would  
make concessions that would mean an extra $5 million a year for the 
team above the already signed deals. 
</P>
<P>
	It also calls for Lemieux to be chairman of the team's  
management committee for $3 million up front, a 5 percent equity 
stake in the team with the possibility of another 5 percent in 
three years, and a salary of $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, however, issued a statement after the plan was  
submitted saying he would not work for the companies.

<HEADLINE> AOL Chief Defends Talks With Gov't. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steve Case, America Online's billionaire  
chairman, today called ``ridiculous'' suggestions that AOL plotted 
with the government to say when the Justice Department first 
learned of his $10 billion purchase of Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Case was interviewed today in preparation for the next phase of  
the trial of the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft 
Corp. Microsoft lawyers focused on AOL's $9.9 billion purchase of 
Internet pioneer Netscape, which was publicly announced last 
November, after executives from both AOL and Netscape testified 
against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Case acknowledged that a senior AOL executive privately warned a  
top government lawyer in October that AOL was involved in 
``sensitive negotiations'' with Netscape. Case said the notice 
given to the government ``struck me as a reasonable thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Case defended AOL's conversation with Justice Department lawyer  
David Boies, saying that if trial testimony approached the secret 
negotiations, ``We would have some problems and have to object to 
those questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a complicated three-ring circus to coordinate. We  
didn't want any premature disclosure to leak out,'' Case said. 
</P>
<P>
	Case, who was questioned by lawyers at a hotel in downtown  
Washington, has already said he doesn't expect to offer any new 
information relevant to the government's case against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing there (involving Netscape) has anything to do with  
operating systems, which, as best I can tell, is the focus of that 
trial,'' said Case, who also is chief executive officer of America 
Online Inc., the world's largest Internet provider, with nearly 18 
million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge who will deliver the trial's verdict has already  
expressed interest in hearing from Case about his plans for 
Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer that saw its 
business wane after Microsoft started giving away its own browser 
software free with its dominant Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that the purchase of Netscape illustrates  
that competition is healthy in the high-tech industry, and that a 
judge's intervention is unnecessary. It claims the sale undermines 
allegations that Netscape could be prevented from distributing its 
software, saying it expects AOL eventually to ship the Netscape 
browser to all its subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier deposition testimony, AOL's Barry Schuler  
acknowledged that a senior executive privately warned a top 
government lawyer weeks before the trial's start that AOL was 
actively involved in sensitive negotiations with Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schuler, president of AOL's Interactive Services Group,  
denied AOL gave the Justice Department full details of its plans. 
The government said previously that it didn't know about the merger 
until November, after witnesses for both AOL and Netscape had 
testified against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters were being allowed to attend at least part of Case's  
questioning because of an obscure 1913 law covering antitrust 
depositions, which are normally conducted in private. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of the trial in January, weeks after the AOL  
purchase of Netscape was announced, U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson surprised the courtroom when he introduced a 
newspaper interview with Case as Court Exhibit No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge even hinted to lawyers from both sides they might  
consider calling Case as one of the final witnesses in the trial, 
although neither side ultimately agreed. The trial resumes June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In that interview with The Washington Post, Case denied that AOL  
intends to compete with Microsoft in the market for computer 
operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no flight of fancy that we can dent in any way, shape  
or form what is a monopoly in the operating system business,'' Case 
told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Like some other major companies, such as IBM Corp., AOL  
maintains a schizophrenic relationship with Microsoft -- partners in 
some areas but bitter rivals in others. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's software requires Windows, making the company somewhat  
reliant on Microsoft. And under a March 1996 deal, AOL agreed to 
distribute Microsoft's browser to all its subscribers in exchange 
for having its own software made available with Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of AOL has always been an aggravation to Microsoft  
Chairman Bill Gates, who warned Case in the early 1990s: ``I can 
buy 20 percent of you or I can buy all of you. Or I can go into 
this business myself and bury you.''

<HEADLINE> Regulators Watch ATM Service Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Banking regulators, worried about the Year  
2000 readiness of a big ATM service company in the West, have 
ordered the company to get in shape by June 30 or face possible 
contract cancellations by some of its 750 bank customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, TransAlliance LP, agreed to the regulators'  
conditions in a signed document, the Federal Reserve and four other 
agencies announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, TransAlliance will make needed changes in  
its computer systems so that all its bank customers will be able to 
successfully complete their Year 2000 testing by June 30 -- the 
deadline set for banks by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	TransAlliance also agreed to have its own systems ready by that  
date. 
</P>
<P>
	In the event the conditions weren't met, the banks that  
TransAlliance serves would be allowed without penalty to annul 
their contracts with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators also would have the authority to impose fines on  
the company, but that isn't mentioned in the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	TransAlliance, based in Bellevue, Wash., provides automated  
teller machine services, including electronic transaction services, 
to some 750 banks, thrifts and credit unions in the West and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic Data Systems, the technology company founded by  
billionaire Ross Perot, owns 50 percent of TransAlliance. The other 
half is owned by a group of 24 banks in the Northwest which 
operates the Exchange ATM network. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that we could agree with the regulators on the  
steps we are taking to ensure Y2K readiness'' by June 30, James D. 
Benson, TransAlliance's president and chief executive officer, said 
in a statement. ``We are confident we will meet this date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government regulators have lauded, for the most part, the  
nation's financial industry for its work preparing for the 
technology problem, when some computers originally programmed to 
recognize only the last two digits of a year could interpret 2000 
as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also was signed by the Federal Deposit Insurance  
Corp., the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of 
Thrift Supervision, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 
which oversees nationally chartered banks, and Washington state's 
Department of Financial Institutions.

<HEADLINE> Media General Cuts Denver Post Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Media General is selling half of its 40  
percent stake in The Denver Post to MediaNews Group, which owns the 
rest of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Media General plans to use the proceeds of the sale to reduce  
its debt and expand its presence in the Southeast, where it already 
owns 21 daily newspapers and 13 television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Together with a previously scheduled redemption of preferred  
stock in Denver Newspapers Inc., which runs the Post, the 
transaction will net Media General about $92 million. After the 
deal closes, Media General will own 20 percent of the Post and 
MediaNews will have the remaining 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Stewart Bryan III, chairman and chief executive officer of  
Media General, said that combined with the $1.4 billion sale of the 
company's cable television division to Cox Communications announced 
last month, the Post transaction will give Media General 
``significant financial flexibility for future growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Media General is an independent, publicly owned communications  
company based in Richmond, Va. It has interests in newspapers, 
broadcast television, recycled newsprint production and diversified 
information services. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaNews Group, a private, Denver-based company formed by W.  
Dean Singleton and Richard B. Scudder, owns clusters of newspapers 
in several states, including California, New Jersey and 
Pennsylvania. Last month, Singleton was elected to the board of 
directors of The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is subject to regulatory approval, but company  
officials said they expect the deal to close by end of June.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Seaside Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASTORIA, Ore. (AP) -- A man was convicted Friday in a 1997  
beachfront thrill killing that prosecutors said was inspired by 
repeating viewings of ``In Cold Blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge rejected claims that Bradley Price was a mere observer  
in the killing of a couple shot in the head at close range while 
they watched the sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was more than just passive. He was an active participant,''  
said Circuit Judge Philip Nelson, staring down from the bench at 
Price. ``I'm convinced he aided and abetted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price was convicted of two counts of aggravated murder and could  
get life behind bars. The sentencing phase begins Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old college dropout and sometime poet claimed at  
trial that admitted triggerman Jesse McAllister had an intense 
desire to kill someone, anyone, just to see what it felt like. 
Price said he attempted to talk his friend out of it, but didn't 
really take the fantasy seriously until it got out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contended Price bought the gun used in the attack  
and knew of McAllister's intention as they walked on Seaside beach 
the morning of July 14, 1997, and targeted a couple -- Gabriella 
Brooke Goza, 26, and Frank ``Kacy'' Nimz Jr., 36. 
</P>
<P>
	Price, who fled with McAllister to Mexico, escaped the  
possibility of the death penalty because of a deal with Mexican 
authorities for his return to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	McAllister, 21, confessed to being the triggerman and is serving  
two consecutive life terms in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors called it a ``thrill killing,'' influenced by the  
movie the suspects had rented four times -- a dramatization of the 
Truman Capote true-crime book ``In Cold Blood.''

<HEADLINE> Border Patrol Agents Combat Boredom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- George McCubbin, a 14-year veteran of the  
Border Patrol, started work at 4 p.m. and ended at midnight. In 
between, he sat in his Chevy Tahoe high on a hill, listened to a 
baseball game, reread an old Joseph Wambaugh novel, and waited for 
something to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing did.  
</P>
<P>
	``They tell us, this 'X' is your location. Now, stay there until  
we say you can leave,'' said McCubbin, head of the agents' local 
union. ``After a while it wears on you mentally. At the end of the 
day you don't feel like you've accomplished anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crackdown on illegal immigration has brought much more calm to  
what was once the busiest sector of the 2000-mile border. But some 
agents say the boredom of working ``X'' shifts is taking a toll -- 
339 agents out of nearly 2,300 in the San Diego sector quit last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	During a typical ``X'' shift, an agent parks somewhere with a  
panoramic view along the U.S. side of the border, hoping their mere 
presence will discourage Mexican migrants from risking the 
crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Border Patrol officials acknowledge that the ``X's'' --  
officially known as ``visual deterrent positions'' -- are not 
popular with the rank-and-file. But they maintain that the strategy 
has had only a minor effect on the agents' decision to leave the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agents have complained about the (``X's'') but the policy is  
very effective,'' said Border Patrol spokesman Robert Smith. ``It's 
a necessary evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the union and the agency agree the strategy behind the  
``X's'' is a marked change for the Border Patrol. Agents sit for as 
many as nine hours, usually alone and with only a few breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem for the agents is that fewer migrants risk an  
illegal crossing in San Diego County. Operation Gatekeeper, which 
more than doubled the number of agents in the 66-mile-long zone, 
has pushed most of the illegal traffic further east to inland 
California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrests plummeted last year to 248,000, an 18-year low.  
</P>
<P>
	Agents are reluctant to voice their frustrations publicly for  
fear of endangering their jobs. But many complain of the tedium, as 
one agent put it, from having to ``stare at a fence all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sector officials agree that attrition is a problem. But  
Villareal said economics is probably the real reason, not the 
``Xs.'' He supports the union's effort to win raises for the agents 
-- something that would be accomplished by a pending U.S. Senate 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	An agent with a year's experience earns roughly $33,000 a year,  
plus an average of 10 percent to 15 percent more in overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
	A third of agents who left last year were forced out because  
they failed tests in Spanish and law, said agency spokesman Roy 
Villareal. Another 31 percent received transfers or promotions to 
other sectors in the United States, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of agents on an ``X'' at any given moment varies by  
zone and shift. In the Imperial Beach Station, the westernmost part 
of the San Diego sector, between 20 and 28 agents work on ``X's'' 
out of about 225 officers on duty, Villareal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others may find themselves on horse patrol, bike duty or  
training -- the kinds of work they expected on joining the patrol, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the union wants more rotation of those who do find  
themselves on the ``X's'' and more opportunities in investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really paint this exciting picture of the job but the job  
is anything but exciting,'' said Daryl Schermerhorn of the National 
Border Patrol Council. ``A guy with half a brain doesn't want to go 
sit around for nine hours.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs Get Closer Aguilera From Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs, in need of a closer with  
struggling Rod Beck on the disabled list and considering elbow 
surgery, acquired Rick Aguilera from the Minnesota Twins on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs sent minor league right-handers Kyle Lohse and Jason  
Ryan to the Twins in exchange for the 37-year-old Aguilera -- the 
Twins' all-time saves leader -- and minor league left-hander Scott 
Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some mixed emotions,'' Aguilera said. ``My heart's  
kind of hurt, knowing I'm leaving. But on the other hand, I'm 
excited about what lies ahead. It was a tough day saying goodbye to 
my teammates and (manager) Tom Kelly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera should fill the Cubs' gaping hole at closer. Beck saved  
51 games last season but has struggled all season. The burly 
right-hander was 2-4 with four blown saves and a 10.54 ERA before 
he went on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck flew to San Francisco for a second opinion Thursday on  
whether to have surgery on two bone spurs and bone chips in his 
right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to shore up the bullpen. Hopefully, Rick Aguilera can  
do that for us,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. ``We just didn't 
feel we could go forward without some experience in the bullpen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Friday's game against the Atlanta Braves, the Cubs had  
converted only 11 of 21 save opportunities, and no reliever other 
than Beck had more than one save. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, Scott Sanders gave up a ninth-inning homer to  
Gerald Williams to squander a 5-4 lead. The Cubs eventually won 6-5 
in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera was 3-1 with a 1.27 ERA and six saves in 17 games for  
the Twins this season. He came to Minnesota from the New York Mets 
in 1989 as a starter, but converted to the role of closer in 1990, 
compiling 254 saves. He also ranks first in club history in games 
pitched with 490. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just think he's an improvement over some of the pieces in  
our bullpen,'' Riggleman said. ``He's a good pitcher who can get 
outs in the ninth inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera was the last link to the Twins' World Series  
championship team in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a shame,'' Kelly said. ``It seems like a long time ago,  
I guess. I think everyone hates to see him go. He's been an 
outstanding player and he's represented the organization very well 
on and off the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Aguilera was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitcher  
Frank Rodriguez. He was re-signed by the Twins in December 1995 to 
a three-year contract as a starting pitcher after spending the 
previous six seasons exclusively as a closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite three stints on the disabled list in 1996, he made 19  
starts, posting an 8-6 record while pitching 111 1-3 innings. 
Aguilera returned to the closer role in 1997 and has 70 saves over 
the past two-plus seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He will join the Cubs in Atlanta on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Lohse, 20, comes to the Twins from the Cubs Class A team in  
Daytona, and will report to Fort Myers in the Class A Florida State 
League. Ryan, 23, has been playing for West Tenn in the Double A 
Southern League and will report to Double A New Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Downs, 23, returns to the Cubs organization after being traded  
to the Twins in November for Mike Morgan. After pitching for Fort 
Myers and New Britain, Downs will report to Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Aguilera waived the no-trade clause in his contract  
so the Twins could keep cutting their payroll. Aguilera's salary 
for this year is $3.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been talking about getting Aguilera for a long time,''  
Riggleman said. ``We'd like to have him and Rod out there 
eventually. Hopefully, we will before the season is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins, who began Friday with the worst record (13-27) in the  
AL, felt they had no choice other than trading their top reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be sorely missed here, but under the  
circumstances, we just couldn't get to him down there in our 
bullpen,'' general manager Terry Ryan said. ``I'd much rather have 
it turn out this way with us getting something than have him walk 
away and get nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs Get Closer Aguilera From Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs, in need of a closer with  
struggling Rod Beck on the disabled list and considering elbow 
surgery, acquired Rick Aguilera from the Minnesota Twins on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs sent minor league right-handers Kyle Lohse and Jason  
Ryan to the Twins in exchange for the 37-year-old Aguilera -- the 
Twins' all-time saves leader -- and minor league left-hander Scott 
Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some mixed emotions,'' Aguilera said. ``My heart's  
kind of hurt, knowing I'm leaving. But on the other hand, I'm 
excited about what lies ahead. It was a tough day saying goodbye to 
my teammates and (manager) Tom Kelly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera should fill the Cubs' gaping hole at closer. Beck saved  
51 games last season but has struggled all season. The burly 
right-hander was 2-4 with four blown saves and a 10.54 ERA before 
he went on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck flew to San Francisco for a second opinion Thursday on  
whether to have surgery on two bone spurs and bone chips in his 
right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to shore up the bullpen. Hopefully, Rick Aguilera can  
do that for us,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. ``We just didn't 
feel we could go forward without some experience in the bullpen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Friday's game against the Atlanta Braves, the Cubs had  
converted only 11 of 21 save opportunities, and no reliever other 
than Beck had more than one save. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, Scott Sanders gave up a ninth-inning homer to  
Gerald Williams to squander a 5-4 lead. The Cubs eventually won 6-5 
in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera was 3-1 with a 1.27 ERA and six saves in 17 games for  
the Twins this season. He came to Minnesota from the New York Mets 
in 1989 as a starter, but converted to the role of closer in 1990, 
compiling 254 saves. He also ranks first in club history in games 
pitched with 490.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Lawyer Seeks New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A lawyer for Dr. Jack Kevorkian asked a judge  
Friday to throw out his murder conviction, saying he had bad legal 
advice -- even though Kevorkian defended himself at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Mayer Morganroth blamed Kevorkian's lawyer, David Gorosh,  
for ``ineffective assistance of counsel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morganroth alleged that Kevorkian acted as his own attorney out  
of frustration over the way Gorosh was handling the defense, The 
Oakland Press of Pontiac reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``The blame for the deficiencies in presenting a defense on  
behalf of Dr. Kevorkian falls squarely on the shoulders of Gorosh, 
who failed to effectively perform his dual roles as advocate and 
adviser,'' Morganroth wrote. ``Gorosh was more interested in 
talking to the media than the defense team and his client, Dr. 
Kevorkian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charge came as a surprise to Gorosh.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see Dr. Kevorkian get a new trial, but not through  
a method that is untrue,'' Gorosh said. ``Frankly, we always 
offered him a number of options. It was his own choice to defend 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morganroth refused to provide a copy of the 20-page motion,  
filed as the court clerk's office closed Friday. He would not say 
who he thought gave bad legal counsel or answer further questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian is serving a 10- to 25-year sentence for second-degree  
murder and delivery of a controlled substance in the injection 
death of Thomas Youk, a Lou Gehrig's disease patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's longtime lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, said he was not  
asked to defend Kevorkian in the Youk case. Gorosh, a former Fieger 
employee fired over Kevorkian's defense in a misdemeanor trial, 
began representing Kevorkian after the charges were filed in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorosh and attorney Lisa Dwyer filed motions and argued for  
Kevorkian during his preliminary hearing. But the night before the 
trial began, Kevorkian decided to represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kevorkian handled his own defense, Gorosh and Ms. Dwyer  
whispered advice to him throughout the trial. Gorosh said Kevorkian 
``listened to some advice and disregarded others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morganroth, who had helped defend Kevorkian in two previous  
trials, dropped in on the last day of the criminal trial. Kevorkian 
asked for his help, and let Morganroth represent him during his 
sentencing. April 14.

<HEADLINE>  A Loud Pop, Then Chaos -- Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The bell for the first class of the day was  
still 20 minutes away, leaving plenty of time for students at 
Heritage High School to mill about the common area next to the 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Some nibbled on cinnamon rolls and sipped juice or milk while  
others just conversed with friends. For seniors, it was a time to 
revel in their last full day of school before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	They were looking forward to getting their yearbooks signed and  
were braced for senior pranks. The previous day, jokesters let 
loose a large bag of crickets, and firecrackers had become almost 
an annual tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Then suddenly, the chatter and laughter was interrupted by a  
loud popping sound. A 15-year-old sophomore wielding a .22-caliber 
rifle was standing in front of the girls' bathroom in the common 
area firing at his schoolmates. He was identified by students as 
Thomas Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting in the common area when I heard something that  
sounded like fireworks. I turned around and saw him and I just ran 
out of the school and across the street to my friend's house,'' 
said Brittanie Berry, 15. ``I saw everybody yelling and running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Deeter, 15, was a friend of the gunman.  
</P>
<P>
	``I yelled to him, `Hey, what're you doing?' But he just kept  
shooting. And then the kid next to me got shot in the foot. Then I 
started to run,'' Deeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students took cover under benches and behind planters while  
others raced outside the one-story red brick building into the 
parking lot of the 1,300-student school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody started throwing their book bags down and trying to  
get out, running as fast as they could,'' said Lee Merritt, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers and administrators in other parts of the building  
ushered students into classrooms, telling them to lock the doors. 
At least one teacher took her students into a closet, where she 
recited Bible verses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were screaming at us over the intercom to get to our  
homerooms as fast as we could,'' said Jessie McCumber, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	After wounding six students, the gunman dropped the rifle and  
fled outdoors. He dropped to his knees, pulled out a .22-caliber 
revolver and stuck it in his mouth. But before he could shoot, 
assistant principal Cecil Brinkley talked him into dropping the 
weapon. The suspect broke down sobbing and was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, cafeteria worker Teresa Kumar was preparing lunch and  
had walked into the cooler to get fruits and vegetables. When she 
emerged, everybody was gone and there were plates of grits, 
biscuits, and bowls of cereal left sitting on the tables. In the 
common area, she saw a wounded girl lying on the floor bleeding and 
screaming. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was hollering she wanted her mother and she was hollering  
that she was shot,'' Ms. Kumar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, small groups of students stood outside waiting for rides  
home and trading versions of how the event unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just crazy and chaos,'' said Alaina Mitchell, 16,  
hugging her brother, who had come to school to pick her up. 
</P>
<P>
	When the news first carried reports of the shooting, Janice Pugh  
waited at home for a while, hoping for a phone call from her only 
child, William. Finally she decided she couldn't wait any longer, 
so she went to Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Her voice cracking and her eyes red, she kept one arm wrapped  
around William while her other hand gripped a balled-up tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not knowing what exactly had happened, not knowing what I  
would find, I just prayed that he would be all right,'' she said. 
``I'm just happy that he's OK and I pray for the others.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. OKs Some Assistance to Iraqis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council agreed Friday to  
extend for six months a humanitarian program financed by oil 
exports aimed at helping ordinary Iraqis cope with economic 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The council unanimously adopted a resolution continuing the  
oil-for-food program. Its current mandate expires at midnight 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council launched the program in 1996 to provide  
food, medicine and other humanitarian aid for Iraqis suffering 
under sanctions imposed after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The program currently allows Iraq to export $5.26 billion in oil  
over six months to buy humanitarian supplies, as well as compensate 
Gulf War victims and fund U.N. operations in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution adopted Friday would renew the oil-for-food  
program under the same terms, but promises to review the $5.26 
billion limit on oil exports should Iraq reach the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq is expected to sell a record $3.9 billion worth of oil in  
the current six-month phase, about $900 million over the previous 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	Although oil prices were at a 12-year low six months ago, a  
strong recovery coupled with Iraq's ability to export close to 2 
million barrels a day enabled Baghdad to set a revenue record. 
</P>
<P>
	But Benon V. Sevan, executive director of the U.N.'s Iraq  
Program, noted that oil prices dropped in the past week and 
stressed that the previous increase had still not enabled Baghdad 
to reach the $5.26 billion ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	In a briefing to the council, he reiterated Secretary-General  
Kofi Annan's recent report, which concluded that oil-for-food 
``cannot -- and was never meant to -- meet all the humanitarian needs 
of the Iraqi people, nor can it restore Iraq's economic and social 
infrastructure to pre-1990 levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing these concerns, Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov  
said even if the oil-for-food program was improved, ``it would not 
be enough to solve the humanitarian crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement on extending the program comes as the council is  
considering ways to improve the humanitarian program as part of a 
new overall policy towards Iraq in the aftermath of the 
U.S.-British airstrikes in December. 
</P>
<P>
	France had wanted to incorporate some of those suggested  
improvements into the resolution for the new six-month phase -- 
including eliminating the ceiling on Iraqi oil exports, an idea 
first raised by the United States in January. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with the recovery in world oil prices, Iraqi oil  
revenue has gone up, prompting the United States to rethink its 
proposal. U.S. officials are now talking about raising the ceiling 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, France settled for a promise from the council to  
review the $5.26 billion limit should Iraq reach the ceiling over 
the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The council remains divided on a long-term policy toward Iraq  
and reaching agreement is expected to take weeks.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Activate Clemens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Roger Clemens was activated from the 15-day  
disabled list tonight before his start against the Chicago White 
Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was placed on the DL on April 29, retroactive to the  
previous day, because of a strained left hamstring. He hurt the 
hamstring and had to leave after two innings of his previous start 
April 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, shooting for an AL-record 18th straight victory, had to  
wait to make his first appearance in nearly a month when the start 
of Friday's game was delayed by rain.

<HEADLINE>  A Loud Pop, Then Chaos -- Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The bell for the first class of the day was  
still 20 minutes away, leaving plenty of time for students at 
Heritage High School to mill about the common area next to the 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Some nibbled on cinnamon rolls and sipped juice or milk while  
others just conversed with friends. For seniors, it was a time to 
revel in their last full day of school before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	They were looking forward to getting their yearbooks signed and  
were braced for senior pranks. The previous day, jokesters let 
loose a large bag of crickets, and firecrackers had become almost 
an annual tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Then suddenly, the chatter and laughter was interrupted by a  
loud popping sound. A 15-year-old sophomore wielding a .22-caliber 
rifle was standing in front of the girls' bathroom in the common 
area firing at his schoolmates. He was identified by students as 
Thomas Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting in the common area when I heard something that  
sounded like fireworks. I turned around and saw him and I just ran 
out of the school and across the street to my friend's house,'' 
said Brittanie Berry, 15. ``I saw everybody yelling and running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Deeter, 15, was a friend of the gunman.  
</P>
<P>
	``I yelled to him, `Hey, what're you doing?' But he just kept  
shooting. And then the kid next to me got shot in the foot. Then I 
started to run,'' Deeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students took cover under benches and behind planters while  
others raced outside the one-story red brick building into the 
parking lot of the 1,300-student school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody started throwing their book bags down and trying to  
get out, running as fast as they could,'' said Lee Merritt, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers and administrators in other parts of the building  
ushered students into classrooms, telling them to lock the doors. 
At least one teacher took her students into a closet, where she 
recited Bible verses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were screaming at us over the intercom to get to our  
homerooms as fast as we could,'' said Jessie McCumber, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	After wounding six students, the gunman dropped the rifle and  
fled outdoors. He dropped to his knees, pulled out a .22-caliber 
revolver and stuck it in his mouth. But before he could shoot, 
assistant principal Cecil Brinkley talked him into dropping the 
weapon. The suspect broke down sobbing and was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, cafeteria worker Teresa Kumar was preparing lunch and  
had walked into the cooler to get fruits and vegetables. When she 
emerged, everybody was gone and there were plates of grits, 
biscuits, and bowls of cereal left sitting on the tables. In the 
common area, she saw a wounded girl lying on the floor bleeding and 
screaming. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was hollering she wanted her mother and she was hollering  
that she was shot,'' Ms. Kumar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, small groups of students stood outside waiting for rides  
home and trading versions of how the event unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just crazy and chaos,'' said Alaina Mitchell, 16,  
hugging her brother, who had come to school to pick her up. 
</P>
<P>
	When the news first carried reports of the shooting, Janice Pugh  
waited at home for a while, hoping for a phone call from her only 
child, William. Finally she decided she couldn't wait any longer, 
so she went to Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Her voice cracking and her eyes red, she kept one arm wrapped  
around William while her other hand gripped a balled-up tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not knowing what exactly had happened, not knowing what I  
would find, I just prayed that he would be all right,'' she said. 
``I'm just happy that he's OK and I pray for the others.''

<HEADLINE> AOL Chief Faces Microsoft Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steve Case, America Online's billionaire  
chairman and one of the few executives to succeed in the shadow of 
Microsoft, was facing questions under oath today from the software 
giant about his nearly $10 billion purchase of Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Case, who was being questioned by lawyers at a hotel in downtown  
Washington, has already said he doesn't expect to offer any new 
information relevant to the government's antitrust case against 
Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing there (involving Netscape) has anything to do with  
operating systems, which, as best I can tell, is the focus of that 
trial,'' said Case, who also is chief executive officer of America 
Online Inc., the world's largest Internet provider, with nearly 18 
million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge who will deliver the trial's verdict has already  
expressed interest in hearing from Case about his plans for 
Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer that saw its 
business wane after Microsoft started giving away its own browser 
software free with its dominant Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that the purchase of Netscape illustrates  
that competition is healthy in the high-tech industry, and that a 
judge's intervention is unnecessary. It claims the sale undermines 
allegations that Netscape could be prevented from distributing its 
software, saying it expects AOL eventually to ship the Netscape 
browser to all its subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier deposition testimony, AOL's Barry Schuler  
acknowledged that a senior executive privately warned a top 
government lawyer weeks before the trial's start that AOL was 
actively involved in sensitive negotiations with Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schuler, president of AOL's Interactive Services Group,  
denied AOL gave the Justice Department full details of its plans. 
The government said previously that it didn't know about the merger 
until November, after witnesses for both AOL and Netscape had 
testified against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters were being allowed to attend at least part of Case's  
questioning because of an obscure 1913 law covering antitrust 
depositions, which are normally conducted in private. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of the trial in January, weeks after the AOL  
purchase of Netscape was announced, U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson surprised the courtroom when he introduced a 
newspaper interview with Case as Court Exhibit No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge even hinted to lawyers from both sides they might  
consider calling Case as one of the final witnesses in the trial, 
although neither side ultimately agreed. The trial resumes June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In that interview with The Washington Post, Case denied that AOL  
intends to compete with Microsoft in the market for computer 
operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no flight of fancy that we can dent in any way, shape  
or form what is a monopoly in the operating system business,'' Case 
told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Like some other major companies, such as IBM Corp., AOL  
maintains a schizophrenic relationship with Microsoft -- partners in 
some areas but bitter rivals in others. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's software requires Windows, making the company somewhat  
reliant on Microsoft. And under a March 1996 deal, AOL agreed to 
distribute Microsoft's browser to all its subscribers in exchange 
for having its own software made available with Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But AOL has roundly trumped Microsoft in the popularity of its  
MSN online service, which stagnates with about 2 million 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of AOL has always been an aggravation to Microsoft  
Chairman Bill Gates, who warned Case in the early 1990s: ``I can 
buy 20 percent of you or I can buy all of you. Or I can go into 
this business myself and bury you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with its purchase of Netscape, AOL now owns Microsoft's  
chief browser rival and the popular Netcenter Web site. The latest 
figures from Media Metrix Inc., which tracks Internet visitors, 
showed AOL's site was the second-most popular on the Web, and 
Netscape's was sixth. MSN's site was third, and Microsoft's 
corporate page was seventh.

<HEADLINE> 5 Boys Charged For Raping Twin Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) -- Five boys were charged today in the  
alleged rape and sodomy of 6-year-old twin girls at a day-care 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects, four 13-year-old boys and one 11-year-old boy,  
sexually assaulted the girls on May 15 in the basement of a day 
care center and in a shed next door, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls were apparently alone in the center and unattended by  
any adult, police said. The next day, the girls told their mother 
about the alleged assault and they were taken to the hospital for 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``They saw the girls were available and took advantage of  
them,'' Lt. Doug Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the suspects are the sons of the owner of a woman who  
runs the day care center and lives next door to the center, police 
said. The other three are friends of her sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the boys was charged in juvenile court with six counts  
of aggravated criminal sodomy. Two of them were also charged with 
two counts of rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrest warrants were issued Friday but the boys were not yet in  
custody. 
</P>
<P>
	The day-care center was closed by order of the state on  
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Exhibit Features World of Microbes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An invisible world that can bring disease and  
death or health and pleasure can finally be seen -- at once 
beautiful and yucky -- at the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcoming the visitor to ``Microbes: Invisible Invaders, Amazing  
Allies,'' is a Medieval mask, its long, birdlike beak curving 
downward and providing space for pleasant-smelling flowers to 
protect the wearer from the bad smells and poisoned air thought to 
cause the plague. 
</P>
<P>
	The departing viewer gets a last treat, a glimpse of part of the  
original notebooks of Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming and a 
sample of the mold that he discovered contained penicillin. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, child and adult alike enters the world of microbes,  
sees the toll of death and illness they have inflicted on the world 
and meets their good uses too, from drugs to tasty mushrooms to 
blue cheese and yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think they're having fun, but they're also learning,''  
Dr. Randall E. Kaye of Pfizer Inc., the exhibit's sponsor, said 
Friday as visiting school children raced from exhibit to exhibit 
pressing buttons, playing video games, laughing and asking 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially opening Saturday, the exhibit is to remain in  
Washington through Sept. 6. It then travels to Chicago, Buffalo, 
N.Y., Cleveland, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Indianapolis, with more 
stops still being booked. It premiered in Toronto and visited 
Jersey City, N.J., Los Angeles, San Francisco and Dallas before 
arriving in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	On the exhibit's dark side, a photo of the face of an Egyptian  
mummy clearly shows the scars of smallpox. 
</P>
<P>
	Around a corner is a tiny, baby-size iron lung, a remembrance of  
before the advent of polio vaccines, when thousands of victims were 
confined to those steel drums to help them breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	A highlight is a large room where the viewer can see the world  
from the point of view of a microbe. The surroundings are other 
bacteria and germs and even a giant white blood cell looking for 
invading viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, a series of hologram screens project 3-D images of the  
virus that causes AIDS, e. coli germs, streptococcus, salmonella 
and several other microbes. 
</P>
<P>
	In its own little room a world map invites visitors to press  
buttons marked with diseases such as tuberculosis, dengue fever, 
AIDS and others. The map lights to show where that disease is most 
prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all microbes are bad. The show notes that some help  
return nitrogen to the soil to help plants grow, others clean up 
oil and pesticides in the environment, billions of microbes in the 
intestines help digest food, and yeasts even help make bread rise 
and ferment beer and wine.

<HEADLINE> Dana Plato's Death Ruled a Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Former child actress Dana Plato's  
drug-overdose death was ruled a suicide Friday, not an accident as 
initially believed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old former star of the NBC sitcom ``Diff'rent  
Strokes'' died May 8 while visiting her fiance's parents in Moore. 
Police initially said she died of an accidental overdose of a 
painkiller and Valium. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Larry E. Balding, deputy state medical examiner, said  
Friday that she had fatal concentrations of the muscle relaxant 
Soma and a generic form of the painkiller Lortab in her body. She 
also had the equivalent of seven tablets of the muscle relaxant in 
her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	Balding said the death was ruled a suicide because of the high  
level of drugs and her history of suicidal tendencies. She did not 
leave a suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato had been prescribed both drugs -- according to her  
fiance, for back injuries she suffered in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato's life went into a tailspin after the sitcom's  
cancellation in 1984. In 1991, she was arrested for robbing a Las 
Vegas video store and placed on five years' probation. A year 
later, she was given another five years' probation for forging 
prescriptions for Valium. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I hadn't gotten caught, it could have been the worst thing  
that happened to me because I could have died of a drug overdose,'' 
she said then. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before her death, Ms. Plato went on Howard Stern's radio  
show in New York to deny a former roommate's claims that she was on 
drugs. Ms. Plato insisted she had been sober for about 10 years but 
said she had taken painkillers when her wisdom teeth were removed 
four months ago.

<HEADLINE> Woman Sentenced for Role in Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- The girlfriend of a man who pleaded guilty  
to killing gay college student Matthew Shepard was sentenced Friday 
to up to two years in prison for helping to cover up evidence in 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasity Vera Pasley, 20, cried repeatedly as she was sentenced  
to 15 months to two years in prison for being an accessory after 
the fact to first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasley said she was sorry for helping to dispose of bloody  
clothing her boyfriend, Russell Henderson, wore during the Oct. 7 
attack on Shepard, 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, posed as  
homosexuals and lured Shepard out of a bar before taking him to a 
remote area, pistol-whipping him and leaving him tied to a fence in 
the cold. He died five days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasley faced up to three years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to face up to what I did,'' Pasley said during her  
sentencing hearing. ``I can't bring him back. I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pasley was one of two women accused of helping McKinney and  
Henderson dispose of Henderson' bloody clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson pleaded guilty last month to kidnapping and felony  
murder and was sentenced to consecutive life prison terms. McKinney 
has pleaded innocent and is scheduled to stand trial in August. He 
faces the death penalty if convicted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristen LeAnn Price, 19, was McKinney's girlfriend. She also was  
charged with being an accessory after the fact to first-degree 
murder, but her trial has been delayed.

<HEADLINE>  Police: Teen Brought Guns From Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The arrest of a quiet, churchgoing Boy Scout  
accused of shooting up his high school with weapons stolen from his 
stepfather's locked gun cabinet was a sharp reminder that it's not 
always the surly, trenchcoat-wearing outcasts who commit violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Solomon Jr., 15, is charged with aggravated assault for  
wounding six fellow Heritage High School students. As more details 
about the sophomore emerged Friday, it became clear that he has 
little in common with the killers in last month's Colorado school 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Writings by Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris -- outsiders ostracized  
at Columbine High School -- indicated that they wanted to kill as 
many people as possible and go down in a blaze of gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon was a marksman with two deadly weapons -- a .357 Magnum  
revolver and a sawed-off rifle hidden in the legs of his baggy 
jeans -- and could have easily killed many students. But he 
apparently aimed at them below the waist so as only to wound them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just trying to be heard and not trying to kill  
anybody,'' said Kent Cason, 19. ``Two of my friends saw him walking 
into the cafeteria and he was loading a gun. He told them to stay 
there so they wouldn't get hurt, and then walked into the 
building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if Solomon really wanted to leave a trail of bodies behind,  
he could have stolen several more powerful weapons from his 
stepfather, according to Sheriff Jeff Wigington. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot more firepower available to him,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Experts said Solomon -- described as a typical teen who grew  
sullen after his girlfriend dumped him this week -- was making a 
desperate cry for attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly he had the option and the weapon to do more damage,  
and in not doing that, what he was doing was a way of getting 
attention,'' said Richard Gelles, professor of child welfare and 
family violence at the University of Pennsylvania. ``He knew he 
would get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Klebold and Harris, who killed 12 students and a teacher  
before taking their own lives, Solomon wasn't ostracized by the 
more popular students and didn't dress differently from his peers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just an average kid,'' said Joe Watts, a student.  
</P>
<P>
	``This case is a reminder that just because a particular child  
isn't in some group of alienated teens or doesn't have two nose 
rings or 15 tattoos doesn't mean that there's not a possibility 
that something tragic could happen,'' said Dr. Tom Cummins, a child 
and adolescent psychiatrist at Emory University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack was the sixth mass shooting at an American high  
school or middle school since October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Few, if any, of the other school killers wore their outcast  
status as clearly and boldly as the trenchcoat-clad Klebold and 
Harris did. 
</P>
<P>
	Luke Woodham, convicted of killing his mother and then two  
classmates in Pearl, Miss., in 1997, was in a cult-like group, but 
it held secretive meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he didn't stand out for the way he dressed, Kip Kinkel,  
who allegedly killed his parents and two fellow high school 
students last year in Springfield, Ore., had tortured animals, was 
fascinated with guns and had a quick temper. In middle school he 
was voted ``Most Likely to Start World War III.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon, called T.J., is described as a clean-cut student with  
average grades that had slipped recently. He went to church with 
his family every week, and the night before the shooting he 
attended a Catholic youth group meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends said he became angry after the breakup and talked of  
ending his life or bringing a gun to school. But no one took him 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	With about 300 students crowded into the school's common area  
Thursday morning, Solomon fired 14 times -- 11 shots with the rifle 
and three times with the revolver. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Cheek, a junior who was shot once in the buttocks and once  
in the leg, said students began chasing Solomon -- who was running 
and smiling as he fired from the hip -- after the rifle ran out of 
bullets. Solomon then fired with the revolver and fled outside. 
</P>
<P>
	There, he fell to his knees and put the gun in his mouth.  
</P>
<P>
	When Assistant Principal Cecil Brinkley followed him outside,  
Solomon raised the gun toward Brinkley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stepped back a couple of steps and I turned to him again and  
I said, `Give me the gun,' and I said again, `Give me the gun,''' 
Brinkley said Friday. ``I saw him lower the barrel of the gun and I 
kept getting closer and closer to him. Then I held out my hands and 
he laid the gun in my hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then he gave me a real big bear hug and he said, `I'm scared,  
I'm scared,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon must appear in juvenile court before he can be charged  
as an adult, something not expected before Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Students were expected to return to Heritage High on Monday, and  
graduation is to go on as scheduled May 28. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday morning, students streamed into Heritage Hills Baptist  
Church to meet with counselors and ministers. Some teens hugged in 
the parking lot before going inside the church. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're just all trying to get our lives back,'' said  
senior Brian Skelton, 18.

<HEADLINE> Violence Emerges As Campaign Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jonesboro. Paducah. Littleton. And now  
Conyers. Violence in America's schools promises to be a chilling 
prism through which Americans view a wide range of issues in the 
2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just gun control. Calls for smaller schools, better  
mental health care, character education, flexible work schedules, 
school prayer -- any issue that even remotely touches the subject of 
school violence -- could gain campaign currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened to you has pierced the soul of America,''  
President Clinton told students and faculty at Columbine High 
School. ``Something profound has happened to your country because 
of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The polls bear him out.  
</P>
<P>
	The shootings in Littleton, Colo. drew an extraordinarily high  
level of public interest, ranked almost as high as any other 
stories this decade, according to the Pew Research Center for the 
People &AMP; the Press. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, the subject was back in the headlines when a  
teen-ager wounded six classmates in Conyers, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder politicians are struggling to solve the problem. Or  
capitalize on the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The starkest example of the shifting political landscape came in  
the congressional debate over gun control. Underestimating the 
demand for new restrictions, Republicans foundered during days of 
Senate debate until Democrats finally sent a modest gun control 
measure to the House. 
</P>
<P>
	After the shootings in his home state, Democrat Max Cleland of  
Georgia reversed himself and voted for his party's measure. Part of 
his reason concerned changes in the measure, he said, but he added 
that school shootings weren't ``just an issue in Littleton, Colo., 
anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say the debate will hound the GOP in 2000.  
``Republicans once again look extreme,'' said Rep. Patrick Kennedy 
of Rhode Island, chairman of the Democratic House campaign 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are accusing Democrats of playing politics with  
tragedy. ``I think it's always a shame when something like this 
comes up and some group tries to take advantage of it,'' said 
Kennedy's counterpart at the GOP committee, Rep. Tom Davis of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	But the politics go deeper than the gun debate. Strategists in  
both parties say the shootings could give resonance to a wide 
variety of issues in presidential, congressional and statewide 
races in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just guns,'' said former Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado,  
general chairman of the Democratic Party.

<P>
	Democrats say the shootings highlight the need for smaller  
schools, smaller class sizes, more counselors and more teachers. 
Romer said after-school programs, often dismissed by GOP lawmakers, 
suddenly make more sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``God knows what these kids are doing between 2:30 p.m. and the  
time their parents come home,'' Romer said in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans predict that private-school vouchers will be more  
popular, as parents seek the freedom to choose safer schools. 
School prayer and even tax cuts also gain credibility, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``If children are praying, they are less likely to be  
fighting,'' Christian Coalition director Randy Tate said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate Lamar Alexander argues that  
tax cuts will make it affordable for more parents to stay home and 
keep an eye on their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that stretches it a bit,'' said Al From, head of the  
Democratic Leadership Council. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also dismissed Gore's suggestion that easing traffic  
congestion and urban sprawl will gain support because parents can 
get home sooner and tend to their kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get parents home 15 minutes early, maybe it makes a  
difference,'' From said. ``But only if you use that 15 minutes to 
change your kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several issues are being highlighted by Democrats and Republican  
alike, including school discipline, more parental responsibility, 
less violence in the mass media, more community service and a hard 
look at America's spiritual health. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said in a recent speech, ``This is a  
warning of something deeper than just the widespread availability 
of guns and violence in the media and video games and Internet 
sites, and deeper even that whatever failures of parenting have 
gone into this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that it is being seen and heard all across our country  
as a spiritual signal that we really have to take stock of what we 
want in our country -- what kind of families, what kind of 
communities,'' said Gore, who cast the tie-breaking vote Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody knows whether the shootings will still be shaping the  
political debate in 2000. Yet, for now, politicians are likely to 
keep on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore says a Littleton parent pleaded with him to promise that  
the victims did not die in vain. ``I promise,'' Gore says, 
repeatedly.

<HEADLINE> Top Dole Adviser Quits Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consultant Kieran Mahoney left Elizabeth  
Dole's campaign Friday, costing her a top adviser just as her GOP 
presidential effort appeared to be gaining steam. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole aides and Mahoney said the parting was amicable, although  
sources close to the candidate suggested it resulted partly from a 
power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to spend more time with his family,'' said Dole  
spokesman Ari Fleischer, calling the departure ``mutually agreed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to go home, and I will get to see my son awake  
tomorrow for the first time in a week,'' Mahoney said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was announced after a meeting between Mrs. Dole and  
Mahoney, who had assumed an unusual amount of control for a 
consultant. His departure leaves campaign manager Tom Daffron as 
Mrs. Dole's top adviser, eventually able to hire consultants who 
will report to him, an official close to Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish Mrs. Dole the best. She's had a substantial last month  
and a half on the campaign trail, and I believe she's articulating 
issues that need to be heard and doing it better than any other 
candidate in that regard,'' Mahoney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other officials close to Mrs. Dole said Mahoney's family  
concerns were complicated by growing disenchantment over his role 
in the campaign. He had expected to have more control, said the 
officials, whose assessment was not disputed by a Mahoney backer. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	As Daffron and Fleischer assumed more authority in shaping Mrs.  
Dole's message, Mahoney's role decreased, said the two sources 
close to Mrs. Dole. One said Mahoney had little to do with the 
campaign in the past couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Though speaking highly of Mrs. Dole, Mahoney seemed to suggest  
the fledgling campaign was more difficult to run than it should 
have been. Discussing the difficulty of balancing his family life 
with his job, he said, ``I had expected this to be more manageable 
in that regard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney's hiring was questioned by Republican strategists who  
predicted he would clash with Mrs. Dole's small circle of longtime 
allies. Though no dispute ever spilled into the open, officials say 
there was friction from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole had trouble raising money and finding her voice in the  
early days of her campaign, but a visit to Kosovo and an aggressive 
move to the political center on gun control gained her much-needed 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	She hoped to add momentum to her campaign Saturday in a speech  
to Georgia Republicans. Two days after a school shooting near 
Atlanta, Mrs. Dole was expected to portray herself as a courageous 
advocate of some gun restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some in our party may not have liked what I said, but that's  
who I am and what I believe,'' Mrs. Dole said in a draft of her 
Saturday speech provided to The Associated Press. She was suffering 
from laryngitis on Friday, leaving some doubt that she would 
deliver the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Praising the Senate for approving measures requiring background  
checks at gun shows and the sale of safety locks with guns, Mrs. 
Dole said in the prepared remarks, ``The House of Representatives 
should do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent reference to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP  
front-runner, Mrs. Dole suggested her rival must speak up on gun 
control. ``Leadership requires more than sitting on a front porch 
measuring which direction the gunsmoke is blowing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush, said: ``Gov.  
Bush has a record in office of enacting tough laws on those who 
commit crimes with a gun. In fact, this coming week he will sign a 
bill that will require automatic detention for juveniles caught 
with illegal possession of a gun.''

<HEADLINE> US Orchestra Gives Concert in Hanoi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Young communists in red scarves, girls in  
frilly party dresses and a whole lot of grown-ups flocked to 
Hanoi's opera house today for a children's concert given by the 
Philadelphia Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, the first U.S. symphony orchestra to visit Vietnam,  
decided to give the free concert as a gift to the children of Hanoi 
ahead of a regular performance Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Music is the only language in the world everyone can  
understand,'' conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch said before the 
hourlong performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by Coca-Cola, whose sign hung prominently over the  
stage of the gilded French colonial rococo opera house, the concert 
began with the American and Vietnamese national anthems. 
</P>
<P>
	The program included easy-to-listen-to classics such as Dvorak's  
``Carnival Overture'' and Beethoven's ``Symphony No. 2'' before 
wrapping up with a rousing rendition of D'Souza's ``Liberty Bell 
March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 600 people attended the concert and applauded the  
conductor as he introduced each piece. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the concert began, 16-year-old Ngo Thu Trang said she  
hoped it would pave the way for more visits by American groups, but 
preferably rock bands -- ``like the Backstreet Boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at the end, Vietnamese concertgoers said they thoroughly  
enjoyed their first live classical concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets were meant to be free for the public, but several  
concertgoers got theirs through friends working in the government 
or at local companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, women sold the supposedly free tickets for $10 -- more  
than a week's salary for an average Vietnamese factory worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The orchestra also will perform in Ho Chi Minh City before  
moving on for concerts in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Taipei, 
Taiwan. It already has performed in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Orchestra, which will have its 100th  
anniversary season next year, also was the first U.S. orchestra to 
go to China, in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	It is accompanying Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge's trade and  
culture mission to Asia.

<HEADLINE> OSHA To Consider New Needle Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Occupational Safety and Health  
Administration will consider requiring hospitals and health care 
facilities to use safety devices that could reduce needlestick 
injuries to workers. 
</P>
<P>
	OSHA Administrator Charles N. Jeffress said Thursday that the  
agency, this fall, will being considering whether new requirements 
on safety devices are necessary to reduce potentially dangerous 
needlestick injuries to the nation's 5.6 million health care 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have an opportunity to provide them with protection  
from the hazards of sharps and needlestick injuries that can 
threaten their health and well-being,'' Jeffress said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement coincided with the release of an OSHA report,  
based on comments from 400 health care workers and facilities, that 
said safety devices aren't being used widely enough to 
substantially reduce the 590,000 needlestick injuries each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Needles and other sharp medical objects potentially carry  
bloodborne illnesses such as AIDS and hepatitis. Now, it's up to 
individual facilities whether to use protective devices. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next four to six weeks, OSHA also plans to strengthen a  
requirement that health care facilities evaluate their policies on 
the use of safety devices. Jeffress said not all facilities have 
complied in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, which enforces workplace safety laws, previously  
proposed stricter reporting of all injuries resulting from 
contaminated needles and sharp objects.

<HEADLINE> Buyers Cautious About Online Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You'll buy a book, balance your checkbook and  
even invest in stocks over the Internet. But when it comes time for 
grocery shopping, most folks still hop in the car and head for the 
supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
	That may change soon. Some of the Internet's elite, such as  
retailer Amazon.com and the founder of software pioneer Netscape, 
are betting big money that consumers will soon be salivating over 
the idea of buying everything from fresh tuna steaks to raisin bran 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about experience, and if you make the online  
experience better than what they can find themselves at the store, 
there's a great chance that your online grocery business will 
succeed,'' said Michael May, an analyst at Internet research firm 
Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Online grocery sales are still quite small, totaling just under  
$150 million last year, less than 1 percent of the more than $440 
billion in total supermarket sales, according to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jupiter expects sales to rise to more than $3.5 billion by  
2002, the market is developing slowly as Web grocers gear their 
businesses to the needs of individual communities rather than take 
the riskier route of going global. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the biggest challenge for cyber-grocers has been  
convincing Americans to just try them out. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, less than a million people have bought groceries  
online, while the average American visits a brick-and-mortar 
supermarket 2.2 times a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are attached to their supermarkets. They like to  
wander around the stores and touch and smell what they are going to 
buy,'' said Tom Agan, who works at the retail consulting firm Kurt 
Salmon Associates. ``It's not so easy for many people to give that 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's online grocers are also struggling to insure shoppers  
that spoiled food, hefty surcharges and late deliveries aren't the 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get what I wanted, it wasn't cheaper, and the  
delivery was late. After all that I figured it was easier to just 
go to the supermarket,'' said Janice Ryer, a working mother of two 
from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryer hasn't bought groceries online since her disastrous attempt  
a year ago from a now-defunct Internet supermarket that operated 
out of her local Kroger's market. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean the fledgling industry is without  
potential. Just a year ago, shoppers steered away from buying 
clothes on the Internet because they couldn't try them on. Today, 
the market is booming as fears about bad fits and restrictive 
return policies fade. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-grocers now generating the most buzz -- and investment  
dollars -- seem to have an important combination of technological 
savvy and understanding of consumer service. 
</P>
<P>
	One is Webvan of Oakland, Calif., which plans to begin serving  
the San Francisco Bay area later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Webvan, founded by Borders Books founder Louis Borders, has  
backers like CBS and the big Japanese high-tech investment firm 
Softbank. 
</P>
<P>
	Webvan's mechanized warehouse has motorized carousels filled  
with thousands of items. There, a worker can fill 10 times more 
orders in an hour than most competitors, whose workers roam grocery 
stores or warehouses, filling shopping carts. 
</P>
<P>
	Another is HomeGrocer.com, which announced this past week that  
Amazon.com had bought a 35 percent stake for $42.5 million. It also 
recently received $5 million from the Barksdale Group, an 
investment firm run by James Barksdale, founder of Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded just a year ago, it now has more than 10,000 customers  
in the Seattle area. On Monday, it began serving Portland, Ore., 
and had more than 400 customers signed up by mid-week. 
</P>
<P>
	HomeGrocer buys all of its own inventory, which it then stores  
in its own distribution center in each city. That holds down its 
prices and also insures better quality of products. 
</P>
<P>
	It also developed a delivery truck with multiple zones, allowing  
ice cream to go in the freezer, orange juice to be refrigerated and 
bread and bananas to stay in a temperate climate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't sure what to expect when I started ordering from  
them,'' said Michelle Borozan, a high-tech worker from Seattlewho 
started shopping at HomeGrocer in February when her son was born. 
``But it really is easy and convenient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The produce is better than anything I would pick out myself,''  
she said. ``Just the sanity it saves me from trying to find a 
parking spot at the supermarket is enough to keep me buying 
online.''

<HEADLINE> Toys May Be Too Buff for Boys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Since the 1960s, male action figures appear to  
have been on a steady diet of steroids, beefing up to inhuman 
proportions and giving boys a skewed definition of masculinity, a 
psychiatrist says. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published this week in the International Journal of  
Eating Disorders, Harvard psychiatrist Dr. Harrison Pope said male 
action hunks are sending boys the wrong message, much as Barbie 
gives girls a twisted picture of perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his studies have shown increased emphasis on muscular  
males over the years, and the latest analysis continues the trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chose to study the toys because we could measure them and  
they were good examples of the trend,'' Pope said. ``We talked to 
many kids and the toys they liked the most were very muscular 
figures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers measured the circumference of GI Joe's waist, chest  
and biceps at different stages of development over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	The original GI Joe from the 1960s, scaled to human dimensions,  
had a biceps circumference that equated to about 12 inches, similar 
to an ordinary man. 
</P>
<P>
	But a GI Joe Extreme from 1997 had a biceps circumference of  
more than 26 inches, almost the size of a small man's waist. In 
comparison, the biceps of real-life home run slugger Mark McGwire 
measure about 20 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Luke Skywalker, nearly two decades after a more slender  
action figure was released for the original Star Wars series, was 
clad in an open robe hanging over a well-defined chest in a 1995 
model, Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the 1960s, people weren't using anabolic steroids so  
men would lift weights and stay within their natural body size,'' 
said Pope, also a researcher at McLean Hospital in Belmont. ``But 
now, the unnatural is possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason to explain the trend is the emergence of women.  
</P>
<P>
	``Women can now fly F-16s and join what were male  
organizations,'' Pope said. ``Men's bodies, particularly their 
muscles, are the only thing that can't be taken away from them by 
the courts and other organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Charness, a spokesman for Hasbro Inc. in Pawtucket, R.I.,  
which makes GI Joe, Star Wars figures, Batman and Superman, said 
their sizes have fluctuated over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	``As for our superhuman figures like Batman and Superman, they  
are based on cartoon characters and their proportions are likely to 
remain superhuman,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Zelin, a psychology professor at Tufts University, said  
studies have shown that many eating disorders have been linked to 
false body images. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems perfectly reasonable that just as women who are  
anorexic have been influenced by the images of thin models, boys 
could be influenced by muscular men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Men have to realize they shouldn't feel pressured to conform to  
standards set in the media, Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some people like Gail Pierce, a manager at Gold's Gym in  
Woburn, said views of the male body already have changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proof is in our logo. When Gold's Gym started (more than  
three decades ago), we used a man that looked like a muscle head. 
Now, that man is lean, fit and more intelligent-looking.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers Mystify Glen Rice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- As well as San Antonio has played  
defense, Glen Rice believes the Spurs have had some help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making their job a lot easier than we should,'' the Los  
Angeles Lakers forward said. ``I'm just standing out buried on the 
wing or buried deep in the corner and guys are getting their rest. 
They're able to save a lot of energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs brought a 2-0 lead into Game 3 today at the Forum,  
where Game 4 in the best-of-7 Western Conference semifinal series 
is Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a tough spot, but we don't feel that the emergency  
lights have to go on,'' Lakers point guard Derek Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fisher agrees that Rice isn't being utilized in a way that  
makes him as effective as he was in the first round against 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get stagnated trying to give the ball to Shaq or maybe Kobe  
tries to make a play,'' he said. ``We're allowing those guys to 
make the play for us. What happens is everybody ends up standing 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaq and Kobe are our stars and our main two weapons, but  
we've got Glen. We have to figure out ways to keep him involved in 
the game at all times,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a 34-14 all-time record at home against the Spurs,  
history suggests the Lakers are in trouble. They haven't recovered 
from a 2-0 deficit to win a best-of-7 series since the trio of 
Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West did so in 1968-69. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the Lakers are 0-9 in playoff series in which they  
lost the first two games, including losses to Utah each of the last 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a difficult task for us, but I just think the way we  
played in the first two games isn't the best that we can play,'' 
Lakers backup guard Derek Harper said. ``We have to go into 
tomorrow's game with a very aggressive approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have lost four straight at the Forum, including twice  
in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a big hurdle for us,'' Spurs forward Tim Duncan said.  
``The Lakers are a very confident team. They're going to come in 
here with some great emotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers say they beat themselves in losing Game 1 87-81 and  
Game 2 by three points Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest problem in game one is that we weren't aggressive  
enough,'' Fisher said. ``In game two, we came out a little 
aggressive but we made too many mistakes, so we have to find that 
good mix right in the middle with being aggressive but still play 
smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs expect Shaquille O'Neal to take more than the 11 shots  
he had in Game 2, and they want to challenge each one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been very aggressive going down there,'' said Spurs  
center David Robinson, who along with fellow 7-footer Duncan, has 
frustrated O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wants to take tough shots with guys on him, then that's  
a good thing for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just because O'Neal has averaged 18.5 points in the series --  
well below his season average -- doesn't mean the Spurs are 
overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons why we've played him pretty good thus far  
is because we fear him so much,'' Avery Johnson said. ``He can come 
in the next game, in our minds, playing like he's going to get 38. 
The minute you start to relax and don't fear him as much, then 
you're going to really be killed.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Police Methods Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A teen-ager who was in class when a teacher was  
shot and killed more than a mile away sat in jail for two years 
because his airtight alibi went unchecked for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Olmetti, 19, was released Thursday in another in a string of  
cases that have stirred anger over Chicago police methods in murder 
investigations. Critics say police have beaten or otherwise bullied 
suspects to get confessions. 
</P>
<P>
	In still another case Thursday, charges were dropped against  
Lanard Guider in a 1997 murder. Prosecutors said there was 
insufficient evidence. Guider, 19, claims his confession was 
coerced by a police beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Olmetti was arrested in April 1997 in the shooting of  
43-year-old teacher Sonia Hernandez after police got an anonymous 
telephone tip with no details. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Carey, Olmetti's public defender, said the slightly built  
teen, who has a mild learning disability, confessed but reported 
police had hit him during an 18-hour interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
	Olmetti had an alibi for Ms. Hernandez's killing: He claimed  
that he was sitting in his second-period high-school class when it 
happened. Police considered the alibi but dismissed it because he 
had confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey said he spent months trying to discredit that confession  
and prove the alibi with telephone and school records. 
</P>
<P>
	But justice moved slowly. Carey is one of 25 trial attorneys in  
the homicide unit and is defending 25 cases, including a dozen in 
which prosecutors are asking for the death penalty. He shares one 
investigator with five other attorneys who have similar caseloads. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone would like to have seen it go faster, including me,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, school attendance records helped persuade  
prosecutors to drop the murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Olmetti declined to discuss his case as he left the Cook County  
Jail with his parents. ``I want to go back to school and get my 
life back together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, charges were dropped against a man who had been on  
death row for a 1985 murder-rape. DNA evidence cleared Ronald 
Jones, who became the 12th death row inmate to be freed since 
capital punishment was reinstated in Illinois in 1977. The state 
has executed 12 people in that time. 
</P>
<P>
	And in April, a judge acquitted a 16-year-old boy who spent more  
than a year behind bars awaiting trial for murder. The teen-ager 
had confessed to stabbing a woman who, it turns out, was never 
stabbed at all. The judge suggested that the zeal of police and 
prosecutors clouded their judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have denied beating suspects. But Cook County State's  
Attorney Richard Devine and Chicago police Superintendent Terry 
Hillard recently announced that murder suspects will be allowed to 
make videotaped statements after they are questioned. Youngsters 
will be allowed to have their parents with them during questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Devine is also reviewing about 90 Chicago death-row cases -- some  
of them resulting from investigations by homicide Cmdr. Jon Burge, 
who was fired in 1993 after being accused of torturing suspects.

<HEADLINE> Former Teammates to Face Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- They were younger then and didn't know better.  
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nieuwendyk was a second-year center and Theo Fleury a rookie  
right wing when the Calgary Flames won the Stanley Cup in 1989. 
With long careers ahead, both hoped to have their names engraved a 
few more times. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade later, they're still waiting.  
</P>
<P>
	For one of them, that moment may be only a few weeks away. Both  
are in the Western Conference finals -- Nieuwendyk for the Dallas 
Stars and Fleury for the Colorado Avalanche -- which means one of 
them will advance to the NHL finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The series between top-seeded Dallas and second-seeded Colorado  
begins Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were the regular-season champions and were far and above  
the best team,'' Fleury said of the Stars. ``We're going to have 
our work cut out for us, but it's going to be fun. It's going to be 
exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury remained with Calgary until he was traded to Colorado on  
Feb. 28. He would've been an unrestricted free agent this summer 
and the Flames dealt him because they knew he wasn't likely to 
re-sign. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-6, 160-pounder with the laser shot and quick skates  
scored in his first game for the Avalanche but also sprained his 
right knee. He missed seven games, then scored again in his first 
game back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really an opportunistic kind of guy,'' Nieuwendyk said.  
``He won't be overly aggressive on the forecheck, but he'll be the 
guy coming in late who seems to get the goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury has done a good job of it in the playoffs, scoring five  
goals and assisting on nine others. His 14 points tie teammate Joe 
Sakic for third in the playoffs. Another teammate, Peter Forsberg, 
leads the list with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fleury is another threat for them, but he's not asked to carry  
the load like he was in Calgary the last few years,'' Nieuwendyk 
said. ``I think he's a real good fit for that team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because Fleury is on a team loaded with scorers, opponents are  
hesitant to target him for fear of being hurt by someone else. 
Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said his team's biggest challenge will 
be finding a way to handle Colorado's depth. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you know you have more firepower, you can almost play  
cocky at times,'' Hitchcock said. ``Fleury brings that cocky 
attitude that says, `We're going to beat you with the puck and beat 
you bad.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk decided he didn't want to play for Calgary any more  
in 1995. He held out at the beginning of the season until being 
traded to Dallas in February. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the Stars' MVP last season, when he picked up the slack  
following an injury to Mike Modano and led the team in points and 
goals. But midway through the first period of the first postseason 
game, he blew out his right knee on a vicious hit from San Jose's 
Bryan Marchment. Dallas reached the Western Conference finals, but 
Nieuwendyk could only cheer them on. 
</P>
<P>
	This postseason, Nieuwendyk is making up for the lost time. His  
three game-winning goals are tied for the playoff lead, as are his 
two overtime goals. Over 10 games, he has six goals and three 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanche coach Bob Hartley said Nieuwendyk is one of several  
players his team must contain. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have lots of speed, especially at center with Joe  
Nieuwendyk and Mike Modano,'' Hartley said. ``They have speed, size 
and a lot of great two-way players.''

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Drops Internet Chat Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Raytheon Co. has dropped a lawsuit against a group  
of people it believed were spreading company secrets in an 
anonymous Internet chat room -- after the defense contractor 
obtained their names. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 21 chatters were employees, and critics say the  
company used the court's power to chill free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that the sole objective of Raytheon was to identify  
these individuals,'' said David Sobel of the Electronic Privacy 
Information Center, a Washington-based research group. ``It raises 
questions about the legitimacy of the way the court's discovery 
procedures were used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the workers quit, and Raytheon says the rest entered  
corporate ``counseling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt like our internal investigation had accomplished what  
we wanted it to accomplish. It was time to put the matter behind 
us,'' David Polk, a spokesman for the Lexington-based company, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to protecting proprietary information from  
being communicated on a public forum. We think we've done that to a 
certain extent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Raytheon filed suit against 21 ``John Does,''  
accusing them of discussing such matters as rumored mergers and 
acquisitions, impending divestitures and possible defense contracts 
on a public Internet site. The company asked the court on Thursday 
to drop the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The chatters used aliases to conceal their identities. Raytheon  
obtained subpoenas against Internet services, and Polk said the 
company eventually learned all 21 names. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobel said the situation illustrated the need for standards to  
ensure that online anonymity is not too easily compromised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not prepared to say that it's the responsibility of the  
Internet companies to fight these efforts, but they do need to make 
sure that their subscribers are given notice of these subpoenas,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Raytheon case, America Online received subpoenas. Under  
AOL policy, whenever it receives a subpoena in a civil case, the 
customer is notified and given 14 days to try to block the 
subpoena. Only after that time has expired will the company turn 
over the information, said AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said targets of criminal investigations are not  
given such a luxury.

<HEADLINE> Blazers' Coach Take Honors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- It was only natural that Mike Dunleavy  
accepted the NBA Coach of the Year award today with a little 
awkwardness. 
</P>
<P>
	All season long, his job was to persuade the talented Portland  
Trail Blazers that they had to put aside their own goals and egos 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little embarrassing to me,'' Dunleavy said as he  
accepted the Red Auerbach Trophy at the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope our players understand that this is really a team  
award, and that I'm really proud of them,'' Dunleavy said, his 
voice wavering slightly and his eyes getting misty. ``I look at it 
as an award for being the most improved team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy received 48 of a possible 118 votes from a panel of NBA  
sports writers and broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia's Larry Brown was second with 23 votes, followed by  
Utah's Jerry Sloan (15). 
</P>
<P>
	In his second season with the Blazers, Dunleavy faced a  
challenge that most coaches envied: how to integrate the deepest, 
most athletic roster in the league. Emerging stars like Damon 
Stoudamire, Brian Grant and Rasheed Wallace were coaxed into making 
room for role players like Stacey Augmon and Walt Williams. The 
free agent signings of veterans Jim Jackson and Greg Anthony made 
the Blazers even stronger, but opened the door for unrest over 
playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	With only a few incidents of grousing, the team held together,  
and won their first Pacific Division title since the 1991-92 
season. The Blazers' 35-15 record was the third-best in the league, 
behind San Antonio and Utah, which were both 37-13. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided that if we were up front with these guys from the  
very start and not try and sugar-coat the minutes they would get or 
the role that they would play on our team, and if they were still 
willing to commit to it, then we had a chance to make it work,'' 
Dunleavy said. ``I think early in the year, it ruffled some 
feathers; some egos got bumped a little bit, but ultimately, as we 
went through a stretch where it happened to all our players, I 
think everybody realized it's nothing personal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning has its ways. Winning soothes a lot of pain.''  
</P>
<P>
	Portland has continued to win in the playoffs. The Blazers swept  
the Suns in the first round, and Friday's award was presented a 
little more than 12 hours after they defeated the Jazz 84-81 in 
Salt Lake City to even their best-of-7 conference semifinals 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a different team than we had last year,'' Grant said.  
``We're the same players, with the exception of about three. But 
we've got a different mindset, and he's got to be commended for 
that. It wasn't something that we just did on our own. We had to be 
pushed in some areas, and we had to have some guidance, and I think 
he provided that guidance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first time in Dunleavy's eight-year coaching career  
-- two with the Los Angeles Lakers and four with Milwaukee before 
Portland -- that he received the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy said this season still hasn't lived up to 1990-91, when  
the Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals and lost to the Chicago Bulls 
for the first of Michael Jordan's six titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the award, but you can have the award back if you give  
me that ring,'' Dunleavy said.

<HEADLINE> Bailey Back in Utah for Title Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Most members of the Utah Jazz hate the  
theatrics before home playoff games. Not Thurl Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks streak toward the ceiling and unleash deafening booms,  
covering the Delta Center and everyone in it with a thin layer of 
ash. The Jazz Dancers frolic as the team's mascot, Bear, rides a 
huge motorcycle to center court, revving the engine while the 
league's noisiest fans scream their lungs out. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates mostly cover their ears and grimace, but Bailey  
savors the noisy, smoky, frantic atmosphere for just a moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get the chance to be in the playoffs at this point in my  
career ... it's just extra-special. I can't adequately describe the 
feeling,'' Bailey said. ``When you're away from this for so long, 
you begin to forget how great it is. Nothing really compares to the 
playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey is 38, the oldest player on one of the league's oldest  
teams. He first came to the Jazz in 1983, and he spent eight years 
in their old green, purple and gold uniforms, playing an important 
part in Utah's rise from a basketball Siberia to the league's upper 
echelons. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years later, after sojourns in Minneapolis, Greece and  
several cities in Italy, Bailey is back with the Jazz at an age 
when most basketball players have moved on to other things. 
</P>
<P>
	``In that sense, Thurl is an inspiration,'' Utah coach Jerry  
Sloan said. ``He kept himself ready for another chance, and now 
that it's come, he's making the most of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey wasn't sure he'd ever return.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I could still play at this level if I was given a  
chance, but I had to accept the fact that maybe I wouldn't fit with 
a team,'' he said. ``I'm glad I was wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey has won a title before. He was a key player at North  
Carolina State the year Jim Valvano's troops upset Akeem Olajuwon 
and Houston in the 1983 NCAA championship game. The Jazz made him 
the seventh overall pick in that year's draft, and he quickly 
became a franchise cornerstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey was one of the game's best sixth men as well as a  
frequent starter for the Jazz, often using his 6-foot-11 body to 
dominate small forwards. His best years were 1987-89, when he 
averaged over 19 points and six rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thurl has always been that really dependable player that every  
team needs,'' said Karl Malone, who joined the Jazz two years after 
Bailey. ``We had a lot of great years here while we were coming up 
in the league. That was a special time for a lot of young guys 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz traded Bailey in 1991, and he played three seasons with  
Minnesota before dropping out of the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey then headed to Greece, playing one season with Panionios  
before three years in the Italian League with Polti Cantu and 
Milano. He led his league in blocked shots each of the four years 
he played in Europe, and was the high scorer on Polti Cantu's 
championship team in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had wonderful times in Europe, but it's hard to be away from  
the people and things you care about,'' Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	His second wife, Sindi, is a Utah native, and the couple made  
their offseason home in Salt Lake. Two of Bailey's children from 
his first marriage also live in Utah. After four years of 
globetrotting, he had had enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bologna club in Italy's top league offered Bailey truckloads  
of lira for another season. The offer went higher when Bailey 
appeared to be leaning toward staying in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was time to move on,'' Bailey said. ``I wanted the  
challenge of trying the NBA again. It was something I had to find 
out about myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, he began playing in a daily pickup game at Salt Lake's  
Westminster College with John Stockton, Jeff Hornacek and a 
revolving roster of NBA players and wannabes. As the lockout 
dragged on, he drew attention with his smooth game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could tell Thurl still had what it takes,'' Stockton said.  
``He's a hard worker, and you could tell he really wanted to stick 
with'' the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	The team invited Bailey to training camp, though no one in the  
organization thought much of his chances to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've invited him. We owe him that. He played for the  
franchise back when it needed him. He did a good job ... so, we owe 
him that,'' Jazz vice president of basketball operations Scott 
Layden told The Salt Lake Tribune at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	But then a chain of events left the Jazz needing a big man. Utah  
went after free agent LaPhonso Ellis, and an irked Antoine Carr 
signed with Houston. When Ellis spurned the Jazz for Atlanta days 
before the regular season began, Bailey was the man on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good timing is part of life,'' Bailey said. ``God had a plan  
for me to be in a good situation, and that's what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He played in 43 of Utah's games this year, providing solid  
defense and the occasional offensive spark. At 38, there are 
limitations to his game, but ``my experience gets me through a lot 
of things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Life is good in Utah for Bailey, who converted to Mormonism, the  
state's dominant faith, while he played in Italy. He's able to 
watch his children grow up, instead of talking to them on the phone 
late at night from a hotel room in Italy. He recently released an 
album of original songs, including a duet with country musician 
Billy Dean. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey and fellow newcomer Todd Fuller, the only additions to  
Utah's roster this season, basically split the minutes that were 
played by Carr in years past. On and off the court, Bailey makes 
the most of his time, as shown in Game 1 of the Jazz's conference 
semifinal series against Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey played just seven minutes but hit the only two shots he  
took, including a jumper that beat the shot clock and tied the game 
in the fourth quarter. When Bailey's unique, twisting jump shot 
found the net, Jazz PA announcer Dan Roberts bellowed a call he 
revived this year after eight years in storage: ``Big T, Thurl 
Bailey! T for two!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be home,'' Bailey said.  
</P>
<P>
	 *End Adv for May 22-23

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Panel Gets Tech Nod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Cash-hungry organizers of Salt Lake City's  
Olympics got one thing they wanted from the International Olympic 
Committee this week: the nod to go after technology sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee and OPUS, the marketing  
company it runs jointly with the U.S. Olympic Committee, have 
hesitated to recruit those corporate sponsors because technology 
has been the IOC's purview in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	No more, said Mitt Romney, chief executive of the SLOC, speaking  
Thursday at the end of four days of meetings between the IOC 
Coordination Commission and Salt Lake City executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking the blinders off,'' Romney said. ``There is a  
huge virgin territory in the information technology marketplace. We 
need to get after it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreements forged this week ``open to us  
potentially millions of dollars,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those millions are badly needed by a committee scarred by  
scandal this winter and still $300 million short of meeting its 
$1.45 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Vows of cooperation, such as on the technology sponsor front,  
were the byword of the meetings here this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, comprised of IOC members and international  
sports officials, offered suggestions ranging from opening the beer 
and wine spigots at the press center to setting aside an 
athletes-only traffic lane between the Olympic Village in Salt Lake 
City and the ski venues in Park City. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, the Swiss IOC member who is chairman of the  
commission, suggested Salt Lake City hope for no snow since the 
artificial variety is preferable from an athletic and logistical 
standpoint. ``That is the only thing man does better than God,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a gesture to show the IOC does not demand luxury, it decided  
to stay at the existing Little America hotel, not in the more 
opulent Little America Tower being built across the street. The 
tower will have suites, but IOC members need only double-bed rooms, 
Hodler said. 
</P>
<P>
	That will mean SLOC can erase a $1.2 million contingency it  
built into its budget in case room rates exceeded $200 per night 
the IOC was obligated to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy chairman of the commission, Jean-Claude Killy of  
France, assured that ``the IOC will pay for its rooms,'' Romney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also endorsed keeping figure skating in the Delta  
Center by adding seats close to the ice so athletes see spectators' 
faces and by using two jumbo screens at the end of the arena to 
give all fans good views. Both athletes and spectators grumbled 
after the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in February. 
</P>
<P>
	And the IOC welcomed the SLOC announcement it wants to add five  
events to the games, bringing the total to 75, the most ever for a 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he's confident the SLOC board and IOC will approve  
adding women's bobsled, men's and women's skeleton (a headfirst 
plunge on a small sled down an ice chute at 70 mph) and men's and 
women's cross-country sprints. The events will use the track 
already build for luge and bobsled as well as the biathlon trail to 
be built this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of adding the events, after figuring in ticket sales,  
is $650,000, said Cathy Priestner-Allinger, director of sport for 
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jen Davidson, a 26-year-old exercise physiologist at  
Intermountain Health Care and women's bobsledder, said she was 
elated by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working long and hard on this,'' Davidson said.  
``I'm pretty happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson, who lives in Layton, Utah, was the brakeman on the  
bobsled team that won three gold and five silver medals during the 
recent World Cup season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser Bullock, the chief operating officer, said the organizing  
committee and the U.S. Olympic Committee are close to finding $5 
million to pay for operating the Utah Winter Sports Park, including 
its bobsled luge track, until the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC has been threatening to close down the park at times to  
save $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said details of the new technology sponsor approach  
remain to be worked out, but Salt Lake and OPUS are free to go 
after sponsors that could help it sell tickets and merchandise on 
the Internet, a $30 million category, as well as other types of 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC will continue negotiating for the computer hardware  
itself, and it has not been decided who will pursue systems 
analysis companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the agreements will be finalized when the IOC  
executive board meets in Seoul, South Korea, next month.

<HEADLINE> Young Murder Victim Yells for Mom </HEADLINE>

	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- An 8-year-old boy screamed for his  
mother as they were chased through their home and shot to death to 
keep him from testifying in a murder case, according to a woman who 
said she was the killer's lookout. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman burst through the front door of Leroy ``B.J.'' Brown  
Jr.'s house, then chased him and his mother up the stairs, firing 
at them as they ran for their lives, Josephine Lee told 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!'' B.J. screamed as he reached for  
his mother on the stairs ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	He was still yelling for his mother when the gunman shot him in  
the back of the head, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's account of the slayings was released Thursday in arrest  
warrant affidavits for Russell and Adrian Peeler. The brothers are 
accused of killing B.J. and his mother, Karen Clarke, to stop the 
boy from testifying against Russell Peeler, who was charged with 
killing Clarke's fiancee, Rudolph Snead Jr., in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	B.J. had identified Russell Peeler as the gunman in an earlier  
attempt on Snead's life and was planning to testify against him. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Jan. 8, several months before Peeler's trial was  
scheduled to begin, B.J. and his mother were found dead inside 
their Bridgeport duplex. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors arrested the Peelers last month, using the statement  
of Lee, a neighbor of Clarke's who admitted alerting the brothers 
when Clarke and her son got home from shopping. Lee pleaded guilty 
to conspiracy to commit murder in return for prosecutors seeking a 
maximum sentence of 7 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Both brothers pleaded innocent Thursday to murder, capital  
felony -- which could earn the death penalty -- and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest affidavits detail Lee's statement to police. She is  
not identified by name in the court papers, but prosecutors 
identified her as the witness during a previous court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler's lawyer, John T. Walkley, called Lee's account  
``preposterous'' and said she had changed her story several times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each statement seems to be a little more incredible than the  
next,'' he said. ``The only reason I can think of why someone would 
do this is because they're trying to protect somebody else.''

<HEADLINE> RaytSaid Dropping Chat Board Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Raytheon has reportedly dropped a  
lawsuit against 21 people it had accused of revealing the company's 
financial secrets on an Internet chat site. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon filed papers yesterday in Middlesex Superior Courtto  
dismiss the suit that had claimed the postings cost it $25,000 and 
hurt its business reputation, according to a report in today's 
editions of The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lexington-based defense contractor said the move had  
protected its financial information. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it brings the matter to a close,'' Raytheon spokesman  
David Polk told the Globe. ``Our internal activities are over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants, at least some of whom were Raytheon employees,  
discussed corporate business on a World Wide Web site run by Yahoo! 
Topics included the company's stock price and gripes about the 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants used aliases like ``Rayman-mass'' and  
``RaytheonVeteran,'' which they believed would protect their 
identities. 
</P>
<P>
	But the defense contractor obtained their names after filing  
discovery motions against Yahoo! and other Internet providers, 
drawing attention to how easy it is to learn the identities behind 
supposedly anonymous Internet screen names. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet free speech groups were critical of the Internet  
providers, saying they caved in to Raytheon after giving the 
impression they'd do more to protect users' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the employees named in the suit have since left  
Raytheon.

<HEADLINE> It's Sweet Jazz for Blazers at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers finally have  
the Utah Jazz right where they want them: at home and appearing 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	John Stockton's missed drive at the end of Game 2 Thursday night  
let the Blazers escape Utah with an 84-81 victory and evened the 
best-of-7 Western Conference semifinals 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The win, which came after Portland nearly blew a fourth-quarter  
lead for the second time in the series, also boosted the Blazers' 
already abundant confidence heading into Saturday's Game 3 at the 
Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not go into Utah saying to ourselves ... `How are we  
going to win? Can we win?' '' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said 
Friday after winning the NBA Coach of the Year award. ``We believed 
that we could win. We know we can win every game we play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland won 22 of the 25 games it played at home during the  
regular season, with one of those losses coming to the Jazz in 
mid-March, 91-77. In the playoffs, Utah has lost its last seven 
games in Portland. Its last win here was in a first-round series in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no doubt we can win one or two of those games up  
there, if we don't turn the ball over and play the kind of defense 
we're capable of,'' Stockton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers led 73-64 with 5:13 to play before the Jazz rallied  
behind Stockton and Jeff Hornacek. Their consecutive 3-pointers 
pulled Utah within 82-81 with 12 seconds left. Portland's Greg 
Anthony made one of two free throws with 10 seconds left, setting 
up Stockton's miss. It appeared that he might have been fouled by 
Jim Jackson, but the officials let the play stand. 
</P>
<P>
	The sometimes hotheaded Blazers kept their cool, unlike Tuesday  
night's opener, in which Rasheed Wallace was called for a flagrant 
foul on Bryon Russell. Wallace threw a tantrum, was called for a 
technical, and the Jazz scored four points on the possession to tie 
the game at 78-all. They didn't trail again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there was a lot of growing up that happened,'' Blazers  
power forward Brian Grant said of Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant said the Blazers will continue to exploit their quickness  
advantage in the paint, even though Utah center Greg Ostertag has 
played better this series after a poor opening-round against 
Sacramento. In Game 1 against the Blazers, he had six points and 
six rebounds, and he grabbed 14 rebounds Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg has had two pretty good games, which is nice because  
(Arvydas) Sabonis is a tough matchup for him,'' Jazz coach Jerry 
Sloan said. ``He's being conscientious about his rebounding, and 
he's doing some good things on defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz have to play better against Isaiah Rider, who continued  
his playoff surge with a career postseason-high 27 points Thursday 
night. He's averaging 19.8 points in the playoffs, and is taxing 
the Jazz defense by hitting from the outside and driving the ball 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, I thought I played pretty good defense,''  
Hornacek said. ``I don't know how much more we could have done, 
unless it was making somebody else take the shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Malone, third in the league in playoff scoring at 23.9,  
behind only Allen Iverson (28.5) and Shaquille O'Neal (25.8), said 
the Jazz can't repeat their 18-turnover performance if they hope to 
win in Portland and take back homecourt advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put ourselves in a hole, and now we have to dig ourselves  
out,'' he said. ``You can't be intimidated now. They came into our 
place, they wanted to get a game, and they did. Now we have to go 
to their place. To win it, we have to win on their floor.''

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Conn. Store Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- An explosion that leveled a liquor store,  
killing two people and injuring 10 others, was caused by the 
ignition of gasoline fumes from a stream that ran under the 
building, investigators said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast Wednesday leveled most of the two-story building,  
which housed Venancio's Wine &AMP; Liquor on the first floor and three 
apartments above. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw anything like it. It was like the whole roof  
lifted up and fell on the sidewalk,'' said Ed Pryblski, whose 
brother, Michael, co-owns the liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials believe that gasoline fumes from the stream came into  
the liquor store through pipe holes in the bathroom floor. The 
fumes were ignited by the pilot light of a ceiling-mounted, 
gas-fired heater. 
</P>
<P>
	The ignition caused two separate explosions -- one in the store  
and one under the building --and started a fire, Deputy Fire Marshal 
Francis Curran said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators theorize that recent rains could have elevated the  
water level and forced vapors to rise in the building. 
Investigators were still trying to find the source of the gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the blast, rescuers dug through the rubble for  
hours Wednesday night for two men they knew were trapped in the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	One man did not survive, but a 36-year-old store employee,  
Jeffrey Keeler, was found alive pinned against a wall under burning 
debris. He was in critical condition at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators, using police dogs and heavy machinery to move  
debris, later pulled a second body from the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten others were hospitalized for non-life threatening injuries.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dropped Vs. DMX </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Authorities have decided not to file charges  
against rapper DMX in connection with a post-concert stabbing at a 
Denver restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had ordered DMX, also known as Earl Simmons, to appear in  
Denver for an interview after witnesses placed him in a group that 
attacked and stabbed a man on April 28 after a concert at the 
Denver Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons returned Tuesday for the interview and witnesses were  
talked to again. Based on the investigation, the district 
attorney's office decided not to file charges, spokeswoman Sandy 
Romero said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Virginia Lopez said the charges were dropped because  
of a conviction was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we expected, DMX was vindicated,'' Simmons spokesman Ian  
Niles said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> World War II Mutineer Seeks Pardon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fifty-five years after the worst domestic loss  
of life in World War II, one of the survivors of an ammunition 
explosion is asking President Clinton to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Freddie Meeks and 49 other black sailors were court-martialed  
for mutiny for refusing to return to the loading docks after the 
July 1944 blast at the Port Chicago Naval Magazine that killed 320 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeks, 79, is one of two known surviving members of the group of  
black sailors convicted and imprisoned three months after the 
explosion near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't really deserve what we got, but we got it and we had  
to put up with it,'' Meeks said Thursday in a telephone interview 
from his home near Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Meeks argued the military prosecution was racist and  
the punishment too harsh. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really wasn't evidence that these men organized a mutiny  
the way most people think of a mutiny at sea,'' said one of Meeks' 
lawyers, Brian Busey. ``These were 50 men who decided individually 
that they were not going to go back and load ships ... after seeing 
hundreds of their friends blown to smithereens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sailors defied white officers' orders to resume loading  
ships two weeks after the blast. Two-thirds of those killed were 
members of the all-black loading crews that stacked bombs and other 
explosives aboard Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	White sailors in the same position would not have been  
court-martialed, Busey contended. 
</P>
<P>
	The pardon petition argues that Meeks' apprehension was  
justified, and that he did not mutiny. It also notes that Meeks 
volunteered for any other Navy duty, including service at the 
front, instead of returning to the docks. 
</P>
<P>
	A pardon would clear Meeks' record but is not the same as a  
reversal of the court-martial conviction. The Navy has refused to 
do that. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers presented the pardon petition to Navy Secretary  
Richard Danzig with a request for a speedy review because of Meeks' 
declining health. Danzig will review the case and make a 
recommendation to the Justice Department. From there, a 
recommendation will go to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, the pardon would address only Meeks' case. The  
other known survivor among the convicted mutineers is considering 
separate legal action, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy spokeswoman, Lt. Dora Staggs, confirmed the Navy's judge  
advocate general received the petition. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1994 Navy legal review concluded the black seamen faced racial  
prejudice but found no grounds to overturn their courts-martial. 
The review followed several years of congressional pressure aimed 
at clearing the sailors' names. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., and others renewed  
those efforts with a letter to Clinton requesting help in expunging 
the convictions. The White House has not acted. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 250 black sailors initially refused to go back to the  
loading docks. Eventually, 208 were forced to return and were 
disciplined. The 50 who continued the boycott were court-martialed 
by an all-white jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeks served less than two years of an original 15-year  
sentence, then returned to active duty in the Navy to serve out the 
term of his draft. He was discharged in 1946 and his military 
benefits were later restored. 
</P>
<P>
	But Meeks was ashamed of the conviction and did not tell his  
children about it until many years later, his lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do hope they get an answer as quickly as possible,'' Meeks  
said. ``This thing has been dragging on for so long, and I'm just 
hoping we get it cleared up.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Envoys Confer in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's chief envoy on the Yugoslavia crisis  
unexpectedly canceled all his meetings with foreign officials today 
amid signs that no breakthrough on finding a political solution was 
in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's office wouldn't say why he  
called off talks with Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou and 
U.N. envoy Carl Bildt, both of whom arrived in Moscow this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Bildt, Papandreou and Russian diplomats had planned to discuss a  
plan to provide humanitarian aid to the victims of the Kosovo 
conflict, both Serbs and Albanians, the ITAR-Tass news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Papandreou had also planned to raise his proposal for a 48-hour  
cease-fire in Yugoslavia. Greece, although a NATO member, has 
opposed the bombing of Yugoslavia, and Papandreou earlier this week 
called for a 48-hour pause to give diplomacy a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin's cancellation came after on-going talks in Moscow  
appeared to have made little progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian acting Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov met with Deputy  
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott today. Talbott only said 
afterwards that ``negotiations are continuing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That meeting came after Chernomyrdin, Talbott and Finnish  
President Martti Ahtisaari held talks that ran into the early hours 
this morning, apparently without major progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott said the Thursday night talks had been constructive and  
would continue. But none of the three gave details. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahtisaari, who returned to Finland today, said the negotiations  
``just keep getting better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were still ``plenty of issues that are extremely difficult  
and the solutions for them don't necessarily please everyone, but 
maybe understanding will increase when there aren't many 
alternatives,'' Ahtisaari told reporters on arrival in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	The Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the State  
Duma, also touched on the crisis today, once again condemning NATO 
raids. It drafted an appeal to President Clinton, Congress, and 
leaders of European governments to stop the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia strongly opposes NATO attacks on Yugoslavia and has been  
working for a political solution, but with little success. 
</P>
<P>
	While Chernomyrdin was in Belgrade on Thursday, he and Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic discussed a plan by the Group of Eight 
industrialized nations to end the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic reportedly told Chernomyrdin that Yugoslavia opposes  
pulling all of its troops out of Kosovo and allowing an 
international force to control the province -- both of which NATO 
demands.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Security Secrets Disclosed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Classified documents of the kind that normally  
take decades to come to light are there for all to see in the back 
of a new book on Clinton administration security policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents describe how North Korea's leader crushed a 1995  
coup attempt and President Clinton assured Boris Yeltsin that U.S. 
policy would have a ``positive impact'' on the Russian leader's 
re-election. The documents also detail how China, under a deal with 
the U.S. communications company Motorola, developed a launcher to 
deploy commercial satellites into space. An intelligence estimate 
said this technology could be converted easily into multiple 
nuclear warhead launchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the government is prone to leaks, the unauthorized  
publication of classified documents that in most cases are just a 
year or two old is rare. It has touched off widespread concern in 
the intelligence community. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials interviewed Thursday confirmed the authenticity  
of the documents and voiced concern about their publication in the 
book ``Betrayal'' by journalist Bill Gertz. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior administration official, who spoke only on condition  
of anonymity, said the White House didn't consider any of the 
published information embarrassing but was concerned about risk to 
intelligence sources and methods. 
</P>
<P>
	For several years, the FBI has been trying to identify Gertz's  
sources, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the kind of material that people file lawsuits to  
obtain after it's 30 years old,'' said Steve Aftergood of the 
Federation of American Scientists, a Washington group that follows 
intelligence issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``These documents carry some of the highest classifications in  
the U.S. government, and it's absolutely astonishing that they 
would be published in this way,'' Aftergood said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his book, Gertz, a reporter for The Washington Times,  
presents a critical account of Clinton administration security 
policy that tracks closely to stories he has written over the past 
several years. The original articles, however, did not include 
reprints of the classified documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gertz, in a telephone interview, declined to discuss his  
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The book criticizes the Clinton administration for being too  
soft in its policies regarding Russia, China, North Korea and Iraq, 
among other nations. The author tries to underscore the threat that 
these countries pose by pointing to documents that describe 
emerging or potential security threats in these and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, according to Gertz, carried out a  
policy of appeasement of real or potential U.S. enemies that ``so 
angered some intelligence, defense and foreign policy officials 
that they responded in the only way they knew how: by disclosing to 
the press some of the nation's most secret intelligence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gertz wrote that his sources were ``unsung heroes'' who  
``jeopardized their careers to expose wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CIA Director George Tenet has complained about a  
``hemorrhaging'' of classified information. Tenet has not blamed 
the news media, focusing instead on ``people who believe they 
derive some power from leaking classified information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book's appendix reprints all or part of 23 documents from  
the Clinton administration -- some as recent as last year -- ranging 
in classification from confidential to top secret. Several are 
marked ``umbra'' or ``gamma,'' code words for information derived 
from electronic intercepts. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 U.S. intelligence report disclosed that the North Korean  
government had detailed three cases of cannibalism stemming from 
famine. It was classified at the ``code word'' level, among the 
highest levels of classification. 
</P>
<P>
	A secret dispatch written last August by Larry Robinson, a State  
Department official in Seoul, raised questions about leader Kim 
Jong-Il's hold on power. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is extensive evidence of a major coup attempt by  
elements of the VI Corps in 1995, which appears to have been 
crushed only with some difficulty,'' the dispatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	A March 1996 State Department memorandum, marked  
``confidential,'' summarized Clinton's meeting with Yeltsin at a 
terrorism summit in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told Yeltsin he ``wanted to make sure that everything  
the United States did would have a positive impact and nothing 
should have a negative impact'' on Yeltsin's upcoming re-election, 
the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo added that the United States wanted an upcoming summit  
with the Russian leader to be successful to ``reinforce everything 
that Yeltsin had done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A December 1996 report by the Air Force National Air  
Intelligence Center described how the Chinese, under a contract 
with Motorola, designed a launcher to send communications 
satellites into Earth orbit. But the Air Force analysis called 
these satellite launchers a ``technology bridge'' to launchers for 
multiple-warhead missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The secret report also noted that ``the Chinese have expressed  
an interest in developing'' such technology, ``however, no known 
testing of such a system has occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a 1997 CIA report, based in part on electronic intercepts  
and spy satellite imagery, indicated Russia was building a bunker 
and subway line for use in evacuating leaders in a military 
emergency.

<HEADLINE> Racing Back at Fatal Accident Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The Winston is usually the most upbeat,  
enjoyable race each year at Lowe's Motor Speedway. This year, it's 
part of the track's recovery process from a deadly tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15th annual all-star event for top stock car drivers will be  
the first race at the track since three spectators were killed and 
eight more were injured by flying debris during an Indy-car race at 
the speedway May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to have some fun this month,'' said speedway  
president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler. ``It's been a long month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time trials were scheduled for tonight to determine the starting  
grid for Saturday night's event, which will feature a record field 
of 21 drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging from advance ticket sales, there doesn't appear to be  
lingering fan concern about safety at the track because of the Indy 
Racing League crash. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 tickets for The Winston had been sold by  
Thursday, and the speedway expects the usual gathering of about 
125,000 for the event, which typically draws a strong walk-up 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the speedway's advance-sale tickets were $76 seats in  
the fourth-turn grandstands, where a wheel and suspension parts 
landed during the IRL race after a three-car wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	But Winston Cup cars are not built like IRL machines, which are  
designed to shed parts in wrecks to help absorb the impact of 
crashes. Winston Cup cars weigh twice as much and have heavy steel 
roll cages surrounding the drivers to protect them from impacts, 
and the vehicles are far less likely to send wheels and other large 
parts flying after crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see no reason at all for anybody to be concerned about  
sitting in the grandstands for The Winston,'' Wheeler said.

	Sitting isn't something that's always popular at The Winston, a  
70-lap affair that generally takes only about 45 minutes to 
complete while featuring the kind of action that keeps fans on 
their feet and cheering. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the drama is that this brisk event offers a purse of  
more than $1.3 million, with the winner guaranteed a minimum of 
$200,000. In addition, because it is a non-points race, NASCAR 
officials tend to turn their heads away and permit the kind of 
aggressive racing that isn't tolerated on the circuit on a weekly 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Winston has produced its share of physical driving, but it  
has created drama in other ways as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Waltrip, a non-winner in his 15-year career on stock car  
racing's premier circuit, earned a spot in the 1996 all-star event 
by winning a qualifying race. He followed that by staging a 
dramatic charge from last to first to win the main event. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to an all-star game in football or basketball,  
those guys don't have to go 100 percent,'' Waltrip said. ``They can 
let their friends shoot or make sure everybody scores. In our 
all-star game, we're still running 200 mph down the straightaway. 
So it gets really serious once we start. In that respect, it's a 
lot like a regular race. 
</P>
<P>
	But the atmosphere is awesome. Everybody is loose and there to  
enjoy the weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race is run in segments of 30, 30 and 10 laps, and Jeff  
Gordon appeared to have the final segment well in hand last year, 
only to run out of gas as he took the white flag. As Gordon's 
silent car coasted helplessly off the pace, Mark Martin powered by 
to win The Winston for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fun race, and you never know what's going to happen,''  
said Darrell Waltrip, who won the inaugural running of The Winston 
in 1985 and has competed in every one since. ``Everybody seems to 
mind their manners pretty well until, obviously, the last 10 laps. 
Then it's a no-holds-barred situation.''

<HEADLINE> Blijlevens Takes Italy's 7th Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANCIANO, Italy (AP) -- Jeroen Blijlevens of the Netherlands  
earned his second stage victory in the Tour of Italy cycling race 
Friday, outsprinting Latvian Romans Vainsteins and Italy's Fabrizio 
Guidi. 
</P>
<P>
	French champion Laurent Jalabert retained the pink jersey as  
overall leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Blijlevens, winner of the third stage at Messina and a former  
race leader, rushed ahead with 200 meters left in the seventh stage 
and won easily. 
</P>
<P>
	Vainsteins, winner of Thursday's stage, finished second and  
Guidi was third in the 94.8-mile stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner was timed in 4 hours, 12 minutes, 6 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Jalabert led Italy's Danilo Di Luca by seven seconds.  
Defending champion Marco Pantani was fifth, 22 seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the start of Friday's stage, Pantani, Jalabert and world  
road champion Oscar Camenzind led a strong protest against blood 
tests carried out by doctors of the Italian Olympic Committee. 
Cyclists considered the new tests an unneeded duplication of blood 
controls made by the International Cycling Union (UIC) at the start 
of last Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not against random anti-doping tests by UIC, but we  
don't want duplicated controls ... If CONI tests are renewed in the 
next days, we are ready to stop the race and return home,'' said 
Pantani, who represented most of the 156 cyclists in the Giro. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's eighth stage of 156.8 miles in the 22-leg event  
includes three climbs and a tough finish at Gran Sasso d'Italia, at 
2,130 meters of altitude in the Apennines mountains.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Grievance Put On Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell wants to concentrate on the  
playoffs before pursuing his grievance against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was fined $25,000 by Madison Square Garden president  
Dave Checketts in April for remarks by his agent. Agent Robert Gist 
was quoted as saying Sprewell would demand an offseason trade if 
the team persists in using him off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell reiterated his unhappiness with his role Thursday night  
before New York's 77-70 victory over the Atlanta Hawks for a 2-0 
lead in their best-of-7 second-round playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	A grievance was filed by the union Wednesday night, just before  
the 30-day deadline expired. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still hoping the Knicks will do the right thing and  
rescind the fine, but if they don't, it's not something we're going 
to let stand without a fight,'' union lawyer Ron Klempner said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than put the grievance on the fast track, Klempner said  
the union will wait until the season ends before requesting a 
hearing date, which would be the next step in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has already had the fine money deducted from his  
paycheck, although a sneaker company that Sprewell endorses has 
said it would pay the $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the season ends, we'll see what the Knicks want to do.  
Right now, Latrell wants to remain focused on basketball,'' 
Klempner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has scored 31 points in each of the Knicks' playoff  
victories over the Hawks and has emerged in the postseason -- in 
part because of Patrick Ewing's various injuries -- as New York's 
primary offensive weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was the starting small forward in the first two games  
of the regular season, then lost his job when a foot injury 
sidelined him for 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy has been bringing him off the bench ever, a  
tactic that has been questioned as the Knicks have consistently 
gotten off to bad offensive starts like their 1-for-15 opening 
against the Hawks on Thursday night that prompted the coach to 
insert Sprewell earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, Sprewell usually sat for the first  
eight minutes of the first and third quarters as Van Gundy went 
with a lineup of Ewing, Allan Houston, Kurt Thomas, Larry Johnson 
and Charlie Ward. Sprewell has been checking in around the 
six-minute mark of the first quarter during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've accepted it, but I still feel the way I did in the  
past,'' Sprewell said before Game 2. ``It's just a situation I'm in 
right now and I have to deal with it.''

	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft plans to quintuple its  
electronic commerce unit by hiring 400 employees to increase its 
efforts to sign up additional small- and medium-sized businesses 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the new employees will be based overseas, Microsoft  
spokesman Dan Leach said. The e-commerce unit, which currently has 
about 100 employees, is part of Microsoft's newly reorganized 
consumer and commerce division. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is focusing its e-commerce efforts on four areas:  
providing access to the Internet; hosting Websites for small 
businesses; gaining distribution for its Microsoft Network 
Websites; and selling Windows and other software as a platform for 
e-commerce offerings, Leach said.

<HEADLINE>  Carr Not the Show on De La Hoya Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya could probably take it easy  
tomorrow night, box Oba Carr for 12 rounds and add another $5 
million to his already fat bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	With a megafight set with fellow welterweight champion Felix  
Trinidad and other big bouts ahead, it would seem the prudent thing 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, however, is in no mood to be prudent.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not boxing anymore. I'm going back to fighting, to the old  
school way,'' De La Hoya said. ``I'm going to walk through guys and 
destroy them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could be bad news for Carr, a decent enough fighter but a  
10-1 underdog when he challenges De La Hoya for the WBC 147-pound 
title in the scheduled 12-round bout at the Mandalay Bay resort. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would please De La Hoya's fans, who may have been  
disappointed in the cautious way he fought Ike Quartey his last 
time out and the fact that four of his last eight fights have gone 
the 12-round distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee you there is no fighter in the world who can take  
my punch and last 12 rounds,'' De La Hoya said. ``So what am I 
doing boxing people? I should be going out there and destroying 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya doesn't need to knock Carr out to guarantee a Sept.  
18 fight with Trinidad that will pay him $15 million. He simply 
needs to beat Carr for the fight, which was finalized Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But De La Hoya says he has a reborn desire to punch people out.  
It came to him just during training camp when he woke up one 
morning about five weeks ago and decided that he should return to 
the form in which he knocked out 20 of his first 22 opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	A parade of different trainers, he said, had changed his style  
by convincing him that he was getting hit too much and should try 
to box more in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided to listen to myself and do what I want in the  
ring,'' De La Hoya said. ``My passion is fighting and I wasn't 
happy doing the things I was doing against (Pernell) Whitaker, 
Quartey and the others. I'm not a boxer, I'm a fighter. I'm a 
slugger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya said his transformation from boxer back to puncher  
began the same day of his revelation in his training camp in the 
mountains of Big Bear, Calif. He went into the ring and began 
backing his sparring partners up and punishing them instead of 
looking for angles and trying to block punches. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, says trainer Roberto Alcazar, have been nothing  
short of spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 100 percent different,'' Alcazar said. ``He's happy and  
he's hurting people in the ring. He's the old Oscar like he was 
when he first started out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya may be fortunate he's got a chance to test out his  
new theory of fighting against Carr instead of a ferocious puncher 
the likes of Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters weighed in Friday at the class limit of 147  
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr is capable enough and certainly no pushover. He's 48-2-1  
with 28 knockouts and his only two losses were to Trinidad and 
Quartey, both of whom he knocked down before being beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carr has had both sides of his jaw broken in his last two  
fights, and the Detroit fighter will be getting a bigger and 
stronger opponent. Carr had his jaw wired for weeks and was on a 
liquid diet after winning a Feb. 22 elimination fight against 
Frankie Randall to qualify for the De La Hoya fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oba Carr is a dangerous opponent and he'll be ready to  
fight,'' said De La Hoya, 30-0 with 24 knockouts. ``When I fight an 
opponent, they lift themselves up to the sky. They all want to be 
the first to beat Oscar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight with Carr, which will be televised by HBO beginning  
around 11:30 p.m. EDT, has been largely overshadowed by 
negotiations between rival promoters Bob Arum and Don King over a 
Sept. 18 fight between De La Hoya and Trinidad, who holds the IBF 
version of the welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Bob Arum said Friday that De La Hoya will receive $15  
million and Trinidad's camp will get $10.5 million for the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two fighters have to win, that's the main thing,'' Arum  
said. ``Other than that, it's a done deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carr would love nothing better than to disrupt the carefully  
laid plans of De La Hoya and his promoter. The 27-year-old, who 
will make $350,000, sees himself as part of a welterweight series 
that could include a number of fights between the likes of himself, 
De La Hoya, Quartey and Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trinidad and Oscar is an attractive fight,'' Carr conceded.  
``People want to see that fight. But in the future they're going to 
want to see Oba Carr and Trinidad and Oba Carr and De La Hoya in a 
rematch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the card is a second title fight, with Floyd Mayweather  
defending his WBC super featherweight title against Justin Juuko, a 
Ugandan living in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the third defense of the title for Mayweather, a 1996  
Olympian who is 20-0 as a pro. He was supposed to have fought Goyo 
Vargas, but Vargas became sick in training camp and pulled out at 
the last minute.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Disney Execs Plan Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Two former Walt Disney Co.  
executives are joining forces to create an entertainment Internet 
site that will be able to personalize its presentation to meet the 
interests of users. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ovitz, who served a brief tenure as president of Disney,  
and former Disney Online president Richard Wolpert hope to 
distinguish their site, CheckOut.com, from dozens of other 
e-commerce portals by offering fans more than just an opportunity 
to buy products. 
</P>
<P>
	Users will be able to listen to music, watch videos and read the  
latest news and archived stories about actors, musicians and 
digital game designers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the selling point stressed by Wolpert and Ovitz during a  
brief demonstration Thursday is CheckOut.com's ability to 
personalize the site. Once a user indicates interest in a 
particular artist, music style or subject, the screen is filled 
with references and options for related information. The site is 
designed to ``remember'' the user's preferences by tracking icons 
that are clicked. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have is the ultimate destination for entertainment  
data,'' said Ovitz. ``It's not all about buying. It's not like an 
Amazon.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CheckOut.com, scheduled to be up and running by midsummer, also  
may reflect the ultimate business partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	It combines Ovitz's powerful influence in the entertainment  
world with Wolpert's experience helping Disney create and manage 
some of the leading Internet sites, including Disney.com, The 
Disney Internet Guide and The Disney Store Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Ovitz and Wolpert is former grocery store magnate Ron  
Burkle. Known in Hollywood for star-studded political fund-raisers 
at his 40-room Beverly Hills mansion, Burkle made headlines last 
October when his Yucaipa Cos. holding company sold Fred Meyer Inc. 
to Kroger Corp. for $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkle, who on Wednesday night held a reception and dinner for  
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, did not join Wolpert and Ovitz 
in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks after the Kroger deal was announced, Wolpert left  
Disney to develop online ventures for Yucaipa. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the high-powered team can make CheckOut.com a force in  
the competitive world of electronic commerce may depend on how well 
they work together, said Ron Rappaport, an e-commerce analyst with 
Zona Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a nice track record on paper and certainly the  
connections are there to make something happen, but making it 
happen is the challenge that separates the ambitious from the 
successful in the Internet industry,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Personalized, one-to-one retailing has been a goal of Internet  
designers for some time, said Rappaport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Ovitz and Wolpert are trying to surf a fairly  
significant wave that marketers have been dealing for a few 
years,'' he said. ``Kudos to this team if they can turn theory into 
reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Ovitz, the deal is the latest of many since the former super  
agent made a bitter break with Disney. Ovitz left after less than a 
year as Disney's No. 2 executive, reportedly because of a dispute 
over power sharing with Disney chairman and chief executive Michael 
Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has become a partner in Livent Inc., the troubled  
live theater company, and backed an unsuccessful bid to lure a 
National Football League franchise to Carson, Calif., where he, 
Burkle and others planned to build a new stadium. Ovitz also has 
formed Artists Management Group, which represents Robin Williams 
and other Hollywood stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz's vision for CheckOut.com includes creating a broad  
entertainment experience that will keep users' attention even if 
they don't buy on every visit. Eventually, the site probably will 
include live shows and the opportunity to download music. 
Initially, CDs, videos and games will be ordered but not delivered 
online.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Beating Death Raises Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- It could have been any small shop in any inner  
city. A customer of one race, store owners of another, a 
disagreement, harsh words, a burst of fatal violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crisis is the same in every city. It's a crisis of the  
inner city, not enough employment, not enough hope,'' James Zogby, 
head of the Arab American Institute, said Thursday. ``They're ripe 
for victimization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Community leaders met Thursday to try to quell tension raised by  
the arrest of two Arab-American store clerks in the beating death 
of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the clerks attacked 34-year-old electrician  
Kalvin Porter with a tire iron after he argued with them about 
comments they supposedly made to his 12-year-old stepdaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the beating one week ago, protests outside the Sunoco  
station in a poor neighborhood on the city's east side have forced 
it to remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadhel Mazeb, 46, and Adel Altam, 26, both immigrants from  
Yemen, were arraigned Monday on second-degree murder charges. They 
were held pending a May 28 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Arab-Americans first began to dominate the grocery store, liquor  
store and gas station business in Detroit in the late 1960s and 
early 1970s as many white business owners fled the city in the wake 
of the 1967 riots. 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 200,000 people of Arab descent -- one of the  
largest Arab populations outside the Middle East -- among the 4 
million who live in metropolitan Detroit. Of the 1 million who live 
in the city, about 80 percent are black. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 people attended Thursday's peace summit, sponsored by  
Arab store owners, the NAACP, and other community and religious 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Deeb, president of the Michigan Food and Beverage  
Association, which represents 3,100 Arab-American merchants in 
metropolitan Detroit, said it ``is not a racial incident but a 
crime issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation was tragic, to say the least,'' Deeb said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Ruth Williams said she has witnessed a pattern of racism by  
Arab store owners against black customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to boycott these businesses,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's racism involved. There's prejudice involved,'' said  
Mary McClendon. ``An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. It's been 
going on for 400 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others at the meeting called for reconciliation and  
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the Arab-Americans, we are not trying to make a racial  
issue out of this,'' said the victim's brother-in-law, Donald 
Wright, who brought three of Porter's children with him. ``We feel 
like the law will do its job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic tensions between inner-city residents and store owners of  
different ethnic groups are nothing new in America. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cleveland, tensions between Arab-American shopkeepers and  
blacks ran high earlier this decade after several inner-city 
merchants were killed and a store clerk was arrested for killing a 
black teen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, violent incidents occurred as Korean-American  
merchants opened stores in black neighborhoods in the 1980s and the 
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastors of black and Korean-American churches formed an alliance  
to promote understanding between the cultures, but the rift 
climaxed with the 1992 riot. More than 2,500 Korean-American 
businesses were destroyed citywide. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1995 study done by the Arab American Institute, based in  
Washington, blamed tensions on a combination of crime, poverty and 
the presence in poor neighborhoods of recent immigrants with 
successful businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation here is where we have victims pitted against  
victims,'' Zogby said.

<HEADLINE> Redskins' Lawsuit 'Mean Spirited' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Decrying Howard Milstein's lawsuit as  
``mean-spirited,'' Washington Redskins general manager Charley 
Casserly today said he did not interfere with the New York banking 
magnate's failed effort to buy the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The allegations are false and have no basis in fact,''  
Casserly, in his first public comments on the suit, said in a 
statement released by the team. ``I do not know why he has included 
me in this mean-spirited lawsuit. I will vigorously defend 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casserly said he has retained Robert S. Bennett, President  
Clinton's lawyer in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Casserly and team president John Kent Cooke were named  
defendants in the lawsuit filed Monday by Milstein, who claimed the 
two worked in a ``systematic bid to undermine the bidding process'' 
so that Cooke could become the new owner of the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein reached an agreement with the trustees of the estate of  
the late Jack Kent Cooke in January to buy the team for $800 
million, but he withdrew the bid at an NFL owners' meeting April 7 
after it became apparent that he did not have the 24 votes needed 
for approval among the 31 owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Snyder, Milstein's junior partner in the bid, has since  
submitted his own $800 million offer, which is expected to be 
approved when the owners meet next week in Atlanta. Milstein's suit 
does not attempt to block the sale of the team to Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit, Milstein said Cooke, with Casserly's help, ``used  
league officials and certain owners themselves to unfairly block 
our bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The choice of Casserly as a defendant was a surprise when  
Milstein announced the suit, which seeks tens of millions of 
dollars in damages. John Kent Cooke, though unable to match an $800 
million bid for his father's team, is a wealthy man in a position 
to defend himself against what he has called the ``petulant 
charges'' from Milstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Casserly is not wealthy, however, and Bennett accused Milstein  
of trying to ``bankrupt'' a loyal member of the Redskins 
organization since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't understand why Mr. Milstein, with his millions  
and millions, files a suit against Charley Casserly, which from its 
reading is designed to bankrupt Charley and his family,'' Bennett 
said. ``We're just vigorously going to protect Charley.'' 
</P>

	Bennett would not specifically address how Casserly would be  
able to afford what could become a costly defense, but the lawyer 
did say he was ``sure the (Redskins) organization will stand behind 
him as this is the morally right thing to do and is legally 
required as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL had no comment. Representatives of Milstein did not  
immediately return calls seeking comment and Snyder was out of town 
and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	If it gets to court, the suit could mark another messy chapter  
in the NFL's long string of legal battles. Other team owners and 
legal officials, including commissioner Paul Tagliabue, could be 
summoned and asked to detail the behind-the-scenes process the 
league uses to choose its owners.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Motor Cancels Dividend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second biggest carmaker,  
posted a loss of $281 million for the latest fiscal year as its 
sales in Japan slumped while the recession continued. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also ommitted dividend payments for the first time  
since its shares were listed in 1951 and expects another loss this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan lost 34.81 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 31  
in contrast to a profit of 16.55 billion yen the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall sales edged up to 6.58 trillion yen, or $54.4 billion,  
from 6.56 trillion yen the previous fiscal year. This increase 
reflected about 85 billion yen in exchange rate gains from the 
weakening of the yen, offset by a decline of about 70 billion yen 
from reduced unit vehicle sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects a loss of 40 billion yen for the current  
fiscal year and a sharp downturn in production and sales. 
</P>
<P>
	It said it expects to produce 1.45 million vehicles this year  
compared with 1.53 million a year ago, a 5.1 percent decline. Last 
fiscal year, production tumbled 8.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has been burdened by massive debts worth an estimated  
$16.9 billion. France's Renault SA acquired a 36.8 percent stake in 
the company for $5.18 billion in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan said its restructuring efforts are proceeding on  
schedule, and that it had reduced interest bearing debt by $3.23 
billion by the end of the fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Ali Aboard Emergency Landing Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Mechanical troubles forced a US Airways  
flight with 73 aboard, including Muhammad Ali, to make an emergency 
landing today at Michiana Regional Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 68 passengers and five crew members were hurt on the  
flight from Pittsburgh to South Bend. All got off the Fokker F-100 
jet safely and were bused to the terminal, airport director John 
Schalliol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali, the former heavyweight champion who is ailing from  
Parkinson's syndrome, is not an unusual visitor to the airport on 
Indiana's northern border. He lives a few miles north of the 
airport in Michigan and flies into the Michiana Regional Airport 
all the time, Schalliol said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 miles from the airport, the pilot of US Airways flight  
1240 called the control tower to say he had mechanical troubles he 
could not fix and asked the airport to prepare for an emergency 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane landed safely, but a blown tire made the plane slide a  
little as it landed, said US Airways spokesman David Castelveter. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three landing gears were off the edge of the runway,  
Schalliol said. The jet did not catch fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The captain did an outstanding job,'' Schalliol said.  
</P>
<P>
	Airport and airline workers were still working to move the  
aircraft off the main north-south runway late Friday. Schalliol 
said two other runways were open just moments after the landing.

<HEADLINE>  De La Hoya, Trinidad Agree To Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya could probably take it easy  
tomorrow night, box Oba Carr for 12 rounds and add another $5 
million to his already fat bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	With a megafight set with fellow welterweight champion Felix  
Trinidad and other big bouts ahead, it would seem the prudent thing 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, however, is in no mood to be prudent.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not boxing anymore. I'm going back to fighting, to the old  
school way,'' De La Hoya said. ``I'm going to walk through guys and 
destroy them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could be bad news for Carr, a decent enough fighter but a  
10-1 underdog when he challenges De La Hoya for the WBC 147-pound 
title in the scheduled 12-round bout at the Mandalay Bay resort. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would please De La Hoya's fans, who may have been  
disappointed in the cautious way he fought Ike Quartey his last 
time out and the fact that four of his last eight fights have gone 
the 12-round distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee you there is no fighter in the world who can take  
my punch and last 12 rounds,'' De La Hoya said. ``So what am I 
doing boxing people? I should be going out there and destroying 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya doesn't need to knock Carr out to guarantee a Sept.  
18 fight with Trinidad that will pay him $15 million. He simply 
needs to beat Carr for the fight, which was finalized Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But De La Hoya says he has a reborn desire to punch people out.  
It came to him just during training camp when he woke up one 
morning about five weeks ago and decided that he should return to 
the form in which he knocked out 20 of his first 22 opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	A parade of different trainers, he said, had changed his style  
by convincing him that he was getting hit too much and should try 
to box more in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided to listen to myself and do what I want in the  
ring,'' De La Hoya said. ``My passion is fighting and I wasn't 
happy doing the things I was doing against (Pernell) Whitaker, 
Quartey and the others. I'm not a boxer, I'm a fighter. I'm a 
slugger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya said his transformation from boxer back to puncher  
began the same day of his revelation in his training camp in the 
mountains of Big Bear, Calif. He went into the ring and began 
backing his sparring partners up and punishing them instead of 
looking for angles and trying to block punches. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, says trainer Roberto Alcazar, have been nothing  
short of spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 100 percent different,'' Alcazar said. ``He's happy and  
he's hurting people in the ring. He's the old Oscar like he was 
when he first started out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya may be fortunate he's got a chance to test out his  
new theory of fighting against Carr instead of a ferocious puncher 
the likes of Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters weighed in Friday at the class limit of 147  
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr is capable enough and certainly no pushover. He's 48-2-1  
with 28 knockouts and his only two losses were to Trinidad and 
Quartey, both of whom he knocked down before being beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carr has had both sides of his jaw broken in his last two  
fights, and the Detroit fighter will be getting a bigger and 
stronger opponent. Carr had his jaw wired for weeks and was on a 
liquid diet after winning a Feb. 22 elimination fight against 
Frankie Randall to qualify for the De La Hoya fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oba Carr is a dangerous opponent and he'll be ready to  
fight,'' said De La Hoya, 30-0 with 24 knockouts. ``When I fight an 
opponent, they lift themselves up to the sky. They all want to be 
the first to beat Oscar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight with Carr, which will be televised by HBO beginning  
around 11:30 p.m. EDT, has been largely overshadowed by 
negotiations between rival promoters Bob Arum and Don King over a 
Sept. 18 fight between De La Hoya and Trinidad, who holds the IBF 
version of the welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad has been offered $11 million for the fight, and Arum  
said the two sides were close to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Trinidad fight will happen because I've been pushing it to  
happen,'' said De La Hoya, criticized in the past for the quality 
of some of his opponents. ``They were making it look like I was 
scared of that fight. I'm not scared, it's Trinidad who is scared. 
Let's make the fight right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carr, of course, would love nothing better than to disrupt the  
carefully laid plans of De La Hoya and his promoter. The 
27-year-old, who will make $350,000, sees himself as part of a 
welterweight series that could include a number of fights between 
the likes of himself, De La Hoya, Quartey and Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trinidad and Oscar is an attractive fight,'' Carr conceded.  
``People want to see that fight. But in the future they're going to 
want to see Oba Carr and Trinidad and Oba Carr and De La Hoya in a 
rematch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the card is a second title fight, with Floyd Mayweather  
defending his WBC super featherweight title against Justin Juuko, a 
Ugandan living in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the third defense of the title for Mayweather, a 1996  
Olympian who is 20-0 as a pro. He was supposed to have fought Goyo 
Vargas, but Vargas became sick in training camp and pulled out at 
the last minute.

<HEADLINE> Jets Up for Sale After Hess' Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The family of Leon Hess has hired Goldman, Sachs  
&AMP; Co. to manage the sale of the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Hess' death, team president Steve Gutman will remain  
in charge of business operations and assist the estate and Goldman 
Sachs in the process. Coach Bill Parcells will continue to have 
complete authority over the football operations, the Jets said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs handled the sale of the Cleveland Browns for the  
NFL last year. The process took several months and had six 
candidates, including Alfred Lerner, who paid $530 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been estimated the Jets might sell for about $500  
million. The NFL finance committee voted this week to recommend 
that the Washington Redskins be sold to Daniel Snyder for $800 
million, but that deal would include the team's new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Reportedly, the bidders for the Jets will include Cablevision  
chairman Charles Dolan and his brother Larry, who bid on the 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Dolan also has majority ownership of New York's Madison  
Square Garden, the NBA's Knicks and the NHL's Rangers. Larry Dolan 
is a Cleveland lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolans also have tried to buy baseball's Cincinnati Reds and  
New York Yankees, as well as the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	When baseball's Cleveland Indians went on sale last week, the  
Dolans also were mentioned. Larry Dolan said then it was 
``premature'' to say whether he was a prospective buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Shula, retired coach of the Miami Dolphins, also reportedly  
could be part of the Dolan effort to acquire the Jets. He was part 
of their bid for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possible buyer for the Jets is New York Mets principal  
owner Nelson Doubleday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess died on May 7 at 85.  
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the Jets won the AFC East with a 12-4 record,  
before losing to Denver in the conference championship game.

<HEADLINE> Senate Gun Vote Reflects NRA Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign contributions from the National Rifle  
Association proved an accurate barometer of how individual senators 
would vote on a series of gun control measures this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-two of the 34 senators who supported the NRA on each of  
four key votes received money for their last election from the 
organization that lobbies for gun owners' rights. Only two of the 
38 senators who opposed the NRA on the same four votes received 
contributions from the gun group. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a 51-50 vote to require background checks for firearms  
buyers at gun shows and pawn shops that clearly reflected the 
momentum toward tighter regulations in the aftermath of recent 
school shootings. Only two of the 50 senators who supported that 
amendment received NRA money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our members support elected officials and candidates who  
believe in the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment and the right 
of lawful Americans to own firearms,'' NRA spokesman Bill Powers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign finance experts said the correlation between votes and  
contributions is not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to know how a candidate is going to vote, follow  
the money that they're collecting when they're running for 
office,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for 
Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. ``It's very 
difficult for candidates to vote against their own cash 
constituents. They will do so only reluctantly and rarely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA opposed efforts to add gun control provisions to the  
juvenile crime bill in the wake of school shootings in Colorado and 
Georgia. The bill passed the Senate late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows this won't stop the crisis in our schools,''  
Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and chief lobbyist James 
Baker said. ``The American people want existing gun laws enforced 
and their Second Amendment freedoms protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five senators who received the most money from the NRA  
between 1993 and 1998 all sided with the gun lobby as it tried to 
defeat several amendments, led by GOP Sen. Rick Santorum of 
Pennsylvania, who has received $19,600 since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Another senator who supported the NRA down the line was GOP  
Slade Gorton of Washington, who has received $11,400 from the gun 
lobby since 1993. On Saturday, while the bill was on the Senate 
floor, he held two fund-raisers in his home state featuring NRA 
President Charlton Heston. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton told his supporters that Congress couldn't solve the  
problem of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could tell you the government could pass a law that  
can prevent this from happening,'' Gorton said. ``But the evil in 
Littleton is beyond the scope of the federal government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA opposed two amendments by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,  
to require background checks on all firearms purchases at gun 
shows. The earlier Lautenberg amendment failed, 51-47, but a recast 
measure passed, 51-50, when Vice President Al Gore cast the 
deciding vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 senators who voted against the second Lautenberg  
amendment received an average of $7,377 from the NRA. Only two of 
the 50 senators supporting the provision -- Democrat Kent Conrad of 
North Dakota and Republican Mike DeWine of Ohio -- received any NRA 
contributions. Conrad got $2,000; DeWine, $4,900. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are responsible checks to prevent guns from getting into  
the hands of felons, the mentally ill and kids,'' Conrad said. 
``Frankly, the NRA has become extreme. They're out of step with 
mainstream America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that the requirement to follow the Brady gun-check law  
should apply to everyone at a gun show and that's what this 
amendment did,'' said DeWine said. ``It basically closed a loophole 
in current law; I did not find it to be an unreasonable 
requirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., and Thad Cochran, R-Miss., were the  
only two NRA supporters who did not receive any contributions from 
the organization. But the NRA did give $4,950 to Cochran's 
leadership political action committee.

<HEADLINE> Silver Futures Tumble on Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Silver futures fell sharply Friday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange after an industry report revealed demand last year 
retreated for the first time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, wheat and soybeans fell sharply, while crude  
gained a second day. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures fell after the Silver Institute in its annual  
World Silver Survey reported demand fell to 840.6 million ounces in 
1998 from 859.9 million ounces the year before, amid weak demand 
from Asia and India, a large buyer of silver for making jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	The report indicated, however, that demand continues to exceed  
mine production. That means warehouse inventories are continuing to 
erode, albeit more slowly. But market participants were concerned 
demand may fall further, despite a slow recovery of economic 
conditions in Asia, if prices rise much past current levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver for July delivery fell 10 cents to $5.21 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat and soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of  
Trade amid forecasts for dry weather next week in Midwestern 
growing areas, which should allow farmers to speed up field work. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are expected to plant record soybean acreage this  
spring, boosting the chances for another bin-busting harvest this 
fall. That would come on top of bumper harvests in Brazil and 
Argentina and add to ample world supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also retreated after a National Oilseed Processors  
Association report showed an anemic pace for crushing soybeans into 
oil and meal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also faced continued pressure from the early  
harvesting of winter wheat crops, where farmers were reporting 
above-average yields. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat fell 4 cents to $2.52 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell  
6 1/4 cents to $4.61 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures advanced a second day on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid prospects for a delay in Iraqi oil 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations had been mired in debate over whether to  
approve another round of an oil-for-aid program for Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	After trading had ended, the U.N. agency voted to extend the  
program another six months. Still, Iraq has indicated it may delay 
loading new cargoes until at least June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq is operating under an embargo imposed after its 1990  
invasion of Kuwait but is allowed to export 1.9 million barrels of 
oil, equal to $5.2 billion, over six months to buy food and medical 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants had worried the current wrangling could take  
weeks, effectively keep oil off the market at a time when other 
major oil producers are cutting back output. 
</P>
<P>
	June crude rose 34 cents to $17.41 a barrel; June heating oil  
rose 0.76 cent to 40.55 cents a gallon; June unleaded gasoline rose 
0.92 cent to 50.40 cents a gallon.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Violence Leaves 18 Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANTWERP, Belgium (AP) -- Sunday's playoff game at Royal Antwerp  
was postponed because of stadium damage after 11 policemen and 
seven spectators were injured during clashes with soccer vandals. 
</P>
<P>
	Two policemen were seriously injured late Thursday when they  
were attacked with iron bars, stones, pointed bats and even a 
scythe. Five suspects remained in detention Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence started when Antwerp yielded three late goals and  
lost 3-1 to Turnhout. Antwerp fans first attacked opposing fans in 
the stands, injuring seven. Afterward, they broke open an equipment 
shed and attacked police. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just getting sick of all this,'' Mayor Leona Detiege said  
after banning Sunday's game. ``It is just too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the club refused to make sufficient efforts to contain  
rioters following the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The city postponed the playoff against La Louviere, and the  
Belgian soccer federation has yet to reschedule the game. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no estimate of the damage to the stadium,  
although fences were destroyed and walls were cracked in the 
mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Antwerp, Belgium's oldest team, for years has supplied  
players for English powerhouse Manchester United. 
</P>
<P>
	It long was one of Belgium's best teams and reached the European  
Cup Winners Cup final six years ago. But it has gone downhill since 
and was relegated from the top division last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected to bounce back this season, but missed out the  
Division Two title and now has only an outside chance to advance in 
the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Judge Denies Golfer's Cart Request  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- A federal judge insists Ford Olinger and  
Casey Martin's cases are different. 
</P>
<P>
	So are the outcomes.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Robert Miller on Thursday declined to back  
Olinger in his suit against the USGA in which he seeks to ride a 
cart in qualifying rounds for the U.S. Open. Miller ruled that it 
would fundamentally alter the nature of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller also wrote in his decision that his ruling had no bearing  
on Martin, who successfully sued the PGA last year to use a cart on 
tour. His case is now under appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point of an athletic competition, in contrast, is to  
decide who, under conditions that are about the same for everyone, 
can perform an assigned set of tasks better than (not as well as) 
any other competitor,'' Miller wrote in his decision, ruling that 
athletic competition presents a different concern for the Americans 
with Disabilities Act than the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Olinger, a golf pro in Warsaw, successfully sued the USGA last  
year to use a cart in a local qualifier for the Open under the ADA 
because of a degenerative hip disorder that makes walking 18 holes 
nearly impossible for him. 
</P>
<P>
	But he did not qualify for the sectional, shooting a 12-over-par  
83. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller agreed with the U.S. Golf Association's contention that  
walking is a fundamental aspect to competitive golf, and that 
allowing Olinger to ride a cart would provide him an unfair 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy in the sense that we've said all along all the  
players in the competition should be treated under identical rules 
and that giving one player a cart would create an unfair advantage, 
and that's exactly what the judge found,'' said USGA spokesman 
Marty Parkes. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller wrote in a footnote that he did not consider the Martin  
case in making his ruling because it was in a different circuit 
court. He also wrote that the two cases differ because Martin's 
suit sought the right to use a cart on the PGA Tour, not just a 
single event. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the ruling, Parkes said the USGA will still honor its  
agreement with Martin to allow him to ride in this year's Open 
while his suit against the PGA is on appeal. Martin is exempt from 
the local qualifier this year, but has to play in the Cleveland 
sectional next month to qualify for the Open championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has a circulatory disorder in his right leg that makes it  
painful for him to walk long distances. His case is on appeal 
before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and a decision isn't 
expected for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Olinger, who was playing golf when he heard the news, told local  
radio show Weekday Sports Beat he probably would appeal the 
decision, though he hadn't discussed it with his lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that I'm of the caliber that I can compete for the U.S.  
Open championship,'' he said. ``I continuously shoot low 70s and 
high 60s, so it's not like I'm out there shooting 90, 95 and just 
trying to get in the Open that way.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Lower; Dow Down 48.96 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved lower today as investors again  
tried to determine what course interest rates will take. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 48.96 to  
10,817.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index fell 5.46 to 1,333.37, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 19.60 to 2,522.63. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little news to affect the overall market. The market  
was in the midst of a ``double witching'' day, when stock and index 
options expire and traders adjust their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Dow components, pharmaceutical maker Merck was down 5/8 to  
71 5/8 although it announced the Food and Drug Administration approved 
its new pain pill Vioxx. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Dow component General Motors rose 2 1/2 to 82 5/8, following  
the lead of Delphi Automotive, the auto parts unit GM spun off. 
Delphi shares were up 1 3/16 to 21 11/16, after Standard &AMP; Poor's 
said it would add the stock to its S&AMP;P 500 index. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman Kodak was down 2 1/4 to 73 5/16. Kodak fell after an  
analyst said it will keep losing market share to Fuji Photo Film 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have traded in a narrow range for several days as  
investors struggle to determine whether a recent rise in inflation 
will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in an 
effort to slow the economy. The Federal Reserve left interest rates 
unchanged Tuesday but warned that inflation may soon force it to 
raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising rates poses two problems for stocks: They lower corporate  
profits, and they also make bonds a more attractive alternative to 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 6 to  
5 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 324.4 
million shares, down from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 1.87 at 637.55, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.30 at 793.33.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Coaches Receive Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee Lady Vols coach Pat Summitt  
and men's coach Jerry Green today received one-year contract 
extensions through the 2004 season and pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
	Summitt, who has guided Tennessee to six NCAA titles in 25  
seasons, will receive an 11 percent raise that will bring her total 
package to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Her new contract carries a $175,000 base salary, $150,000 in  
radio and television commitments, $125,000 from apparel contracts 
and a $50,000 retention bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, who has led the Volunteers to back-to-back 20-win  
seasons, gets a 5 percent raise to put his total package at 
$540,000. The contract calls for a $150,000 base salary, $220,000 
in radio and TV commitments, $120,000 in apparel contracts and a 
$50,000 retention bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's athletic director Joan Cronan praised Summitt as ``a  
wonderful representative of the university who continues to achieve 
excellence with her players on the court and in the classroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Men's athletic director Doug Dickey said Green has done ``a  
solid job of improving men's basketball,'' pointing to Tennessee's 
41-18 record and consecutive NCAA tournament appearances in the 
past two seasons.

<HEADLINE> Pregnant Valedictorian Loses Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RADCLIFF, Ky. (AP) -- A Christian high school stripped an  
18-year-old senior of her valedictorian title and barred her from 
next month's graduation ceremonies because she is pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	Leah Carr, who has a straight-A average, said she became  
pregnant six months ago. She said she expected some punishment but 
also support from officials at Dove Christian Academy, a school of 
149 students run by Radcliff First Assembly of God. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel let down, betrayed,'' Ms. Carr said. ``I love them, I  
trusted them. I don't feel the support I was wanting. I don't 
expect anyone to pet me in my sins, but I do want forgiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church pastor and the school principal declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Larry Riggs, the parent of one of Ms. Carr's classmates, said he  
believes the school may have sent a bad message. 
</P>
<P>
	``She could have hid it, she could have had an abortion,'' he  
said. ``Do we want kids to think that if they do wrong, there is 
not forgiveness? Do we want to promote abortion as the way to avoid 
ridicule from the church?''

<HEADLINE>  Knievel Jumps Grand Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND CANYON WEST, Ariz. (AP) -- Robbie Knievel had room to  
spare. 
</P>
<P>
	The motorcycle daredevil easily cleared a sliver of the Grand  
Canyon on Thursday, traveling 228 feet to break his own world 
record by 5 feet. Fireworks erupted and a crowd of several hundred 
cheered as he soared over the 200-foot-wide gorge at 90 mph on an 
ordinary 500cc motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
	If he failed, Knievel risked plunging 2,500 feet to the canyon  
floor on the Hualapai Indian Reservation, west of Grand Canyon 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel, 37, wiped out in a cloud of dust after the jump, but  
didn't appear to have suffered any serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm wiped out in the head a little,'' Knievel said.  
</P>
<P>
	The jump was televised live by Fox on the East Coast for  
tape-delay airing later in the rest of the country. Knievel's 
previous record was set in Panama City, Fla., in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel was going to attempt the same jump on April 29 but it  
was canceled at the last minute because of wind and cold. Knievel 
said his daredevil father, Evel Knievel -- recovering from a recent 
liver transplant -- had wanted to jump the Grand Canyon but never 
got the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Knievel achieved notoriety in April 1989 by jumping  
the fountains at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, a stunt that nearly 
killed his father 21 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel would not say how much Fox paid him.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about one of the seven wonders of the world,  
and I want to do it,'' Knievel said earlier this week. ``Everyone 
has a calling, has to make a living. I'm not trying to kill 
myself.''

	MOSCOW (AP) -- After winning another major political victory over  
his hard-line foes, Boris Yeltsin left today for two weeks of 
vacation in southern Russia, his spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin will vacation in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi,  
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.

premier-designate, Sergei Stepashin, easily approved by the lower 
house of parliament Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has rested several times in Sochi. He was there in  
November to recover from what aides described as fatigue and high 
blood pressure.

<HEADLINE> FAA Clears New National Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- National Airlines -- a new airline with an old  
name -- has been cleared for takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Las Vegas-based carrier has been authorized by the Federal  
Aviation Administration to begin passenger service next week. 
</P>
<P>
	National will launch service Thursday with daily flights to  
Chicago's Midway Airport and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Service to New York and San Francisco is scheduled to begin June  
14 and June 24, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can all take pride in this moment,'' Michael Conway, the  
airline's chief executive, said after FAA representatives presented 
the company with an air carrier operating certificate. 
</P>
<P>
	National takes the name of a one-time industry leader that  
specialized in flights to vacation spots like Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1958, a National Airlines 707 flew the first domestic  
passenger jet flight in the United States. It took 111 passengers 
from New York to Miami in about two and a-half hours. 
</P>
<P>
	National and Pan American merged in 1980 and Pan Am later went  
bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural flight of the new National Airlines is scheduled  
Thursday from Las Vegas to Los Angeles at 8:30 a.m., followed by a 
flight to Chicago Midway at 9:20 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Beating Death Raises Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- It could have been any small shop in any inner  
city. A customer of one race, store owners of another, a 
disagreement, harsh words, a burst of fatal violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crisis is the same in every city. It's a crisis of the  
inner city, not enough employment, not enough hope,'' James Zogby, 
head of the Arab American Institute, said Thursday. ``They're ripe 
for victimization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Community leaders met Thursday to try to quell tension raised by  
the arrest of two Arab-American store clerks in the beating death 
of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the clerks attacked 34-year-old electrician  
Kalvin Porter with a tire iron after he argued with them about 
comments they supposedly made to his 12-year-old stepdaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the beating one week ago, protests outside the Sunoco  
station in a poor neighborhood on the city's east side have forced 
it to remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadhel Mazeb, 46, and Adel Altam, 26, both immigrants from  
Yemen, were arraigned Monday on second-degree murder charges. They 
were held pending a May 28 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Arab-Americans first began to dominate the grocery store, liquor  
store and gas station business in Detroit in the late 1960s and 
early 1970s as many white business owners fled the city in the wake 
of the 1967 riots. 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 200,000 people of Arab descent -- one of the  
largest Arab populations outside the Middle East -- among the 4 
million who live in metropolitan Detroit. Of the 1 million who live 
in the city, about 80 percent are black. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 people attended Thursday's peace summit, sponsored by  
Arab store owners, the NAACP, and other community and religious 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Deeb, president of the Michigan Food and Beverage  
Association, which represents 3,100 Arab-American merchants in 
metropolitan Detroit, said it ``is not a racial incident but a 
crime issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation was tragic, to say the least,'' Deeb said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Ruth Williams said she has witnessed a pattern of racism by  
Arab store owners against black customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to boycott these businesses,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's racism involved. There's prejudice involved,'' said  
Mary McClendon. ``An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. It's been 
going on for 400 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others at the meeting called for reconciliation and  
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the Arab-Americans, we are not trying to make a racial  
issue out of this,'' said the victim's brother-in-law, Donald 
Wright, who brought three of Porter's children with him. ``We feel 
like the law will do its job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic tensions between inner-city residents and store owners of  
different ethnic groups are nothing new in America. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cleveland, tensions between Arab-American shopkeepers and  
blacks ran high earlier this decade after several inner-city 
merchants were killed and a store clerk was arrested for killing a 
black teen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, violent incidents occurred as Korean-American  
merchants opened stores in black neighborhoods in the 1980s and the 
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastors of black and Korean-American churches formed an alliance

<HEADLINE>  NATO Bombs Yugoslav Fuel Depots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO bombs set fuel depots across  
Yugoslavia ablaze today, lighting the Belgrade skyline and a town 
near the Hungarian border with the orange glow of burning fires. 
The United States apologized for an airstrike that damaged the 
Swiss ambassador's residence during a diplomatic reception. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yugoslav foreign ministry spokesman, meanwhile, denied U.S.  
and NATO reports of army desertions. Allied officials have cited 
the desertion accounts as evidence the NATO air campaign that began 
March 24 was working and raising the levels of internal unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	And little progress was reported in Moscow in talks late  
Thursday and early today between Russia's Balkans envoy, U.S. 
negotiator Strobe Talbott and Finland's president. Russia, which 
has cultural and religious ties to Serbia, opposes NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Tanjug news agency said one person was killed and  
several were injured when fuel storage tanks were hit by allied 
bombers in Sombor, a mostly Hungarian town 12 miles from the border 
with Hungary. Smoke billowed over Sombor before dawn today. 
</P>
<P>
	Also reportedly targeted late Thursday and early today were the  
Ostruznica and Lipovacka Suma regions near Belgrade, where more 
fuel depots and army installations are located. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance bombed the Cukarica and Rakovica districts in the  
Yugoslav capital late Thursday. Serbian media said the Cukarica 
fuel depot, on a busy Belgrade street, was hit twice and set on 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss diplomats confirmed their ambassador's residence was  
damaged in the strike, but said there were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, Swedish  
Ambassador Mats Staffansson -- whose residence had been damaged in a 
bombing Wednesday night -- was among those at the reception 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a quarter past eight, we had just come to dessert, when a  
crash came. Four cruise missiles came down on a fuel depot only 300 
yards from the Swiss residence. An enormous pressure-wave broke a 
very large picture window in the dining room. I, the Slovak 
ambassador and the Vatican ambassador threw ourselves under the 
dining-room table to get out of the way of the flying glass,'' the 
newspaper quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bern, Switzerland, the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland,  
Madeleine Kunin, apologized to Swiss Foreign Minister Joseph Deiss. 
Neutral Switzerland, which is not a member of NATO, represents U.S. 
interests in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Monica Schmutz-Cattaneo said the  
Swiss made a formal diplomatic representation to both NATO and the 
United States, stressing that embassies should not be hit in future 
bombing campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	The private Beta news agency also reported that the residence of  
the Indian ambassador was damaged by the strike on the fuel depot. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Talbott, Finnish President Martti  
Ahtisaari and Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin wrapped up talks at 
a government resort outside Moscow early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahtisaari, who returned to Finland today, said the negotiations  
``just keep getting better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were still ``plenty of issues that are extremely difficult  
and the solutions for them don't necessarily please everyone, but 
maybe understanding will increase when there aren't many 
alternatives,'' Ahtisaari told reporters on arrival in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO wants the total and unconditional withdrawal of Milosevic's  
40,000 troops and police in Kosovo, a return of all refugees and a 
well-armed, NATO-dominated international force to police the peace 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott said the talks had been constructive and would continue.  
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, NATO struck army barracks in Belgrade's plush  
Dedinje district where President Slobodan Milosevic lives and 
works. But one of the bombs went astray, leaving a hospital in 
smoldering ruins and three patients dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish, Indian, Norwegian and Hungarian ambassadors'  
residences were also damaged. Serbian media reported damage to 
Libya's embassy and the Israeli diplomatic mission. 
</P>
<P>
	There were new accounts of Serb soldiers deserting following  
U.S. reports that 500 have quit, mainly drafted soldiers from 
northern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yugoslav government official, Nebojsa Vujovic, denied today  
that soldiers who have returned from Kosovo this week to their 
homes in the central Serbian towns of Krusevac and Aleksandrovac 
were deserters. 
</P>
<P>
	``These reservists were regular soldiers returning home ... in  
accord with the army Supreme Command's decision to adjust army 
levels (in Kosovo) to peace time,'' Vujovic said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is serious evidence that ... Yugoslavia is implementing  
this decision, but Western media interpreted these moves as 
desertions,'' Vujovic said. ``There are no desertions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 residents of Cetinje -- almost one-third of the  
population -- today protested the recent Yugoslav army 
reinforcements around their city and to demand the military 
withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here to ask loudly what these people in fatigues are  
doing in our city,'' Mirko Dapcevic told the crowd, his words 
followed by huge applause. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the first and certainly the biggest protest  
against the Yugoslav army in Montenegro, which, with much larger 
Serbia, makes up Yugoslavia. Montenegro's pro-Western government is 
at odds with Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,700 refugees crossed from Kosovo into Macedonia on  
Thursday, the highest number in several weeks, the United Nations 
refugee agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees said areas around Pristina, Kosovo's provincial  
capital, had been ``cleaned out'' over recent days. Some also said 
ethnic Albanian men had to pay military and paramilitary forces to 
escape alive. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR estimates 800,000 people, the vast majority of them ethnic  
Albanians, have fled or been driven out of Kosovo since NATO began 
airstrikes. Most have gone to Albania. Kosovo had a prewar 
population of about 2.1 million people and in the 13 months before 
NATO intervened in March, about 2,000 were killed by Serb forces.

<HEADLINE> Syria Ready for Talks With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syria told Israel's new prime minister  
Friday it was ready to resume peace talks and urged him to 
negotiate simultaneously with Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Official Syrian radio urged Israel's Prime Minister-elect Ehud  
Barak to deal with the Syrian and Lebanese peace talks as one since 
``the two are unified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A commitment from Barak's government would, no doubt, give  
Syrian-Israeli talks a fruitful start and would help to find a 
solution,'' the radio said. Syria has nearly 35,000 soldiers in 
Lebanon and is the major power broker in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The radio added that Syria was ready to restart peace  
negotiations with Israel where they left off in early 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, the negotiating team of Israeli Prime Minister  
Shimon Peres had reportedly agreed to a full withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights, a strategic plateau that Israel captured in the 1967 
Arab-Israeli War and subsequently annexed. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in June 1996, Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposed such a  
withdrawal, took office as Israel's prime minister and refused to 
pick up talks where his predecessor had left off. Negotiations have 
been on hold since. 
</P>
<P>
	Syria is reported to have welcomed Netanyahu's defeat in this  
week's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, who was elected Monday, has pledged to withdraw Israeli  
troops from Lebanon within a year. Israel has occupied a zone of 
southern Lebanon since 1985 as a buffer against guerrilla attacks 
on its northern towns.

<HEADLINE> Japan Said Punishing Credit Suisse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's financial authorities will order Credit  
Suisse Group to suspend its Japanese operations as punishment for 
obstructing an inspection by the Financial Supervisory Agency, a 
news report said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss financial group has been accused of dubious financial  
transactions intended to conceal losses at Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The FSA, Japan's financial watchdog, believes senior Credit  
Suisse officials in Japan hid and destroyed documents, Kyodo News 
reported, quoting unidentified agency officials. 
</P>
<P>
	FSA officials were not available for comment late today.  
</P>
<P>
	The report did not say how long the company's operations might  
be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyodo said the agency is also likely to punish the officials  
accused of tampering with the evidence, and will decide on final 
actions against the Swiss banking group by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse allegedly used derivatives to hide stockholding  
losses at Japanese financial institutions, including Nippon Credit 
Bank, and other non-financial companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, Credit Suisse said in Zurich, Switzerland it had  
suspended some employees and bonuses in connection with the FSA's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse said an independent probe by an international law  
firm found that ``some employees attempted to obstruct the (FSA) 
inspection during its early stages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law firm, Wilmer Cutler and Pickering, found that several  
managers and other staffers tried to interfere with FSA's probe in 
its initial stages by hiding and destroying documents, Credit 
Suisse said. 
</P>
<P>
	The employees allegedly sought to conceal activities that may  
have violated the strict regulatory separation of the banking and 
securities business in Japan, Credit Suisse said the lawyers' 
report found. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank said it regretted that misconduct and made an apology  
to Japan's regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	But Credit Suisse said, ``There was no evidence of efforts to  
conceal derivatives transactions, or transactions involving failed 
Japanese financial institutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper reports have alleged that Credit Suisse's investment  
bank, Credit Suisse First Boston Corp., marketed several plans to 
help Japanese companies hide losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The law firm's report ``concludes that a few individuals in  
leadership positions failed both the company and its employees,'' 
Credit Suisse said. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse said it would make internal management and  
structural changes to ``repair the breach of the group's code of 
conduct.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Painkiller Vioxx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans suffering from arthritis, severe  
menstrual discomfort or other acute pain soon will have a new 
choice in painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration has approved Vioxx, produced by  
Merck &AMP; Co. The manufacturer said the drug, to be available by 
prescription only, should be in pharmacies by mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	The dosage is once a day, and the cost of the prescription  
medication is expected to be between $2.38 and $2.52 per tablet. It 
will also be available in liquid form. 
</P>
<P>
	In tests on acute pain, Merck officials said the drug worked  
well on patients who had wisdom teeth extracted or hip or knee 
replacements or who suffered severe menstrual pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx is a type of drug known as a Cox-2 inhibitor, the second  
such drug on the market. The other, Monsanto's Celebrex, went on 
sale last year for arthritis sufferers, and more than 2 million 
prescriptions were written in the first three months it was on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers to the FDA recommended approval of Vioxx last month.  
</P>
<P>
	The newly developed Cox-2 inhibitors relieve aches and  
inflammation with fewer stomach-damaging side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of people depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and  
other pills called ``nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,'' or 
NSAIDs, to relieve pain. 
</P>
<P>
	But NSAIDs can cause ulcers, stomach bleeding and other  
gastrointestinal side effects, especially in long-term users. They 
are blamed for sending 107,000 people to hospitals every year and 
for killing 16,500. 
</P>
<P>
	NSAIDs target an enzyme called cyclo-oxegenase, which is  
responsible for much inflammation, but it exists in two types. 
Cox-2 is believed to cause inflammation, while Cox-1 protects the 
stomach lining. NSAIDs attack both. So scientists developed more 
specific drugs to target just Cox-2. 
</P>
<P>
	While Vioxx is the second Cox-2 inhibitor, it could prove to be  
a formidable competitor, especially since it was approved for more 
uses than Celebrex. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx will include a label noting that rare instances of  
gastrointestinal bleeding were reported among users during trials 
and urging physicians to watch for the possibility.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rig Count Up by 11 / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and  
natural gas in the United States has risen by 11 to 518, the third 
straight increase after months of declines and record lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rigs running nationwide this week, 138 were exploring for  
oil and 380 for gas, Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. reported 
Friday. During the same week last year, 855 rigs were operating in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally  
peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil 
boom, but has set record lows in nine of the last 18 weeks. The 
latest was 498 on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, Oklahoma gained six  
rigs, New Mexico gained three and Wyoming gained one. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas lost five rigs and California's total fell by two. The  
numbers in Alaska and Louisiana remained unchanged.

	Refugee Flow to Albania Resumes  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Breaking a week-long lull, a new  
tide of Kosovo refugees poured into Albania today. Many in the wave 
of 2,500 spoke of Serb security forces banging on their doors and 
ordering them to leave. Meanwhile, NATO bombed a Kosovo jail today, 
killing at least 19 people and injuring many, Yugoslavia state 
media reported. After reports of desertions by Yugoslav army 
reservists, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said troops who showed up 
in two central Serbian towns this week were just soldiers returning 
home as part of a reduction of Serb forces in Kosovo.

	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The despondent boy who allegedly wounded six

aggravated assault today. Thomas Solomon Jr., 15, used a .357 
Magnum revolver and a sawed-off rifle and could have easily killed 
many Heritage High School students. But he apparently aimed at them 
below the waist so as only to wound them. Solomon was known as a 
quiet, churchgoing Boy Scout who supposedly stole the weapons from

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most people in a new survey say they  
anticipate little effect from the Year 2000 computer problem on 
their bank accounts -- but that's not stopping them from setting 
aside a little extra cash in the days before New Year's. A new 
Gallup poll of 1,606 adults showed that the vast majority -- nearly 
79 percent -- said they fully expect the Y2K problem to have 
``little or no impact'' on their personal finances. But almost 
two-thirds of them said they expect to set aside extra cash in the 
days before New Year's Day.

	Amazon.com Backs Off Book Ban  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Responding to e-mail complaints, Amazon.com says  
it will restore a book critical of the Scientology movement to its 
online catalog. The book, ``A Piece of Blue Sky,'' by British 
writer Jon Atack, was banned by a British court following a 
successful 1995 defamation lawsuit against Atack. Amazon said the 
book would be able to be shipped in a matter of days, after coding 
is put in place to make sure copies aren't shipped to British 
addresses.

contingent upon approval by Indiana authorities. His jail term was

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Panel Gets Tech Nod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Cash-hungry organizers of Salt Lake City's  
Olympics got one thing they wanted from the International Olympic 
Committee this week: the nod to go after technology sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee and OPUS, the marketing  
company it runs jointly with the U.S. Olympic Committee, have 
hesitated to recruit those corporate sponsors because technology 
has been the IOC's purview in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	No more, said Mitt Romney, chief executive of the SLOC, speaking  
Thursday at the end of four days of meetings between the IOC 
Coordination Commission and Salt Lake City executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking the blinders off,'' Romney said. ``There is a  
huge virgin territory in the information technology marketplace. We 
need to get after it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreements forged this week ``open to us  
potentially millions of dollars,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those millions are badly needed by a committee scarred by  
scandal this winter and still $300 million short of meeting its 
$1.45 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Vows of cooperation, such as on the technology sponsor front,  
were the byword of the meetings here this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, comprised of IOC members and international  
sports officials, offered suggestions ranging from opening the beer 
and wine spigots at the press center to setting aside an 
athletes-only traffic lane between the Olympic Village in Salt Lake 
City and the ski venues in Park City. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, the Swiss IOC member who is chairman of the  
commission, suggested Salt Lake City hope for no snow since the 
artificial variety is preferable from an athletic and logistical 
standpoint. ``That is the only thing man does better than God,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a gesture to show the IOC does not demand luxury, it decided  
to stay at the existing Little America hotel, not in the more 
opulent Little America Tower being built across the street. The 
tower will have suites, but IOC members need only double-bed rooms, 
Hodler said. 
</P>
<P>
	That will mean SLOC can erase a $1.2 million contingency it  
built into its budget in case room rates exceeded $200 per night 
the IOC was obligated to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy chairman of the commission, Jean-Claude Killy of  
France, assured that ``the IOC will pay for its rooms,'' Romney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also endorsed keeping figure skating in the Delta  
Center by adding seats close to the ice so athletes see spectators' 
faces and by using two jumbo screens at the end of the arena to 
give all fans good views. Both athletes and spectators grumbled 
after the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in February. 
</P>
<P>
	And the IOC welcomed the SLOC announcement it wants to add five  
events to the games, bringing the total to 75, the most ever for a 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he's confident the SLOC board and IOC will approve  
adding women's bobsled, men's and women's skeleton (a headfirst 
plunge on a small sled down an ice chute at 70 mph) and men's and 
women's cross-country sprints. The events will use the track 
already build for luge and bobsled as well as the biathlon trail to 
be built this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of adding the events, after figuring in ticket sales,  
is $650,000, said Cathy Priestner-Allinger, director of sport for 
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jen Davidson, a 26-year-old exercise physiologist at  
Intermountain Health Care and women's bobsledder, said she was 
elated by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working long and hard on this,'' Davidson said.  
``I'm pretty happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson, who lives in Layton, Utah, was the brakeman on the  
bobsled team that won three gold and five silver medals during the 
recent World Cup season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser Bullock, the chief operating officer, said the organizing  
committee and the U.S. Olympic Committee are close to finding $5 
million to pay for operating the Utah Winter Sports Park, including 
its bobsled luge track, until the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC has been threatening to close down the park at times to  
save $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said details of the new technology sponsor approach  
remain to be worked out, but Salt Lake and OPUS are free to go 
after sponsors that could help it sell tickets and merchandise on 
the Internet, a $30 million category, as well as other types of 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC will continue negotiating for the computer hardware  
itself, and it has not been decided who will pursue systems 
analysis companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the agreements will be finalized when the IOC  
executive board meets in Seoul, South Korea, next month.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Mourn Slain Brit TV Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTON-SUPER-MARE, England (AP) -- Thousands of mourners gathered  
Friday for the funeral of Jill Dando, one of Britain's most popular 
television personalities, whose slaying last month shocked the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	People lined the streets of this western coastal town and  
watched silently as her coffin was driven from a local church to 
the graveyard where she was to be buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Dando, who appeared on news and current affairs programs  
for the British Broadcasting Corp., was shot in the head April 26 
on the doorstep of her west London home as she returned from 
shopping errands. Her killing remains unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the mourners, James Higgins, had traveled from London to  
watch the funeral procession pass through. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having seen her on television almost daily I felt I wanted to  
say some sort of goodbye. And her hometown seemed a fitting place 
to do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the congregation of 100 mourners were Prince Edward's  
fiancee Sophie Rhys-Jones and a string of television personalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Farthing, whom Miss Dando was to have married in September,  
read a poem sent anonymously by a woman who had lost her fiance 
suddenly last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A speaker set up in a park allowed local people to listen to the  
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jill, the beautiful girl next door, known to every family in  
the country, was shot dead. And everyone was asking `Why?''' said 
the Rev. Roger Collins, reading her eulogy. 
</P>
<P>
	Several witnesses have come forward with descriptions of a  
similar man seen at or near the 37-year-old TV star's house, but 
nobody has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Some speculate it was a botched robbery or a stalker, while  
others say it could have been an underworld hitman, since Miss 
Dando worked on ``Crimewatch,'' a true-life crime show that seeks 
the public's help in catching suspects.

<HEADLINE> Ga. County Once a Hunting Haven </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- Gun racks have long been standard equipment  
on pickup trucks here, but the gun culture has been diluted by an 
influx of people who have transformed the once-rural area into a 
fast-growing Atlanta suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Six students were wounded Thursday when 15-year-old Thomas  
Solomon Jr. walked into his school and began firing a rifle and a 
.357 Magnum revolver that police say he stole from his stepfather's 
locked gun cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting came just hours before the Senate voted in favor of  
new gun control legislation pushed by President Clinton. The attack 
also tested beliefs about guns in Rockdale County, which was mostly 
rural until the 1980s, when it became another part of Atlanta's 
suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got both ends of the spectrum here in this community,  
but we are a semi-rural area and a suburb of Atlanta,'' Sheriff 
Jeff Wigington said. ``We have some areas where people go hunting, 
especially in adjacent counties. So I know there are lots of homes 
here with guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about guns Friday, convenience store clerk Jeanette  
Patterson said ``everybody's got them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a small community. You've got your pickup trucks, your  
tobacco chewing and your gun racks. This is not downtown Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During hunting season, the convenience store opens early to  
serve coffee, snacks and drinks to hunters decked out in 
camouflage. Some shoot deer in a wooded area just across the road 
from the store. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Patterson's 15-year-old son is in Solomon's Boy Scout troop  
and was in the Heritage High School common area when the shooting 
started. She blames parents -- not movies, video games or guns -- for 
school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, some people are just predestined for violence and  
parents should be aware of it and get counseling,'' she said. 
``They need to stop passing the buck to something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Morgan, an AT&AMP;T supervisor who lives a few doors down from  
the Solomons, said his 17-year-old son, Skip, visited the Solomons 
last summer and became uncomfortable when shown a cabinet full of 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``My kids aren't ones to hang around guns,'' said Morgan, a  
transplant from Rhode Island. ``I believe in the right to bear 
arms, as long as they are reasonable. I fully support what's going 
on in Congress to get guns to responsible people. I don't want to 
legislate against hunters. Just don't use them on people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, school officials met with Heritage students at a  
church to outline possible new security measures, including metal 
detectors, uniforms and clear plastic book bags. Many students said 
they didn't think any of those measures would have prevented the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing against guns,'' said Kenny McKay, a 16-year-old  
sophomore. ``I don't think guns did this. I think a hardened heart 
did this. I do believe if he hadn't had access to the guns it 
wouldn't have happened. But it takes a long time to get that much 
hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKay said he enjoys hunting and shooting, but believes it  
should be done under adult supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	David Nix, a mechanical engineer whose daughter will attend  
Heritage in two years, said he hunted as a youth in rural South 
Carolina but has changed his mind about firearms because of 
violence in his own home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Statistics show that when there's a gun around, people are  
more likely to kill someone they know,'' he said. ``I think the 
violence in the United States dictates that guns should be more 
tightly controlled.''

<HEADLINE> Schilling in War of Words With Phils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- This would be perfect for an editorial  
cartoon: Curt Schilling, enormous and menacing on the mound, 
unleashes a sizzling fastball. Standing at the plate with a skinny 
bat is Phillies general manager Ed Wade. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after Schilling demanded in a national conference call  
that the Phillies spend more money or trade him, Wade distributed a 
two-page, point-by-point rebuttal Friday in which he said Schilling 
was ``self-serving'' and ``wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Curt has a right to express his opinions,'' Wade said. ``But  
that's all they are. Much of what Curt says is irresponsible and 
his comments often are not based upon facts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every fifth day, Curt has the opportunity to go out and be a  
horse on the mound. Unfortunately, on the other four days, he tends 
to say things which are detrimental to the club and clearly 
self-serving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Schilling was the guest on major league baseball's  
weekly conference call with the national media. As Wade pointed out 
in his statement, ``Baseball uses the call to promote the game and 
its star players. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, Curt used the call as a forum to discuss the  
Phillies' finances, the team's ownership group and his personal 
feelings about the direction of the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did he ever.  
</P>
<P>
	``For us to be successful and to compete and to win, they're  
going to have to go out and get a big player. We're short right 
now,'' Schilling said. ``They told us they're not ready to pay in 
the Randy Johnson financial territory. If they signed Randy Johnson 
this winter, would we be contenders? If you bring in Randy Johnson, 
Brad Radke, Kenny Rogers, you name it, we'd be a legitimate 
contender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling met with team president David Montgomery Thursday  
night during the team's exhibition game against its Triple-A 
affiliate in Moosic, Pa. Montgomery did not return a call Friday, 
and Wade said he was told it was a ``private meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that it's necessary for me to schedule a time to  
meet with him,'' Wade said. ``I'm finished with it. I said hello to 
him last night, and he said hello to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies began the season with a $30.36 million payroll, the  
fourth lowest in the National League. Despite that, the Phillies 
were 21-18 Friday, trailing NL East leader Atlanta by 3 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Curt had a chance to promote his own performance and that of  
his teammates,'' Wade said. ``He had a chance to talk about Mike 
Lieberthal, Scott Rolen, Doug Glanville, Paul Byrd, and others. And 
maybe he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling did praise some teammates, notably pitcher Carlton  
Loewer, saying the right-hander is ``going to be an impact 
pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But all the positives he could have gotten out of that forum  
were negated by his comments about areas in which he is 
uninformed,'' Wade said. ``It's unfortunate that he chose to use 
the spotlight and do something other than put his best foot 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, off to a 7-1 start, has a complete no-trade clause in  
his contract, which pays him $10.8 million this year and next with 
an option for 2001 at $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said repeatedly he is willing to waive the clause to be  
traded to a contender, and frequently turns postgame interviews 
into impromptu rip sessions directed toward Montgomery and chairman 
Bill Giles. After beating Kevin Brown and the Dodgers on May 2, 
Schilling said, ``It's been six years since we've played good 
baseball on a consistent basis here. It's up to the Phillies 
ownership to get the players and put a good team out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What message does that comment send to his teammates?'' Wade  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the conference call Wednesday, Schilling elaborated on his  
comments in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're knocking on the door and they stand pat, I'd want to  
go,'' Schilling said. ``If ownership is not willing to make a trade 
or spend in July, they need to sell the team and give the 
Philadelphia fans what they deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade declined to expound on his statement. Some excerpts:  
</P>
<P>
	--On acquiring more pitching: ``We've been trying to upgrade our  
rotation since the end of last season and will continue to try. We 
haven't turned down any trade for starting pitchers because of 
dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On Schilling's belief that Forbes Magazine's report that the  
Phillies made a profit in 1998 was correct, and the team's 
assertion that it lost money was not: ``I've been in all the 
ownership group's meetings since December 1997, and I've seen the 
bottom line. The team has lost significant dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On Schilling's trade demand: ``Curt does not have a `trade me'  
clause. He has a `no trade' clause, which means he can refuse to be 
traded to any team. If we ever decide we want to trade Curt, he'll 
have his say. But Curt does not have the total say in this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade insisted that the controversy would ``absolutely not''  
affect a decision to trade his ace.

jobs over the next year as the railroad attempts to become more 
competitive and lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven percent, or 400, of the company's 5,200 salaried positions  
will be cut. In addition, another 1,000 union jobs will be 
eliminated, the company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the process of identifying where those (1,000)  
positions are, and that will take the better part of three to four 
weeks,'' said railroad spokesman Richard Russack. 
</P>
<P>
	BNSF, the second-largest railway company in the U.S. with 34,000  
route miles, is cutting back at the same time the country's largest 
railroad, Union Pacific Corp., has been hiring at record levels and 
has spent nearly $1.5 billion in upgrading its track and trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Burlington Northern bought Santa Fe in 1995 and Union Pacific  
took over Southern Pacific the following year. The two companies 
will control 90 percent of freight west of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	``Union Pacific is still, in a sense, building out of its merger  
with Southern Pacific, a carrier in a tremendously weak position,'' 
said railroad analyst James Higgins of Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins said that BNSF is a year further along in its merger and  
that Santa Fe was a far healthier railroad than Southern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``Burlington Northern has been spending heavily to increase  
capacity and probably has reached a point where even in a stronger 
revenue environment it would reach a point where it could take 
people out,'' Higgins said of the job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues at the railroad are trending slightly below the second  
quarter of 1998, and said Robert D. Krebs, chairman and chief 
executive, adding that earnings would be slightly less than the 58 
cents per share earned in the year-ago period. He estimated the 
severance costs would cost the company 6 to 8 cents a share in 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	BNSF also announced that Douglas J. Babb, senior vice president  
of the merchandise business unit, has resigned to pursue other 
opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Illusionists Preserving White Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Talk about your family portraits.  
</P>
<P>
	The 49 white tigers being raised by Siegfried and Roy are making  
their television debut in a bid to raise public consciousness of 
the plight of the endangered animals. 
</P>
<P>
	The famous illusionists announced Thursday they are joining with  
Exxon and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to help 
preserve the animals. 
</P>
<P>
	The key element is a new 30-second television commercial that  
features the pair and their animals. Many of the white tigers are 
featured in their stage show at The Mirage hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to cry,'' Roy Horn said after seeing the commercial.  
``The good news is that the white tigers and white lions are going 
into the 21st century. The bad news is that if we don't do 
something about the tigers in the wild, they will disappear.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs Foster Kids' Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would double money for  
programs to help thousands of foster children make the leap to 
adulthood cleared a House panel Thursday and drew a strong 
endorsement from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means human resources subcommittee approved the  
bill, which would expand services to foster children ages 18 to 21 
by increasing the funding from $70 million to $140 million next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The main sponsor, Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., said the money  
would provide job training, housing assistance and other services 
for an estimated 20,000 foster children who are abruptly dropped 
from the system once they reach age 18. 
</P>
<P>
	States could also use the money for younger foster kids who are  
nearing age 18 for such things as assistance in obtaining a high 
school diploma, post-secondary education, job placement and 
training in daily living skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who proposed similar legislation in his budget, said in  
a statement he would work with Congress to help the measure pass 
and ``enable these young people to live up to their God-given 
potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said House GOP leaders have pledged to bring the bill to  
a floor vote in June. Its next stop is the full Ways and Means 
Committee.

<HEADLINE> 39 File To Enter NBA Draft Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Duke's Elton Brand, college basketball's player  
of the year as a sophomore, and Rhode Island's Lamar Odom, the 
Atlantic 10 tournament MVP, are among 39 players who have filed as 
early entry candidates for the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft is June 30 at the MCI Center in Washington. Players  
who have filed for early entry can withdraw from consideration by 
notifying the NBA at least one week prior to the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The present early entry list includes five freshmen, 11  
sophomores, 11 juniors, two high school players and 10 foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, a 6-foot-8 forward, averaged 17.7 points, 9.8 rebounds  
and 2.21 blocked shots per game in leading Duke into the NCAA 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom, a 6-10 sophomore forward, averaged 17.6 points, 9.4  
rebounds and 3.8 assists for Rhode Island. His 3-pointer at the 
buzzer gave the Rams a 62-59 victory over Temple in the A-10 
tournament title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other early entry candidates are: juniors Richard Hamilton  
of national champion Connecticut and Steve Francis of Maryland, 
sophomore Baron Davis of UCLA, and high school stars Jonathan 
Bender of Picayune (Miss.) High and Leon Smith of Chicago's Martin 
Luther King High. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, sophomore Ron Artest of St. John's, sophomore William  
Avery and freshman Corey Maggette of Duke, redshirt freshman Dion 
Glover of Georgia Tech, and junior Jamaal Magliore of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover, however, reportedly had a change of heart, and a final  
decision was expected by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, an All-American, helped UConn win the NCAA title after  
averaging 21.5 points and 4.8 rebounds. Francis led Maryland to the 
final 16 after averaging 17 points and 2.79 steals per game and was 
a second-team All-American. Davis, a third-team All-American, 
averaged 15.9 points, 5.1 assists, 3.6 rebounds and 2.52 steals per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The tallest player in the early entry list is 7-3 Aleksandr  
Radojevic of Barton County (Kan.) Community College. The only other 
7-footer is 7-1 Josko Poljak, a 21-year-old from Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
	The two high school players are among the tallest, with Bender  
at 6-11 and Smith at 6-10.

<HEADLINE>  Reds' Stadium, Owner in Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- As one of her last acts as owner, Marge Schott  
guaranteed the Cincinnati Reds a new 45,000-seat ballpark by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds officials celebrated their lease agreement for a new  
ballpark today, saying it will provide income that allows them to 
compete for the playoffs once again. 
</P>
<P>
	For Schott, it was a bittersweet moment. She has agreed to sell  
her controlling share in the team to three of its limited partners, 
led by financier Carl Lindner. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott leaned on a table in front of the pitcher's mound at  
Cinergy Field while Lindner, team and government officials stood in 
the background as the 30-year lease agreement was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Schott didn't say anything during the 20-minute news  
conference, she showed mixed emotions afterwards about her last 
major act as owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I was still part of it when it was built, but I'll be  
part of it, yeah,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott had not made any public appearances and only visited her  
office at Cinergy Field a few times since agreeing to sell most of 
her shares to Lindner and two other limited partners on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The $67 million deal that will end her 15-year reign as  
controlling partner awaits approval by major league baseball, the 
last step before Lindner takes over. 
</P>
<P>
	Their appearances on the artificial turf at Cinergy amounted to  
a public passing of the torch. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Lindner declined to talk about the team's future  
because the sale hasn't been approved, he stepped up to the 
microphone to praise Schott for the ``nice things she has done for 
this city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bet she's signed over the last 15 years over a million  
autographs and I'd like to get a little hand for Marge this 
morning,'' Lindner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott reached over to touch Lindner's hand as he led the  
applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, asked if the lease signing was a bittersweet moment, she  
said, ``Kind of, yeah. But you've got to do things that baseball 
wants you to do. It's a boys' club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball had offered Schott a choice of either selling her  
controlling shares or accepting yet another suspension for 
allegedly using the names of Reds employees on falsified sales 
documents at one of her auto dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner and the other limited partners also had her boxed in --  
the current ownership agreement ends after 2000 and they were 
prepared oust her at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The lease agreement means the new owners can count on much more  
revenue to make the Reds more competitive. The Reds have not had a 
winning record since 1995, the last year before they slashed the 
payroll to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't have a new stadium, you won't be able to compete  
at all,'' general manager Jim Bowden said. ``This gives us a chance 
to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never asked to be able to put the same payroll on the  
field that Atlanta does or the Yankees do, but just put us in the 
ballpark. Give us a chance to be two or three players short of what 
they can do financially and not 15 players short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new ballpark will overlap left field at Cinergy, so some of  
the seats will be removed while the Reds are still playing there. 
The ballpark will include 3,000 club seats and 51 luxury boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Managing executive John Allen said the team will consider  
selling naming rights. Seat licenses could be attached to some 
``ultra-premium seating,'' but regular season ticket holders won't 
have to buy them, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	An architect is designing the stadium and should have a first  
draft done in July.

<HEADLINE> NATO Struggles To Maintain Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With no breakthrough in sight on the  
diplomatic or bombing fronts, the Clinton administration and its 
NATO partners struggled Friday to patch up differences over Kosovo 
while portraying Belgrade and its military as cracking after 59 
days of airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	In appearances with Secretary of State Madeleine, British  
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said London and Washington are in 
harmony on Kosovo strategy. And he asserted that NATO bombs are 
hitting so hard that ``I don't see any sign that the Yugoslav army 
at the present rate of attrition is going to hold out until August 
or September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even that time frame is remarkable, considering that many in  
NATO originally believed the air campaign would be over in weeks, 
not months. 
</P>
<P>
	The calendar is influencing NATO leaders' thinking because of  
the lead time required to reach either of two outcomes in Kosovo 
before the typically harsh Balkan winter sets in -- the resettlement 
of ethnic Albanian refugees in Kosovo under a peace agreement, or 
entering Kosovo forcibly to end the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the top NATO commander, told Defense  
Secretary William Cohen and the military service chiefs in private 
meetings at the Pentagon on Thursday that the time is approaching 
when NATO decisions on ground troops must be made if a resolution 
is to be achieved before winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Bacon, Cohen's spokesman, said Clark did not recommend a  
ground invasion or a change in NATO's strategy. He told Cohen, 
however, that because there is no guarantee that the air campaign 
will achieve all of NATO goals by autumn, ``you have to be open to 
the possibility of looking at other options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon also said the Clinton administration wants an enlarged  
NATO peacekeeping force to assemble in Macedonia, on the border 
with Kosovo, ``as quickly as possible.'' He said NATO's political 
body, the North Atlantic Council, is likely to discuss a plan early 
next week for a peackeeping force of about 50,000 troops. The 
United States is likely to contribute 7,000 to 8,000 troops, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the U.S. part of the peacekeeping force could include  
the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit that is now afloat in the 
Adriatic with about 2,000 troops equipped with a variety of arms 
and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has all but ruled out a ground invasion, but it is moving  
ahead with a revised plan for a peacekeeping force that would 
secure the return of the ethnic Albanians and implement a peace 
agreement. The question bedeviling NATO now is, what if there is no 
peace deal. Can the alliance sustain an air campaign indefinitely? 
Should it plan on sending a ground force into Kosovo in late summer 
or early fall on the assumption that by then the Serb troops would 
be so battered they could not resist? 
</P>
<P>
	To that last question, Britain says yes. The Clinton  
administration says no. 
</P>
<P>
	And German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder this week restated his  
strong opposition to sending any NATO ground troops into Kosovo 
until a peace agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, and in Washington on  
Friday, officials sought to portray Belgrade as on the verge of 
defeat, even though President Slobodan Milosevic has shown few 
signs of giving up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic is up against the ropes, he's in the corner, and  
that's where he's going to be kept by NATO until such time as he 
throws in the towel.'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters in 
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook, speaking to reporters at the British ambassador's  
residence in Washington, described Milosevic as stubborn but 
surprised that NATO has managed to keep up the airstrikes without 
unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
	In a briefing for reporters at the Pentagon, Bacon said the  
Kosovo Liberation Army is gaining strength even as the Serb forces 
are weakening. He said the KLA now has between 17,000 and 20,000 
troops, including about 15,000 in Kosovo -- more than twice as many 
as when the NATO bombing began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the KLA is now better trained, better equipped and  
better led than when the war began. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- President Clinton signed an emergency spending measure that  
includes $12 billion for Kosovo-related operations, including 
humanitarian relief for refugees, aid to Macedonia and the other 
``front line'' states that are accepting hundreds of thousands of 
refugees, as well as funds for other U.S. military forces. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Pentagon announced that 1,022 members of the Air National  
Guard and Air Force Reserve are being ordered to active duty for 
the Kosovo conflict. They, plus 26 KC-135 air refueling planes, are 
from units in Illinois, Kansas, Maine and New Jersey. It brings to 
about 5,000 the number of reservists activated so far. 
</P>
<P>
	-- State Department spokesman James Rubin said Milosevic is  
trying to manipulate a United Nations mission that is in Kosovo to 
assess humanitarian needs. ``It is essential that the United 
Nations not allow itself to be forced into cooperating with his 
agenda to use the U.N. humanitarian mission to generate favorable 
propaganda while denying it access to some of the most needy in the 
region,'' Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Painkiller Vioxx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has approved a new painkiller  
that could provide stiff competition to one of the nation's 
best-selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval of Merck &AMP; Co.'s Vioxx was announced Friday, and the  
company said the drug should be in pharmacies by mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vioxx for  
people with osteoarthritis, for women with menstrual pain and for 
adults with other acute pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The dosage is once a day, and the cost of the prescription  
medication is expected to be between $2.38 and $2.52 per tablet. It 
will also be available in liquid form. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tests on acute pain, Merck officials said the drug was  
tested and worked well on patients following extraction of wisdom 
teeth, people who had had hip or knee replacements and women who 
suffered severe menstrual pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx is a type of drug known as a Cox-2 inhibitor and is the  
second such drug on the market. The other, Monsanto's Celebrex, 
went on sale late last year for arthritis sufferers, and more than 
two million prescription were written in the first three months of 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers to the FDA recommended approval of Vioxx last month.  
</P>
<P>
	Cox-2 inhibitors are a new type of drug that relieves aches and  
inflammation with fewer stomach-damaging side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of people depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and  
other pills called ``non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,'' or 
NSAIDs, to relieve pain. 
</P>
<P>
	But NSAIDs can cause ulcers, stomach bleeding and other  
gastrointestinal side effects, especially in long-term users. They 
are blamed for causing 107,000 hospitalizations every year, and for 
killing 16,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	NSAIDS target an enzyme called cyclo-oxegenase, which is  
responsible for much inflammation. But there are two types of this 
enzyme. Cox-2 is believed to cause inflammation, while Cox-1 
protects the stomach lining. NSAIDs attack both. 
</P>
<P>
	So scientists developed more specific drugs to target just  
Cox-2. 
</P>
<P>
	While Vioxx is the second Cox-2 inhibitor on the market it could  
prove to be a formidable competitor, especially since it was 
approved for more uses than Celebrex. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx will include a label note that there were rare instances  
of gastrointestinal bleeding among users during trials and urging 
physicians to watch for that possibility.

<HEADLINE> Track Star Schwartz Dies at 87 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Elizabeth Robinson Schwartz, the first woman to  
win an Olympic gold medal in track, is dead at age 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz, who in 1928 won the gold medal in 100-meter dash in a  
then-world record 12.2 seconds, died Tuesday in Colorado. She was 
suffering from cancer and Alzheimer's disease, according to her 
son, Rick Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of the Chicago suburb of Riverdale, Schwartz also won a  
gold in the 400-meter relay during the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz began her track and field career at Thornton High  
School in suburban Harvey. Her biology teacher at the time was on a 
commuter train when he saw her running to catch the train. 
Astounded at the girl's speed, he suggested that they start 
training together, Rick Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100-meter Olympic race in Amsterdam was Schwartz's fourth  
competitive race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can remember standing in the middle of the field after the  
race and seeing the American flag raised and hearing the `Star 
Spangled Banner' and all the people singing it,'' she said in a 
1988 interview. ``Then I walked off the field and just kind of 
enjoyed the feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz's track and field career nearly ended in 1931 when she  
was seriously injured in a plane crash south of Chicago. Doctors 
said she wouldn't live, then they said she wouldn't walk, according 
to her son. She began training again shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she was no longer able to crouch down for the sprint  
position. She started running relays instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz retired from track shortly after the 1936 Olympics. She  
married Richard Schwartz in 1939 and often traveled the country 
speaking on behalf of the Women's Athletic Association and the 
Girls' Athletic Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz also is survived by a daughter and three grandchildren.  
Services will be private.

	``If you don't have a new stadium, you won't be able to compete  
at all,'' general manager Jim Bowden said. ``This gives us a chance 
to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never asked to be able to put the same payroll on the  
field that Atlanta does or the Yankees do, but just put us in the 
ballpark. Give us a chance to be two or three players short of what 
they can do financially and not 15 players short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new ballpark will overlap left field at Cinergy, so some of  
the seats will be removed while the Reds are still playing there. 
The ballpark will include 3,000 club seats and 51 luxury boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Managing executive John Allen said the team will consider  
selling naming rights. Seat licenses could be attached to some 
``ultra-premium seating,'' but regular season ticket holders won't 
have to buy them, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	An architect is designing the stadium and should have a first  
draft done in July.

<HEADLINE> Seattle's Griffey Still Having Fun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Kirby Puckett is Ken Griffey Jr.'s favorite  
player. And not just for what Puckett did on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Mariners slugger remembers how Puckett became his  
mentor when he got to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first came into the league, he treated me like I was  
somebody and not a rookie,'' Griffey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Puckett, a former star for the Minnesota Twins, now is an  
executive vice president with the team. When the Mariners are in 
Minneapolis on Monday, Griffey will go to Puckett's office to see 
his friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in 1989, when Griffey was a rookie, Puckett offered some  
sage advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Smile and do what you've got to do,''' Griffey said.  
```Just play hard and have some fun.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven seasons later, the charismatic Griffey is still smiling  
and having fun. He's one of the most popular players in the game 
and perhaps the best. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it's easy to have fun when you've got 366 career  
homers, including consecutive 56-homer seasons in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Still believed to be approaching the prime of his career,  
Griffey is an American League MVP, a three-time AL home run 
champion, a nine-time All-Star and a nine-time Gold Glove center 
fielder. He's led the majors in voting for the All-Star game the 
past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	With 16 homers in 39 games this year, Griffey is off to a fast  
start, sharing the major league home run lead with Tampa Bay's Jose 
Canseco. He has homered in five of his last six games, and he has 
hit in nine consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey isn't taking anything for granted. He saw what happened  
to Puckett. 
</P>
<P>
	Puckett led the Twins to World Series titles in 1987 and 1991,  
before being forced into early retirement in 1996 when an early 
form of glaucoma left him blind in his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey remembers Puckett's message fondly.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was towards the end of my rookie season and we were playing  
Minnesota and I didn't run out a ground ball,'' Griffey said. ``He 
said, `Show a little more effort. You ain't got to run under four 
seconds, but just do a little more. And smile.' That always 
stuck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another baseball elder Griffey listens to is Chili Davis of the  
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always gives me calls during the season when I've done  
something wrong and when I've done something right,'' Griffey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the late Jackie Robinson. Griffey appreciates  
everything Robinson did for today's black players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did everything you ask somebody to do and more,'' Griffey  
said. ``He endured the name-calling, the dirty play. If you're the 
only one, it's always hard. He's the one who did it for all of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners have another star in Alex Rodriguez, a three-time  
All-Star shortstop. Last season, Rodriguez joined Canseco and Barry 
Bonds in the majors' 40-40 club with 42 homers and 46 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey enjoys watching young players develop into stars. He  
knows Rodriguez is a special talent. Rodriguez is good enough to 
play anywhere on the field, Griffey says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at our shortstop,'' he said. ``He could play second base  
if he wanted. Third base. First base. The outfield positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't matter if a player isn't a center fielder like  
Griffey. If he's got talent, Griffey likes him. He particularly 
enjoys watching Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and Red Sox 
right-hander Pedro Martinez, who he thinks might be the best 
pitcher in the game today. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that he enjoys hitting against Martinez.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's the one guy who's going to come after you,'' Griffey  
said. ``He's a skinny kid who gives you everything he's got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Griffey with a smile: ``I don't like pitchers.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 37.46 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed in a listless session  
today as investors, worried about the effect rising interest rates 
could have on big-name stocks, moved their money into small-cap 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average finished 37.46 lower at  
10,829.28, closing out an unusually quiet week on Wall Street with 
a loss of 84.04, or 0.77 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week has been interesting,'' said Brian Belski, chief  
investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo. 
``There's been no volume, but many of the internal factors are 
fairly positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, even as most indexes ended lower Friday, the New York  
Stock Exchange had six stocks rise for every five that fell. On the 
Nasdaq Stock Market, the ratio of advancers to decliners was 
roughly even. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index fell 22.09 to 2,520.14, and the  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 8.54 at 1,330.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Some prominent technology stocks fell, including Dow component  
IBM, which tumbled 2 1/2 to 230 3/8. Nasdaq's most actively traded stocks 
were a trio of high-profile computer companies: Dell, Microsoft and 
Intel all declined, with Dell slipping 15/16 to 37 5/16, Microsoft 
falling 7/8 to 77 9/16 and Intel losing 11/16 to close at 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Cecin, director of institutional trading at Piper Jaffray  
in Minneapolis, said investors appeared to be edging away from the 
biggest names, seeking value in smaller companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the money coming out of the large-cap stocks is just  
looking for a new home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players continued to ponder the impact of potentially  
higher interest rates. Analysts said the low volume and modest 
shifts on Wall Street this week were due largely to the Federal 
Reserve's warning Tuesday that it may raise interest rates if 
further signs of inflation appear in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates can crimp corporate profits as borrowing  
costs rise. Analysts say that with many stocks near record levels, 
investors may feel that large-cap stocks are simply too expensive 
if their profits start to wane. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little fresh news to affect the overall market.  
Cosmetics maker Revlon, a frequent topic of takeover speculation, 
rose 1 1/4 to 30 1/2 amid rumors it will be acquired by Coty, a fragrance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical maker Merck, counting on a boost after the Food  
and Drug Administration approved its new pain pill Vioxx, instead 
saw its shares fall 15/16 to 71 5/16. Analysts said Merck simply 
mirrored the drug sector, where most companies fell much more 
steeply. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Dow component General Motors rose 3 3/16 to 83 5/16,  
following the lead of Delphi Automotive, the auto parts unit GM 
spun off. Delphi shares rose 13/16 to 21 5/16 in heavy trading 
after Standard &AMP; Poor's said it would add the stock to its S&AMP;P 500 
index. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman Kodak fell 2 9/16 to 73 after an analyst said it will  
keep losing market share to Fuji Photo Film Co. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the shifting fortunes of blue-chip companies, analysts  
were reluctant to draw many conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are questioning what to do with some of these premier  
leaders,'' Belski said. ``There's a lot of indecision and a lack of 
investor commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday was a ``double witching'' day, when the expiration of  
stock and index options forces traders to adjust their portfolios. 
Yet volume remained low on the NYSE. Consolidated volume totaled 
836.41 million shares, compared to 905.9 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.55 to 636.87, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.34 to 795.37. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.12 to 449.14,  
its fourth straight gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.06 percent.  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 slipped 
0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.5 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Black Newspaper Finds Backer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Defender -- a leading voice for black  
Americans through segregation and the civil rights era -- has found 
an investor who is expected to bring financial stability to the 
94-year-old newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Defender has suffered in recent years, but I think we have  
an opportunity to get back on track,'' Robert Sengstacke, 
great-nephew of the newspaper's founder, said Friday. ``There are 
reasons why the Defender is 94 years old, why it has survived; it 
still provides a service to this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit businessman Don Barden announced an agreement in  
principle Thursday with Sengstacke Enterprises Inc., which 
publishes the Defender and three other black-oriented newspapers. 
Terms of the deal were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being a fixture in Chicago since 1905, the  
Defender was read by thousands in the South, where it was 
distributed by Pullman porters and sold by newsboys who risked 
being lynched for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The early Defender inflamed southern whites by encouraging  
blacks to leave the Jim Crow laws and cotton fields of the South to 
take jobs in northern factories. It also became home to black 
writers ignored by the white press, including Langston Hughes and 
W.E.B. DuBois. At its peak in the 1930s, the Defender had a 
circulation of 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defender's future was put up for grabs after John  
Sengstacke, nephew of the paper's founder Robert Abbott, died in 
1997 at 84. In 1975, he placed Sengstacke Enterprises Inc. in trust 
with instructions that it be sold upon his death; his heirs had no 
say in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Some feared Northern Trust Co., Sengstacke's trustee, would sell  
the newspaper and its sister papers -- the Michigan Chronicle, the 
Pittsburgh Courier and the Memphis Tri-State Defender -- without 
concern for their activist history. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, activists in the African-American community hope the  
arrangement with Barden will help the Defender stay true to its 
crusading heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Defender is the only daily newspaper that tells our  
story,'' said the Rev. Al Sampson, who heads the Citizens Committee 
to Save the Chicago Defender. ``It has told our story throughout 
the black liberation movement, and we need it to keep telling that 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barden -- who owns the Majestic Star riverboat casino in Gary,  
Ind., five Illinois radio stations and other businesses -- said his 
goal was to maintain the company legacy as well as provide growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will work cooperatively to grow this medium in its existing  
and new community markets, provide all news and information needed 
and desired and work with the family of employees who have served 
this vision for so long,'' Barden said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> NBC's Ventura Story Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- Among all the laughable inaccuracies in ``The  
Jesse Ventura Story'' airing Sunday on NBC, one jumps out. 
</P>
<P>
	Gubernatorial candidate Ventura is on the campaign trail,  
discussing why the state ought to regulate prostitution rather than 
ban it. 
</P>
<P>
	As he's getting in his car, he turns to the reporter and says,  
``Thanks a lot for your time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This never happened, and as any reporter who covers Ventura  
knows, it's not likely to ever happen. The real Ventura spends more 
time joking about running over reporters than thanking them. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's just the beginning. NBC is stretching when it says  
the account scheduled to air Sunday is ``based on the true story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But inaccuracies aren't the worst part of the movie.  
</P>
<P>
	At the end of it, the Ventura character turns to the camera as  
he's entering the Capitol and says, ``I can promise you this: It's 
not going to be boring.'' It sure isn't, in real life. 
</P>
<P>
	But the movie turns a bona fide character -- Ventura himself --  
into Casper Milquetoast. It's not only untrue to the events of last 
fall's gubernatorial campaign, it's dull -- something the real 
Ventura never is. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ventura story is a great one. The former bad-boy  
professional wrestler known as ``The Body'' runs for governor and 
scores a shock victory over the son of a state Democratic political 
legend and a Republican rising star. 
</P>
<P>
	On a shoestring campaign with few staff, Ventura built support  
by sheer force of personality. The movie doesn't show any of the 
street energy of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the character works out of a snazzy, well-staffed  
campaign office, something the real Ventura didn't have. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ventura campaign picked up steam when he ran some creative,  
funny ads featuring himself singing a revised version of the 
``Theme From Shaft'' and doing television commercials with his 
action figure fighting off Evil Special Interest Man. The movie 
substituted variations that failed to match the wit of the original 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie Ventura walks door-to-door delivering campaign  
pamphlets. The real Ventura didn't do that; supporters literally 
followed him -- at fairs and across the state either in their cars 
or on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nils Allen Stewart plays Ventura but conveys neither the  
governor's rough charm nor his distinctive voice. Stewart puts all 
the attitude of a commercial voice-over into his accompanying 
narration. 
</P>
<P>
	The real Ventura has star power. This guy doesn't.  
</P>
<P>
	The movie traces Ventura from his youth in south Minneapolis to  
his election night victory. The script conveys few of Ventura's 
numerous grammatical quirks. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the character says things you would never expect to  
hear from Ventura, such as ``I had an epiphany'' or ``I didn't know 
it, but what I was looking for was back home in Minnesota.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota viewers also may cringe at the skewed portrayals of  
Ventura's opponents in the election. 
</P>
<P>
	In the movie, GOP St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman and former  
Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III are indistinguishable. In real 
life, Coleman is much taller than Humphrey and is a native New 
Yorker who speaks with a Brooklyn accent. 
</P>
<P>
	Humphrey is a native Minnesotan and the son of former Vice  
President Hubert Humphrey. The movie Humphrey lives in a gated 
palace; the real Humphrey lives in a modest suburban house. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura himself had nothing to do with the movie and says he  
won't watch it. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither should anyone who wants to understand how Ventura rocked  
the political establishment, because what you see in the movie 
isn't what Minnesota voters saw last fall.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Signs $15B Kosovo-Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today signed a bill  
providing $15 billion for the air assault on Yugoslavia, aid for 
disaster victims, farm aid and other programs. But he cautioned 
Congress that veto battles over budget bills may lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Capping three months of wrangling, lawmakers sent Clinton the  
Kosovo legislation Thursday on a 64-36 Senate vote. The House 
approved the measure on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed it despite reservations about extraneous items  
added by lawmakers, citing its funds for the U.S. military, farmers 
and residents of Central American nations still struggling to 
recover from last autumn's devastating Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a real emergency here,'' White House press secretary  
Joe Lockhart said today. ``The president believes it's unfortunate 
that Congress has sent down legislation that isn't clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement after the vote, Clinton said Thursday  
that he opposed congressional provisions ``that reward special 
interests, weaken environmental protection and undermine our 
campaign to stop teen smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``I call on Congress to end these stealth attempts to  
weaken environmental and public health protections. I have vetoed 
bills in the past because they contained anti-environmental riders 
and, if necessary, am fully prepared to do so again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also criticized a provision forbidding the federal  
government from claiming any of the $246 billion the states have 
won from tobacco companies in a legal settlement. Clinton wanted to 
use some of that money for health care and anti-smoking 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nation's governors, who wanted to keep the money from  
going to Washington, were jubilant. 
</P>
<P>
	``States now have the certainty and flexibility to meet the  
health and welfare needs of the citizens in their own states,'' 
said the chairmen of the National Governors' Association, 
Republican Michael Leavitt of Utah and Democrat Thomas Carper of 
Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans voted for the bill 32-23, with many of the  
most conservative members voting against it. Democrats supported it 
by 32-13, with opponents citing excessive spending or objectionable 
environmental amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	In a split at the top of the GOP hierarchy, the measure was  
supported by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, but 
opposed by Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the No. 2 Senate 
Republican and a leader of the chamber's conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives criticized the package because it is stuffed with  
local provisions that they said were hardly the emergencies the 
bill proclaims them to be. These included $250,000 to help 
revitalize a downtown Los Angeles neighborhood; $2 million to 
intensify security at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in 
Washington; and increased federal payments to some Northwestern 
wheat farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The freight train has stowaways hidden all the way through,''  
said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	They also complained that all but $2 billion of the measure's  
price tag would be paid with this year's federal surplus, which 
comes completely from Social Security -- money Republicans had 
pledged to leave alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders focused on the bill's $12 billion -- double Clinton's  
request -- for the conflict with Yugoslavia, the Kosovo Albanian 
refugees, Balkan countries near the fighting and U.S. forces around 
the globe. They said rejecting the package would hurt American 
troops in combat -- something few lawmakers want to be accused of 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think for one minute that I'd vote not to give them the  
equipment they need?'' Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said of 
U.S. troops. ``It would be unthinkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reluctance of senators to block the package was underscored  
when an effort by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, to pay for more of the 
bill by cutting most domestic programs failed, 70-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's Senate vote marked the culmination of a process that  
began in February, when Clinton asked Congress for nearly $1 
billion to help Central American and Caribbean nations recover from 
last fall's two deadly hurricanes, Mitch and Georges. 
</P>
<P>
	As the measure moved through Congress, it picked up $900 million  
so the government could help victims of this month's killer 
tornadoes in the Midwest and be prepared for other natural 
disasters yet to come. The bill also has $574 million to help 
American farmers, mainly those facing low prices for hogs, wheat 
and other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	In defeats for the environmental lobby, the measure also has  
language delaying tighter restrictions on mining companies that use 
government lands. Higher royalties on oil companies that drill on 
federal property would be postponed.

	Capping three months of wrangling, lawmakers sent Clinton the  
Kosovo legislation Thursday on a 64-36 Senate vote. The House 
approved the measure on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed it despite reservations about extraneous items  
added by lawmakers, citing its funds for the U.S. military, farmers 
and residents of Central American nations still struggling to 
recover from last autumn's devastating Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a real emergency here,'' White House press secretary  
Joe Lockhart said today. ``The president believes it's unfortunate 
that Congress has sent down legislation that isn't clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement after the vote, Clinton said Thursday  
that he opposed congressional provisions ``that reward special 
interests, weaken environmental protection and undermine our 
campaign to stop teen smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``I call on Congress to end these stealth attempts to  
weaken environmental and public health protections. I have vetoed 
bills in the past because they contained anti-environmental riders 
and, if necessary, am fully prepared to do so again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also criticized a provision forbidding the federal  
government from claiming any of the $246 billion the states have 
won from tobacco companies in a legal settlement. Clinton wanted to 
use some of that money for health care and anti-smoking 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nation's governors, who wanted to keep the money from  
going to Washington, were jubilant. 
</P>
<P>
	``States now have the certainty and flexibility to meet the  
health and welfare needs of the citizens in their own states,'' 
said the chairmen of the National Governors' Association, 
Republican Michael Leavitt of Utah and Democrat Thomas Carper of 
Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans voted for the bill 32-23, with many of the  
most conservative members voting against it. Democrats supported it 
by 32-13, with opponents citing excessive spending or objectionable 
environmental amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	In a split at the top of the GOP hierarchy, the measure was  
supported by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, but 
opposed by Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the No. 2 Senate 
Republican and a leader of the chamber's conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives criticized the package because it is stuffed with  
local provisions that they said were hardly the emergencies the 
bill proclaims them to be. These included $250,000 to help 
revitalize a downtown Los Angeles neighborhood; $2 million to 
intensify security at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in 
Washington; and increased federal payments to some Northwestern 
wheat farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The freight train has stowaways hidden all the way through,''  
said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	They also complained that all but $2 billion of the measure's  
price tag would be paid with this year's federal surplus, which 
comes completely from Social Security -- money Republicans had 
pledged to leave alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders focused on the bill's $12 billion -- double Clinton's  
request -- for the conflict with Yugoslavia, the Kosovo Albanian 
refugees, Balkan countries near the fighting and U.S. forces around 
the globe. They said rejecting the package would hurt American 
troops in combat -- something few lawmakers want to be accused of 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think for one minute that I'd vote not to give them the  
equipment they need?'' Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said of 
U.S. troops. ``It would be unthinkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reluctance of senators to block the package was underscored  
when an effort by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, to pay for more of the 
bill by cutting most domestic programs failed, 70-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's Senate vote marked the culmination of a process that  
began in February, when Clinton asked Congress for nearly $1 
billion to help Central American and Caribbean nations recover from 
last fall's two deadly hurricanes, Mitch and Georges. 
</P>
<P>
	As the measure moved through Congress, it picked up $900 million  
so the government could help victims of this month's killer 
tornadoes in the Midwest and be prepared for other natural 
disasters yet to come. The bill also has $574 million to help 
American farmers, mainly those facing low prices for hogs, wheat 
and other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	In defeats for the environmental lobby, the measure also has  
language delaying tighter restrictions on mining companies that use 
government lands. Higher royalties on oil companies that drill on 
federal property would be postponed.

<HEADLINE> Thomson Leading Golf Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Peter Thomson molded 12 players from  
seven countries into the first International team to win the 
Presidents Cup. Now he has a bigger prize in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	With a chance to beat the Americans on their home turf, Thomson  
has agreed to return as captain for the 2000 matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naturally, I'm excited,'' he told The Associated Press early  
today from Malaysia. ``I said the Melbourne event was the highlight 
of my career. This will be a real test for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the team can win in the U.S., we're on top of the pile.''  
</P>
<P>
	After losing the first two matches at the Robert Trent Jones  
Golf Club in Virginia, the International team handed the Americans 
their worst loss ever in match play, 20 1/2-11 1/2, at Royal Melbourne 
Golf Club in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	While players such as Greg Norman and Steve Elkington said  
during a beer-spraying celebration after the matches that they 
wanted Thomson to return as captain, the five-time British Open 
champion said only that he might consider it. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem has spent the past few weeks  
polling international players, and Thomson was the choice. Gary 
Player also was considered, and he is likely to be the leading 
candidate should the Presidents Cup move to South Africa in 2002, 
as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly didn't plan on this,'' Thomson said. ``But I said  
that if the team wanted me to do it, then I would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Presidents Cup began in 1994 and was patterned after the  
Ryder Cup to give foreign-born players outside Europe a chance to 
take part in match play. It will return to the Robert Trent Jones 
Golf Club next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour announced last week that Ken Venturi, the CBS  
Sports golf analyst and 1964 U.S. Open champion, would be the 
American captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I applaud that,'' Thomson said. ``I'm sure the U.S. could not  
have picked a better man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus was the U.S. captain in Melbourne and had what  
Thomson called during opening ceremonies the ``greatest collection 
of golfers in the world,'' from young lions such as David Duval and 
Tiger Woods to the experience of Fred Couples and Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	But the International team, inspired by an emotional team  
meeting led by Thomson after its 1996 loss in Virginia, rolled to 
such a huge lead that it only needed to win two of the 12 singles 
matches on Sunday to take the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Already this year, five players from that team have won on the  
PGA Tour -- Elkington, Vijay Singh, Stuart Appleby, Ernie Els and 
Carlos Franco. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got a lift of confidence,'' Thomson said. ``I'm not  
surprised because they're all good players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International team is determined by the world ranking,  
although Thomson said he expected Norman, Elkington, Singh and Nick 
Price to remain the foundation of his team. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he expects the Americans to be hungrier for the  
next matches, especially after losing the cup for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is now without either cup -- Europe has won the  
last two Ryder Cup matches, and will try to retain it in September 
at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the third time Thomson has served as captain. He  
was pressed into the job in 1996 after a player revolt that led to 
David Graham stepping down. He called last year's victory the 
``highlight of my career,'' partly because it was played in his 
native Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of winning on American soil has Thomson just as  
enthused. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really looking forward to this. I'm thrilled,'' Thomson  
said. ``It will be huge if we win. It means the International team 
will be recognized as the top dog, bigger than Europe -- and bigger 
than the U.S., I suppose.''

<HEADLINE> Mircosoft Unveiling New Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. revealed a new defense  
strategy today for its antitrust trial, suggesting future 
high-speed Internet connections for consumers will undermine the 
government's case by threatening to reduce the industry's reliance 
on Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The insights into Microsoft's new courtroom defense came during  
testimony from Steve Case, the chairman of America Online Inc., who 
was questioned for three hours under oath at a downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial judge previously agreed to allow Microsoft to ask Case  
about AOL's nearly $10 billion purchase earlier this year of 
Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet software pioneer that 
saw its business crumble after Microsoft started giving away its 
own Web browser free with the Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Case argued that Netscape's ``Netcenter'' Web site -- among the  
most popular on the Internet -- attracted AOL more than its browser 
software, which he acknowledged has suffered a ``significant 
decline'' in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not buy Netscape because of the browser business,''  
Case said. ``We bought Netscape in some ways despite the browser 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft focused as much Friday on AOL's purchase as on  
future high-speed Internet access -- connecting home computers and 
other devices over cable TV or new digital telephone lines or even 
using satellite transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Those questions appeared to puzzle Case, who has taken an  
unusually high-profile role in recent weeks lobbying Congress and 
federal regulators to force the nation's cable companies to allow 
their subscribers to use his AOL software with cable companies' 
ultra-fast data pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I in the right room?'' Case asked at one point.  
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer John Warden pressed Case on whether high-speed  
Internet connections will allow consumers to use software that 
isn't installed with Windows on their personal computers but housed 
instead on powerful machines elsewhere and ``served up'' to 
customers across data lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``As more people are connecting to high-speed networks, they  
will be able to do more useful things,'' Case agreed cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's sudden emphasis on these high-speed connections and  
their implications is meant to undercut some elements of the 
government's antitrust case -- namely, that its Windows operating 
system is so dominant that no one in the industry can compete with 
its success. 
</P>
<P>
	Software that is used in such ways across high-speed networks  
can typically be used with whatever operating system a consumer has 
on their computer. Microsoft argues that, in effect, the Internet 
itself becomes a competing software platform, threatening to make 
Windows less important. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears were illustrated by Microsoft's $5 billion  
investment in AT&AMP;T earlier this month, ensuring that AT&AMP;T will use 
Windows software in millions of cable TV boxes providing high-speed 
Internet connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also argues that this ability to run programs across a  
network can ease the reluctance of programmers to write software 
for operating systems other than Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has accused Microsoft of exploiting a particular  
antitrust theory known as the ``applications barrier to entry.'' 
This reasons that potential rivals are discouraged from creating 
other operating systems because they can't persuade programmers to 
write useful applications for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also contends that fast Internet connections  
eventually will allow consumers to easily retrieve even large 
software programs from remote locations, which could contradict 
government charges that Netscape was prevented from being able to 
adequately distribute its rival browser software. 
</P>
<P>
	The government on Friday did not appear interested in the  
high-speed Internet access question. During much of Warden's 
questioning, Justice Department lawyer David Boies rubbed his chin 
and glanced toward the ceiling, sometimes casually taking notes on 
a legal pad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a sideshow, an effort to detract from what the  
real issues are,'' Boies said afterward.

<HEADLINE> Georgia School Had Security Devices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- In the wake of the nation's latest school  
shooting, administrators insisted they had done everything possible 
to avoid such an incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the course of the day, I've talked with at least 20  
different experts about whether we could have done anything 
differently -- and the answer was emphatically no,'' said Jim 
Borland, a Rockdale County Board of Education member. ``Nothing can 
prevent what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-year-old sophomore armed with two guns opened fire Thursday  
morning at Heritage High School in Conyers, shooting six 
classmates. None of the injuries was critical. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the shooting, about 100 parents attended a regularly  
scheduled school board meeting. Only one parent commented, 
volunteering to patrol the halls if it would help make the school a 
safer place. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do we need to do more to protect our kids?'' asked Jody  
Isom, whose 15-year-old daughter, Lindsay, attends Heritage. ``The 
main thing is that we need more interaction with the kids, and if 
that means volunteering, I'll be the first one to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School Superintendent Donald Peccia and Borland said security is  
a priority. Both have opposed installing metal detectors, though 
Heritage has video surveillance cameras and an armed sheriff's 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Jim Wigington said today that the deputy's day begins at  
8:30 a.m., so he was not on duty at the time of Thursday's 8 a.m. 
shooting. He arrived shortly afterward, however, and helped direct 
the students as they evacuated the school, Wigington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heritage students said that after the April 20 school massacre  
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., teachers went over 
the school's crisis plan but did not hold lockdown drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Peccia also sent home a letter with students saying that any  
copycat incidents would not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we are aware of any rumors, threats or allegations,  
my staff and I will take prompt action to investigate the situation 
completely and call the police for assistance,'' said the letter, 
dated April 29. ``Strict disciplinary consequences will be assigned 
to any student and to anyone else exhibiting such behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peccia said a deputy will be posted at every Rockdale school  
until the end of the school year. Classes continued today at all 
schools except Heritage, and Peccia said attendance was about 
normal. Classes at Heritage are set to resume Monday, and 
graduation there is scheduled for a week from today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot let something like this slow us down,'' Peccia said.  
``And we will not tolerate anyone trying to take it away from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debby Stephens, whose daughter attends Heritage, said she has no  
qualms about sending her child back to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the truth is that unless we do something to change the  
minds of these kids, it's going to happen again,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Helicopter Rescues McKinley Climbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Two exhausted, frostbitten British  
mountain climbers who got trapped on Mount McKinley in a fierce 
blizzard were rescued Friday by a high-altitude helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers were trying to get to a third climber late Friday  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigel Vardy and Antony Hollinshead, plucked off the mountain  
just after midnight, were hospitalized with frostbite after getting 
300 feet from the mountain summit. Both said they were disappointed 
at not reaching the top, but said the weather worked against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a gnat's whisker away, but it was a combination of a  
lot of things. It would have been a worse situation if we had 
continued on,'' Hollinshead said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three climbers tried to reach the top of North America's  
highest peak Wednesday, but a blizzard forced to wait as they 
battled hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
	They decided to head down a day later. Vardy, nearly blinded by  
frostbite, stumbled, which sent him and his roped-together 
companions, Hollinshead and Steve Ball, on a 300-foot tumble. 
</P>
<P>
	In better shape than the other two, Ball, 42, descended to a  
ranger camp for help Thursday. Authorities did no know where he was 
until Friday afternoon. They reported that he was hypothermic, had 
a fractured leg and was dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Vardy, 29, and Hollinshead, 33, badly frostbitten and exhausted,  
were rescued early Friday in a daring high-altitude helicopter 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Their McKinley climb ended at about midnight, and after  
communicating with park rangers for hours through a radio with 
ever-weakening batteries, a break in the weather allowed a 
high-altitude helicopter pilot to make a dash for the men. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot dropped a bag with a radio, fluids and two ``screamer  
suits,'' insulated suits specifically designed to protect them from 
the 50 mph winds and temperatures 30 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Dangling from a helicopter cable, the climbers were taken on a  
10-minute flight to the 72,00-foot base camp and later on to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Vardy was hospitalized in serious condition with severe  
frostbite. His nose and cheek were blackened from the damage, and 
white gloves covered his hands. He also was alert and in good 
spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	The team had the right equipment, and all three climbers had  
reach the tops of peaks higher than McKinley, Vardy said. But the 
ferocious weather and the tantalizing proximity of the summit 
conspired against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you climb 4,000 feet in a day, you don't want to come  
down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollinshead, also frostbitten and with an injured shoulder, was  
in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did everything technically right, but we just left too big  
a chunk for the summit day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rescue was similar to one last summer in which two other  
British climbers were flown beneath the helicopter to a base camp. 
Two British military climbers were about 300 feet lower when they 
were rescued in June. 
</P>
<P>
	About 350 climbers now are on Mount McKinley. Ten people have  
reached the summit so far this spring, Park Service spokeswoman 
Jane Tranel said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees on Both Coasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Kosovo refugees can be found from coast to coast  
as they settle in with friends, relatives and host families anxious 
to help them forget about their war-torn homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees arrived Thursday in Seattle and Los Angeles. The  
arrival of a seven-member family at Seattle-Tacoma International 
Airport marked the latest leg in an odyssey that began when Serbian 
police drove them from their home in Gjilan, about 40 miles from 
the Kosovo capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank the American government that took the initiative to  
save us from the bloody hands of the Serb regime, to save my family 
and children,'' Xhavit Korqa, the father, said through an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korqas walked for two days through the mountains before  
reaching Macedonia, where they had to wait for a week at the 
border. The family spent a month at a border camp in Macedonia, 
then two weeks at Fort Dix in New Jersey before heading for 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	With Korqa came his wife and children -- three girls and two  
boys, ages 6 to 16. World Relief, the refugee resettlement arm of 
the National Association of Evangelicals, is sponsoring the family 
in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Korqa said the first thing he wants his children to do is to go  
to school and learn English. The first thing the 45-year-old 
mechanic and bus driver wants to do is find work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very encouraging,'' said host family member Bruce  
Kennedy, after the Korqas sat through a news conference. ``This 
means they won't have time on their hands as they have had for the 
last few months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korqa and his family have full refugee status, meaning they will  
be able to apply for permanent residence in the United States and 
eventually apply for green cards. 
</P>
<P>
	But Korqa said they hoped to return home ``as soon as peace  
returns to Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24 after  
President Slobodan Milosevic rejected a plan to end the fighting 
with the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Hundreds of thousands of 
ethnic Albanians have fled to neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has agreed to accept up to 20,000 refugees.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 3,000 refugees have been flown to Fort Dix this month,  
where they are processed for relocation throughout the United 
States. At the post, Mirsade Bejiqi was saying good-bye Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	She arrived with her parents and three brothers here with the  
first planeload of refugees on May 5. The 20-year-old college 
student had to say good-bye again Thursday as her family headed to 
Boise, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to say. I'm too sad,'' Bejiqi sobbed. ``How  
many times do I have to say good-bye to my friends?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arlinda Gashi, 19, stood behind a fence and cried as she watched  
her friend talk to reporters. They exchanged a tearful farewell 
before Bejiqi boarded a bus for Newark International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, 28 ethnic Albanian refugees -- all members of the  
Vlashi family -- arrived to stay with host families. They were 
greeted by Hajrush Vlashi and his wife, Renee. The couple worked 
with the Jewish Federation to bring family members to the United 
States from Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in shock,'' Mrs. Vlashi said by telephone from Los Angeles  
International Airport. ``They were very, very happy to see my 
husband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees will receive one month of cash assistance, which  
averages about $300 a person, and three months of services. The 
hosts have been asked to house families for as long as two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Soybean Oil Tested As Motor Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers say they've developed an  
alternative use for soybeans -- as a motor oil. 
</P>
<P>
	A month-long road test ended Friday in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from Agro Management Group Inc., of Colorado  
Springs, Colo., who developed and patented the product, drove two 
trucks on an 18-day tour through 18 states. One was lubricated with 
conventional motor oil, the other with the new soybean oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The two materials performed equally, researchers said.  
</P>
<P>
	The new product, made from soybean, canola and other vegetable  
oils, operates in the same way as conventional motor oil but is 
biodegradable, nontoxic and produces fewer harmful emissions, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you drain the oil pan (now), there's always a concern  
about what you do with the oil, because it is a toxic substance,'' 
said Byron Lemoine of the United Soybean Board. ``This is not 
toxic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dollars from soybean farmers helped pay for the research  
project. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists shouldn't expect to see the product at their local  
auto shops soon. The product will initially be offered only for 
commercial fleets in Michigan and already is being used in U.S. 
Postal Service vehicles in Grand Rapids, Mich.

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Reversing course, Indianapolis 500 race  
officials have reinstated the credentials of a Sports Illustrated 
writer barred because the magazine ran a critical article and photo 
of fans killed at a recent race. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony George, president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, said  
SI's senior auto racing writer, Ed Hinton, can cover the May 30 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's quite welcome to come, but I find it distasteful to have  
to offer him a credential,'' George said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway relented after a boycott of the race by other news  
organizations began to take shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Race officials were upset by a photo and an article that  
appeared in the magazine after three fans were killed May 1 at a 
race in Concord, N.C. Hinton wrote in the article, titled ``Fatal 
Attractions,'' that such accidents could be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	The photograph, taken by The Associated Press, showed one victim  
lying on blood-covered grandstand steps with a leg protruding from 
beneath a sheet and another sheet-covered body. 
</P>
<P>
	Mai Lindstrom, a spokeswoman for the Indy Racing League, which  
is headed by George, said that some of the AP photos were ``very 
graphic,'' and ``to our knowledge, SI was the only publication that 
chose to print one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Horton, AP senior photo editor for sports, said photo  
editors were sensitive to the graphic nature of the photographs and 
edited them carefully. He said there had been no complaints from AP 
member newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway at first offered press credentials for a Sports  
Illustrated writer other than Hinton, but the magazine declined. 
</P>
<P>
	In protest, the Chicago Tribune said earlier this week it  
wouldn't cover the race, and the Los Angeles Times also said it was 
considering a boycott. After the speedway backed down, the Tribune 
said it would cover the Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports Illustrated said Hinton would cover the race but was  
upset by George's criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad it's been resolved. We wish it hadn't come to  
this,'' said SI spokesman Joe Assad. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinton said he was astounded at George's comments.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought they were at least putting it under the guise of a  
professional dispute,'' he said. ``What I've heard sounds so absurd 
and so irrational I don't know what to make of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indy 500, which began in 1911 as ``the greatest spectacle in  
motor racing,'' has lost its prestige in the last three years. Star 
drivers like Michael Andretti and Al Unser Jr. no longer compete 
there.

<HEADLINE> School Violates Religious Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A lawyer for a school district found  
to have violated the religious rights of Catholic families says the 
ruling will have a chilling effect on classroom curricula. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Charles Brieant held Friday that the Bedford  
Central School District violated the religious rights of three 
families by holding an Earth Day liturgy, by encouraging the use of 
``worry dolls'' and by having third-graders make paper images of a 
Hindu god. 
</P>
<P>
	The families alleged in a lawsuit that the district promoted  
Satanism, the occult and New Age religion. Brieant ruled against 
the families on a dozen or so other issues, including complaints 
about yoga lessons. He called the case ``agenda driven 
litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the district's lawyer, Warren Richmond, said the ruling  
would have a negative effect on teachers as they develop their 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to self-censor,'' Richmond said. ``This is going  
to have a chilling effect, not just here, but at schools around the 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent Bruce Dennis, who described the questioned  
activities as innocent, said he had expected complete vindication 
and was disturbed by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notion of that paper-bag elephant head cutout being a  
violation I assumed to be ludicrous,'' Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the school board had not decided whether to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	The decision came 2 1/2 months after the end of a sometimes comical  
two-week trial with witnesses that included a yogi-numerologist, a 
psychic-telepath and the Rock Hound, a mineralogist who denied that 
crystals have special powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The tooth fairy was mentioned twice and when ``interspecies  
communication'' came up, the judge asked if that meant, ``Come 
here, Rover, lie down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the potential of the case attracted serious attention. The  
liberal People for the American Way organization supported the 
school district, while the conservative American Catholic Lawyers 
Association took on the case for the families. 
</P>
<P>
	Brieant said the violations he found were not the result of  
school policy but of random acts initiated by individual school 
teachers, whom he said luxuriated in their academic freedom. He 
ordered the district to adopt a published policy with clear 
instructions to teachers about Supreme Court standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just wanted other religions to be subject to the same  
draconian limitations that Christianity and Judaism are subject 
to,'' said plaintiffs' lawyer James Bendell, who had called the 
curriculum a ``Twilight Zone.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Finds Dialysis Center Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The number of dialysis centers around the  
country reporting problems with the machines increased to 11 
following a government alert that said malfunctioning tubing could 
expose patients to each other's blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 11 centers and hospitals have alerted their patients  
to the equipment problems, including blood leaks inside dialysis 
machines, and said they'll conduct regular blood tests for exposure 
to hepatitis or HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration issued a nationwide safety  
alert last week to all dialysis centers because of the chance that 
malfunctioning equipment potentially exposed patients to 
contaminated blood. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, four centers had reported some problem with tubing  
used extensively in the dialysis process. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the FDA's alert, another seven centers have notified the  
agency of problems, and it is continuing to investigate to 
determine ``the exact nature of the problem and what is causing 
it,'' spokeswoman Sharon Snider said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The machines are used to cleanse the blood of deadly toxins when  
the kidneys fail. There is concern because traces of blood were 
found in tubing inside the machines, Steven Niedelman, an 
enforcement director for the FDA's Center for Medical Devices and 
Radiological Health in Rockville, Md., said last week. Filters are 
supposed to prevent that from happening. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the risk that patients were exposed to blood-borne  
diseases was ``extremely remote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nipro Medical Corp., which manufactures the tubing, has  
voluntarily recalled 154,000 tubing sets. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Mary's Hospital in Tucson, one of the first centers  
identified, told its 121 dialysis patients about potential 
problems. Officials also told patients they would undergo blood 
tests for possible exposure to HIV, hepatitis or other blood-borne 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
	At the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Lee Regional  
Hospital in Johnstown, Pa., spokeswoman Anne McGrath said no blood 
leaked within the dialysis machines and none of 67 patients was 
exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the other centers said anyone had been exposed to  
contaminated blood. Several did not return calls seeking comment 
and some said blood testing would be offered. 
</P>
<P>
	The other centers are Bayonne Hospital in Bayonne, N.J., Total  
Renal Care in Miami Lakes, Fla., Dialysis Clinic of Oak Ridge, 
Tenn., Maine General Medical Center in Waterville, Maine, Mercy 
Hospital Medical Center in Des Moines, Iowa, Methodist Hospital in 
Houston, Cape County Regional Dialysis Center in Cape Girardeau, 
Mo., Bay Health Medical Center in Dover, Del., and the Veterans 
Affairs Medical Center in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska OKs Execution Moratorium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- The Nebraska Legislature has become the  
first in the nation to approve a moratorium on executions, a step 
that surprised some in a state where residents consistently say 
they support capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-house, officially nonpartisan Legislature voted 27-21 on  
Thursday to send the measure to Gov. Mike Johanns. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-term Republican supports capital punishment and  
opposes the moratorium but did not say whether he will sign or veto 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would put a two-year moratorium on executions while a  
study is done to see if the death penalty is being applied fairly. 
Death sentences still could be given, but no executions would take 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Ernie Chambers and Kermit Brashear pushed the bill through  
three rounds of debate. Chambers, an outspoken independent, has 
proposed abolishing the death penalty nearly every year since his 
election in 1970, but Brashear's support surprised even statehouse 
insiders. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Republican candidate for governor and longtime  
supporter of capital punishment, Brashear is the conservative 
chairman of the Legislature's Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	While many as 80 percent of Nebraska's registered voters have  
indicated support for the death penalty in public opinion polls, 
Brashear said he believes most Nebraskans will support the 
moratorium during the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Brashear said state law requires the death penalty be applied  
fairly and uniformly, but many of the 155 murderers serving life 
sentences committed crimes just as heinous as those of the 10 men 
now on Nebraska's death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states have considered moratoriums but have not adopted  
legislation, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a 
Washington-based group critical of how capital punishment is 
applied. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida officials stopped executions for a year after a fire  
started during a 1997 electrocution. The Illinois House recently 
passed a resolution urging the governor to impose a six-month 
moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bar Association and the National Conference of  
Catholic Bishops have called for such moratoriums.

<HEADLINE>  Shooting at Another American School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The first bell hadn't sounded yet and the  
students in the commons area at Heritage High School were gabbing 
and munching on cinnamon rolls. It was the last day of class for 
the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly came a loud, startling ``pop,'' then another, another  
and still another. Some figured it was a prank -- maybe firecrackers 
-- until they heard shouts of ``he's got a gun!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the panic, screams, tears -- and blood.  
</P>
<P>
	On the day Heritage High seniors were looking forward to picking  
up their yearbooks, their suburban community became the new focus 
for a nation on edge after months of fear and concern about 
violence in America's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Six students were wounded in Thursday morning's attack, none  
critically. Prosecutor Richard Read said the boy who suddenly 
attacked his classmates was carrying a .22-caliber rifle and 
.22-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, a 15-year-old sophomore friends said was upset over  
a failed romance, dropped to his knees, pulled the gun away from 
his mouth and, witnesses said, surrendered with a tearful: ``Oh my 
God, I'm so scared!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman was identified by friends as Thomas Solomon. He was  
charged with aggravated assault and other charges were being 
considered. Solomon must appear in juvenile court before he can be 
charged as an adult, something not expected before Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes were canceled for today, though students were expected  
to return to Heritage High on Monday. School officials said 
graduation would go on as scheduled May 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack was the seventh at an American high school or middle  
school since October 1997. President Clinton received word of 
Thursday's shooting before he left for Littleton, Colo., for the 
one-month anniversary of the deaths of 15 people at Columbine High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	The news ``is deeply troubling to me, as it is to all  
Americans,'' Clinton said. As he spoke, the U.S. Senate was 
approving a proposal requiring background checks for all 
transactions at gun shows and for anyone seeking to reclaim a 
weapon at a pawn shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Heritage High Class of '99 was left with these  
indelible mental snapshots: 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of teens, screaming, crying, jamming through doors to  
escape. Some yanking up fallen friends, others jumping over them. 
</P>
<P>
	A girl, lying on the floor, screaming ``I'm shot!'' and begging  
for her mother. Another moaning after banging her head diving under 
a table. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher shepherding students into a closet, and calming them  
by quoting from the Book of Psalms. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, helicopters, sirens, milling knots of dazed students,  
panicked parents searching the groups and tearful, hugging 
reunions. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of these same students and parents had watched television  
coverage of the Littleton shooting a month ago. That horror lasted 
for hours; the assault here was over in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You, like, watch it on TV and it's not your school and it's  
not like this,'' said Scottie Sanders, an 11th-grader struggling to 
reconstruct the morning's events. ``It was like a blur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heritage, 20 miles east of Atlanta, is a mostly white, suburban  
school, like Columbine High. About 80 percent of graduates go on to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the massacre in Colorado, Heritage had video  
surveillance cameras in the hallways and an armed sheriff's deputy 
on duty during school hours. The deputy didn't exchange fire with 
the gunman, and it was unclear where he was during the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Dunn, a sophomore, said he had seen ``lots of guns'' at  
the suspect's home. Solomon was described as quiet, and several 
students said his grades had slipped lately and he had been heard 
making ambiguous comments about shooting someone. One said he 
didn't take Solomon seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, someone had brought in a paper bag filled with  
crickets and left them to hop out across Heritage High. There were 
rumors that a possum or another critter would be turned loose 
Thursday, and firecrackers had been lit as classes came to a close 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I walked into the commons area and heard the pops,'' said  
Michael Mellitto, an 18-year-old junior. ``I thought, `Ha, ha, very 
funny!' Then these girls come running past me, crying, saying, `I 
can't believe they shot him!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Deeter, 15, a friend of the gunman, said Solomon was  
depressed after a girlfriend broke off their relationship this 
week. He was there as the attack began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I yelled to him, `Hey, what're you doing?' But he just kept  
shooting. And then the kid next to me got shot in the foot. Then I 
started to run,'' Deeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen-year-old Drake Hoy tried to run, too, but realized  
something was wrong with his foot: ``I took off my boot and there 
was blood and stuff everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the gunman was running and shooting at no one in  
particular, firing at students below the waist. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were falling on the floor, a lot of screaming, people  
trying to help each other,'' said Joel Thomas, 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside a closet, teacher Carol Ingle recited Bible verses to  
calm terrified students she had gathered there. One of them, 
freshman Stephanie Edwards, said: ``She told us it would be all 
right.''

<HEADLINE> Kasich To Make Public Contributors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich will start making public the  
names of his presidential exploratory committee's financial 
backers, a spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Press Secretary Todd Harris said the Kasich 2000 committee will  
meet Federal Election Commission campaign finance deadlines 
beginning July 15, when forms are due showing how money was raised 
and spent through the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee, has been  
unusual among the better-known presidential hopefuls in that he 
chose not to register his exploratory committee with the FEC; it is 
registered only with the Ohio secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris emphasized that the July filing will be voluntary, and  
said the decision to file was made to avoid letting the lack of 
disclosure become a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have conducted this campaign to the letter of the law and  
when people examine the Kasich campaign we want the focus on John's 
message and what he is saying,'' Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	No law requires an exploratory committee to register; that's  
required only after a hopeful has decided to become a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Legally, they're probably on solid ground. Politically,  
they're on quicksand,'' Larry Makinson, executive director of the 
Center for Responsive Politics, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably the only reason this hasn't been more of an issue is  
he isn't considered a top-tier candidate for president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Makinson's group has been preparing a report comparing the  
various committees' public disclosure performance, and The Columbus 
Dispatch reported in Friday's editions that the report would be 
critical of Kasich. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich has told reporters he raised $1.3 million during the  
first quarter of 1999, and that he is meeting his fund-raising 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC said federal law does not set a time limit or dollar  
limit on hopefuls while they travel, poll and talk to activists in 
the course of deciding whether to run for an office. 
</P>
<P>
	Makinson said Kasich's failure to file disclosure reports to  
date presents questions about the ethics of a person holding an 
important job in Congress maintaining secrecy about the origins of 
a large amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in Congress, let alone the chairman of an important  
committee, should have more than a million dollars of phantom 
money,'' Makinson said. ``Maybe (Microsoft Chairman) Bill Gates 
wouldn't be influenced by a million dollars but almost anyone else 
would be.''

on duty during school hours. The deputy didn't exchange fire with 
the gunman, and it was unclear where he was during the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Dunn, a sophomore, said he had seen ``lots of guns'' at  
the suspect's home. Solomon was described as quiet, and several 
students said his grades had slipped lately and he had been heard 
making ambiguous comments about shooting someone. One said he 
didn't take Solomon seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, someone had brought in a paper bag filled with  
crickets and left them to hop out across Heritage High. There were 
rumors that a possum or another critter would be turned loose 
Thursday, and firecrackers had been lit as classes came to a close 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I walked into the commons area and heard the pops,'' said  
Michael Mellitto, an 18-year-old junior. ``I thought, `Ha, ha, very 
funny!' Then these girls come running past me, crying, saying, `I 
can't believe they shot him!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Deeter, 15, a friend of the gunman, said Solomon was  
depressed after a girlfriend broke off their relationship this 
week. He was there as the attack began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I yelled to him, `Hey, what're you doing?' But he just kept  
shooting. And then the kid next to me got shot in the foot. Then I 
started to run,'' Deeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen-year-old Drake Hoy tried to run, too, but realized  
something was wrong with his foot: ``I took off my boot and there 
was blood and stuff everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the gunman was running and shooting at no one in  
particular, firing at students below the waist. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were falling on the floor, a lot of screaming, people  
trying to help each other,'' said Joel Thomas, 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside a closet, teacher Carol Ingle recited Bible verses to  
calm terrified students she had gathered there. One of them, 
freshman Stephanie Edwards, said: ``She told us it would be all 
right.''

<HEADLINE> NE Asian Trade Zone Considered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- With much of the world banding together into trade  
blocs, Japan should consider forming a free trade zone in Northeast 
Asia, a government study concluded Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual white paper by the powerful Ministry of Industry and  
International Trade said the area was one of the few places in the 
world where major economies were not moving toward regional 
integration. 
</P>
<P>
	The report noted that 90 percent of the 134 members of the World  
Trade Organization were in some sort of regional bloc, while Japan, 
South Korea and Hong Kong were on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan should seek to deepen intra-regional exchange and  
understanding in Northeast Asia, the only area in the world which 
has shown little interest in regional cohesion or integration,'' 
said MITI deputy director Kenji Totoki, who helped draft the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to increasing trade and investment between countries  
under the North American Free Trade Agreement and a planned South 
American common market known as Mercosur. 
</P>
<P>
	Free trade zones also force companies to compete in a truly  
international environment, important as the world moves toward a 
borderless economy, Totoki told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Another benefit is members form a unified front in global trade  
negotiations, strengthening their bargaining power, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the report noted Japan has not faired poorly in global  
trade. It said Japan's surplus in trade and services last year was 
$78 billion, the highest in half a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The politically sensitive surplus with the United States was  
also higher. Totoki said Japan's recession is scaring consumers 
into buying fewer imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Japanese and U.S. economies were growing at the same  
rate, the trade surplus should have decreased,'' Totoki said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report proposed restoring growth by fixing what it called  
the main problem in Japanese finance: the ``overly dominant'' role 
of banks in corporate financing, which has led to underdeveloped 
capital markets. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, MITI called for reforming the global financial  
system to avoid a repeat of the recent Asian crisis. Taxes on 
investment money entering or leaving a country could prevent the 
sudden flights of capital such as those that it said ruined smaller 
Asian economies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considerable credence has ... been given to the argument that  
the real problem was massive international inflows and outflows of 
short-term capital,'' Totoki said.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Teen Brought Guns From Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The arrest of a quiet, churchgoing Boy Scout  
accused of shooting up his high school with weapons stolen from his 
stepfather's locked gun cabinet was a sharp reminder that it's not 
always the surly, trench coat-wearing outcasts who commit violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Solomon Jr., 15, is charged with aggravated assault for  
wounding six fellow Heritage High School students. As more details 
about the sophomore emerged Friday, it became clear that he has 
little in common with the killers in last month's Colorado school 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Writings by Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris -- outsiders ostracized  
at Columbine High School -- indicated that they wanted to kill as 
many people as possible and go down in a blaze of gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon was a marksman with two deadly weapons -- a .357 Magnum  
revolver and a sawed-off rifle hidden in the legs of his baggy 
jeans -- and could have easily killed many students. But he 
apparently aimed at them below the waist so as only to wound them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just trying to be heard and not trying to kill  
anybody,'' said Kent Cason, 19. ``Two of my friends saw him walking 
into the cafeteria and he was loading a gun. He told them to stay 
there so they wouldn't get hurt, and then walked into the 
building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if Solomon really wanted to leave a trail of bodies behind,  
he could have stolen several more powerful weapons from his 
stepfather, according to Sheriff Jeff Wigington. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot more firepower available to him,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Experts said Solomon -- described as a typical teen who grew  
sullen after his girlfriend dumped him this week -- was making a 
desperate cry for attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly he had the option and the weapon to do more damage,  
and in not doing that, what he was doing was a way of getting 
attention,'' said Richard Gelles, professor of child welfare and 
family violence at the University of Pennsylvania. ``He knew he 
would get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Klebold and Harris, who killed 12 students and a teacher  
before taking their own lives, Solomon wasn't ostracized by the 
more popular students and didn't dress differently from his peers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just an average kid,'' said Joe Watts, a student.  
</P>
<P>
	``This case is a reminder that just because a particular child  
isn't in some group of alienated teens or doesn't have two nose 
rings or 15 tattoos doesn't mean that there's not a possibility 
that something tragic could happen,'' said Dr. Tom Cummins, a child 
and adolescent psychiatrist at Emory University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon's attorney, Don Samuel, described the teen's parents as  
``wonderful people'' who are stunned about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are just devastated not only by what their son allegedly  
did to these other children but also by what their son is now 
facing,'' Samuel said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack was the sixth mass shooting at an American high  
school or middle school since October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Few, if any, of the other school killers wore their outcast  
status as clearly and boldly as the trench coat-clad Klebold and 
Harris did. 
</P>
<P>
	Luke Woodham, convicted of killing his mother and then two  
classmates in Pearl, Miss., in 1997, was in a cult-like group, but 
it held secretive meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he didn't stand out for the way he dressed, Kip Kinkel,  
who allegedly killed his parents and two fellow high school 
students last year in Springfield, Ore., had tortured animals, was 
fascinated with guns and had a quick temper. In middle school he 
was voted ``Most Likely to Start World War III.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon, called T.J., is described as a clean-cut student with  
average grades that had slipped recently. He went to church with 
his family every week, and the night before the shooting he 
attended a Catholic youth group meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends said he became angry after the breakup and talked of  
ending his life or bringing a gun to school. But no one took him 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	With about 300 students crowded into the school's common area  
Thursday morning, Solomon fired 14 times -- 11 shots with the rifle 
and three times with the revolver. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Cheek, a junior who was shot once in the buttocks and once  
in the leg, said students began chasing Solomon -- who was running 
and smiling as he fired from the hip -- after the rifle ran out of 
bullets. Solomon then fired with the revolver and fled outside. 
</P>
<P>
	There, he fell to his knees and put the gun in his mouth.  
</P>
<P>
	When Assistant Principal Cecil Brinkley followed him outside,  
Solomon raised the gun toward Brinkley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stepped back a couple of steps and I turned to him again and  
I said, `Give me the gun,' and I said again, `Give me the gun,''' 
Brinkley said Friday. ``I saw him lower the barrel of the gun and I 
kept getting closer and closer to him. Then I held out my hands and 
he laid the gun in my hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then he gave me a real big bear hug and he said, `I'm scared,  
I'm scared,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon must appear in juvenile court before he can be charged  
as an adult, something not expected before Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Students were expected to return to Heritage High on Monday, and  
graduation is to go on as scheduled May 28. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday morning, students streamed into Heritage Hills Baptist  
Church to meet with counselors and ministers. Some teens hugged in 
the parking lot before going inside the church. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the students at the meeting was Solomon's ex-girlfriend,  
Cara Ward, 15. People who were in the church said Miss Ward broke 
down in tears and ran out of the meeting. She returned about 25 
minutes later and was consoled by friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``She doesn't want anyone to think she's the cause of all of  
this,'' said Jenny Stephens, 15, one of Miss Ward's friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Ward has not spoken with reporters.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Friend Cooperates in Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Fund-raiser and Little Rock  
restaurateur Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie has promised to cooperate 
with an investigation of illegal Asian donations to Democrats as 
part of a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie, a friend of President Clinton, pledged his cooperation  
Friday, ending a weeklong trial here on charges of obstruction of 
justice for allegedly hiding documents from a Senate campaign 
finance investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department prosecutors offered immunity and a  
recommendation for probation in exchange for Trie's help in tracing 
the source of Asian contributions funneled through him to the 
Democratic National Committee and to Clinton's legal defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC has returned $640,000 raised by Trie, while Clinton's  
legal defense fund has returned $460,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said the plea agreement was a boost to  
the investigation by its Campaign Financing Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows the continuing progress by the task force in  
actively pursuing allegations of campaign financing abuses,'' said 
department spokesman Myron Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie also was charged in Washington with making illegal  
contributions to buy access to Clinton for himself and Asian 
businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	In the plea agreement, prosecutors dropped the charges in both  
Arkansas and Washington and Trie pleaded guilty to a felony charge 
of causing a false statement to be filed with the Federal Election 
Commission and a misdemeanor charge of making a political 
contribution in someone else's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that the DNC had the names of the wrong persons,'' Trie  
admitted to U.S. District Judge George Howard. ``I requested that 
somebody else give the money for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trie faces up to six years in prison and $350,000 in fines.  
</P>
<P>
	After pleading guilty, Trie was served with a subpoena to appear  
June 10 before the House Government Reform Committee, which is 
looking into campaign finance abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, the committee chairman, said he hoped the  
Justice Department would cooperate and let Trie answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people have waited a long time for answers and  
they have a right to know the truth,'' the Indiana Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie, 49, became friends with Clinton when he was governor and  
frequented a Chinese restaurant Trie owned near the Arkansas 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	A naturalized U.S. citizen, the Taiwan-born Trie operated the Fu  
Lin Chinese restaurant in Little Rock. In 1991, he began an 
international trading business. He moved to Washington when Clinton 
became president.

<HEADLINE> Sound Therapy For Ear Ringing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's commonly called ringing in the ears, but  
for millions of people who suffer tinnitus, the sound that plagues 
them may instead be a buzz or hiss or chirp or high-pitched 
whistle. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 50 million Americans hear those phantom sounds  
continuously, although for most it's just an annoyance. But for 12 
million people, the incessant noise becomes debilitating enough to 
seek medical help, according to the American Tinnitus Association. 
</P>
<P>
	They can suffer sleep deprivation or depression. Tinnitus can  
ruin family relationships. Occasionally, it even pushes sufferers 
to suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no cure -- and tinnitus is on the rise, due in part to  
ear damage from our increasingly noisy society. Loud noise is a 
chief culprit in tinnitus, as anyone whose ears have rung at least 
temporarily after a rock concert can attest. 
</P>
<P>
	But an Emory University professor says many patients can retrain  
their brains to recognize their ear-ringing as no more annoying 
than the refrigerator humming in the background of your home. 
</P>
<P>
	It's called tinnitus retraining therapy, and the key is using  
other faint sounds, sometimes called ``white noise,'' to adjust how 
patients' brains perceive and react to the abnormal sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very simple,'' explains Pawel Jastreboff, who introduced  
the approach in the early 1990s but now, as director of Emory's new 
tinnitus center, is training numerous doctors to use it. ``All of 
our senses, including hearing, are based on contrast from 
background. ... If you introduce another sound, then the first 
sound seems to be not as loud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He fits severe patients with small hearing aid-like devices to  
deliver faint sounds, like running water or a low hum, for up to 18 
months. Over that time, their brains are supposed to become so used 
to focusing on the new sounds that they're not paying attention to 
the ringing. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors don't understand what causes tinnitus. But they do know  
that the most common trigger is loud noise, like an explosion, a 
concert or pulsating boom box, a plane taking off, lawn mowers and 
other power tools. 
</P>
<P>
	Even one-time exposure to a really loud noise commonly causes  
temporary tinnitus. But chronic exposure risks persistent ringing 
in the ears. Experts say the best protection is prevention -- turn 
down the volume or wear earplugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But tinnitus isn't a novelty of the super-loud 20th century.  
It's been described for hundreds for years. And it can be a side 
effect of numerous medications, or the consequence of a blow to the 
head or an ear infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are studying an area of the brain called the auditory  
cortex that helps process signals from the ears and behaves 
abnormally in tinnitus sufferers, in hopes of understanding what 
makes the ringing continue so maybe it could be blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jastreboff says for now, ``it's possible to help really a  
majority of patients'' with sound therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who have a strong emotional response to the ringing  
seem to suffer most, so he teaches them about how the brain 
processes sound and ways to cope, helping them to relax. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Jastreboff introduces sound therapy. Some people try to  
mask tinnitus with louder noise, but he stresses very faint sounds, 
too low to interfere even with a telephone conversation. ``You'll 
never achieve habituation if you block tinnitus,'' he contends. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the noise is so faint some people forget they're  
wearing the devices. ``I've had some people jump in a swimming pool 
and make a total mess of their sound generators,'' Jastreboff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The patient's severity determines the sound. Some succeed with  
hearing aids to amplify everyday sounds over the ear ringing. But 
the majority get the behind-the-ear sound generators, emitting just 
enough noise for the brain to sense. 
</P>
<P>
	Jastreboff has published studies suggesting the approach helps  
up to 80 percent of patients get significant relief. Studies from 
Britain and Australia also suggest it helps, although not quite as 
much.

<HEADLINE> As Knicks Win, Grunfeld Sits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like the rest of the New York Knicks, Ernie  
Grunfeld had the day off today. Unlike the others, he won't be back 
at Madison Square Garden when their series against the Atlanta 
Hawks resumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld, the former general manager and team president who was  
demoted in a front office shakeup last month, has been watching 
from afar as the team he built has begun to thrive in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by controversial new acquisitions Latrell Sprewell and  
Marcus Camby, the Knicks have a 2-0 lead over Atlanta in the 
best-of-7 second round. The series resumes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people criticized what I did, but I did what was in  
the best interest of the organization,'' Grunfeld said. ``I still 
feel very good about it, and now it's starting to come around and 
people are starting to see why I made the decisions I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been more than a month since Grunfeld was reassigned to  
special consultant, a move made by Madison Square Garden president 
Dave Checketts while the team was floundering with a .500 record 
and in danger of missing the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The demotion all but ruined the relationship between Grunfeld  
and Checketts, who considered each other friends and whose families 
were close. 
</P>
<P>
	Refusing to call himself bitter, it's nonetheless clear Grunfeld  
feels a sense of betrayal from the organization he spent 18 years 
with as a player, broadcaster and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hurt,'' Grunfeld admitted in a telephone interview  
Friday after playing a round of golf. ``I was hurt by the events 
that happened and the timing of the events, but sometimes strange 
things happen in our business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good lesson for our family to see that things aren't  
always going to go perfect in your life, and sometimes you're going 
to have to regroup. My family grew up as a Knicks family, and the 
Knicks were a very important part of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard on them, but they're tough and were going to move  
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The demotion of Grunfeld has remained a hot topic of debate in  
New York for the past month as the team has begun to click on a 
consistent basis. A victory over the Hawks would put New York into 
the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, acquired by Grunfeld prior to the season for John  
Starks, Terry Cummings and Chris Mills, has scored 31 points in 
each of the first two games against the Hawks and is New York's 
leading scorer in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's on a level with Michael Jordan,'' Atlanta's Ed Gray said.  
``He's that type of player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Camby was the subject of much more criticism,  
including within the organization and especially with coach Jeff 
Van Gundy, because it cost the Knicks gritty veteran Charles 
Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
	But Camby has injected the team with a shot-blocking presence on  
defense and a youthful energy on offense that had been missing for 
the better part of a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby's devastating dunk over Dikembe Mutombo in Game 2, a play  
on which he took off from near the foul line, was exactly the type 
of moment Oakley was simply incapable of. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a lot of pride in the way things are coming around,''  
said Grunfeld, who has been watching the games on TV with family 
and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We watch and we root, I'm a Knicks fan, and I feel this is the  
team I put together and I felt could be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going to take a little longer than normal for  
this team to come together, but finally it is coming together and 
I'm really happy about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks, meanwhile, stayed in Atlanta on Friday for a long  
film session and practice. They will try to become just the eighth 
team in NBA history to come back from a 2-0 deficit in a seven-game 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 3 is Sunday afternoon, and Game 4 is Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh-and-two is not a good situation to be in, but it's not  
impossible,'' Steve Smith said. ``The Garden is the one place where 
you just like to play.''

<HEADLINE> Stewart Gets Shot at Indy Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Larry Curry had a message for driver Tony  
Stewart: ``Tell him to get on that plane and get back here. We've 
got a practice in the morning and we drew No. 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who was in Concord, N.C., to qualify for Saturday  
night's NASCAR Winston Open, has only a small window of time 
earlier Saturday in which to take a shot at the pole for the May 30 
Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, the co-owner of his team, got the first part of the  
equation right, drawing the second spot in the qualifying order for 
Stewart's primary car and No. 17 for his backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying was scheduled to begin at 11 a.m., but one possible  
glitch in Stewart's plan is a 60 percent chance of rain Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's as good as it gets,'' said Curry, who pumped his fist in  
the air after pulling the No. 2 spot. ``That's what we had to do, 
so now we've just got to hope that it doesn't rain. We really don't 
have any leeway. If it rains, it pushes back practice, qualifying 
starts late and we'll have to qualify on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pole and most of the top spots in the 33-car lineup are  
expected to be filled Saturday, with the rest of the field 
determined in further time trials on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pole favorite Greg Ray, with no other racing on his schedule  
this weekend, will have to wait until No. 45 -- his backup -- or No. 
58 to make his four-lap, 10-mile qualifying run. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time race winner Arie Luyendyk, also one of the favorites on  
Saturday, is 30th in line. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending race winner Eddie Cheever drew qualifying position No.  
1, followed by Stewart, Scott Sharp and rookies David Steele and 
Jaques Lazier. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Boat, last year's pole-winner, will go 15th, while his  
teammate, Kenny Brack, the defending Pep Boys Indy Racing League

	 *THE PAYOFF:* It takes four laps around the 2 1/2-mile oval to win  
the pole for the Indianapolis 500. For the driver who accomplishes 
that feat, the payoff averages well over $25,000 a lap. 
</P>
<P>
	To begin, the pole winner on Saturday will get the traditional  
trophy and a check for $100,000 from sponsor PPG Industries. If he 
or she runs the fastest single lap in qualifying, add $5,000 to 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the 33 starters in the race, including the pole-winner,  
will get $15,000 as well as a ring from PPG. 
</P>
<P>
	The fastest qualifier will also get to drive home a 1999  
Chevrolet Camaro pace car, worth about $30,000.

	 *AERIAL VIEW:* Kevin Forbes, director of engineering and  
construction for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, says the last leg 
of the infield portion of the new Formula One track will be paved 
before the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want people to be able to see the road course when there  
are pictures shot from the blimp for TV,'' Forbes said. ``We hope 
people will see how well it fits into the overall layout of the 
facility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway is spending an estimated $75 million for  
construction projects, including the track, 36 Formula One garages, 
a new control tower and media center. All of the work is expected 
to be done prior to the first F1 races at the track on Sept. 24, 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The road circuit is 2.61 miles long and traverses 13 turns. It  
uses about half of the historic 2 1/2-mile oval, including most of the 
main straightaway.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Appeal Smog Fight Rejection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- EPA Administrator Carol Browner said Thursday  
the Clinton administration is ``pursuing all options available'' to 
overturn an appeals court decision that last week scuttled the 
agency's controversial smog and soot health standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the interim we will take whatever steps, consistent with  
the court's decision, so that we can secure these protections for 
all Americans,'' Browner said in a statement prepared for a Senate 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward in discussions with reporters, she said the decision  
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia would be 
appealed. She said she was heartened that the court did not 
challenge the rule's scientific underpinning. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 regulation was one of the most controversial ever  
developed by EPA, requiring much tougher air pollution controls to 
reduce the soot and ozone allowed in the air. The court, in a 2-1 
decision, said EPA exceeded its authority in setting the standards 
under the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing before the Senate Environment subcommittee on clean  
air, Browner began expressing her dismay at the court ruling toward 
the end of her testimony. But she was not allowed to finished. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., the subcommittee chairman, cut her  
off, saying the hearing was called to discuss the EPA's recent 
proposal to reduce sulfur in gasoline and impose tighter pollution 
controls from cars. Discussing the court case would be 
inappropriate, he said, promising future hearings on the air 
standards now in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Browner still managed to make clear her views on the court  
ruling, calling it ``bizarre'' and ``illogical'' -- and a total 
surprise to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to fly in the face of more than a half a century of  
U.S. Supreme Court rulings,'' she said. ``The decision is 
illogical. It would have you believe that in 1990, Congress and the 
Bush administration ... perpetuated a cruel hoax by on the one hand 
directing EPA to strengthen air quality standards, and then, with 
the other hand, gutting EPA's powers to enforce these standards.''

<HEADLINE> Blood Clots Factor in Wynette Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An autopsy performed on the exhumed body  
of Tammy Wynette showed the country singer died of heart failure 
caused by damage from repeated blood clots. 
</P>
<P>
	The role drugs may have played in Wynette's 1998 death is  
impossible to determine because the autopsy took place a year after 
she died, Medical Examiner Bruce Levy said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traces of Versed, a sedative, and Phenergan, which is used for  
nausea and as a sedative, were found in her body. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhumation and autopsy were prompted by a $50 million  
wrongful death lawsuit filed by Wynette's four daughters. They 
allege their mother could have lived longer but her health wasn't 
monitored closely enough, and that she was given too many 
painkillers prior to her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy said that if called to testify, he would say Wynette died  
of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
	``My belief is that the heart failure happened probably through  
a combination of natural disease and maybe or maybe not contributed 
to by the drugs,'' Levy said. ``There's no way to be able to 
determine that for sure.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Push Rural Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm-state Senate Democrats are asking federal  
regulators to consider subsidizing high-speed Internet access in 
rural areas, saying better telecommunications are critical to 
economic survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would come from fees that are imposed on  
telecommunications companies and typically passed on to their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are determined not to end up with a country of haves and  
have-nots with respect to advanced telecommunications,'' Sen. Byron 
Dorgan, D-N.D., said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1996 law, rural areas are supposed to have  
telecommunications services that are ``reasonably comparable'' to 
those in cities, but it was left up to the FCC to decide how to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	The government already is handing out nearly $1.7 billion in  
subsidies to schools and libraries, including those in rural areas 
and inner cities, for a variety of telecommunications needs, 
including Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard recently called for $2.25 billion to  
fund the program in its second year. That is generating criticism 
mostly from Republicans on Capitol Hill, because of fears that it 
could raise phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators say farmers, rural businesses and small-town  
health-care facilities need access to high-speed Internet services 
for transmitting graphics and large amounts of data. Farmers, for 
example, often use satellite imaging to decide how much fertilizer 
and pesticide to use in their fields. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Kennard, the senators said the FCC should  
consider subsidizing high-speed Internet and data services via 
satellite services, raise the technical requirements for phone 
lines, and encourage cellular companies to serve remote areas and 
Indian reservations where there is little existing phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the senators are introducing legislation to set up  
an office of rural advocacy at the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rural communities need the economic and social benefits that  
high-speed Internet access provides. For some of them, it's a 
matter of basic economic survival,'' said Senate Minority Leader 
Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications companies have been racing each other to  
provide high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	An alliance of computer makers and big telephone companies,  
including US West, wants the FCC to ease regulations they say 
discourage modernization. Rival long-distance companies, including 
AT&AMP;T, oppose the move. AT&AMP;T is seeking to become a major provider 
of Internet service over cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment on  
the senators' request. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was signed by Daschle and Dorgan and Sens. Tom Harkin  
of Iowa, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Kent 
Conrad of North Dakota, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Paul Wellstone of 
Minnesota, Patty Murray of Washington, and Max Baucus of Montana.

<HEADLINE> As Knicks Win, Grunfeld Sits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like the rest of the New York Knicks, Ernie  
Grunfeld had the day off today. Unlike the others, he won't be back 
at Madison Square Garden when their series against the Atlanta 
Hawks resumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld, the former general manager and team president who was  
demoted in a front office shakeup last month, has been watching 
from afar as the team he built has begun to thrive in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by controversial new acquisitions Latrell Sprewell and  
Marcus Camby, the Knicks have a 2-0 lead over Atlanta in the 
best-of-7 second round. The series resumes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people criticized what I did, but I did what was in  
the best interest of the organization,'' Grunfeld said. ``I still 
feel very good about it, and now it's starting to come around and 
people are starting to see why I made the decisions I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been more than a month since Grunfeld was reassigned to  
special consultant, a move made by Madison Square Garden president 
Dave Checketts while the team was floundering with a .500 record 
and in danger of missing the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The demotion all but ruined the relationship between Grunfeld  
and Checketts, who considered each other friends and whose families 
were close. 
</P>
<P>
	Refusing to call himself bitter, it's nonetheless clear Grunfeld  
feels a sense of betrayal from the organization he spent 18 years 
with as a player, broadcaster and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hurt,'' Grunfeld admitted in a telephone interview  
Friday after playing a round of golf. ``I was hurt by the events 
that happened and the timing of the events, but sometimes strange 
things happen in our business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good lesson for our family to see that things aren't  
always going to go perfect in your life, and sometimes you're going 
to have to regroup. My family grew up as a Knicks family, and the 
Knicks were a very important part of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard on them, but they're tough and were going to move  
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The demotion of Grunfeld has remained a hot topic of debate in  
New York for the past month as the team has begun to click on a 
consistent basis. A victory over the Hawks would put New York into 
the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, acquired by Grunfeld prior to the season for John  
Starks, Terry Cummings and Chris Mills, has scored 31 points in 
each of the first two games against the Hawks and is New York's 
leading scorer in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's on a level with Michael Jordan,'' Atlanta's Ed Gray said.  
``He's that type of player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Camby was the subject of much more criticism,  
including within the organization and especially with coach Jeff 
Van Gundy, because it cost the Knicks gritty veteran Charles 
Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
	But Camby has injected the team with a shot-blocking presence on  
defense and a youthful energy on offense that had been missing for 
the better part of a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby's devastating dunk over Dikembe Mutombo in Game 2, a play  
on which he took off from near the foul line, was exactly the type 
of moment Oakley was simply incapable of. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a lot of pride in the way things are coming around,''  
said Grunfeld, who has been watching the games on TV with family 
and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We watch and we root, I'm a Knicks fan, and I feel this is the  
team I put together and I felt could be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going to take a little longer than normal for  
this team to come together, but finally it is coming together and 
I'm really happy about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks, meanwhile, stayed in Atlanta on Friday for a long  
film session and practice. They will try to become just the eighth 
team in NBA history to come back from a 2-0 deficit in a seven-game 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 3 is Sunday afternoon, and Game 4 is Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh-and-two is not a good situation to be in, but it's not  
impossible,'' Steve Smith said. ``The Garden is the one place where 
you just like to play.''

<HEADLINE> Court Overturns FCC Phone Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court today overturned a  
decision by federal regulators that had resulted in lower 
long-distance phone bills for millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sent part  
of the 1997 decision back to the Federal Communications Commission 
for review. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the FCC didn't adequately explain certain changes  
to a complex formula that affects ``access'' payments that 
long-distance companies pay local phone companies to connect calls. 
</P>
<P>
	These fees are typically passed on to long-distance customers  
and make up a big portion of the average long-distance bill. When 
the FCC orders these fees to be reduced, the savings are supposed 
to be passed along to long-distance customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 the FCC made some adjustments that caused the access  
fees to be reduced by more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the court today disagreed with the FCC's rationale  
for making those changes to the so-called ``X Factor.'' Expressed 
as a percentage, the factor aims at ensuring that as a local phone 
company's productivity improves, the company would receive less 
from these access payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Local phone companies ``argue that the FCC did not give a  
rational explanation of that choice and we agree,'' the court said 
in its 11-page opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision is a major victory for the nation's Bell companies,  
GTE and other local phone companies and a blow to the FCC and the 
long-distance companies AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	The local telephone industry through the United States Telephone  
Association had contested this portion of the FCC's decision before 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T and MCI had challenged the FCC's 1997 calculations for  
opposite reasons. The long-distance companies contended the FCC 
should have adjusted its formula to result in deeper cuts in the 
access payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's decision is likely to affect how the FCC adjusts  
access fees later this year. The fees are still expected to be 
reduced, but now it is not clear by how much.

<HEADLINE> First Arab Woman Elected in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIBEH, Israel (AP) -- For half a century, Arab women in Israel  
had no voice in parliament. That's changed with the victory of 
Hussnia Jabara, the first Arab woman elected to Israel's Knesset. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't have taken so long,'' said the 41-year-old  
activist, whose priorities are to improve education and fight 
unemployment in Arab communities that have suffered discrimination 
at the hands of Israeli governments for years. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite her election this week, the 120-member Knesset  
continues to be dominated by men -- only 14 of the newly elected 
legislators are women, and that's an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Jabara's victory highlights gradual changes in Israeli  
Arab society, where women, even of her generation, were expected to 
be mothers and wives, not lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jabara, a farmer's daughter, married a man her family chose for  
her when she was 19. ``We weren't modern then,'' she said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	But times have changed. While she gives interviews, her husband,  
Fathi, a driving teacher, helps answer the phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of men worked on her campaign in Taibeh, a Muslim  
community of 27,000 residents located about 20 miles northeast of 
Tel Aviv. Her mother prayed for her and neighbors flocked to her 
home every evening to show support. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Jabara said, in a sign that Arab citizens are slowly being  
integrated into the Israeli mainstream, the primarily Jewish, 
left-wing Meretz Party, on whose slate she was elected, made 
getting an Arab woman into parliament a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Meretz was the only party competing in the elections to use a  
quota system under which four of the top 10 candidates on the slate 
had to be women. Meretz won 10 seats, with Jabara in 10th place. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the issues Jabara is pushing are longer school days so  
Arab women can work full-time if they choose and better education 
about birth control to increase women's freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	One of 15 children, Jabara believes that once education  
improves, the Arab community will become more open to expanding 
women's traditional roles. 
</P>
<P>
	While she has found a home in Meretz, the Arab political  
establishment has been slower to change. The three predominantly 
Arab parties have failed to elect a woman to a realistic slot on 
their party lists. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed Miari, a former lawmaker in the Arab National  
Democratic Alliance, warns that Jabara's victory should not be 
overrated. The advancement of Arab women, he said, was linked to 
that of Israel's Arab community as a whole, which, he contended, 
still faced widespread discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there has been a slow move toward integration of Israel's  
1 million Arab citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	An Arab woman from the mixed city of Haifa was crowned Miss  
Israel this spring and an Arab legislator made a bid for prime 
minister in last week's elections. Though dominated by Jewish 
candidates, the two largest political parties, Likud and Labor, 
brought three Arab lawmakers into parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Jabara said teaming up with Jewish parties was key because it  
gave Arab politicians a chance to sit in the government. While no 
predominantly Arab party has ever been asked to join a government, 
Meretz is expected to become a member of Prime Minister-elect Ehud 
Barak's new coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Meretz legislator Naomi Hazan said Jabara has her work  
cut out for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hussnia faces a tremendous responsibility because, until now,  
nobody has dealt with the interests of Arab women,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> eToys' Shares Quadruple in IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of eToys more than quadrupled on their  
first day of trading Thursday after the Internet toy merchant 
raised $166 million in a much-anticipated initial public offering. 
</P>
<P>
	The new stock was priced at $20 a share, but soared as high as  
$85 in midday trading. It closed at $76.56 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	While the IPO came amid some weakness in Internet stocks in  
recent weeks, the offering exceeded most expectations and signaled 
that Wall Street hasn't abandoned its interest in Internet issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1997, eToys has quickly become the leading toy  
retailer on the Internet, offering more than 9,000 toys, video 
games, children's books, music and baby products. Last year, sales 
were $30 million, compared with $700,000 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many Internet merchants, the Santa Monica, Calif.-based  
eToys has yet to make a profit, yet it continues to attract the 
attention of investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Toys R Us, the brick-and-mortar superstore which runs  
toysrus.com, has struggled to keep pace with eToys and is planning 
to revamp its Web site in the coming months to better compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``The toy business is one of the fastest growing online retail  
categories and eToys is leading the way,'' said Michael May, an 
analyst at the New York-based Internet research firm Jupiter 
Communications. ``Etoys is doing a great job building their 
business and capturing more wallet share from their customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jupiter predicts that online toy sales will reach $53 million in  
1999 and grow to $555 million by 2002. That's still only a fraction 
of the more than $21 billion in total annual toy and video game 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sold 8.32 million shares, or about an 8 percent  
stake. It plans to use the proceeds to expand its features and 
services and pay for more marketing and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the offering, demand was so strong for eToys' shares  
that the Santa Monica, Calif.-based company boosted the size of the 
IPO by 120,000 shares and also increased the price range from $10 
to $12 a share to $18 to $20 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``EToys has very, very smartly managed the development of the  
company over the last year and positioned themselves to be the 
children's center of the Internet,'' said Gail Bronson, an analyst 
with IPO Monitor. ``The key to a successful IPO, especially a 
dot.com IPO, is good marketing and branding.''

	NATO Bombs Said To Kill 19 People  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO bombed a Kosovo jail today,  
killing at least 19 people and injuring scores, Yugoslavia state 
media reported. A new tide of Kosovo refugees poured into Albania -- 
breaking a weeklong lull. Many in the wave of 2,500 spoke of Serb 
security forces banging on their doors and ordering them to 
immediately leave. President Slobodan Milosevic blamed the ``NATO 
aggressor'' for the mass exodus of hundreds of thousands of ethnic 
Albanians. After days of reports of mass desertions by Yugoslav 
army reservists, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said troops who 
showed up in two central Serbian towns this week were just 
``regular soldiers returning home'' as part of a reduction of Serb 
forces in Kosovo.

	Gunman Charged With Assault  
</P>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The teen-age suspect accused of opening fire  
on classmates was charged with aggravated assault today. Friends 
identified the gunman as Thomas Solomon Jr., nicknamed T.J. He must 
appear in juvenile court before he can be charged as an adult, 
something not expected before Monday. ``He kind of had a natural 
high, pulling the trigger ... like it was some kind of game to 
him,'' said student Jason Cheek, who was wounded in the leg, as he 
left the hospital.

	Trie Pleads Guilty to 2 Charges

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Presidential friend Charlie Trie  
pleaded guilty to two charges today and pledged to cooperate in an 
investigation of campaign fund-raising. In return, prosecutors 
dropped indictments pending against him in Washington and Arkansas. 
Under the deal, the restaurateur turned campaign fund-raiser -- who 
has been implicated in improper contributions from Chinese 
officials -- will be sentenced to probation.

<P>
	TROY, Mich. (AP) -- Kmart Corp. closed its suburban Detroit  
headquarters and sent 3,500 employees home early this afternoon 
after receiving two bomb threats, the nation's No. 3 retailer said. 
The first threat came in about 7:30 a.m. and the second shortly 
after noon, company spokesman Stephen Pagnani said. ``We did 
evacuate the building and are sending people home for the day,'' 
Pagnani said.

	Syria Ready for Talks With Israel  
</P>
<P>
	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syria told Israel's new prime minister  
today it was ready to resume peace talks and urged him to negotiate 
simultaneously with Lebanon. Official Syrian radio urged Israel's 
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak to deal with the Syrian and 
Lebanese peace talks as one since ``the two are unified.'' Syria 
has nearly 35,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is the major power broker 
in the country. The radio added that Syria was ready to restart 
peace negotiations with Israel where they left off in early 1996.

	Buyers Cautious About Online Food  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some of the Internet's elite, such as retailer  
Amazon.com and the founder of software pioneer Netscape, are 
betting big money that consumers will soon be salivating over the 
idea of buying everything from fresh tuna steaks to raisin bran 
online. Online grocery sales are still quite small, totaling just 
under $150 million last year, less than 1 percent of the more than 
$440 billion in total supermarket sales, according to Jupiter. 
While Jupiter expects sales to rise to more than $3.5 billion by 
2002, the market is developing slowly as Web grocers gear their 
businesses to the needs of individual communities.

big-name stocks, moved money into small-cap issues. The Dow Jones 
industrial average ended at 10,829.28 points, down 37.46. On the

assaulting two motorists, was granted parole today and is scheduled 
for release June 4. The Maryland Parole Commission voted 5-1 to 
grant the former heavyweight champion his release, contingent upon 
approval by Indiana authorities. The commission said it granted 
parole because it would guarantee that Tyson would be supervised 
upon his release. His jail term was to expire in September.

<HEADLINE> Fast Train Fund Finalists Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater is to  
announce next week that Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Atlanta and other 
cities will share $12 million for studies on trains that can travel 
up to 310 mph, an official says. 
</P>
<P>
	A ceremony is scheduled Monday at the B&AMP;O Railroad Museum in  
Baltimore. Seven projects among 11 applicants will be picked for 
further studies, and one of those will be selected next year for 
development and construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies will look into the feasibility of magnetic  
levitation technology, which already is being tested in Germany and 
Japan. The so-called ``maglev'' trains use electromagnets to lift 
the train above ground and free it of speed-reducing friction. 
</P>
<P>
	While critics say the concept is largely unproven from a  
revenue-producing standpoint, supporters believe the technology has 
potential given a strong commitment from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort got a boost last summer when President Clinton signed  
a transportation law that authorized $1 billion in federal money to 
explore and construct such a system. 
</P>
<P>
	A Federal Railroad Administration official, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, identified three of the selected projects 
Friday: 
</P>
<P>
	--A 40-mile system linking Baltimore and its airport with the  
main train station in Washington, D.C. The trip could take 16 
minutes, compared with 40 to 50 minutes by conventional rail. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 45-mile system linking Pittsburgh's airport in suburban  
Coraopolis with the city of Pittsburgh and its eastern suburbs. 
Proponents eventually want to extend the system to Philadelphia, 
creating a two-hour Pittsburgh-Philadelphia trip that now takes 
eight hours on Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 40-mile portion of the 110-mile Interstate 75 corridor  
between Atlanta and Chattanooga, Tenn. The system was proposed by 
Atlanta officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal official also said a fourth project would be in  
southern California, but did not specify which one. One proposal 
would link Las Vegas, Nev., with Anaheim, Calif. The other would 
connect the Los Angeles International Airport with March Air Force 
Base. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore Sun first reported on some projects in Friday's  
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining proposals would link Port Canaveral with the Space  
Coast Regional Airport in Titusville, Fla.; Denver International 
Airport and Eagle County Regional Airport in Colorado; Hampton 
Roads and Richmond, Va., with Washington, D.C.; New Orleans with 
Houston; Birmingham, Ala. with Atlanta; and Huntsville and Decatur, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Maglev runs on basic magnetic principles: When two magnets are  
put together, opposite poles attract, similar ones repel. Either 
magnetic attraction or repulsion can be used to lift or push the 
car above the guideway. In both cases, the train moves as the 
magnetic field travels along the guideway.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs $15B Kosovo-Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today signed a bill  
providing $15 billion for the air assault on Yugoslavia, aid for 
disaster victims, farm aid and other programs. But he cautioned 
Congress that veto battles over budget bills may lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Capping three months of wrangling, lawmakers sent Clinton the  
Kosovo legislation Thursday on a 64-36 Senate vote. The House 
approved the measure on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed it despite reservations about extraneous items  
added by lawmakers, citing its funds for the U.S. military, farmers 
and residents of Central American nations still struggling to 
recover from last autumn's devastating Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a real emergency here,'' White House press secretary  
Joe Lockhart said today. ``The president believes it's unfortunate 
that Congress has sent down legislation that isn't clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement after the vote, Clinton said Thursday  
that he opposed congressional provisions ``that reward special 
interests, weaken environmental protection and undermine our 
campaign to stop teen smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``I call on Congress to end these stealth attempts to  
weaken environmental and public health protections. I have vetoed 
bills in the past because they contained anti-environmental riders 
and, if necessary, am fully prepared to do so again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also criticized a provision forbidding the federal  
government from claiming any of the $246 billion the states have 
won from tobacco companies in a legal settlement. Clinton wanted to 
use some of that money for health care and anti-smoking 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nation's governors, who wanted to keep the money from  
going to Washington, were jubilant. 
</P>
<P>
	``States now have the certainty and flexibility to meet the  
health and welfare needs of the citizens in their own states,'' 
said the chairmen of the National Governors' Association, 
Republican Michael Leavitt of Utah and Democrat Thomas Carper of 
Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans voted for the bill 32-23, with many of the  
most conservative members voting against it. Democrats supported it 
by 32-13, with opponents citing excessive spending or objectionable 
environmental amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	In a split at the top of the GOP hierarchy, the measure was  
supported by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, but 
opposed by Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the No. 2 Senate 
Republican and a leader of the chamber's conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives criticized the package because it is stuffed with  
local provisions that they said were hardly the emergencies the 
bill proclaims them to be. These included $250,000 to help 
revitalize a downtown Los Angeles neighborhood; $2 million to 
intensify security at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in 
Washington; and increased federal payments to some Northwestern 
wheat farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The freight train has stowaways hidden all the way through,''  
said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	They also complained that all but $2 billion of the measure's  
price tag would be paid with this year's federal surplus, which 
comes completely from Social Security -- money Republicans had 
pledged to leave alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders focused on the bill's $12 billion -- double Clinton's  
request -- for the conflict with Yugoslavia, the Kosovo Albanian 
refugees, Balkan countries near the fighting and U.S. forces around 
the globe. They said rejecting the package would hurt American 
troops in combat -- something few lawmakers want to be accused of 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think for one minute that I'd vote not to give them the  
equipment they need?'' Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said of 
U.S. troops. ``It would be unthinkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reluctance of senators to block the package was underscored  
when an effort by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, to pay for more of the 
bill by cutting most domestic programs failed, 70-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's Senate vote marked the culmination of a process that  
began in February, when Clinton asked Congress for nearly $1 
billion to help Central American and Caribbean nations recover from 
last fall's two deadly hurricanes, Mitch and Georges. 
</P>
<P>
	As the measure moved through Congress, it picked up $900 million  
so the government could help victims of this month's killer 
tornadoes in the Midwest and be prepared for other natural 
disasters yet to come. The bill also has $574 million to help 
American farmers, mainly those facing low prices for hogs, wheat 
and other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	In defeats for the environmental lobby, the measure also has  
language delaying tighter restrictions on mining companies that use 
government lands. Higher royalties on oil companies that drill on 
federal property would be postponed.

<HEADLINE>  Italy Fears New Political Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- A briefcase lying on a bloodied sidewalk. A grieving  
widow. A commando communique. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing of a labor official, claimed by the militant Red  
Brigades, terrifies Italians, who worried Friday about a possible 
return to the political violence that marked the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is, why now?  
</P>
<P>
	Italy's economy and government are remarkably stable after years  
of turmoil. But government attempts to bolster the economy by 
winning concessions from labor and its backing of NATO's air 
campaign in Yugoslavia have been denounced by the far left. 
</P>
<P>
	Both issues figured in the 28-page manifesto left by the Red  
Brigades in a trash bin in Rome claiming Thursday's slaying of 
Massimo D'Antona, who was shot repeatedly in the heart as he walked 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
	At D'Antona's funeral Friday, Italian leaders vowed there would  
be no replay of the ``years of lead,'' when assassinations and 
bombings by terrorists from the far left and right terrified the 
country in the 1970s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever did the shooting shouldn't fool themselves,''  
D'Antona's boss, Labor Minister Antonio Bassolino, told the funeral 
congregation. ``We haven't gone back 20 years. Italy wants to go 
ahead with new social and labor rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Antona, he said, was a man ``ready for dialogue, a leftist and  
a reformist. That's why he was struck down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Italy's Cabinet approved an employment package that  
D'Antona had finished just hours before his death. 
</P>
<P>
	A university professor in labor law, D'Antona was a chief  
architect of labor reforms that included an agreement by industry 
and unions to create more jobs by encouraging part-time work. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy has also been enjoying a rare show of cooperation between  
the center-left government and the center-right opposition, 
including on electoral reforms aimed at bringing Rome more in line 
with the rest of Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides were also cooperating in Italy's participation in the  
NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia, which has made extensive use of 
Italian air bases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Brigades' most notorious attack, in 1978, struck at  
another figure of cooperation -- former Premier Aldo Moro, who, just 
before his kidnapping and killing, brokered the ``historic 
compromise'' in which Communists pledged to work together in 
Parliament with the Christian Democrat-dominated coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Two decades later, that accord helped pave the way for the  
appointment of the country's first former Communist premier, 
Massimo D'Alema. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants' goal during their bloody campaign in the 1970s  
was nothing short of destruction of the Italian state and anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the latest attack, D'Alema said: ``We don't want to  
underestimate their message and intent to destabilize our country 
in this delicate moment. But this is a country that will not let 
itself be sent backward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Antona's killing came 11 years after the Red Brigades' last  
claimed assassination, that of a senator, and six years after its 
last claimed act of violence, a bombing at the U.S. air base at 
Aviano, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	In Parliament on Wednesday, the opposition helped D'Alema beat  
back an attempt by some in his government to urge a unilateral 
cease-fire in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	And last week, the center-left and the opposition pulled  
together to elect the nation's president in a first-round vote -- 
only the third time in Italy's postwar history that has happened. 
The new head of state, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, a political 
independent, is a staunch backer of political reform. 
</P>
<P>
	In its manifesto claiming D'Antona's killing, the Red Brigades  
vowed to ``attack and dismantle ... the imperialist state'' and 
target NATO for its ``imperialist war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Antona had been targeted as a shaper of ``neo-corporate  
politics,'' the manifesto said, using the Marxist language of 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A crackdown after Moro's death and the end of the Cold War  
helped cool the guns and passions of the old Red Brigades. The last 
imprisoned major leader, Renato Curcio, a Brigades founder, won 
release last October after 24 years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many Red Brigades members were never captured, with  
many believed to be living abroad.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Golfer Says He'll Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- A local golf pro who lost his court  
battle with the U.S. Golf Association said today he'll still play 
in a local qualifier for the U.S. Open despite a judge's ruling 
barring him from using a cart. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Olinger, who has a degenerative hip disorder that makes  
walking 18 holes nearly impossible, said he would consult with his 
doctors before playing Monday at the South Bend Country Club. 
Unless they tell him that he risks serious injury by playing, he'll 
be there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to go out and commit suicide,'' Olinger said.  
``If everything goes well, you're going to see me at 10:10 (a.m.) 
at the South Bend Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's what the USGA wants, that's what the USGA is going  
to get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olinger sued the USGA under the Americans with Disabilities Act  
seeking a permanent injunction allowing him to ride in qualifiers 
for the Open. But U.S. District Judge Robert Miller ruled such an 
accommodation would fundamentally alter the nature of the 
tournament and denied the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Olinger, a golf pro in Warsaw, successfully sued the USGA last  
year to use a cart in a local qualifier in a similar suit. Though 
he was allowed to ride, he shot a 12-over-par 83 and did not 
qualify for the sectional. 
</P>
<P>
	What remains to be seen now is whether Miller's decision will  
eventually affect Casey Martin, who has a circulatory disorder in 
his right leg that makes it painful for him to walk long distances. 
</P>
<P>
	He successfully sued the PGA to use a court on tour, and the PGA  
has appealed the decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
The USGA has agreed to allow him to ride while the suit is under 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	USGA spokesman Marty Parkes said the association hasn't analyzed  
the implications of Miller's decision yet, but he reiterated that 
Martin would be allowed to ride in this year's Open. Still, the 
association now has a trial judge's decision backing up their 
contention that carts represent an unfair advantage, and Parkes 
said the USGA's executive committee will discuss its options at its 
meeting during the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing that says there's going to be a decision out  
of that meeting right away, but it certainly will be discussed,'' 
Parkes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parkes said the USGA made the exception for Martin in deference  
to his suit against the PGA. Still, Olinger said he was frustrated 
by the USGA's decision to allow Martin to ride while fighting him 
in court on his request. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's another guy going on a cart, and it's not me,'' he  
said. ``I don't know how they justify him getting a cart and me 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, John Hamilton, said Olinger has 30 days to appeal  
the judge's decision, but he's unsure whether Olinger will have the 
funds to pursue an appeal.

<HEADLINE> L.L. Bean To Expand Retail Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEPORT, Maine (AP) -- Mail-order company L.L. Bean plans to  
open its first major U.S. store outside Maine, the first step 
toward expanding its domestic retail presence beyond the 24-hour 
store that Leon Leonwood Bean opened 87 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The new location, in the Tysons Corner Center mall in McLean,  
Va., is part of the company's strategy for boosting profits in an 
era of ever-increasing competition in its core mail-order business. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Gorman, president and grandson of L.L. Bean, said the  
outdoors outfitter is up to the challenge of the suburban shopping 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is worried about The Gap, but we've got a unique  
niche and we have a good opportunity,'' he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, L.L. Bean plans to build at least three stores by 2001  
to test the retail waters, said Bill Shea, L.L. Bean's top retail 
executive. Those are in addition to the main store in Freeport, 10 
smaller outlet stores in four states and 16 stores in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, whose sales have hovered around $1 billion for the  
past four years, hopes the new stores will boost brand identity 
while increasing sales of camping gear, fishing gear, bicycles, 
kayaks and canoes -- all things that people might want to see or 
feel before buying. 
</P>
<P>
	The company hopes to maintain an outdoors theme similar to its  
Freeport store, so the 75,000-square-foot Tysons Corner store, 
which is expected to open by July 2000, will feature a stream, 
waterfall and indoor trout pond, Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Strategic Retail, a marketing  
and retail consultant in New York, said it's important for L.L. 
Bean to seek new markets and introduce trendier clothing lines to 
attract new customers. But she said it's important for the company 
to move slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a noble thing for them to do, but it's fraught with a lot  
of challenges for a company that isn't traditionally in the retail 
business and the fashion business,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The location was chosen because there are 1.4 million L.L. Bean  
catalog customers living in the area and because the mall attracts 
21 million visitors a year. Also, Great Falls National Park on the 
Potomac River is 10 miles away and the Appalachian Trail is 75 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	L.L. Bean workers will teach outdoor skills like fly casting,  
kayaking and canoeing the same way it does through its Outdoors 
Discovery Program in Freeport, Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other stores planned by L.L. Bean will be smaller -- about  
30,000 square feet -- and won't necessarily be located in malls. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to introduce the company to new customers as well as  
serve current customers, providing another avenue for profits in an 
era where homes are flooded with mail-order catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	About 85 percent of L.L. Bean's revenues currently come from  
catalog sales, 10 percent from retail sales and 5 percent over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorman is optimistic the retail-stores experiment will work.  
``We don't see it as a risk because we believe it will be received 
enthusiastically. We'd look silly if it flops, but it won't.''

<HEADLINE> Knievel Jumps Grand Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND CANYON WEST, Ariz. (AP) -- Robbie Knievel had room to  
spare. 
</P>
<P>
	The motorcycle daredevil easily cleared a sliver of the Grand  
Canyon on Thursday, traveling 228 feet to break his own world 
record by 5 feet. Fireworks erupted and a crowd of several hundred 
cheered as he soared over the 200-foot-wide gorge at 90 mph on an 
ordinary 500cc motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
	If he failed, Knievel risked plunging 2,500 feet to the canyon  
floor on the Hualapai Indian Reservation, west of Grand Canyon 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel, 37, wiped out in a cloud of dust after the jump, but  
didn't appear to have suffered any serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm wiped out in the head a little,'' Knievel said.  
</P>
<P>
	The jump was televised live by Fox on the East Coast for  
tape-delay airing later in the rest of the country. Knievel's 
previous record was set in Panama City, Fla., in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel was going to attempt the same jump on April 29 but it  
was canceled at the last minute because of wind and cold. Knievel 
said his daredevil father, Evel Knievel -- recovering from a recent 
liver transplant -- had wanted to jump the Grand Canyon but never 
got the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Knievel achieved notoriety in April 1989 by jumping  
the fountains at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, a stunt that nearly 
killed his father 21 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel would not say how much Fox paid him.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about one of the seven wonders of the world,  
and I want to do it,'' Knievel said earlier this week. ``Everyone 
has a calling, has to make a living. I'm not trying to kill 
myself.''

<HEADLINE> Feds To Study Olympics Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Congressional investigators examining Atlanta's  
bid for the 1996 Olympics will be in Georgia next month to go 
through many of the records of the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation holds about 1,400 boxes  
of records that detail the committee's enticements to IOC members 
from 1988 to 1990, when Atlanta was awarded the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation has agreed to give the U.S. House Commerce  
Committee access to the records, even though the foundation is 
battling The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in court to keep them 
from being released publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Echols, a GAAF spokesman, said today the House committee has  
not determined how many of the records will be examined or how long 
the process will take. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know what the inquiry's schedule is at this point,''  
Echols said. ``We are cooperating fully with the committee and will 
do whatever is necessary to do this review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee wants to determine if the boxes of records contain  
evidence of bribery similar to the scandal that has tainted Salt 
Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Companies Suing Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two tobacco companies filed federal lawsuits today  
challenging a first-in-the-nation attempt by the Massachusetts 
attorney general to restrict tobacco advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Porter, an assistant attorney general, said lawsuits were  
filed by Philip Morris Cos. and Lorillard Tobacco Co., claiming 
that the restrictions on cigarette advertising violated the First 
Amendment and were pre-empted by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, Porter said he had been told by an industry  
attorney that lawsuits were forthcoming from R.J. Reynolds Tobacco 
Co. and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., the other two largest 
cigarette makers in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attorney general intends vigorously to defend these cases  
and is firmly of the view that these regulations are lawful,'' 
Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two provisions of the regulations being challenged by Philip  
Morris would ban outdoor advertising of tobacco products near 
schools and playgrounds and ban advertising for tobacco products 
near schools inside retail stores if they're visible from outside. 
The regulations are to go into effect in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris spokesman Brendan McCormick said the company  
challenged sections of the consumer regulations ``which we feel 
unduly restrict our right to market our products to adults who 
choose to smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCormick insisted that Philip Morris wanted to combat youth  
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue of youth smoking is one where we're all on the same  
page. Philip Morris stands willing to work with anyone who shares 
the goal of reducing the incidence of youth smoking,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left for Lorillard attorney Richard Zielinski wasn't  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts was one of 46 states that reached a settlement  
with tobacco companies to resolve claims for the costs of treating 
sick smokers.

<HEADLINE> Deal Struck in Charlie Trie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Presidential friend Yah Lin ``Charlie''  
Trie, the restaurateur turned political fund-raiser implicated in 
improper contributions from Chinese officials, today reached a plea 
agreement on an obstruction of justice charge against him, a 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor George Vein confirmed today that a deal has been  
struck. Details were withheld pending an announcement in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie's trial began Monday. He was accused of obstructing justice  
by ordering an employee to destroy documents subpoenaed in 1997 by 
a federal grand jury and by the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee. The charges carry a penalty of up to five years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces separate charges in Washington that he made and  
arranged illegal contributions from foreigners to the Democratic 
National Committee. Trie is accused of making the contributions to 
buy access to Clinton and other top officials for himself and the 
likes of Chinese arms dealer Wang Jun. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee has returned $640,000 that  
Trie raised. President Clinton's legal defense fund has returned 
another $460,000 raised by Trie. 
</P>
<P>
	He became friends with then-Gov. Clinton when Clinton frequented  
a Chinese restaurant Trie owned near the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had expected to wrap up their case today.  
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, testimony was suspended and jurors were sent home  
while lawyers for the prosecution and the defense wrangled over 
what documents the defense should be allowed to present as 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers say thousands of documents were provided to  
congressional investigators, making Trie's business and 
fund-raising activities an open book. 
</P>
<P>
	But Maria Mapili, who managed his office here, testified that  
Trie ordered her to get rid of documents that the Senate panel 
sought in its probe. She said she threw out some papers but hid 
others that were later seized or turned over to the grand jury.

<HEADLINE> Profile of Georgia School Gunman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The 15-year-old sophomore accused of opening  
fire on his classmates had talked about shooting people at school 
and showed off the guns his stepfather kept in the basement of his 
home, friends say. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have been saying he's been wanting to do this all year  
long,'' said 15-year-old Katie Bir, a freshman at Heritage High 
School in suburban Atlanta and a friend of the gunman's 
ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, identified by students as Thomas Solomon, lives  
with his mother, stepfather and 13-year-old sister at the end of a 
cul-de-sac of $275,000-plus homes with manicured lawns. His 
two-story brick house is nestled on a large, wooded lot with a 
basketball goal sitting at the end of a winding driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	One other thing about the house stood out to those who knew the  
teen-ager -- ``lots of guns'' in the basement, said sophomore Chris 
Dunn, a friend of Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed them to me and my brother one time. I don't know  
much about guns, but I think they were like, hunting guns,'' said 
15-year-old Brad Morgan, who lives two houses away from the suspect 
and who rode the bus with him each day to school. 
</P>
<P>
	Six students were wounded in Thursday's school shooting, but  
none of the injuries were life-threatening. It was unknown whether 
the family's guns were the two used in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and neighbors said the teen-ager was involved in the Boy  
Scouts and liked to play video games, including the violent 
``Mortal Kombat.'' He was described as a quiet boy with a few close 
friends and had attended a youth service at the Catholic church his 
family attends the night before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty quiet, but around me and other people he would  
laugh and joke around,'' Dunn said. He said he never heard the 
suspect mention plans to shoot anyone at school. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were people that really kept to themselves,'' said Brad  
Morgan's father, Allan, who sometimes drove the suspect to summer 
school last year in the neighborhood car pool. ``He was a quiet 
kid, but I just chalked it up to him being shy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some said his grades had slipped recently and his heart was  
broken after his girlfriend of nearly a year dumped him this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't even trying anymore, which I was kind of concerned  
about,'' Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friend and classmate Nathaniel Deeter, 15, said the suspect was  
``really upset'' about the breakup. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I have no reason to live anymore.' And I told him he  
was crazy. I thought he was just feeling sorry for himself because 
a lot of kids feel like that,'' Deeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, reporters swarmed the one-street subdivision and  
detectives searched the boy's home, carrying boxes in and out. 
</P>
<P>
	The family moved two years ago to this east Atlanta suburb from  
Kernersville, N.C. The boy's mother, Mae Dean Daniele, works as a 
secretary for a veterinarian. The stepfather, Robert Daniele, is a 
trucking executive. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend of the suspect, 16-year-old Glen Ganyard III, told The  
Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Solomon had recently received a 
handgun as a gift from his parents, but they took it away when they 
learned he was carrying the gun around. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he knew where it was hidden,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Starr's Aide Urges Hubbell Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Urging reinstatement of a criminal charge  
against Webster Hubbell, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office 
argued in federal appeals court Friday that the indictment details 
dozens of alleged lies by the presidential friend. 
</P>
<P>
	In throwing out one of 15 charges against Hubbell, a judge had  
declared that some language in the indictment was too vague. 
Hubbell is accused of concealing from federal banking regulators 
work that he and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had done for a 
fraudulent Arkansas land development when both were attorneys in 
Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig argued to a three-judge panel that  
Hubbell repeatedly lied over a six-year span to federal regulators, 
and that amounted to a ``scheme, a pattern of conduct'' that is 
spelled out in the first 85 paragraphs of the indictment against 
Mrs. Clinton's former law partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Peter Romatowski said the language in the  
dismissed charge is so broadly worded that Hubbell doesn't know 
what the specific allegations are. 
</P>
<P>
	``How is a jury to be instructed? ... Are they to be turned  
loose on 85 paragraphs?'' asked Romatowski. 
</P>
<P>
	Appeals judge Stephen Williams, a Republican appointee to the  
court, suggested the dropped count may be so lengthy because of 
extensive evidence of wrongdoing by Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is it the government's fault if evidence suggests 1,000''  
acts ``by which the scheme has been carried out?'' asked Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Challenged to counter the argument that the indictment was too  
vague, Rosenzweig pointed to language that details 50 separate 
alleged lies by Hubbell to the Resolution Trust Corp. and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams heard the arguments along with appeals court judges  
Laurence Silberman, a Republican appointee, and David Tatel, a 
Clinton appointee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell is scheduled to go on trial Aug. 9.  
</P>
<P>
	In a related case, Hubbell pleaded guilty in 1994 to stealing  
hundreds of thousands of dollars from his law firm and its clients. 
He served a year and a half in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has testified repeatedly that she remembers almost  
nothing of her work on the Castle Grande development, which was 
owned by her Whitewater partner Jim McDougal and Hubbell's 
father-in-law, Seth Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators said the development was riddled with insider dealing  
and fictitious sales.

	The greenback had gained early today following remarks from U.S.  
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that the United States had no 
intention to use its currency as a trade policy tool. The remark 
indicated the government had no plans to make American exports 
cheaper by undermining the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar quickly met stiff selling by U.S. banks, some  
large Asian players and large Japanese brokerages seeking to lock 
in profits, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 123.63 yen and 124.60 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei 225 briefly dropped below 16,000  
for the first time since April 1. But with the index down more than 
6 percent from a high set on May 6, further downside risk was 
limited, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 16,000 level provides a very good opportunity for domestic  
institutional investors to start new investment for this fiscal 
year,'' said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, players don't expect a quick rebound in share  
prices either, especially since the U.S. Federal Reserve's hint at 
an interest rate hike has cooled off the action on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 565.65 million shares, up from 550.36 million shares 
Thursday. Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 613 to 585, while 
114 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors bought shares on dips after the Nikkei average  
closed below 17,000 points Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips were mixed. TDK, Tokyo Electron, Kyocera, Honda,  
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and Fuji Photo were weaker, while 
Sony, NEC, Toyota and Bridgestone were up. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in banks and brokerages are generally higher after recent  
declines. Major commercial banks will announce earnings results 
later today. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.17 yen, down  
from 132.44 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.345 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.295 percent,

<HEADLINE> Watch for Currency-Exchange Fees / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Overseas travel may be more expensive for some  
vacationers this summer because of a hike in fees from credit card 
issuers. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of the biggest credit card issuers have added or plan  
to add surcharges on consumer purchases made overseas using Visa, 
MasterCard and American Express, and several others are considering 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fees -- assessed per transaction after a currency is  
converted to dollars -- run between 1 percent and 4 percent. That's 
in addition to the traditional 1 percent currency-exchange fee. 
</P>
<P>
	That 1 percent fee on credit and charge cards has long been  
considered a bargain among travelers since it's a wholesale rate, 
or the same exchange rate awarded to big financial institutions, 
and typically about 5 percent better than the retail rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's a pretty small group (of issuers involved).  
But it has a pretty broad reach -- about a quarter of the market,'' 
said Robert B. McKinley, president of CardWeb.com Inc., a credit 
card research firm based in Frederick, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the issuers involved: Providian Financial began adding a 4  
percent fee last summer, Citibank added a 2 percent surcharge 
starting in November, and American Express will increase its 
transaction fee to 2 percent from 1 percent on June 15. First USA 
Bank, the world's largest card issuer, had planned to add a 2 
percent currency-exchange surcharge on April 1, but backed off on 
those plans just days before. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that they backed off on it ... is a good sign,''  
McKinley said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he and other consumer advocates worry that added  
currency-exchange fees will become the norm in an industry that has 
been trying to maximize fee income because intense competition and 
prevailing low interest rates have been squeezing profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issuers are leaving no stone unturned in their effort to  
capture consumer fee income,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive 
director of the Washington-based Consumer Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenders contend that the latest fees are a necessary part of  
doing business, as well as a way to offset losses from bad debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are administrative costs and foreign exchange risks  
associated with the millions of transactions in all the foreign 
markets that we deal with,'' said Judy Tenzer, a spokeswoman for 
American Express. 
</P>
<P>
	She defended her company's decision, saying that the new  
currency-exchange rate ``is still a very efficient rate for people 
who may be used to getting money at airports or hotels or foreign 
exchange offices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, consumer groups say credit cards are still a good  
way for travelers to spend money abroad. They're safer than 
carrying cash, plus users get the same purchase protection overseas 
as they do in the United States, which means they can dispute 
questionable charges and temporarily withhold payment if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	As the summer vacation season approaches, consumer groups  
suggest foreign-bound individuals use a credit card from an issuer 
that doesn't impose the extra surcharge. And there are still plenty 
of them around, like Diners Club International, which imposes the 
traditional 1 percent conversion fee.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week mixed  
Friday, with the key index rising in Tokyo on bargain-hunting but 
falling in Hong Kong on fears of a rise in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained  
92.99 points, or 0.57 percent, to finish the day at 16,292.98. On 
Thursday, the average closed up 71.81 points, or 0.44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei briefly dropped below 16,000 for the first time since  
April 1. But with the index down more than 6 percent from a high 
set on May 6, further downside risk was limited, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 16,000 level provides a very good opportunity for domestic  
institutional investors to start new investment for this fiscal 
year,'' said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, players don't expect a quick rebound in share  
prices either, especially since the U.S. Federal Reserve's hint at 
an interest rate hike has cooled off the action on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar slipped against the yen after early  
gains, falling to 123.76, 0.72 yen below its level late Thursday in 
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 124.40 overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stock prices fell for a third straight session as  
investors continued to worry about a possible rise in local 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 103.28 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 
12,272.14. On Thursday, the index had slipped 27.72 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said concerns about a hike in local interest rates has  
cast a shadow over the Hong Kong market after the U.S. Federal 
Reserve hinted earlier this week of a possible rise in U.S. 
interest rates in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Any change in U.S. rates usually leads to a similar move in Hong  
Kong because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed flat as investors gave a cool  
reception to encouraging, but widely expected, trade and industrial 
data that was announced midway through the session. The market's 
key Weighted Stock Price Index slipped 2.19 points to 7,606.69. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, boosted by a  
sharp rise in market heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. 
The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 13.70 points, 0.6 percent, to 
2,148.84. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher as expectations of a  
healthy first quarter economic performance prompted bargain-hunting 
after two sessions of heavy losses. The 30-company Philippine Stock 
Exchange Index (PSE Index) rose 7.93 points, or 0.3 percent, to 
2,377.13. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian share market closed slightly lower. The  
All Ordinaries Index slipped 1.9 points, or 0.06 percent, to 
2,950.7. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed slightly higher on a technical  
rebound following recent sharp losses. The Korea Composite Stock 
Price Index rose 1.89 points, or 0.2 percent, to 710.49. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly higher as buying in  
selective blue chips supported the index, dealers said. The Straits 
Times Index rose 1.4 percent, or 26.41 points, to 1953.30. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed mostly higher, but the  
index fell because of falls in blue-chip stocks. The Composite 
Index, which tracks 100 key stocks, closed at 769.79, down 9.83 
points, or 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed mixed. The Composite  
Index fell 2.389 points, or 0.4 percent, to 519.664. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed little changed. The Thailand  
SET Index slipped 0.27 points to 479.33.

<HEADLINE>  Carr Not the Show on De La Hoya Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya could probably take it easy  
tomorrow night, box Oba Carr for 12 rounds and add another $5 
million to his already fat bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	With a megafight set with fellow welterweight champion Felix  
Trinidad and other big bouts ahead, it would seem the prudent thing 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, however, is in no mood to be prudent.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not boxing anymore. I'm going back to fighting, to the old  
school way,'' De La Hoya said. ``I'm going to walk through guys and 
destroy them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could be bad news for Carr, a decent enough fighter but a  
10-1 underdog when he challenges De La Hoya for the WBC 147-pound 
title in the scheduled 12-round bout at the Mandalay Bay resort. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would please De La Hoya's fans, who may have been  
disappointed in the cautious way he fought Ike Quartey his last 
time out and the fact that four of his last eight fights have gone 
the 12-round distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee you there is no fighter in the world who can take  
my punch and last 12 rounds,'' De La Hoya said. ``So what am I 
doing boxing people? I should be going out there and destroying 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya doesn't need to knock Carr out to guarantee a Sept.  
18 fight with Trinidad that will pay him $15 million. He simply 
needs to beat Carr for the fight, which was finalized Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But De La Hoya says he has a reborn desire to punch people out.  
It came to him just during training camp when he woke up one 
morning about five weeks ago and decided that he should return to 
the form in which he knocked out 20 of his first 22 opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	A parade of different trainers, he said, had changed his style  
by convincing him that he was getting hit too much and should try 
to box more in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided to listen to myself and do what I want in the  
ring,'' De La Hoya said. ``My passion is fighting and I wasn't 
happy doing the things I was doing against (Pernell) Whitaker, 
Quartey and the others. I'm not a boxer, I'm a fighter. I'm a 
slugger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya said his transformation from boxer back to puncher  
began the same day of his revelation in his training camp in the 
mountains of Big Bear, Calif. He went into the ring and began 
backing his sparring partners up and punishing them instead of 
looking for angles and trying to block punches. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, says trainer Roberto Alcazar, have been nothing  
short of spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 100 percent different,'' Alcazar said. ``He's happy and  
he's hurting people in the ring. He's the old Oscar like he was 
when he first started out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya may be fortunate he's got a chance to test out his  
new theory of fighting against Carr instead of a ferocious puncher 
the likes of Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters weighed in Friday at the class limit of 147  
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr is capable enough and certainly no pushover. He's 48-2-1  
with 28 knockouts and his only two losses were to Trinidad and 
Quartey, both of whom he knocked down before being beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carr has had both sides of his jaw broken in his last two  
fights, and the Detroit fighter will be getting a bigger and 
stronger opponent. Carr had his jaw wired for weeks and was on a 
liquid diet after winning a Feb. 22 elimination fight against 
Frankie Randall to qualify for the De La Hoya fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oba Carr is a dangerous opponent and he'll be ready to  
fight,'' said De La Hoya, 30-0 with 24 knockouts. ``When I fight an 
opponent, they lift themselves up to the sky. They all want to be 
the first to beat Oscar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight with Carr, which will be televised by HBO beginning  
around 11:30 p.m. EDT, has been largely overshadowed by 
negotiations between rival promoters Bob Arum and Don King over a 
Sept. 18 fight between De La Hoya and Trinidad, who holds the IBF 
version of the welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Bob Arum said Friday that De La Hoya will receive $15  
million and Trinidad's camp will get $10.5 million for the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two fighters have to win, that's the main thing,'' Arum  
said. ``Other than that, it's a done deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carr would love nothing better than to disrupt the carefully  
laid plans of De La Hoya and his promoter. The 27-year-old, who 
will make $350,000, sees himself as part of a welterweight series 
that could include a number of fights between the likes of himself, 
De La Hoya, Quartey and Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trinidad and Oscar is an attractive fight,'' Carr conceded.  
``People want to see that fight. But in the future they're going to 
want to see Oba Carr and Trinidad and Oba Carr and De La Hoya in a 
rematch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the card is a second title fight, with Floyd Mayweather  
defending his WBC super featherweight title against Justin Juuko, a 
Ugandan living in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the third defense of the title for Mayweather, a 1996  
Olympian who is 20-0 as a pro. He was supposed to have fought Goyo 
Vargas, but Vargas became sick in training camp and pulled out at 
the last minute.

<HEADLINE> Va. Health Facility Blamed in Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Shoddy medical care and poor communication  
between nurses and doctors were to blame for the death of a patient 
at a state-run mental health institute, two confidential reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Skander Najar died June 8 from an inflamed, bleeding pancreas  
while he was a patient at the Northern Virginia Mental Health 
Institute. Two days earlier, he was vomiting and showing other 
symptoms, but nurses' notes show the on-call doctor who was 
notified put off seeing him until the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Najar, 26, didn't receive emergency treatment until his mother,  
Hanni Najar, arranged his transfer to neighboring Fairfax Hospital 
at a nurse's urging, an internal report by the institute said. The 
Associated Press obtained a copy of the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairfax Hospital staff fought for 24 hours to save Najar, but  
couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The internal investigation said Najar's death was caused by  
human error, specifically ``inadequate physical assessment, 
documentation and communication of the patient's changing clinical 
condition'' by the institute's medical staff. It said nurses 
believed they would be yelled at by on-call physicians who believed 
they were receiving too many calls. 
</P>
<P>
	A consultant for the state attorney general's office drew  
similar conclusions in a separate review. ``The information in the 
record indicates that on on-call M.D. should have ensured immediate 
medical evaluation,'' the consultant, psychiatry professor 
Catherine A. Leslie, wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department has been investigating negligence,  
abuse and deaths of patients in Virginia's public mental 
institutions since 1990, and the Northern Virginia institute is 
still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the psychiatrists at the institute, including the  
on-call doctor, lost their jobs after Najar's death. The institute 
has adopted policies to improve basic patient care and staff 
communication that include having an on-site doctor 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week, and the state mental health system has been 
overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Najar said the reports confirmed her fears about her son's  
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had already come to the conclusion that there were problems  
at the institute, but I wasn't fully aware of the extent of the 
problems,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Sign Staley To Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles have their franchise  
running back, and his name is not Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles signed Duce Staley to a six-year, $16.3 million  
contract extension today, a month after picking quarterback Donovan 
McNabb instead of Williams with the No. 2 pick in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal keeps Staley in Philadelphia through the 2004 season,  
and he could make an additional $2 million in incentives. He rushed 
for 1,065 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's more than what I thought I was getting here, and I  
thought I was getting a lot,'' Eagles coach Andy Reid said. ``We 
are counting on Duce and we tried to show that by signing him to 
this contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Ricky Watters signed with Seattle as a free agent, Staley  
won the Eagles' starting job last season from injury-plagued 
Charlie Garner, who was released last month. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Eagles secured the No. 2 draft pick with a 3-13 season,  
fans began a loud campaign for the team to choose Williams, the 
Heisman Trophy winner from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Council even voted on a resolution for the team to pick  
Williams; it was stymied by council members who realized there were 
better things to do. Mayor Edward Rendell urged fans to call the 
Eagles offices and lobby for Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid and Tom Modrak, director of football operations, chose  
McNabb instead -- partly because of Staley's breakthrough season as 
a featured back. In addition to becoming a 1,000-yard rusher, 
Staley added 432 yards receiving on a team-high 57 catches and six 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Staley, a third-round pick by the Eagles in 1997 from South  
Carolina, could have become a restricted free agent after this 
season. He resisted the lure of testing the market, partly because 
of what he remembered about Watters' heated contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to go into the year thinking about money,  
thinking about myself,'' Staley said. ``I felt I would be cheating 
the team, thinking about all the money I could be chasing. I can't 
live for tomorrow. I can only live for today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Eagles drafted me, so I feel dedicated to them like they  
are dedicated to me. They gave me my first shot so I thought it was 
only right as far as returning the favor.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	AVONDALE, Pa. (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus took a moment to recall the  
days when he was young and greedy, a time when he felt he could do 
anything on a golf course and pushed his body to give him what he 
demanded. 
</P>
<P>
	His gait was much quicker, his hair shinier and closer to the  
color of sand in a bunker. Nicklaus felt invincible back then, and 
he believes that is part of the reason he now must step gingerly 
into a sand trap, steadying a 59-year-old body that is now partly 
supported by a ceramic left hip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that my hip problem and the early aging resulted  
basically because of cortisone injections,'' said Nicklaus, who 
returns to competitive golf today for the first time in nearly a 
year. ``I had 25 of them in a 10-week period when I was 23 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wouldn't do that any more, but that's what they used to  
do in those days. A lot of my back problems, I think, came from 
cortisone. By the time I was 19, I'd had my back injected in seven 
different places and some of them repeatedly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is nothing Nicklaus can do about it now, except what he  
has always done. Play golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Warming up for his first tournament since having his left hip  
replaced in January, Nicklaus shot an even-par 72 Thursday in a 
pro-am round just four months after the experimental operation. 
Teeing off today in the Senior PGA Bell Atlantic Classic, Nicklaus 
ends a 299-day layoff -- his longest since turning professional in 
1961. He last played in the U.S. Senior Open on July 26, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Waving to the crowd and then slicing his first tee shot into the  
rough, Nicklaus tried to see beyond the moment. Even as he gets his 
golf game back into shape, Nicklaus is dreaming of one final charge 
that will cap his brilliant career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll play a little bit this fall, just because I want to play  
next year,'' Nicklaus said. ``My goal next year is to try to play 
the four majors and try to be as competitive as I can be. Beyond 
that point, I'm not saying that's going to be the end of my playing 
major championship golf, but it'll probably be the end of my 
playing all four of them in one year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Out of habit, impatience, or a little of both, Nicklaus clutched  
a microphone as if it were a 9-iron while discussing his quick 
comeback from an operation that forced him to miss his first 
Masters in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He was told he couldn't return for six months, and Nicklaus  
eagled that estimate, so to speak, beating it by two months. 
Doctors were amazed at the deterioration in Nicklaus' hip, which 
had been bone-on-bone with no cartilage for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never expected to be able to do things so soon,'' said  
Nicklaus, who played about 20 practice rounds at home in North Palm 
Beach, Fla., before making his comeback official. ``I certainly 
don't want to do it again, but it was no big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well this weekend at this senior tournament in the  
Philadelphia suburbs, Nicklaus will play the Memorial Tournament on 
the course he designed in Dublin, Ohio, June 3-6. Then he plans to 
play in the U.S. Open, U.S. Senior Open and Senior Players 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt that I'll go to the British this year,'' Nicklaus  
said. ``That's too many weeks in a row. I might play the PGA 
Championship and I might not. I haven't made up my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus teed off on No. 10 in the pro-am, bogeying the first  
hole and double-bogeying the fifth. He finished with four birdies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't have my strength yet,'' Nicklaus said. ``I mean,  
I'm not terrible. I surprise myself every once in while and hit one 
pretty good. But I'm 85 percent top form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing to the crowd and signing autographs, Nicklaus walked  
nearly all of the hilly course. He plans to do the same in the 
tournament, even though carts are legal on the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think that I played great, but I played better than  
I've been playing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus made a terrific second shot on the par-3 11th, coaxing  
a short chip 3 feet from the cup before sinking the easy putt for 
par. He has come a long way since first clutching a club in his 
hands after the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine Nicklaus, the six-time Masters champion, starting from  
scratch in the weeks after the surgery -- with half swings, 
three-quarter swings and finally full swings that drove the ball 
only 170 yards or so. He joked that he's not even a four-handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to get back to a four,'' Nicklaus said. ``I was a  
four when I was about 12 years old and haven't worried about it 
much since then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Nicklaus stirred memories of his triumphant, youthful  
days when he became the oldest player to finish in the top 10 at 
the Masters, shooting a final-round, 4-under-par 68 to tie for 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	If his bid for one last shot at the four majors goes as planned,  
he wonders how his mind and body will respond. 
</P>
<P>
	``You find something inside you that will sort of drive you on,  
like at the Masters,'' Nicklaus said. ``I remembered how to finish 
a golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that will come back. I'll remember.''

<HEADLINE> 5 Boys Charged For Raping Twin Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) -- Five boys were charged Friday in the  
alleged rape and sodomy of 6-year-old twin girls at a day-care 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects, four 13-year-old boys and one 11-year-old boy,  
sexually assaulted the girls on May 15 in the basement of a day 
care center and in a shed next door, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls were apparently alone in the center and unattended by  
any adult, police said. The next day, the girls told their mother 
about the alleged assault and they were taken to the hospital for 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``They saw the girls were available and took advantage of  
them,'' Lt. Doug Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the suspects are the sons of the woman who runs the day  
care center and lives next door to the center, police said. The 
other three are friends of her sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the boys was charged in juvenile court with six counts  
of aggravated criminal sodomy. Two of them were also charged with 
two counts of rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the boys were in custody Friday night and a fifth was at  
large, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The day-care center was closed by order of the state on  
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Chinese gymnast Sang Lan, who was  
paralyzed during the Goodwill Games last summer, fulfilled a 
longtime wish today when she visited the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasun and a host of  
diplomats, the 17-year-old gymnast got to see the U.N. Security 
Council chamber where she hit the president's gavel and the General 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.N. symbolizes world peace,'' Sang said through an  
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in a wheelchair, she also got to see Chinese sculptures  
and other gifts to the United Nations from her government. 
</P>
<P>
	Sang, a member of the Chinese national team, was severely  
injured during a warmup exercise at the Goodwill Games last summer 
in Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	She was paralyzed from the neck down, but has regained some  
strength in her shoulders, elbows and wrists, and can raise her 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	China's U.N. Mission said the U.N. visit was her last public  
appearance in the United States before returning home Sunday via 
Detroit.

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Houston third baseman Ken Caminiti strained  
his right calf while stealing a base and was forced to leave Friday 
night's game against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti, who began the night batting .287 with two homers and  
16 RBIs, was listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti hit an RBI single in the third inning and tried to  
steal second. As he neared the base, he appeared to cramp up and 
grabbed his right leg, but still managed to slide around shortstop 
Rich Aurilia's tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Team trainers went on to the field to assist Caminiti, and he  
limped off the field and into the clubhouse. He was replaced in the 
lineup by Jack Howell.

<HEADLINE> House Democrats Push for Gun Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Propelled by a rash of high school shootings,  
President Clinton and congressional Democrats brainstormed at the 
White House today on how to push Senate-passed gun control 
legislation through the House before Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president said very clearly that he wants a memorial for  
those victims of Littleton and every other shooting that we've seen 
in the schools and houses across this country and he wants that 
memorial to those kids before we go on Memorial Day recess,'' Rhode 
Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy said as he and 17 other Democrats 
emerged from the West Wing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot let the (National Rifle Association) write our gun  
laws,'' added New York Rep. Nita Lowey. ``We have to take action 
this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One aide sitting in on the Roosevelt Room meeting said lawmakers  
would try to avoid having the bill referred to the House Judiciary 
Committee, where it would likely be bogged down in hearings. The 
bill was passed by the Senate on Thursday and requires trigger 
locks on all new handguns and imposes tougher restrictions on sales 
at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., offered to schedule House  
votes on the juvenile violence bill in the second week of June, 
after Judiciary Committee hearings. In a floor speech, he left open 
the possibility of proposing additional gun restrictions, but 
cautioned that the House wouldn't necessarily approve all the 
provisions passed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, we need to tighten current laws to make it more  
difficult for kids to get guns,'' Hastert said. ``We will take a 
look at the measure passed by the Senate to make sure that it is a 
reasonable and commonsense approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the administration  
wanted the House legislation to go even further than the Senate 
bill. He also called for a vote to be held soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see anyone who will benefit from delay, except people  
like the NRA and those who have opposed these measures at every 
step of the way,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to capitalize on the momentum generated in the Senate,  
House Democrats rejected the Republican proposal for a vote in 
June, pushing instead for floor debate next week, according to 
House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. And Rep. John 
Conyers, ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, already 
had proposed several gun sale restrictions by the time the Senate 
voted. 
</P>
<P>
	But today Republicans fired back, accusing Gephardt of rejecting  
a deal he had agreed to in a meeting Thursday with Republican 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all quite surprised that Mr. Gephardt did not stick to  
our agreement,'' Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said in a 
statement. ``To address this issue in a haphazard fashion does not 
do justice to the victims of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt's office said no member of the party leadership had  
endorsed the GOP timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage, 73-25, of the juvenile crime bill authored by Sen.  
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, would have been improbable at best before the 
Littleton, Colo., school shootings, but it was given added impetus 
by the additional bloodshed earlier in the day at a high school in 
Conyers, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Rank-and-file Republicans who reversed their opposition to the  
Democrats' gun control proposals and even backed down when GOP 
leaders threatened to pull the bill earlier this week were pleased 
to leave behind such a public relations meltdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``OK, we've had the debate,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., who voted for the bill on final passage. To the 
Democrats and their declaration of victory over Republicans and the 
gun lobby, Lott said: ``You've had your fun, you've made your 
point. ... Now it's time for us to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats never stopped crowing after Vice President Al Gore  
cast the tie-breaking vote at midday in favor of a key Democratic 
gun control amendment that had failed in nearly identical form a 
week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment, authored by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., called  
for background checks on all gun show transactions and wiped out a 
less-sweeping Republican version approved only moments before. The 
amendment also would require that anyone who pawned a gun would 
have to undergo a background check before reclaiming it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., who had voted against similar gun  
controls last week, lined up in favor this time. He said he had 
made up his mind to do so Wednesday night, after Democrats had 
agreed to changes. But he added that the day's bloodshed in his 
home state ``really confirmed for me that I was on the right 
track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also requires that ``secure gun storage or  
safety devices'' be sold with new handguns. But the measure also 
extends liability protections for a gun owner who uses a safety 
lock and whose gun is stolen and used in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the measure continues current gun law that majority  
Republicans had succeeded in changing briefly earlier in the day. 
Under the measure as passed, for example, background checks could 
still take up to three days instead of the 24-hour limit that 
Republicans wanted on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Importing high-capacity ammunition clips would be banned, and  
any juvenile convicted of a felony would be denied the right to 
purchase a gun for life. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure calls for $5 billion over five years to help crack  
down on juvenile crime. It provides money for prosecutors, and 
makes it easier to try some juveniles as adults. In addition, it 
requires a study of the entertainment industry to gauge the impact 
of its violent products on the young. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, more Republicans voted for the bill than against it,  
with 42 Democrats and 31 Republicans voting yes, and 23 Republicans 
and two Democrats voting no.

<P>
	But Democrats never stopped crowing after Vice President Al Gore  
cast the tie-breaking vote at midday in favor of a key Democratic 
gun control amendment that had failed in nearly identical form a 
week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment, authored by retiring Sen. Frank Lautenberg,  
D-N.J., called for background checks on all gun show transactions 
and wiped out a less-sweeping Republican version approved only 
moments before. The amendment also would require that anyone who 
pawned a gun would have to undergo a background check before 
reclaiming it. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Democrat Max Cleland, who had voted against similar gun  
controls last week, lined up in favor this time. He said he had 
made up his mind to do so Wednesday night, after Democrats had 
agreed to changes. But he added that the day's bloodshed in his 
home state ``really confirmed for me that I was on the right 
track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also requires that ``secure gun storage or  
safety devices'' be sold with new handguns. But the measure also 
extends liability protections for a gun owner who uses a safety 
lock and whose gun is stolen and used in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the measure continues current gun law that majority  
Republicans had succeeded in changing briefly earlier in the day. 
Under the measure as passed, for example, background checks could 
still take up to three days instead of the 24-hour limit that 
Republicans wanted on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Importing high-capacity ammunition clips would be banned, and  
any juvenile convicted of a felony would be denied the right to 
purchase a gun for life. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure calls for $5 billion over five years to help crack  
down on juvenile crime. It provides money for prosecutors, and 
makes it easier to try some juveniles as adults. In addition, it 
requires a study of the entertainment industry to gauge the impact 
of its violent products on the young. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, more Republicans voted for the bill than against it,  
with 42 Democrats and 31 Republicans voting yes, and 23 Republicans 
and two Democrats voting no. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have seen today is for the first time in a major kind  
of gun control issue, rejection of the National Rifle Association 
and a vote for common sense,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither Republicans nor the NRA would concede defeat. The  
powerful pro-gun group vowed to ``hold up a mirror'' to an 
administration it says doesn't enforce current laws.

<HEADLINE>  Cannes Screens Lynch, Smith Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- Director David Lynch is well known for his  
strange, dark, often violent films. Yet at Cannes, he's come up 
with a heartwarming movie where nobody dies, nobody is hurt and 
nobody is even mean. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Smith is known for small, quirky films that deal with  
mundane issues like the lives of store clerks. At Cannes, he's 
presenting a film about nothing less than good, evil and the 
Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Both films, presented Friday, are among the most talked-about at  
this year's festival. 
</P>
<P>
	For Lynch, it was a newspaper article that led to ``The Straight  
Story.'' The title is a play on words; it's a true story about 
Alvin Straight, an Iowa man who gained notoriety in 1994 for a 
singularly unusual act. 
</P>
<P>
	Straight, then 73, heard his brother Lyle had had a stroke. The  
two hadn't spoken for 10 years, and Alvin wanted to put things 
right. 
</P>
<P>
	With poor eyesight and no driver's license, he hitched a trailer  
to his lawn mower and drove across Iowa -- 240 miles -- to his 
brother's Wisconsin home. The trip took six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	As ``The Straight Story'' begins, we hear music that sounds  
unmistakably like that of ``Twin Peaks,'' Lynch's famously dark TV 
series. The music is by the same composer. But the similarity ends 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is a slow-moving (some might say too slow) and  
beautifully filmed tribute to Straight's stubbornness, and to the 
kindness he encounters along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no huge surprises -- it was, after all, based on real  
events. But the ending is surprisingly affecting. Mostly this is 
due to the acting of Richard Farnsworth as Alvin, whose 
expressively craggy face appears in nearly every scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch says he got a call after making the film, telling him it  
had received a G rating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, please say that again, because it's the only time I'm  
going to hear it,'' he joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's film could not be more different. In ``Dogma,'' showing  
out of competition, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon play angels who try 
to return to heaven after they are banished. The film also stars 
Linda Fiorentino as a reluctant descendant of Jesus Christ, Chris 
Rock as a trash-talking 13th apostle, Alan Rickman as an angel who 
is the voice of God, and singer Alanis Morisette as God. 
</P>
<P>
	The Walt Disney Co., the parent company of Miramax Films,  
apparently felt it would be inappropriate to release the film under 
any of the company's movie labels, including Miramax. So Miramax 
co-chairmen Bob and Harvey Weinstein formed a separate company to 
purchase and find a distributor for the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who previously directed ``Clerks,'' ``Mallrats'' and  
``Chasing Amy,'' says he knew he was going to ruffle some feathers. 
But he told a news conference he hoped people would ``see the movie 
for what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, the film begins with an amusing disclaimer, in  
which the filmmakers note that God, too, has a sense of humor -- 
witness the platypus. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it apologizes to the platypus community.  
</P>
<P>
	But the film may be offensive even to those who accept the  
religious satire. There is plenty of blood and guts, and it is a 
bit jarring to see charming Matt Damon blowing people away.

<HEADLINE> Disney Breach Date Corrected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The judge who ruled that The Walt Disney Co.  
breached the contract of former studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg has 
notified both sides that in his opinion he incorrectly said the 
violation occurred in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Superior Court Judge Paul G. Breckenridge Jr. said on  
Thursday that it was on Oct. 1, 1996, that Disney broke its 
contract by failing to pay Katzenberg a lump-sum bonus for work he 
performed before leaving the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 date surprised both sides in the case, since Disney  
wasn't obligated to pay Katzenberg the bonus until 1996, two years 
after he left Disney in a falling-out with chairman and chief 
executive officer Michael Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding Disney to the 1994 date would have forced Disney to pay  
millions in accrued interest to Katzenberg. Breckenridge ruled on 
Wednesday that Disney must pay Katzenberg a share of profits, plus 
interest, from movie projects he worked on before he quit. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge still must determine how much money Disney owes, or  
how what interest rate should be paid.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees on Both Coasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Kosovo refugees can be found from coast to coast  
as they settle in with friends, relatives and host families anxious 
to help them forget about their war-torn homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees arrived Thursday in Seattle and Los Angeles. The  
arrival of a seven-member family at Seattle-Tacoma International 
Airport marked the latest leg in an odyssey that began when Serbian 
police drove them from their home in Gjilan, about 40 miles from 
the Kosovo capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank the American government that took the initiative to  
save us from the bloody hands of the Serb regime, to save my family 
and children,'' Xhavit Korqa, the father, said through an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korqas walked for two days through the mountains before  
reaching Macedonia, where they had to wait for a week at the 
border. The family spent a month at a border camp in Macedonia, 
then two weeks at Fort Dix in New Jersey before heading for 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	With Korqa came his wife and children -- three girls and two  
boys, ages 6 to 16. World Relief, the refugee resettlement arm of 
the National Association of Evangelicals, is sponsoring the family 
in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Korqa said the first thing he wants his children to do is to go  
to school and learn English. The first thing the 45-year-old 
mechanic and bus driver wants to do is find work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very encouraging,'' said host family member Bruce  
Kennedy, after the Korqas sat through a news conference. ``This 
means they won't have time on their hands as they have had for the 
last few months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korqa and his family have full refugee status, meaning they will  
be able to apply for permanent residence in the United States and 
eventually apply for green cards. 
</P>
<P>
	But Korqa said they hoped to return home ``as soon as peace  
returns to Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24 after  
President Slobodan Milosevic rejected a plan to end the fighting 
with the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Hundreds of thousands of 
ethnic Albanians have fled to neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has agreed to accept up to 20,000 refugees.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 3,000 refugees have been flown to Fort Dix this month,  
where they are processed for relocation throughout the United 
States. At the post, Mirsade Bejiqi was saying good-bye Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	She arrived with her parents and three brothers here with the  
first planeload of refugees on May 5. The 20-year-old college 
student had to say good-bye again Thursday as her family headed to 
Boise, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to say. I'm too sad,'' Bejiqi sobbed. ``How  
many times do I have to say good-bye to my friends?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arlinda Gashi, 19, stood behind a fence and cried as she watched  
her friend talk to reporters. They exchanged a tearful farewell 
before Bejiqi boarded a bus for Newark International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, 28 ethnic Albanian refugees -- all members of the  
Vlashi family -- arrived to stay with host families. They were 
greeted by Hajrush Vlashi and his wife, Renee. The couple worked 
with the Jewish Federation to bring family members to the United 
States from Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in shock,'' Mrs. Vlashi said by telephone from Los Angeles  
International Airport. ``They were very, very happy to see my 
husband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees will receive one month of cash assistance, which  
averages about $300 a person, and three months of services. The 
hosts have been asked to house families for as long as two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Labonte Wins Winston Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Bobby Labonte has finished second in each  
of the last two all-star races for NASCAR's Winston Cup series. 
He's in prime position to improve on that this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte won the pole for the 15th annual running of The Winston  
by destroying the qualifying record Friday night by more than 3.5 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In a format that requires drivers to make three laps around  
Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte and stop to change two tires, 
Labonte capitalized on a pit stop that took just 9.8 seconds. The 
result was an average speed of 146.830 mph, easily eclipsing the 
143.273 set by Bill Elliott two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're awfully excited,'' said Labonte, who would win a minimum  
of $200,000 for a victory in Saturday night's 70-lap race. ``The 
guys did a great job on the pit stop and I got in and out of the 
pits really well and didn't spin the tires too bad. That's the name 
of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Labonte's first pole in five appearances at The Winston,  
which has a purse of more than $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting alongside him will be defending Winston Cup champion  
Jeff Gordon, who had a pit stop of 8.9 seconds but wasn't as fast 
as Labonte on the track and wound up with a 144.814. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Martin, who won The Winston last year when Gordon ran out  
of gas taking the white flag, also broke the qualifying record 
Friday night with a 143.862 and will start third. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty drivers were guaranteed entry in The Winston, with the  
remainder of the field being filled by the winner of the Winston 
Open, a 50-lap race held for non-qualifiers before Saturday night's 
main event. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first racing activity at the track since May 1,  
when three spectators were killed and eight more were injured by 
debris that flew into the stands following a crash during an Indy 
Racing League event. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night's activities drew a crowd of about 35,000,  
including many who sat in the fourth-turn grandstands where the 
debris from the IRL wreck landed. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd saw a number of problems in addition to Labonte's  
impressive qualifying run. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Waltrip, winner of the first Winston in 1985 and one of  
three drivers to compete in every all-star race, was penalized 
three seconds because an air gun was thrown back over the pit-road 
wall after his stop. Waltrip will start 17th. 
</P>
<P>
	Winston Cup points leader Jeff Burton had just the 16th-fastest  
speed after crew chief Frankie Stoddard, changing the right-front 
tire, couldn't get the lug nuts tightened on the first try. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst pit stop of the session, however, went to Ricky Rudd,  
who in his haste to get back on the track for his third lap did a 
360-degree spin near the exit of pit road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were going for it,'' said Rudd, who will start 19th. ``I  
feel bad for the guys. We had a good pit stop, and I let them down 
a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least Rudd made it in to get two tires changed before he  
messed up his stop. Ward Burton came charging down pit road so fast 
that he couldn't get stopped in time, and he slid right past his 
stall. 
</P>
<P>
	Car owner Bill Davis, watching from just behind the pit-road  
wall, epitomized the good-natured spirit of the all-star weekend by 
smiling and giving a friendly wave to Burton as he skidded past in 
a cloud of gray tire smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton will start 20th.

<HEADLINE> Ray, Stewart in Pole Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The rivalry is heating up between Greg Ray  
and Tony Stewart, the man he replaced at Team Menard. 
</P>
<P>
	Those two are considered the drivers to beat on Saturday in pole  
qualifying for the Indianapolis 500 on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a former Indy Racing League champion who has moved on  
to become the hottest rookie in NASCAR's Winston Cup series, left 
Team Menard at the end of the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	His seat was filled by Ray, a fast but unproven driver who IRL  
officials hope develops into a star, much as they hoped Stewart 
would become their main man before he chose to concentrate on stock 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	When practice began last Saturday at the Indianapolis Motor  
Speedway, it was Ray who set the pace for the first few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Stewart emerged, driving for a new team of which he is a  
co-owner. He turned it up Wednesday, running the fast lap of the 
week at 226.683 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about Ray, Stewart said, ``I haven't paid much  
attention to those guys, but he's got all of my old setups, so they 
ought to be going fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray answered on Thursday, retaking the top spot on the speed  
chart with a lap of 227.192. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels nice to be this consistently quick,'' Ray said. ``We  
regard our competition very highly. We're not taking anything for 
granted. From here, we want to try to go even faster but, above 
all, keep it off the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart wasn't able to keep his car off the wall.  
</P>
<P>
	Shaking down his primary car, he got too high in turn 3 on the  
2 1/2-mile oval and bounced twice off the concrete wall before 
stopping on the main straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed about 12 more inches of racetrack,'' Stewart said.  
``Unfortunately, I just ran out of racetrack and hit the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The car was not badly damaged, but Stewart was upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just made a stupid mistake,'' he said. ``I'm disgusted with  
myself. They pay me to drive a race car, and I take these things to 
heart. Thankfully, it wasn't too bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knock on wood, we haven't had an engine problem of any kind  
yet, and I've had more fun so far this week, and the most relaxing 
week leading up to qualifying that I've ever had at Indy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray is having fun, too, except when he is asked about replacing  
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of hearing his name,'' Ray said earlier in the week.  
``I have a lot of respect for Tony's ability, but I just don't want 
to answer any more questions about him. He's Tony Stewart and I'm 
Greg Ray, and I want to concentrate on my team and my effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only problem is the head-to-head duel on Saturday could be  
short-circuited if Stewart gets a late draw in the qualifying order 
or if the weather turns wet. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Stewart is committed to drive Saturday night in  
The Winston, a NASCAR all-star event at Lowe's Motor Speedway in 
Concord, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	To make it in time, Stewart must leave Indianapolis no later  
than 1:30 p.m., local time. Concord's time is an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying is scheduled to begin here at 11 a.m., but the early  
weather forecast is calling for possible morning rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would mean we'd have to qualify on Sunday, but the most  
important thing is to make the race. I've won the pole,'' said 
Stewart, who has started first, second and fourth in his three 
previous Indy races. ``I want to win the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Race day will be a long haul for Stewart, who is scheduled to  
fly to Concord immediately after the 500 to race in NASCAR's 
Coca-Cola 600. The only other driver to pull off that double is 
current Winston Cup regular John Andretti, who finished 10th in the 
1994 Indy 500 and then crashed out of the 600. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's practice, Robby Unser, last year's top Indy  
rookie, jumped to fourth overall at 225.079. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fast drivers on Thursday included two-time Indianapolis  
champion Arie Luyendyk, retiring following the May 30 race, at 
225.073; Stephan Gregoire at 224.792, 1996 Indy winner Buddy Lazier 
at 224.361 and defending champion Eddie Cheever Jr. at 224.193. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Unser, Robby's cousin, also crashed in practice Thursday,  
spinning in turn 3 and hitting the wall twice. He also escaped 
injury.

</P>
<P>
	TILTON, N.H. (AP) -- Damon W. Hall, who recently received the  
French Legion of Honor for his service in World War I, died Tuesday 
at age 105. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Sangerville, Maine, on June 29, 1893, Hall worked for

	In February, French Consul-General Maurice Portiche presented  
Hall with France's highest military honor at a ceremony. To 
celebrate the 80th anniversary of the end of the war, France began 
honoring foreign soldiers who helped liberate France from German 
occupation in 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, officials said Hall was one of 300 surviving  
American veterans who qualified for the medal because they were

	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Retired Gen. James E. Hill Jr., a  
former commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command 
and a force behind the U.S. military's push into space, died 
Thursday of cancer. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill's 37-year military career began the day after the surprise  
attack on Pearl Harbor, when he enlisted in the Army Air Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill was a P-47 fighter pilot and flew 128 missions in World War  
II, shooting down five enemy planes and earning the title of 
``ace.'' He also flew in Korea and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving as commander of NORAD's Alaska region, Hill became  
commander of NORAD and Air Defense Command in 1977. He retired from 
that position in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	As commander, Hill strongly advocated a separate space command  
but was rebuked by others who disagreed, said retired Brig. Gen. 
Bill Lindeman, a former deputy chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	After his retirement, Hill served as president of the Colorado  
Springs Area Chamber of Commerce and helped found the nonprofit 
Space Foundation, which promotes space-related business and 
educational efforts.

	PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- Sheldon Judson, a Princeton University  
geosciences professor who researched Stone Age archaeological sites 
in North America and Europe, died Thursday of pancreatic cancer. He 
was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Judson was the author of several geo-archaeological reports and  
co-wrote textbooks and workbooks used in introductory geology 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his research topics were ancient North American Indian  
sites and France's rock shelters of the late Paleolithic period, or 
Old Stone Age era circa 10,000 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Judson's best-known textbook is ``Physical Geology,'' co-written  
with L. Don Leet in 1954 and with Marvin E. Kauffman in revised 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Judson was a member of the Princeton faculty from 1955 to 1982.  
Between 1970 to 1982, he was the chairman of its geosciences 
department. He held the rank of dean when he served as chairman of 
the University Research Board in the 1970s.

Winnebago Tribe, died Thursday of complications from a heart

</P>
<P>
	The Winnebago Tribe's reservation is centered in Thurston  
County, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPointe, who served four years on the tribal council about  
seven years ago, was elected chairman in October. He had served the 
tribe in many other ways, including director of the Winnebago 
Native American Head Start program, and as part of a task force 
that established a tribal college.

</P>
<P>
	DOLGEVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Lyndon Waldo Lyon, developer of 800  
varieties of African Violet including the double-pink and star 
flower, died Wednesday at age 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyon's passion for the purple-flowered plant was sparked in 1949  
with the gift of a single African Violet leaf from his niece. 
Shortly after, he set up an African Violet nursery under artificial 
lights in his own house where he studied the plant and experimented 
with hybridization. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1955, Lyon had built a greenhouse with 5,000 plants and had  
created 80 new varieties, including the double-pink which created a 
sensation at the 1954 national convention of the African Violet 
Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
	He built another greenhouse in 1956 and in the same year  
successfully bred the star flower, where the five petals are about 
the same size. Normally, the flowers of African Violets have three 
lower petals which are larger than the upper two. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1958, Lyon co-authored a book titled, ``1,001 African Violet  
Questions Answered by 12 Experts,'' and had proclaimed the plant as 
the ``Queen of House Plants'' in a magazine article. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1982, Lyon had created about 800 varieties and was selling  
over 100,000 plants a year in a retail-wholesale business. That 
same year he sold the business to his grandson, Paul Sorano.

	MANCHESTER, England (AP) -- Comic actor Norman Rossington, a  
veteran of dozens of movies and British television shows, died 
Friday of cancer. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liverpool-born Rossington was best-known for his string of  
more than 40 films, including the classic ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' 
``A Hard Day's Night'' with the Beatles, the World War II epic 
``The Longest Day'' and ``A Night to Remember'' about the Titanic 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	His stage career included stints at the Metropolitan Opera in  
New York, Laurence Olivier's pre-National Theatre company at 
Chichester, England, and in the Royal Shakespeare Company. His many 
TV credits included ``I Claudius.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rossington had been working up until November in the London West  
End stage hit ``Beauty and the Beast,'' but bowed out after a fall 
on stage.

	TRIESTE, Italy (AP) -- Fulvio Tomizza, a writer of several novels  
about the mix of cultures in his native Istria, died Friday. He was 
64. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, Tomizza wrote his first novel, ``Materada,'' named  
after his hometown in Istria, the northwest Croatian peninsula 
formerly under Italian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200,000 ethnic Italians were forced to flee Istria after  
World War II when Italy lost its jurisdiction over the territory, 
and the book focused on how natives were uprooted and sent 
searching for a new motherland. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomizza went on to write dozens of other books with similar  
themes and also worked as a playwright and journalist for RAI, 
Italian state TV.

<HEADLINE> Link To IOC Scholarships on Tax Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Salt Lake Organizing Committee finally  
filed its 1997-98 tax return, the first to acknowledge that the 
committee provided scholarships, most of which can be traced to the 
relatives of International Olympic Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	However, tax attorneys issued a disclaimer that the payments of  
tuition, room and board do not meet the Internal Revenue Service 
definition of a ``scholarship program,'' and still are not reported 
that way, The Salt Lake Tribune said in a copyright story on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Revelations of a scholarship last winter triggered multiple  
investigations into how Salt Lake won the bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games and its continued pampering of IOC members and their 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Past tax returns have put the so-called scholarships in ``other  
costs,'' and that's the proper category, said Albert Rodriguez, 
whose Los Angeles law firm Rodriguez, Horii and Choi was hired by 
the SLOC late last year. The SLOC referred all questions to 
Rodriguez on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest tax return gives much more detail on revenue and  
spending than past returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez declined to characterize past tax returns as sloppy or  
inadequate, but characterized the latest return ``an extra effort 
in the interest of complete and full disclosure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to say whether he has advised the committee to amend  
its previous tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	The carefully crafted response -- and the length of time it took  
accountants to file it -- reflects the delicate situation in which 
SLOC finds itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether lavish  
spending on IOC members and their relatives constitutes a crime. 
Also at issue is whether SLOC and the bid committee falsified tax 
returns or abused their tax-exempt status.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Pitcher Throws Fake Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Red Sox pitcher Ramon Martinez threw 84 pitches in  
a simulated game today for the first time since he underwent 
shoulder surgery last June. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez said he felt no pain after throwing and gained  
confidence about returning to the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy,'' Martinez said. ``I don't belong sitting on  
the bench, I belong out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Martinez, older brother of Boston ace Pedro  
Martinez, was 7-3 last year with Los Angeles before his season was 
cut short for rotator cuff surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said Martinez will likely  
return the first or second week of July.

<HEADLINE> GM Plant To Be in Baltimore County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE MARSH, Md. (AP) -- General Motors announced Thursday it  
chose a site in Baltimore County for its new $250 million 
transmissions plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison Transmission, a subsidiary of the world's largest  
automaker, plans to build the 400,000 square foot plant on the 
65-acre site of a former gravel quarry here. 
</P>
<P>
	``This location is especially good for us since it is near a  
good work force, a major highway and a port,'' said Allison 
President Dan Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction could begin this summer but won't be completed for  
about a year, said Richard C. Mike Lewin, Maryland's secretary of 
business and economic development. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant initially will employ about 300 workers now employed  
at GM's Broening Highway plant in Baltimore City, Lewin said. 
Though no new jobs will be created, the new plant will ensure that 
500 autoworkers remain in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our strong suit is our workers,'' Lewin said. ``They  
could have taken this plant anywhere in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland sweetened the deal by extending financial incentives to  
Allison. State officials declined to release details, but WBAL-TV 
reported that GM will receive over $1 million in tax credits during 
the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The state also will plug $8 million to $10 million into local  
highways used to access the plant. The state would be willing to 
help with extensive improvements to the plant's infrastructure to 
keep it open, Lewin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first heavy manufacturing plant to be built in  
Maryland in 30 years,'' Gov. Parris Glendening said, standing on 
the future site of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	GM, based in Detroit, has said it needs a new plant to meet the  
demand for the 1000 series Allison automatic transmissions, which 
are sold to makers of full-size pickup trucks.

<HEADLINE> NYC Cop's Case Undermined Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In another apparent blow to the defense of a  
Brooklyn policeman accused of torturing a prisoner, a former 
prosecutor testified that the officer claimed he -- not the prisoner 
-- was a victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Leary O'Rourke told a jury Thursday that while she was  
processing the arrest of Abner Louima, Officer Justin Volpe told 
her that Louima had cursed at police before attacking two uniformed 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said Mr. Louima hit him in the head,'' O'Rourke, now in  
private practice, said Thursday at the federal brutality trial of 
five officers. Volpe, she added, also claimed Louima punched 
another officer, Charles Schwarz, during a melee outside a Brooklyn 
nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors have said Volpe's motive for the attack was  
his incorrect belief that Louima had punched him during the riot. 
But the prosecutors say Volpe's overblown and false descriptions of 
Louima cursing and striking out at others were meant to plant the 
seeds for a cover-up of the attack on the Haitian immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, is charged with ramming a stick into Louima's rectum  
and mouth in a fit of rage in a bathroom stall. Volpe had arrested 
Louima, 32, on charges of assaulting a police officer; the charges 
were dropped, and it later turned out a cousin of Louima hit Volpe. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Rourke's testimony follows of a parade of law enforcement  
witnesses who have given devastating accounts of Volpe waving a 
stick and bragging of an assault on a prisoner just after the 
alleged attack in the police station bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, chose not to cross-examine  
any prosecution witness Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a change in strategy,'' Kornberg told reporters  
outside court. ``You'll see why when we finish the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, four 70th Precinct patrolmen have testified seeing Volpe  
wielding a stick in the station. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest, Officer Michael Schoer, said Thursday he first  
thought the feces were from the puppy Volpe kept around the 
station. Instead, Volpe told him it was human excrement, Schoer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, Schwarz and two other officers are charged with violating  
Louima's civil rights by beating him en route to their station. 
Schwarz also is accused of holding down Louima in the bathroom 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	A fifth defendant is charged with covering up the incident,  
which left Louima hospitalized with severe internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony Thursday, an emergency room nurse said that  
Louima, his face caked with blood and body shaking, told her 
details of the alleged brutality before he had surgery to repair a 
tear in the tissue separating the bladder and rectum. He also 
denied he had fought with police, said the nurse, Sonia Miller.

<HEADLINE> Kids Fuel 'Phantom Menace' Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ``Star Wars'' prequel was poised to  
shatter its own single-day triumph and vanquish weekend box office 
records as theaters braced today for a torrent of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Show me the kids!'' 20th Century Fox distribution chief Tom  
Sherak said Friday, refusing to predict how much the George Lucas 
film would rake in by Sunday's final showings. 
</P>
<P>
	Youngsters could be the key to the success of ``Star Wars:  
Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some movie critics complained that the film's 8-year-old central  
character and sidekick Jar Jar Binks were annoying and would appeal 
only to children. If so, kids could send the movie over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Movie analysts expect the film to gross $120 million to $140  
million by the end of its five-day opening frame. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie made a record $28.5 million on its Wednesday debut. On  
Thursday the box office tally was $12.3 million (a second-day 
drop-off was not unexpected by the industry), bringing the two-day 
tally to $40.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The kid factor should push Saturday's grosses beyond Wednesday,  
setting a new one-day record, according to industry estimates. The 
Wednesday take beat the $26.1 million earned in 1997 by previous 
title holder ``Lost World: Jurassic Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Box office comparisons are not adjusted for inflation.

<HEADLINE> Pueblo Indians Reuniting With Bones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Scores of Pueblo Indians were retracing  
their tribe's past, making an 80-mile trek to Pecos Pueblo to unite 
with the bones of their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians were following a route taken by their ancestors 160  
years ago, when disease and warfare decimated Pecos Pueblo. Most of 
the survivors moved to Jemez Pueblo, a small community of scattered 
adobe houses about 50 miles north of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	To unify the tribe and reconnect with their culture, a large  
group of people from Jemez Pueblo left on foot Wednesday. They 
headed through the high red rock area of northern New Mexico 
through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains toward Pecos National 
Historic Park, about 15 miles east of Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
	By late Thursday, the 200 marchers had finished about half their  
journey. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, they plan to meet the truck that is bringing home  
the bones of 1,912 people excavated between 1915 and 1929 in New 
Mexico's upper Pecos Valley by archaeologist Alfred Kidder. The 
pueblo plans a burial ceremony at the monument. 
</P>
<P>
	Jemez Pueblo Gov. Raymond Gachupin said the long walk to the  
Pecos monument is a way for the entire community to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's mostly to pay tribute to our ancestors to give us  
an idea of the pain and tribulations that they went through,'' he 
said. ``For them, it was a matter of survival. For us, it is a 
matter of respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard University handed over the remains Tuesday in the  
largest transfer under the 1990 Native American Graves Protection 
and Repatriation Act, which requires the return of Indian 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	The bones, plus objects to be returned next week from Phillips  
Academy in Andover, Mass., represent the foundation of scientific 
knowledge about early cultures of the American Southwest, said 
James Bradley, director of the Peabody Andover museum. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Jemez creation story, Father Sun warned that if  
the people neglected or forgot the traditional ways, he would take 
their lands for someone else. Today, the culture remains strong: 
Children in the 3,200-member tribe learn their traditional 
language, Towa, before English. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other pueblos are losing their language,'' tribal official  
Cruz Toya said. ``The reason we are here is to show the people, our 
ancestors, we care. By doing this we also teach the kids our 
language and culture. Hopefully, they will carry this on and tell 
their kids the history we made.''

<HEADLINE> New Rules for Souvenir Baseballs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Worried about ``wild scrambles'' in the stands,  
Major League Baseball is asking its players to be a little more 
careful with its souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Players, coaches and managers have been reminded this year not  
to toss balls into the stands. Instead, they have been told simply 
to hand the souvenir to fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy is not new, said baseball spokesman Pat Courtney.  
Although a memo has been sent to all 30 ballclubs, a notice has 
been posted in clubhouses about the policy for at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball decided to reiterate the policy after watching fans  
climb over each other trying to get one of slugger Mark McGwire's 
home run balls last year during his record-breaking season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a safety thing,'' Courtney said. ``We just don't want any  
wild scrambles or melees up in the stands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many players routinely toss baseballs into the stands after the  
final out of an inning or after chasing down a foul. Officials can 
do nothing about the scramble for balls into the stands after home 
runs or fouls, but it is trying to maintain control at other times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to discourage players from giving away balls,''  
Courtney said. ``It's fine if they want to do that. Just go hand it 
to someone, instead of throwing it into the stands.''

<HEADLINE> FEC May Allow Credit-Card Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential campaigns that use the Internet  
to raise funds got a big lift when the Federal Election Commission 
took the first step toward approving federal matching dollars for 
credit card donations to candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	All the major presidential campaigns have Web sites that include  
fund-raising sections. The easiest way for donors to contribute is 
via credit card, but existing FEC regulations expressly forbid 
candidates from collecting federal matching funds on those 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC tentatively approved a plan Thursday that would allow  
presidential campaigns to begin collecting credit card donations in 
anticipation of receiving matching funds for them on Jan. 1, 2000, 
the same time that they will get federal dollars for other eligible 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the commission -- which is made up of six members split  
evenly along party lines -- did not vote, members indicated that as 
soon as some details regarding the security and documentation of 
donations are resolved, the regulations would be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FEC is going to take the legal steps to make these funds  
matchable,'' said Scott Thomas, the commission chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission acted in response to a formal request made by  
Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley's campaign in March. 
</P>
<P>
	All five of the commission members at the meeting indicated that  
they would vote to pass the regulation in some form, but they left 
the decision to a written vote by each of the six commission 
members within the next 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clear indication is that the commission wants to do  
this,'' said David Mason, a Republican FEC member. ``It's just the 
details that need to be worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barring disapproval from the Congress or the president, the new  
regulations would take effect in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for the campaigns to maintain security procedures  
-- the details of which are still to be worked out -- to avoid 
illegal donations via corporate credit cards or from foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	Many members of the commission stressed, however, that it would  
be unfair to place more restrictions on credit card donations than 
more traditional forms like checks or money orders.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Activate Boggs From DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Wade Boggs resumed his quest for  
3,000 career hits Friday night when the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 
activated him from the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs, sidelined since May 6 because of a strained left  
hamstring, was batting .276 with no homers and nine RBIs when he 
went on the DL for just the second time in his 18-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs began a weekend series against the Anaheim Angels 57 hits  
shy of 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on the roster, the Devil Rays optioned outfielder  
Randy Winn to Triple-A Durham. He was batting .276 with one homer 
and nine RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Thomson To Lead International Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Five months ago in Australia, Peter  
Thomson held up the Presidents Cup trophy as captain of the 
International team and called it the crowning achievement of a 
career that includes five British Open titles. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he agreed to return as captain in 2000 for a chance  
to beat the Americans on their own turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to this, I'm thrilled,'' Thomson told The  
Associated Press from Malaysia. ``It will be huge if we win. It 
means the International team will be the top dog, bigger than 
Europe -- and bigger than the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Royal Melbourne Golf Club in December, Thomson brought  
together 12 players from seven countries under one fabricated flag 
and handed the Americans their worst loss ever in match play, 
20 1/2-11 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States players will be determined to erase the  
disappointment of Royal Melbourne,'' he said. ``However equally, 
the International team vividly remembers the joy of victory and 
would dearly cherish a successful defense on the Americans' soil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Presidents Cup, patterned after the Ryder Cup to give  
foreign players born outside Europe a chance to compete, began in 
1994 and resulted in two U.S. victories at the Robert Trent Jones 
Golf Club in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	After the U.S. failure in Australia, the 2000 matches return to  
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said the Melbourne event was the highlight of my career,''  
Thomson said. ``This will be a test for the team. If the team can 
win in the U.S., we're on top of the pile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour announced last week that Ken Venturi, the CBS  
Sports golf analyst and 1964 U.S. Open champion, would be the 
American captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I applaud that,'' Thomson said. ``The U.S. could not have  
picked a better man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus was the U.S. captain at Melbourne and had what  
Thomson called during opening ceremonies the ``greatest collection 
of golfers in the world,'' from young stars such as David Duval and 
Tiger Woods to the experience of Fred Couples and Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	But the International team, inspired by an emotional team  
meeting led by Thomson after its 1996 loss in Virginia, rolled to 
such a huge lead that it only needed to win two of the 12 singles 
matches on Sunday to take the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Already this year, five players from that team have won on the  
PGA Tour -- Steve Elkington, Vijay Singh, Stuart Appleby, Ernie Els 
and Carlos Franco. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got a lift of confidence,'' Thomson said. ``I'm not  
surprised because they're all good players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International team is determined by the world rankings,  
although Thomson said he expects the same core of his winning team 
in 2000 -- Elkington, Greg Norman, Els and Nick Price. 
</P>
<P>
	That he will be captain is a small surprise. Thomson suggested  
during the beer-spraying celebration at Royal Melbourne that it was 
time to give someone else a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem has spent the past few weeks  
polling international players, and Thomson was the choice. Gary 
Player also was considered, and he is likely to be the leading 
candidate should the Presidents Cup move to South Africa in 2002, 
as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly didn't plan on this,'' Thomson said. ``But I said  
that if the team wanted me, then I would.''

<HEADLINE> Japan's Top Banks Report Big Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's top banks reported heavy losses for the  
latest fiscal year due largely to writing off problem loans to 
comply with new, more stringent rules for classifying loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The major commercial lenders indicated Friday they would earn a  
profit by the end of the current business year. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-ranked Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., the only major commercial  
bank which has not taken part in a taxpayer-financed bailout of the 
industry, posted a consolidated net loss of 86.90 billion yen, or 
$701 million, for the fiscal year ended March 31 compared with a 
net loss of 524.36 billion yen a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	It said its parent company problem loans total 2.16 trillion  
yen, or $17.42 billion -- up from 1.86 trillion yen last September. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher figure was due in part to revamped disclosure  
standards prompted by the banking sector's recent woes. Problem 
loans include those extended to bankrupt borrowers, companies in 
danger of failing and loans on which payments have been missed or 
which have been restructured. 
</P>
<P>
	Under previous accounting standards, Tokyo-Mitsubishi's problem  
loans would have totaled 2.08 trillion yen. It wrote off 843.9 
billion yen worth of these loans in the past fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	It forecast a group net profit of 140 billion yen for the  
current fiscal year, which ends in March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. posted a consolidated net loss of  
445.29 billion yen, or $3.59 billion, compared with a loss of 72.02 
billion yen the previous year. It expects a group net profit of 130 
billion yen this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	It reported problem loans at its parent company amounting to  
2.25 trillion yen, or $18.15 billion, under the new accounting 
rules, up from 1.47 trillion yen a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank disposed of 856.48 billion yen in problem loans with  
the roughly 900 billion yen in public funds it received as part of 
25 trillion yen the government earmarked to prop up the banking 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Asahi Bank Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd., Sanwa Bank Ltd., Sakura Bank  
Ltd., Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and Tokai Bank Ltd. also all reported 
large group net losses for fiscal 1998, reflecting their stepped up 
efforts to write off bad loans using government funds. 
</P>
<P>
	But each of the banks projected posting a net profit this fiscal  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's banks have been struggling to deal with loans which have  
soured amid the country's worst recession since World War II. Many 
of these loans were extended in the late 1980s to finance 
speculative land deals before a collapse in real estate prices at 
the outset of this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament approved a scheme in October to inject new capital  
into banks to cover bad loan write-offs. Two major banks which had 
become insolvent largely as a result of problem loans were 
nationalized late last year.

<HEADLINE> Alomar's Surgery a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Sandy Alomar had a bone chip the size of a lima  
bean removed from his left knee today and the Cleveland Indians 
catcher is expected to be sidelined for at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar's surgery -- the seventh on his left knee -- was performed  
at Lutheran Hospital by Dr. Lou Keppler, the team's orthopedic 
surgeon. Keppler did a similar procedure on Alomar's left knee last 
October after the Indians were eliminated from the AL championship 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a statement released by the Indians, Keppler  
removed ``loose bodies'' from Alomar's knee before making an 
incision behind his knee in order to remove the bone chip. 
</P>
<P>
	With Alomar out, Einar Diaz will handle the majority of the  
Indians' catching duties with Chris Turner, recently promoted from 
Triple-A Buffalo, serving as his backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz, who started Friday night's game against Detroit, is  
batting .257 with two homers and 10 RBIs. However, the rookie has 
been struggling lately and batted only .111 (2-for-18) on the 
Indians' recent six-game road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar was off to a good start this season following a  
disappointing and injury-filled 1998. He's batting .317 with three 
homers and 16 RBIs, but was limited to just 22 games because of 
injuries.

<HEADLINE> INS Rule Helps Central Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Immigration procedures will be eased for more  
than a quarter-million Salvadorans and Guatemalans seeking legal 
U.S. residency after entering the nation illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Such individuals, most of whom came to the United States after  
fleeing civil wars in their homelands during the 1980s, will be 
allowed to apply for relief from deportation through a simplified 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a new rule announced Thursday by the Immigration and  
Naturalization Service, the immigrants will be exempt from having 
to prove they would suffer ``extreme hardships'' if they were sent 
back to their homelands -- a key test of eligibility. They also will 
have their cases overseen by INS asylum officers, rather than 
immigration judges. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10,000 Eastern Europeans also will be affected by the  
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consistent with the commitment President Clinton made when he  
visited Central America in March, the new program is the 
culmination of the administration's efforts to create as accessible 
and straightforward a process as the law permits,'' INS 
Commissioner Doris Meissner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule is expected to affect 290,000 Central Americans,  
including 240,000 Salvadorans and Guatemalans. It is to take effect 
June 21 after a public comment period. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Congress passed a law that granted amnesty to some  
Nicaraguans and Cubans in the United States and allowed them to 
apply for status as legal permanent residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was intended to help the thousands of Central Americans  
who illegally entered the United States after fleeing civil wars in 
their homelands during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, Guatemalans and Salvadorans who qualify would be  
considered for a suspension of deportation under the less stringent 
rules that existed before the 1996 immigration legislation, but on 
a case-by-case basis, requiring them to prove ``extreme hardship'' 
if they were returned to their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary  
subcommittee on immigration and claims, criticized the rule change, 
saying it was ``not what Congress intended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Amnesty rewards those who break the law and encourages more  
illegal immigration. It is a slap in the face to all those who 
patiently waited their turn to come to the U.S.,'' Smith said in a 
statement.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Finds Kosovo Quiet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- At first glance, the village, once  
home to about 1,000 ethnic Albanians, seemed normal. Chickens 
wandered around intact houses, cows grazed in the fields. But the 
houses were abandoned, the workshops and barns deserted -- the 
village was empty and looted. 
</P>
<P>
	For the visiting U.N. team, this was ``silent confirmation'' of  
the ethnic conflict that has driven about 800,000 Kosovo Albanians 
into exile in neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The team found the village, Muhadzeri Babuc, almost by chance as  
it traveled the road to Urosevac. The team was on its first full 
day Friday touring Kosovo to assess the humanitarian needs of the 
province, where refugees have said Serb forces waged a brutal 
campaign to expel the ethnic Albanian majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour provides the United Nations with the first  
on-the-ground look at Kosovo since international observers and 
virtually all foreign aid workers fled the province shortly before 
NATO launched its air campaign March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Several times during the day, U.N. mission head Sergio de Mello  
tried to visit villages off the main roads. His Yugoslav hosts 
refused. It was unsafe to stray off the road, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, de Mello insisted. He stopped the convoy and  
proceeded into the settlement to see it for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The houses, he found, were abandoned. Workshops and barns  
deserted. Floors of the brick homes were littered with clothes, 
bedding and household items. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silent confirmation,'' de Mello muttered.  
</P>
<P>
	Much of Kosovo appears empty. Those still there only reinforce  
the picture of a mass exodus by ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	At the mosque in Kacanik, the team found three elderly brothers  
who stayed behind when their family fled from the chaos in Kosovo, 
heading for the nearby Macedonian border. 
</P>
<P>
	Imer Caca said he could have gone -- but at the same time he  
couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were afraid,'' he said of his family. ``There was  
shooting day and night. I would have left -- but I have to take care 
of my brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His brothers Rufki and Nuhi are diabetic. Rufki's right leg was  
amputated several years ago; Nuhi has lost both of his. They 
couldn't have survived alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers, along with an elderly neighbor, found refuge in  
Kacanik, where townspeople laid mattresses in the mosque for them 
and bring them food. 
</P>
<P>
	It's better than their empty village. But many of Kacanik's  
people have fled, too. 
</P>
<P>
	In an abandoned, looted apartment, a pot of tea still stands on  
a table, testament to the haste with which its inhabitants left. 
</P>
<P>
	The floors are strewn with the debris of a family's life:  
clothes, dishes, toys, a photo album. 
</P>
<P>
	A look inside shows what that life was once like: new babies,  
family outings, a village wedding, a vacation abroad. Now they have 
all gone -- somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Macedonian border town of Djeneral Jankovic, the team saw  
hundreds of tractors and wagons abandoned by fleeing ethnic 
Albanians. The wagons were packed with blankets, mattresses, 
cradles, rugs and household goods and covered in plastic sheeting. 
A lonely donkey brayed wildly among the abandoned vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Several thousand Kosovo Albanians were trapped there for several  
days when Macedonia closed its border. And when the border 
reopened, the refugees had to cross on foot, leaving their 
belongings behind, parked at a huge cement plant near the border 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials assured the U.N. team that the vehicles were being  
protected so their owners could reclaim them when they return. 
</P>
<P>
	In Urosevac, the liveliest town visited by the team, the  
delegation found Kosovo Albanians who had tried to leave for 
Macedonia but had been turned back at the train station by Serb 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said: 'Go back!' I don't know why,'' said one young man  
who spoke a little English. Asked why he wanted to leave Kosovo, he 
said he was afraid of the army and police. 
</P>
<P>
	In Urosevac, an ethnically mixed city, the scene was one of  
seeming normalcy amid signs of tension. 
</P>
<P>
	Old men in dark berets lined up to collect their pensions from  
government offices. Young people thronged the streets. Shops were 
open, but not well-stocked. 
</P>
<P>
	On the edge of town, however, burned homes and shops spoke  
silently of the violence.

<HEADLINE> Magellan Health Moving to Maryland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- Magellan Health Services, the nation's  
largest manager of health care plans, is moving its corporate 
headquarters from Atlanta to Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to Columbia, which is expected to be completed in the  
next few months, will bring about 600 jobs to Maryland over the 
next 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``With so many individuals already employed here in Maryland  
through our subsidiary, Magellan Behavioral Health, it is a natural 
fit to relocate our corporate headquarters here as well,'' Dr. 
Henry T. Harbin, president and chief executive, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Magellan already has more than 900 employees in Maryland.  
</P>
<P>
	Harbin also said proximity to Washington and the center of the  
nation's health care policy-making was also a factor in the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Magellan was also lured by a $2.8 million grant from Maryland's  
Sunny Day Fund, which aims to stimulate economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Magellan Health Services Inc. is a $1.5 billion company with  
more than 11,000 employees nationwide. Its three main businesses 
are Magellan Specialty Health, which manages the care of 
individuals with chronic medical conditions; Magellan Behavioral 
Health, the nation's largest manager of mental health and substance 
abuse treatment programs; and MENTOR, which provides home and 
community-based services.

<HEADLINE> Publisher Pulls Hit Man Guide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Two families who claimed a hit man followed a  
how-to manual published by Paladin Press in the killings of their 
loved ones are getting millions of dollars and a promise to stop 
selling the book, their lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boulder, Colo., publisher agreed Friday to stop selling  
``Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors,'' said 
lawyer John Marshall. The book has sold more than 13,000 copies 
since it was first published in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit, scheduled to go to trial next week, was  
filed by the family of Mildred Horn and her 8-year-old son Trevor, 
and the family of nurse Janice Saunders. It accused Paladin Press 
of providing James Perry with a 130-page blueprint for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry was convicted of killing the Silver Spring mother, her  
quadriplegic son and Ms. Saunders in 1993, a year after ordering 
the book. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a multi-million dollar settlement in which Paladin has  
agreed, in addition, to make donations to two charities,'' said 
Marshall. ``They have agreed to remove `Hit Man' from their 
catalogue and to cease publication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed not to disclose the exact amount of the  
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Paladin lawyer Lee Levine said concerns over school violence  
stemming from last month's murders in Littleton, Colo. and this 
week's shootings in Conyers, Ga., could have made it harder to get 
the jury to listen to their side. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is about whether or not there is a clear and  
convincing case that this book in any sense known to our law caused 
these murders,'' or substantially helped Perry to commit them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hit Man'' offers tips for deadly effectiveness, such as  
shooting victims in the head. Ms. Horn and Ms. Saunders were shot 
in the eye. Trevor's breathing tube was disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Horn, Ms. Horn's ex-husband, was convicted of hiring  
Perry so he could inherit the $1.7 million estate his son won from 
a medical malpractice suit. 
</P>
<P>
	At Perry's trial in 1995, prosecutors listed 22 connections  
between Perry's actions and the book's instructions. Paladin 
countered that there were few similarities and that Perry learned 
what he knew from growing up in a tough Detroit neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13,500-member Society of Professional Journalists filed a  
court brief in support of Paladin Press, saying the suit threatens 
the right of free speech, said President Wendy S. Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the timing for the suit is difficult given our  
recent experience with the Littleton, Colo., shooting,'' she said.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today released new  
guidelines to ease the availability of marijuana for medical 
research, in a move that officials believe will quicken the pace of 
studies into the drug's possible beneficial uses. 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidelines, ``an extension of an existing process,''  
will make it easier for academic researchers to obtain samples of 
research-grade marijuana grown by the government, said Campbell 
Gardett, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines were endorsed by the White House Office of  
National Drug Policy as part of an effort to more thoroughly 
understand the benefits and risks of using marijuana to treat 
medical conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such research will allow us to better understand what benefits  
might actually exist for the use of cannabinoid-based drugs,'' the 
drug policy office said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision underscores the federal government's commitment  
to ensuring that the discussion of the medical efficacy and safety 
of cannabionoids takes place within the context of medicine and 
science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug policy office, in the past, has resisted efforts by  
some groups to make medical marijuana more readily available, but 
officials at the agency insisted today that the new directive is 
``not a reversal of policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been increasing pressure from organizations,  
researchers and physicians for more research into the medical uses 
of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, voters passed an initiative in 1996 that would  
allow patients to grow and use marijuana if it was prescribed by 
their doctors. The federal response was to warn that doctors could 
be penalized if they helped their patients get the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Some federal scientists have conducted marijuana research in the  
past, but many academic and private researchers have complained of 
the difficulty of getting research-grade marijuana from tightly 
controlled government supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidelines will ease the process, while assuring that  
the drug is available only to legitimate researchers, Gardett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines say that HHS has determined that it will make  
research-grade marijuana available ``on a cost reimbursement 
basis,'' which means that researchers or their sponsors will help 
defray the government cost of raising the weed on government lands. 
</P>
<P>
	The intent of the policy, also, is to ensure that the marijuana  
used in research is of high quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Valid research, the guidelines say, requires that ``the  
substance ... must have a consistent and predictable potency, must 
be free of contamination and must be available in sufficient 
amounts to support the needs of the study.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few months, committees of experts have recommended  
in two major studies a more extensive program of scientific 
research into marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Committees for both the National Academy of Sciences and the  
National Institutes of Health concluded there is evidence that 
marijuana can be useful in the treatment of some patients who have 
not responded well to other therapies. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cancer patients and people with AIDS have said that  
marijuana, often obtained illegally, is able to relieve nausea and 
to restore appetite. Other patients have used marijuana to combat 
glaucoma, the sight-robbing disease caused by a buildup of pressure 
in the eye.

<HEADLINE> Moment of Truth for Indy 500 Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Greg Ray wants to leave Indianapolis Motor  
Speedway tomorrow as the pole winner for the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we've been here working on all week,'' said Ray,  
who has been the fastest driver on the 2 1/2-mile oval all but one day 
since practice opened last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	His fastest lap so far, 227.192 mph, came Thursday during the  
final hour, often referred to as ``Happy Hour'' because weather 
conditions are generally conducive to speed with cooling 
temperatures and winds often dying down. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ray backed it up Friday with a lap of 227.175 mph shortly  
after the track opened for practice at 11 a.m. -- the same time that 
the first of two days of time trials was scheduled to begin on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The qualifying on Saturday and Sunday will determine the 33-car  
starting lineup for the 83rd Indy on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really hasn't mattered what time of day we go out,'' Ray  
said. ``These guys at Team Menard have given me a fast car in just 
about any condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no guarantees, but we're feeling pretty good right  
now,'' he said. ``I'll be disappointed if we don't get the job 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Ray can't take anything for granted -- not with  
challengers like Tony Stewart, the driver he replaced at Team 
Menard, and Arie Luyendyk close enough to get his attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who had to miss all of Friday's final full day of  
practice to practice and qualify for Saturday night's NASCAR 
Winston Open in Concord, N.C., was the only driver to beat Ray for 
the day's best speed on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The hottest of the current Winston Cup rookies, driving for Joe  
Gibbs Racing, turned a lap of 226.683 mph to top that day's speed 
chart. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even an embarrassing brush with the speedway wall late in  
Thursday's practice could stifle his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just need to get a break with the draw and the weather,''  
Stewart said. ``If we get the chance to run on Saturday, we'll be 
right there. If not, we'll qualify Sunday. Either way, the main 
thing is to win the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast for Saturday was calling for a 60 percent chance of  
morning rain, with afternoon clearing. A delay would cause big 
problems for Stewart, who must leave Indy by 1:30 p.m. to get to 
Concord for the stock car race. 
</P>
<P>
	The other part of the equation was the draw for positions in the  
qualifying line, which was to be conducted following the end of 
practice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Curry, co-owner of the team, pumped his fist in the air  
after drawing position No. 2 for the team's primary car and No. 17 
for Stewart's backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we just need the weather to cooperate,'' Curry said.  
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk, who won Indy poles in 1993 and 1997 and won the  
500-mile race in 1990 and '97, has been just close enough to Ray 
and Stewart to be optimistic about his chances of winning another 
pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Greg Ray has to be the favorite,'' said Luyendyk, who  
will retire from the cockpit following the race. ``He's been able 
to run 226 on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been able to run 225 on my own,'' added Luyendyk,  
referring to running without the help of the draft from other cars 
on the track. ``The key is going to be the conditions when you go 
out. This place is tougher than anywhere to gauge because even a 
small temperature change or wind change can make a huge 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk was right behind Ray in Friday's practice, turning his  
fast lap of the week at 226.131 -- the third fastest overall. Next 
was Luyendyk's Treadway Racing teammate Sam Schmidt at 225.468, 
followed by Scott Sharp at 224.792, defending Indy Racing League 
champion Kenny Brack at 224.087 and A.J. Foyt Racing teammate and 
last year's pole-winner Billy Boat at 223.847. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more crashes on Friday brought the total since practice  
began to 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Mike Borkowski, who also crashed Monday, and John Paul  
Jr. both hit the wall. Borkowski escaped injury, but Paul was 
admitted to Methodist Hospital with a severe back contusion and a 
back sprain.

<HEADLINE>  Police: Teen Brought Guns From Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The teen-age suspect accused of opening fire  
on classmates, wounding six of them, got his guns from a locked 
cabinet in his home and concealed the rifle he took to school in a 
pants leg, the sheriff said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockdale County Sheriff Jeff Wigington also said that  
investigators seized a videotape from a surveillance camera in the 
area where the shootings happened. They had not watched it as of 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day Heritage High seniors were looking forward to picking  
up their yearbooks, their suburban community became the new focus 
for a nation on edge after months of fear and concern about 
violence in America's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Six students were wounded in Thursday morning's attack, none  
critically. Two of the six were treated at a hospital and released 
Thursday. Two others were released today -- including a boy who said 
the shooter laughed during the attack -- while the other two, both 
girls, remained hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack was the sixth mass shooting at an American high  
school or middle school since October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, a 15-year-old sophomore friends said was upset over  
a failed romance, dropped to his knees and pointed the gun at his 
mouth after the shootings, witnesses said. A short time later, he 
aimed the gun at an assistant principal, then surrendered with a 
tearful: ``Oh, my God, I'm so scared!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wigington said today that the suspect broke into a locked gun  
cabinet in his family's basement to get the two weapons, a rifle 
and a .357 Magnum. He wouldn't say how the cabinet was broken in to 
but said it wasn't just unlocked. Wigington said he didn't know 
whether the boy's parents were aware the guns had been taken. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect fired 14 shots, 11 of them from the rifle and three  
from the Magnum revolver, according to a preliminary investigation. 
No bullets from the revolver hit anyone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wigington said the boy concealed the rifle in the leg of his  
jeans and the revolver in a book bag. He gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently he was shooting at the hip. Basically, he was not  
aiming the rifle at one particular person,'' Wigington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends identified the gunman as Thomas Solomon Jr., nicknamed  
T.J. He was charged with aggravated assault, and other charges were 
being considered. Solomon must appear in juvenile court before he 
can be charged as an adult, something not expected before Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in there laughing, jumping up and down,'' student Jason  
Cheek, who was wounded in the leg, said today as he left the 
hospital. ``He kind of had a natural high, pulling the trigger ... 
like it was some kind of game to him. He didn't seem like anybody 
that was angry to me. He just, he looked like he was just having a 
good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the shooting, Assistant Principal Cecil Brinkley followed  
the student outside toward the football field and asked the suspect 
to hand over the handgun, which at that point was raised at 
Brinkley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stepped back a couple of steps and I turned to him again and  
I said, 'Give me the gun,' and I said again, 'Give me the gun,''' 
Brinkley said today. ``I saw him lower the barrel of the gun and I 
kept getting closer and closer to him. Then I held out my hands and 
he laid the gun in my hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then he gave me a real big bear hug and he said, 'I'm scared,  
I'm scared,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes were canceled today, though students were expected to  
return to Heritage High on Monday. School officials said graduation 
would go on as scheduled next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, students streamed into Heritage Hills Baptist  
Church near the school to meet with counselors and ministers. Some 
teens hugged in the parking lot before going inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're just all trying to get our lives back,'' said  
senior Brian Skelton, 18, on his way in. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton received word of Thursday's shooting before he  
left for Littleton, Colo., for the one-month anniversary of the 
deaths of 15 people at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The news ``is deeply troubling to me, as it is to all  
Americans,'' Clinton said. As he spoke, the U.S. Senate was 
approving a proposal requiring background checks for all 
transactions at gun shows and for anyone seeking to reclaim a 
weapon at a pawn shop. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings came before the first bell sounded, when students  
in the commons area were gabbing and munching breakfast. It was the 
last day of class for the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	When the loud pops sounded out, some figured it was a prank --  
maybe firecrackers -- until they heard shouts of ``he's got a gun!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I walked into the commons area and heard the pops,'' said  
Michael Mellitto, an 18-year-old junior. ``I thought, `Ha, ha, very 
funny!' Then these girls come running past me, crying, saying, `I 
can't believe they shot him!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	In their panic, hundreds of crying teens jammed through doors to  
escape, some yanking up fallen friends, others jumping over them. 
One girl, lying on the floor, screamed ``I'm shot!'' and begged for 
her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of these same students and parents had watched television  
coverage of the Littleton shooting a month ago. That horror lasted 
for hours; the assault here was over in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You, like, watch it on TV and it's not your school and it's  
not like this,'' said Scottie Sanders, an 11th-grader struggling to 
reconstruct the morning's events. ``It was like a blur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heritage, 20 miles east of Atlanta, is a mostly white, suburban  
school, like Columbine High. About 80 percent of graduates go on to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the massacre in Colorado, Heritage had an armed  
sheriff's deputy on duty during school hours. Wigington said the 
attack happened before the deputy had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Dunn, a sophomore, said he had seen ``lots of guns'' at  
the suspect's home. Solomon was described as quiet, and several 
students said his grades had slipped lately and he had been heard 
making ambiguous comments about shooting someone. One said he 
didn't take Solomon seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Deeter, 15, a friend of the gunman, said Solomon was  
depressed after a girlfriend broke off their relationship this 
week. He was there as the attack began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I yelled to him, `Hey, what're you doing?' But he just kept  
shooting. And then the kid next to me got shot in the foot. Then I 
started to run,'' Deeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen-year-old Drake Hoy tried to run, too, but realized  
something was wrong with his foot: ``I took off my boot and there 
was blood and stuff everywhere.'' He was treated for minor wounds 
and released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside a closet, teacher Carol Ingle recited Bible verses to  
calm terrified students she had gathered there. One of them, 
freshman Stephanie Edwards, said: ``She told us it would be all 
right.''

<HEADLINE> Sanders Marries New York Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARROLLTON, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders  
was married today to New York actress and model Pilar Biggers, 
according to a statement released by a publicity agent for his 
pastor. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 31, and Biggers, 25, were wed in a small private  
ceremony on Nassau's Paradise Island in the Bahamas, according to a 
release from Bishop T.D. Jakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``After my divorce, God sent someone into my life who has helped  
me to see that life really does go on,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deion and I are so thankful for this moment,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bride, represented by the Ford Agency, has done editorial,  
catalog and runway modeling for designers Tommy Hilfiger, Guess and 
Richard Tyler, the release said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also has appeared in ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' ``Veronica's  
Closet,'' ``The Pretender'' and the 1999 movie ``The Mod Squad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple is expected to take an extended honeymoon before  
returning to Sanders' residence in the north Dallas suburb of 
Plano. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' first wife, Carolyn Chambers Sanders, originally filed  
for divorce in September 1996, but asked to dismiss the suit about 
a week later. At the time, Carolyn Chambers Sanders said she and 
her husband had reconciled. She filed for divorce again in March 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders underwent surgery last month on his left big toe and its  
affect on his football career was uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders injured the toe in the first quarter of the Cowboys'  
35-28 victory over Arizona last Nov. 15. He played briefly in the 
next game against Seattle, and then was out until the Cowboys' 
playoff loss to Arizona on Jan. 2. Dallas went 2-3 during the five 
games he missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys training camp begins July 26.

<HEADLINE> Cyclists Protest Renewed Blood Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOGGIA, Italy (AP) -- Some of cycling's top riders on Friday  
threatened to withdraw from the Tour of Italy if further drug tests 
are demanded by Italian sports authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood tests were performed on three teams by Italy's Olympic  
Committee before the start of Friday's seventh stage. The 
International Cycling Union conducted tests at the start of the 
race May 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending Giro champion Marco Pantani, Giro leader Laurent  
Jalabert and world road champion Oscar Camenzind contend the tests 
are unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an evident lack of respect for the cyclists. ... The  
next time we are ready to stop the race and return home ... most 
cyclists are ready to join the protest,'' Pantani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani won the Giro and Tour of France last year.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are not criminals ... we already undergo antidoping urine  
tests every morning,'' he said. ``It looks like a political move in 
occasion of Italy's most prestigious race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani and other cyclists said they do not oppose the drug  
tests by their governing organization, but they object to the 
duplicate tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Directors of the teams Mobilvetta, Ballan and Cantine Tollo,  
whose cyclists were tested Friday, also lamented the method used by 
doctors hours before the stage from Foggia to Lanciano. 
</P>
<P>
	Two unheralded cyclists, Nicola Loda and Javier Ochoa Palacios,  
were banned from the Giro and did not start last Saturday because 
their tests showed unusually high levels of red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
	High red blood cell count can be a sign of use of EPO, a banned  
substance. But the high count can also occur naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasquale Bellotti, secretary of Olympic panel, said he could not  
understand the protests by the cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's tests were part of the campaign to safeguard the  
cyclists' health,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Gandhi's Party Set For Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A former Congress party politician who  
was thrown out of the party for challenging Sonia Gandhi right to 
run for prime minister said Friday he would form a rival party to 
contest India's upcoming elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharad Pawar, a party boss from the western state of  
Maharashtra, and two others were expelled after demanding a 
constitutional amendment to bar foreign-born citizens from becoming 
prime minister. The Italian-born Mrs. Gandhi resigned as party 
president after the proposal was made, creating chaos in the 
Congress leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Once India's dominant party, Congress led India for 45 of its 52  
years as an independent nation, and was just beginning to recover 
from defeats in the previous two elections, in 1996 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Pawar said he would found a new party after a meeting Saturday  
with the other two expelled party members, Purno Sangma and Tariq 
Anwar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take a decision on a viable alternate platform within  
the next couple of days,'' Pawar told The Associated Press in a 
telephone interview from Pune, 100 miles south of Bombay, India's 
financial hub and his base. 
</P>
<P>
	``This alternative will be based on the ideology of the Congress  
party,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pawar and his allies will likely court defectors from the  
Congress and ally with other regional groups that could play a 
crucial role in the formation of the next government, expected to 
be another coalition since no single party is expected to dominate 
the parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi maintained her public silence, refusing to respond  
to party leaders and hundreds of supporters who have camped outside 
her New Delhi home, pleading with her to reconsider her 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	She canceled all public engagements Friday, the eighth  
anniversary of the assassination of her husband and former Prime 
Minister Rajiv Gandhi, including two rallies that had been planned 
to kick off the party's election campaign. She did attend a private 
morning prayer meeting at her husband's memorial, where she and her 
two children spread handfuls of jasmine petals on the tomb. 
</P>
<P>
	India's Parliament was dissolved last month after Prime Minister  
Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government was dislodged in a no-confidence 
vote and opposition groups failed to put together a new ruling 
coalition. Elections are set for September-October. 
</P>
<P>
	A split, just four months before national elections, would set  
back Congress' hopes to return to power. But the Congress shrugged 
off the political costs of the expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Pawar is getting much response,'' Congress  
spokesman Ajit Jogi said in New Delhi. ``Some people will break 
away, but you can't call it a split.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Money Going To Magnetic Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proposals for high-speed magnetic levitation  
trains from Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Atlanta will be among the 
seven projects sharing $12 million for further studies, an official 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements will be made by Transportation Secretary  
Rodney Slater in Baltimore on Monday. Following the studies, one of 
the seven ``maglev'' projects will be picked for development and 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Maglev systems, already being tested in Germany and Japan, use  
electromagnets to lift the train above ground and free it of 
speed-reducing friction. Such trains can travel up to 310 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A Federal Railroad Administration official, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, identified three of the selected projects: 
</P>
<P>
	--A 40-mile system linking Baltimore and its airport with the  
main train station in Washington, D.C. The trip could take 16 
minutes, compared with 40 to 50 minutes by conventional rail. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 45-mile system linking Pittsburgh's airport in suburban  
Coraopolis with the city of Pittsburgh and its eastern suburbs. 
Proponents eventually want to extend the system to Philadelphia, 
creating a two-hour Pittsburgh-Philadelphia trip that now takes 
eight hours on Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 40-mile portion of the 110-mile Interstate 75 corridor  
between Atlanta and Chattanooga, Tenn. The system was proposed by 
Atlanta officials.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Hampers McKinley Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Low on supplies and lashed by strong  
winds, three British mountaineers were stranded near the top of 
North America's highest peak early today as foul weather hampered 
efforts to rescue them. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio had hoped to make quick dash to the summit of Mount  
McKinley, but that gamble failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men, one of them too injured to travel, were pinned  
down at 19,000 feet on McKinley's challenging West Rib route. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers have had limited radio contact with the climbers,  
either because of transmission problems or dying batteries, 
National Park Service spokeswoman Jane Tranel said. They radioed 
for help early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the men were not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Tranel said they were traveling with little gear, apparently to  
make a quick trip to the 20,320-foot summit and back down to a camp 
at 15,700 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were low on food and other supplies in an area without  
much protection from McKinley's notorious winds, which Tranel said 
were blowing up to 50 mph. The temperature was expected to dip to 
minus-30 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor visibility has made rescue by helicopter untenable so far,  
Tranel said, but a high-altitude helicopter was ready to fly if 
visibility improved near the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service was forecasting partly cloudy  
conditions today, Tranel said, so an aerial rescue attempt was 
considered possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- University of Cincinnati football player  
DeMarco McCleskey was indicted on charges of raping a UC student in 
her dormitory room. 
</P>
<P>
	McCleskey, 18, was indicted Friday on two counts of rape and one  
count of aggravated burglary. If convicted, he could be sentenced 
to a maximum of 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said a 19-year-old woman reported that McCleskey entered  
her dormitory room between 1:30 a.m. and 2:30 a.m. on May 9 and 
forced her to have sex. The woman said she knew McCleskey and had 
previously turned down his request for a date. 
</P>
<P>
	McCleskey, from Claremore, Okla., has denied the allegations and  
is out of jail on $10,000 bond. He has been suspended indefinitely 
from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	McCleskey was UC's top running back last season and was named to  
Conference USA's all-freshman team. He rushed for 861 yards and 11 
touchdowns on 162 carries and led the Cincinnati Bearcats in 
rushing and scoring last season.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Visits New Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Decked out in a cowboy hat, first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton tasted a Southwest sampler of cultures, 
admiring the art and history of old Santa Fe, Albuquerque and 
ancient Acoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady on Friday toured a 360-year-old mission church at  
Acoma Pueblo, accepting Indian pottery from several artists. She 
viewed a monumental sculpture in a Hispanic neighborhood of 
Albuquerque and toured the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe, one 
of the oldest public buildings in North America, dating from 1610. 
</P>
<P>
	She later flew to Cortez, Colo., for a trip today to Mesa Verde  
National Park -- all part of her ``Save America's Treasures'' tour 
of the Southwest. The journey began Wednesday at the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	At Acoma, Mrs. Clinton was shown the water-damaged San Esteban  
del Rey mission church, built beginning in 1630. She announced a 
$75,000 grant for San Esteban from Cornerstones Community 
Partnerships, a Santa Fe group that restores old churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time of the first millennium, you were the only  
Americans here,'' she told a crowd of about 800. ``And when we talk 
about saving America's treasures, we have to begin by saving the 
first Americans' treasures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She toured Sky City, a village the Acoma tribe built atop a  
367-foot-tall mesa near Enchanted Mesa around 1200. The adobe and 
sandstone homes have no running water or electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 30 people are chosen for the honor of living  
year-round atop the mesa 50 miles west of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	In Albuquerque's Martineztown, Mrs. Clinton announced a $4,000  
National Endowment for the Arts grant to preserve the Southwest 
Pieta, a sculpture by Luis Jimenez. The 20-foot-tall statue of a 
man cradling the figure of a woman incorporates Aztec legend in 
traditional Christian form. 
</P>
<P>
	The Save America's Treasures program is a partnership between  
the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the White House 
Millennium Council that has raised more than $60 million for 
preservation.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Congressional investigators examining Atlanta's  
bid for the 1996 Olympics will be in Georgia next month to go 
through many of the records of the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation holds about 1,400 boxes  
of records that detail the committee's enticements to IOC members 
from 1988 to 1990, when Atlanta was awarded the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation has agreed to give the U.S. House Commerce  
Committee access to the records, even though the foundation is 
battling The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in court to keep them 
from being released publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Echols, a GAAF spokesman, said today the House committee has  
not determined how many of the records will be examined or how long 
the process will take. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not know what the inquiry's schedule is at this point,''  
Echols said. ``We are cooperating fully with the committee and will 
do whatever is necessary to do this review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee wants to determine if the boxes of records contain  
evidence of bribery similar to the scandal that has tainted Salt 
Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Grunfeld Sounds Vindicated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One month after he was removed as president and  
general manager of the New York Knicks, Ernie Grunfeld sounds like 
a man who feels vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people criticized what I did, but I did what was in  
the best interest of the organization,'' the deposed architect of 
the Knicks said Friday. ``I still feel very good about it, and now 
it's starting to come around and people are starting to see why I 
made the decisions I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld has been watching from afar as the team he built has  
started to thrive in the playoffs. Led by controversial new 
acquisitions Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby, the Knicks have a 
2-0 lead over Atlanta in the best-of-7 second round. 
</P>
<P>
	The series resumes Sunday afternoon with Game 3. Game 4 is  
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been more than a month since Grunfeld was reassigned to  
special consultant, a move made by Madison Square Garden president 
Dave Checketts while the team was floundering with a .500 record 
and in danger of missing the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The demotion all but ruined the relationship between Grunfeld  
and Checketts, who considered each other friends and whose families 
were close. 
</P>
<P>
	Refusing to call himself bitter, it's nonetheless clear Grunfeld  
feels a sense of betrayal from the organization he spent 18 years 
with as a player, broadcaster and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hurt,'' Grunfeld admitted in a telephone interview  
Friday after playing a round of golf. ``I was hurt by the events 
that happened and the timing of the events, but sometimes strange 
things happen in our business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good lesson for our family to see that things aren't  
always going to go perfect in your life, and sometimes you're going 
to have to regroup. My family grew up as a Knicks family, and the 
Knicks were a very important part of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard on them, but they're tough and were going to move  
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The demotion of Grunfeld has remained a hot topic of debate in  
New York for the past month as the team has begun to click on a 
consistent basis. A victory over the Hawks would put New York into 
the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, acquired by Grunfeld prior to the season for John  
Starks, Terry Cummings and Chris Mills, has scored 31 points in 
each of the first two games against the Hawks and is New York's 
leading scorer in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's on a level with Michael Jordan,'' Atlanta's Ed Gray said.  
``He's that type of player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Camby was the subject of much more criticism,  
including within the organization and especially with coach Jeff 
Van Gundy, because it cost the Knicks gritty veteran Charles 
Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
	But Camby has injected the team with a shot-blocking presence on  
defense and a youthful energy on offense that had been missing for 
the better part of a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby's devastating dunk over Dikembe Mutombo in Game 2, a play  
on which he took off from near the foul line, was exactly the type 
of moment Oakley was simply incapable of. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a lot of pride in the way things are coming around,''  
said Grunfeld, who has been watching the games on TV with family 
and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going to take a little longer than normal for  
this team to come together, but finally it is coming together and 
I'm really happy about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks, meanwhile, stayed in Atlanta on Friday for a long  
film session and practice. They will try to become just the eighth 
team in NBA history to come back from a 2-0 deficit in a seven-game 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh-and-two is not a good situation to be in, but it's not  
impossible,'' Steve Smith said. ``The Garden is the one place where 
you just like to play.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Local TV for Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Local television news, weather and sports  
broadcasts would be available on satellite TV systems just as they 
are on cable under bills passed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bills, approved by voice votes Thursday evening, would  
let DirecTV, EchoStar and other companies beam local broadcast 
signals to customers who use either pizza-sized satellite dishes or 
big ``backyard'' dishes no matter where they live. Under existing 
law, companies are barred from doing this. 
</P>
<P>
	A final bill could be enacted before June 30, Sen. Patrick  
Leahy, D-Vt., who helped write one of the Senate-passed measures, 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Some satellite customers who are illegally receiving distant  
network affiliates via satellite are supposed to be cut off from 
ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox signals on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Both bills, however, would delay those cutoffs for customers who  
live on the fringes of their local stations' coverage areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to have'' the final bill ``done before then so we  
don't have the `Perils of Pauline' aspect,'' said Leahy, the Senate 
Judiciary Committee's top Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills -- one originating in the Senate, the other passed by  
the House last month -- are slightly different and will be 
reconciled in a conference of House and Senate lawmakers. Each 
chamber will then vote on the product of that conference and, if it 
passes, send it to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures are intended to resolve a dispute between satellite  
companies and broadcasters over conditions under which viewers who 
get their television from satellite can watch broadcast TV 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bills, satellite TV customers wouldn't be forced to  
use rooftop antennas or subscribe to cable TV to receive local 
broadcast signals. They would be able to get them directly from a 
satellite company, probably for a small monthly fee. Eventually, 
the companies would have to carry all local broadcast stations in a 
given market. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite and broadcast industries generally support the  
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Both bills also would permit eligible satellite customers to  
continue receiving broadcast network programs from ``distant'' 
network affiliates as long as they satisfy certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing law lets satellite companies provide customers with  
``distant'' network signals, those from other broadcast areas, only 
if those customers cannot receive local stations using rooftop 
antennas. The current law doesn't take into account quality of 
local reception. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite and broadcasting industries have been at odds for  
years over how to interpret the arcane legal test that determines 
when a satellite customer can't get a local signal and thus is 
eligible to receive network programs by satellite. The bills would 
make some changes aimed at making it easier for satellite customers 
who get a poor local TV signal to be able to receive network 
signals on their satellite systems. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are H.R. 1554 and S 247.

<HEADLINE> Track Star Schwartz Dies at 87 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Elizabeth Robinson Schwartz, the first woman to  
win an Olympic gold medal in track, is dead at age 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz, who in 1928 won the gold medal in 100-meter dash in a  
then-world record 12.2 seconds, died Tuesday in Colorado. She was 
suffering from cancer and Alzheimer's disease, according to her 
son, Rick Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of the Chicago suburb of Riverdale, Schwartz also won a  
gold in the 400-meter relay during the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz began her track and field career at Thornton High  
School in suburban Harvey. Her biology teacher at the time was on a 
commuter train when he saw her running to catch the train. 
Astounded at the girl's speed, he suggested that they start 
training together, Rick Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100-meter Olympic race in Amsterdam was Schwartz's fourth  
competitive race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can remember standing in the middle of the field after the  
race and seeing the American flag raised and hearing the `Star 
Spangled Banner' and all the people singing it,'' she said in a 
1988 interview. ``Then I walked off the field and just kind of 
enjoyed the feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz's track and field career nearly ended in 1931 when she  
was seriously injured in a plane crash south of Chicago. Doctors 
said she wouldn't live, then they said she wouldn't walk, according 
to her son. She began training again shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she was no longer able to crouch down for the sprint  
position. She started running relays instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz retired from track shortly after the 1936 Olympics. She  
married Richard Schwartz in 1939 and often traveled the country 
speaking on behalf of the Women's Athletic Association and the 
Girls' Athletic Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz also is survived by a daughter and three grandchildren.  
Services will be private.

	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities have denied claims in a  
tabloid report that JonBenet Ramsey's brother is a suspect in the 
girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Burke is not a suspect,'' said Suzanne Laurion, a spokeswoman  
for Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke was 9 when his 6-year-old sister was found beaten and  
strangled in the family's basement in Boulder. He was the only 
person, other than JonBenet's parents, known to be in the house 
when she died on Christmas night in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said that the parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, remain  
under suspicion. A grand jury has been investigating the case since 
Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder city spokeswoman Leslie Aaholm said police want to talk  
more with Burke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to talk to him, which is something we've said  
all along,'' she said. ``We're simply trying to clarify that the 
police do not now nor have they ever considered Burke to be a 
suspect.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and its NATO  
partners struggled today to patch up differences over Kosovo while 
portraying Belgrade and its military as cracking after 59 days of 
airstrikes. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said London and 
Washington are in harmony on Kosovo strategy. The calendar is 
influencing NATO leaders' thinking because of the lead time 
required to reach either of two outcomes in Kosovo before the 
typically harsh Balkan winter sets in -- the resettlement of ethnic 
Albanian refugees in Kosovo under a peace agreement, or entering 
Kosovo forcibly to end the conflict.

	FDA Approves New Painkiller Vioxx  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has approved a new painkiller  
that could provide stiff competition to one of the nation's 
best-selling drugs. Merck &AMP; Co.'s Vioxx was approved today, and the 
company said the prescription drug should be in pharmacies by 
mid-June. The Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vioxx

<HEADLINE> Leetch Nears Deal With Rangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Rangers have all but wrapped up a  
new contract with all-star defenseman Brian Leetch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to say 100 percent, but barring something  
unforseen, the deal should be completed shortly,'' Rangers 
spokesman John Rosasco said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosasco said that an announcement on Leetch's signing was  
``imminent.'' The Rangers and (Leetch's agent) ``Jay Grossman have 
been working hard the last 10 days. It just came together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosasco would not confirm that Leetch had agreed to a four-year  
contract worth $35 million, as had been reported in the Daily News, 
or that a news conference would be scheduled Monday to announce the 
signing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to say ... until Brian signs a contract,''  
Rosasco said. Leetch is currently on vacation and expected back 
after the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Grossman was not immediately available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	With the retirement of Wayne Gretzky, and the Rangers missing  
the playoffs for a second year in a row, it became imperative for 
them to sign Leetch, their captain and highest profile player along 
with goaltender Mike Richter. Richter is currently under a 
long-term contract signed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Leetch wants to stay with the team he has played with since  
coming to New York following the 1988 Olympics. In re-signing with 
the Rangers, he will miss an opportunity to test the free-agent 
market and become perhaps the first $10 million player in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	The News said the agreement to the record-setting contract was  
reached Wednesday night. Leetch's $8.75 million annual salary would 
be the highest in team history and the highest among NHL 
defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	There were many teams interested in Leetch, who has won the  
Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenseman two times and generally 
regarded as one of the best players in the game for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Leetch totaled 55 points -- fifth among defenseman -- this season.  
He is third on the Rangers' career scoring list with 177 goals and 
578 assists for 755 points -- leading all defensemen in the team's 
history.

<HEADLINE> US Orchestra Gives Concert in Hanoi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Young communists in red scarves, girls in  
frilly party dresses and a whole lot of grown-ups flocked to 
Hanoi's opera house today for a children's concert given by the 
Philadelphia Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, the first U.S. symphony orchestra to visit Vietnam,  
decided to give the free concert as a gift to the children of Hanoi 
ahead of a regular performance Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Music is the only language in the world everyone can  
understand,'' conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch said before the 
hourlong performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by Coca-Cola, whose sign hung prominently over the  
stage of the gilded French colonial rococo opera house, the concert 
began with the American and Vietnamese national anthems. 
</P>
<P>
	The program included easy-to-listen-to classics such as Dvorak's  
``Carnival Overture'' and Beethoven's ``Symphony No. 2'' before 
wrapping up with a rousing rendition of D'Souza's ``Liberty Bell 
March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 600 people attended the concert and applauded the  
conductor as he introduced each piece. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the concert began, 16-year-old Ngo Thu Trang said she  
hoped it would pave the way for more visits by American groups, but 
preferably rock bands -- ``like the Backstreet Boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at the end, Vietnamese concertgoers said they thoroughly  
enjoyed their first live classical concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets were meant to be free for the public, but several  
concertgoers got theirs through friends working in the government 
or at local companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, women sold the supposedly free tickets for $10 -- more  
than a week's salary for an average Vietnamese factory worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The orchestra also will perform in Ho Chi Minh City before  
moving on for concerts in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Taipei, 
Taiwan. It already has performed in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Orchestra, which will have its 100th  
anniversary season next year, also was the first U.S. orchestra to 
go to China, in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	It is accompanying Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge's trade and  
culture mission to Asia.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Vs. Chang in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Top-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Martina Hingis  
got tough pairings in today's draw for the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov will play Michael Chang in the first round in a match  
between two former French Open champions. Hingis faces a possible 
match against Amelie Mauresmo in the second round, a rematch of 
their contentious Australian Open final. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament, the only major played on clay, begins Monday at  
Roland Garros. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov was the French Open winner three years ago and Chang  
triumphed in 1989 when he was 17. If Kafelnikov beats Chang he 
could face two-time Roland Garros winner Jim Courier in the fourth 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Moya begins his title defense against Markus Hipfl, and  
would face Petr Korda or Alberto Martin in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Sampras, who has never won the French Open, starts against  
Juan Antonio Marin of Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
	If the No. 1 player advances, he could face Thomas Enqvist in  
the fourth round and 1997 champion Gustavo Kuerten in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi could play 1998 French Open semifinalist Cedric  
Pioline in round two and 1995 French Open winner Thomas Muster in 
the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	Another first-round highlight features Patrick Rafter against  
world junior champion Roger Federer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, seeking her first championship win at Roland Garros,  
should beat Amanda Hopmans of the Netherlands in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	She would then face Mauresmo if the Frenchwoman downs Tara  
Snyder of the United States in their first-round match. 
</P>
<P>
	That meeting could reopen the flap before the Melbourne final  
when Hingis described Mauresmo, who is gay, as ``half a man.'' 
Mauresmo disparaged Hingis for the remark. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have since played once, when Mauresmo beat Hingis at the  
Gaz de France indoor tournament in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario faces 17-year-old  
Croat Marjana Lucic in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 5-seeded Venus Williams takes on France's Alexandra Fusai in  
the first round while her younger sister Serena plays Laurence 
Courtois of Belgium. The sisters cannot meet before the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Lindsay Davenport takes on countrywoman Jane Chi in the  
first round.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Clinton Secrets in Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Highly classified U.S. documents in a new book  
divulge a wealth of secrets, including that North Korea's leader 
crushed a 1995 coup attempt and President Clinton assured Boris 
Yeltsin that U.S. policy would have a ``positive impact'' on the 
Russian leader's re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents also detail how Navy intelligence used the cover  
of a Coast Guard ship inspection to search for laser weapons aboard 
a Russian ship. None were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the government is prone to leaks, the unauthorized  
publication of classified documents that in most cases are just a 
year or two old is rare. It has touched off widespread concern in 
the intelligence community. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the kind of material that people file lawsuits to  
obtain after it's 30 years old,'' said Steve Aftergood of the 
Federation of American Scientists, a Washington group that follows 
intelligence issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``These documents carry some of the highest classifications in  
the U.S. government and it's absolutely astonishing that they would 
be published in this way,'' Aftergood said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Betrayal'' by Bill Gertz, a reporter for The Washington Times,  
presents a critical account of Clinton administration security 
policy that tracks closely to stories Gertz has written over the 
last several years. The original articles, however, did not include 
reprints of the classified documents. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials interviewed Thursday confirmed the authenticity  
of the documents and voiced concern. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior administration official, who spoke only on condition  
of anonymity, said the White House didn't consider any of the 
published information embarrassing but was concerned about risk to 
intelligence sources and methods. 
</P>
<P>
	For several years, the FBI has been trying to identify Gertz's  
sources, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	CIA Director George Tenet has complained about a  
``hemorrhaging'' of classified information. Tenet has not blamed 
the news media, focusing instead on ``people who believe they 
derive some power from leaking classified information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gertz, in a telephone interview, declined to discuss his  
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	But his book states the Clinton administration carried out a  
policy of appeasement of real or potential U.S. enemies that ``so 
angered some intelligence, defense and foreign policy officials 
that they responded in the only way they knew how: by disclosing to 
the press some of the nation's most secret intelligence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gertz wrote that his sources were ``unsung heroes'' who  
``jeopardized their careers to expose wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book's appendix reprints all or part of 23 documents from  
the Clinton administration -- some as recent as last year -- ranging 
in classification from confidential to top secret. Several are 
marked ``umbra'' or ``gamma,'' code words for information derived 
from electronic intercepts. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 U.S. intelligence report disclosed that the North Korean  
government had detailed three cases of cannibalism stemming from 
famine. It was classified at the ``code word'' level, among the 
highest levels of classification. 
</P>
<P>
	A secret dispatch written last August by Larry Robinson, a State  
Department official in Seoul, raised questions about leader Kim 
Jong-Il's hold on power. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is extensive evidence of a major coup attempt by  
elements of the VI Corps in 1995, which appears to have been 
crushed only with some difficulty,'' the dispatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	A March 1996 State Department memorandum, marked  
``confidential,'' summarized Clinton's meeting with Yeltsin at a 
terrorism summit in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told Yeltsin he ``wanted to make sure that everything  
the United States did would have a positive impact and nothing 
should have a negative impact'' on Yeltsin's upcoming re-election, 
the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo added that the United States wanted an upcoming summit  
with the Russian leader to be successful to ``reinforce everything 
that Yeltsin had done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An April 1997 Pentagon report described how the Navy inserted an  
intelligence team into a Coast Guard inspection crew that searched, 
unsuccessfully, for evidence of the laser weapon aboard a Russian 
merchant ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo alleged the ship was involved in spying on U.S.  
submarines and appeared to direct a ``laser emanation'' at a 
helicopter carrying a Navy officer. No weapon was found. 
</P>
<P>
	And a 1997 CIA report, based in part on electronic intercepts  
and spy satellite imagery, indicated Russia was building a bunker 
and subway line for use in evacuating leaders in a military 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of the documents' messages were serious. The March 1996  
memo detailed an offer Yeltsin made in jest after Clinton handed 
him a document translated only in English. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreign Minister (Yevgeny) Primakov said that he could read  
it, and Yeltsin joked that since Primakov knew English, Secretary 
(of State Warren) Christopher should now learn Russian,'' the memo 
related. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russians would be glad to provide the secretary with a  
young attractive instructress who would work with the secretary 
night and day.'' Clinton joked that would change Christopher's 
droll image, the memo said.

<HEADLINE> Bay Area Baseball Competing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Baseball in the Bay Area was an afterthought during the  
multimillion-dollar spending spree in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Brown went to Los Angeles for $105 million. Anaheim signed  
Mo Vaughn for $80 million. Randy Johnson got $52.4 million to go 
Arizona. Texas brought back Rafael Palmeiro for $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	While their division rivals were signing the most expensive free  
agents, Oakland and San Francisco were hunting the bargain racks 
for overlooked veterans and minor league free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Their most expensive additions? Tony Phillips, who signed for  
$700,000 with the Athletics, and Scott Servais, who got $500,000 
from the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being last in their divisions in payroll, the teams are  
doing well so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't concern ourselves with how much money we spend,''  
Giants first baseman J.T. Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco, which entered the weekend a half-game behind  
Arizona in the NL West, has been in first or second place all but 
11 days since April 12, 1997. Oakland was second in the AL West 
going into the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Good young pitchers have helped the Giants, who lost their only  
star, Barry Bonds, to an elbow injury last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Ortiz has a good fastball, a durable arm and is 5-2 with a  
2.53 ERA. Chris Brock, discarded by the Braves, is 4-3 with a 4.01 
ERA, and Joe Nathan, a converted shortstop who gave up baseball for 
a year, has shown a lively arm and is 2-0 with a 2.42 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``On paper, we don't look as good as other teams, but when we're  
on the field, we can play together and that's the key,'' San 
Francisco's Stan Javier said. ``It never bothered us that we were 
picked to finish last. It's better that people take us lightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the NL West in 1997 and losing a one-game  
wild-card playoff to the Cubs last season, Dusty Baker's Giants 
probably can't be called a big surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one expected Oakland to contend. The A's finished last in  
1998, put ace Kenny Rogers on the trading block in spring training 
and have a skimpy $22.8 million payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	However, an odd mix of old and new -- the opening day roster had  
five players younger than 25 and five older than 37 -- has worked 
despite slow starts by Rogers, Tom Candiotti and Rookie of the Year 
Ben Grieve, who is hitting .144. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing is we are winning and we still haven't swung the  
bats all that well,'' Mike MacFarlane said of the A's, who are last 
in the AL in batting average. ``We're kind of waiting for all that 
to jell and come together. When that happens, we'll get on a good 
roll again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, who has improved nearly every team he has gone to with  
his patience at the plate and aggressiveness everywhere else, was 
baseball's best free-agent bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old Phillips seems to get better with age. He has a  
.389 on-base percentage, 33 runs and a surprising nine homers. But 
it's his influence on the young players that might be most 
important. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of those guys; you hate playing against him but you  
love playing with him,'' MacFarlane said. ``He's a leader on the 
team and an example. You can't find a better one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The A's have also gotten surprise production out of John Jaha  
(.343, 8, 27), who nearly retired because of foot injuries, and 
Olmedo Saenz (.300, 2, 15), signed as a minor league free agent 
from the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is surprised at how well we're going but me,''  
Phillips said. ``Every spring training, you go into the season with 
the attitude that you want to win your division and go to the 
playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While that still seems improbable, the A's do have one advantage  
over their rivals in the AL West, who must try to trade for 
pitching down the stretch. Oakland has last year's No. 1 pick Mark 
Mulder (2-2, 3.73) and Tim Hudson (2-0, 2.83) waiting at Triple-A 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PINS AND NEEDLES:* After two major operations in the last three  
years and thousands of pitches by his right arm, David Cone was 
supposed to be in the twilight of his career, not at the peak. 
</P>
<P>
	But a new offseason plan has given the 36-year-old pitcher a  
little extra life on his fastball and more command on the mound. 
For the first time, Cone didn't pick up a baseball at all this 
offseason, and he began acupuncture treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems to have paid off. Through the first six weeks of the  
season, Cone is 4-2 and leads the majors with a 1.69 ERA for the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't get as sore for whatever reason,'' said Cone, who  
is able to throw between starts again, something he rarely did last 
year. ``I want to be in this for the long haul. The real test comes 
in September, but I just know I'm better this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone gives a lot of the credit to acupuncture. He has even flown  
up from Florida the husband-and-wife team that worked on him this 
winter for some in-season treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had never been to New York before, it was kind of cute,''  
Cone said. `'I took them to Chinatown.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO EXCUSES:* Expos manager Felipe Alou doesn't want to hear his  
players gripe anymore about the small crowds in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dustin Hermanson and other players have complained about the  
lack of crowd support. The Expos have averaged only 9,630 fans in 
their first 22 home games amid rumors they will relocate after the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to hear players criticizing the crowd or our  
situation here -- it's not fair,'' Alou said. ``The question I would 
ask myself is: What am I doing for the cause? 
</P>
<P>
	``If I go 3-for-15 or bat .180, I don't want to say to my club  
that the only reason I didn't win was because there were no people 
there. That record will be there forever. There will be no 
asterisk. It won't say how many people were watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one of Alou's players agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have no excuses,'' Michael Barrett said. ``We go on the  
road and there's big crowds and our road record is no better.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BASE HITS:* Three top left-handed pitching prospects,  
baseball's rarest commodity, got promoted this week. Atlanta called 
up Bruce Chen (3-2, 2.30 in Triple-A) to the majors Friday. St. 
Louis' Rick Ankiel (6-0, 0.91 in Double-A) was promoted to Triple-A 
Memphis and Baltimore moved Matt Riley to Double-A Bowie after he 
posted an 0.57 ERA in his last four starts at Class A. ... Not only 
did Don Zimmer keep the Yankees in first place for Joe Torre, he 
added 21 wins to Torre's career record. According to the Elias 
Sports Bureau, the Yankees 21-15 record under Zimmer will count 
officially for Torre. Stat of the week: Pudge Rodriguez has stolen 
11 bases while allowing only three while he is behind the plate for 
Texas.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Stars Head Early to NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Duke's Elton Brand and Connecticut's Richard  
Hamilton, two of the top players in college basketball, are leaving 
school early to join the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, college basketball's player of the year as a sophomore,  
and Hamilton, who helped Connecticut win the national championship 
as a junior, were among 39 players who have filed as early-entry 
candidates for the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, a 6-foot-8 forward, averaged 17.7 points, 9.8 rebounds  
and 2.21 blocked shots in leading Duke into the NCAA championship 
game against UConn. Hamilton, an All-American, helped UConn win its 
first NCAA title after averaging 21.5 points and 4.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of underclassmen also includes Rhode Island's Lamar  
Odom, the Atlantic 10 tournament MVP. Odom, a 6-10 sophomore 
forward, averaged 17.6 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.8 assists for 
Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft is scheduled for June 30 at the MCI Center in  
Washington. Players who have filed for early entry can withdraw 
from consideration by notifying the NBA at least one week prior to 
the draft. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-Prison Staffer Probed in Escape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A former prison psychologist who allegedly sent  
a convicted robber revealing photos of herself is under 
investigation on suspicion of helping him and another inmate make 
their getaway after an escape. 
</P>
<P>
	State police are investigating Elizabeth Feil, 43, in connection  
with the escape Tuesday night of Byron Lester Smoot and Gregory Lee 
Lawrence, said Ms. Feil's lawyer, Isaac Dixon. Both inmates were 
recaptured two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon would not provide details regarding Ms. Feil or disclose  
her whereabouts. Police said the inmates had at least one 
accomplice, but they wouldn't confirm whether Ms. Feil was thought 
to have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Bosshard, Ms. Feil's husband, said two state police  
officers came to his Annapolis home early Wednesday morning and 
told him his wife was a suspect. The police cited photographs of 
Ms. Feil, dressed in black lingerie and a garter belt, found in 
Smoot's cell, Bosshard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosshard said he took the photographs of his wife 11 years ago  
while they were vacationing. He said that based on the photographs, 
he believes his wife had an affair with Smoot while he was behind 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are estranged as of two days ago,'' he said Friday. ``Up  
until that point, I thought we were deeply in love. You have no 
idea how devastated I am by this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence, 39, was serving a life sentence for murder after  
shooting a man and stealing his shoes in 1978. Smoot, 38, was 
imprisoned for a rash of armed robberies and was sentenced to 29 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoot and Lawrence escaped Tuesday night when they walked past  
an unmanned guard tower next to the front gate at the Maryland 
Correctional Institute, a medium-security prison in Jessup. They 
scaled two fences, one topped with razor wire, where police found 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
	A bloodhound picked up a scent that led to a phone booth about  
two miles away, where police suspect one or both inmates got a 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were recaptured Thursday afternoon in Baltimore, where they  
lived before going to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosshard said his wife agreed to help police find the two  
prisoners if she would be free from prosecution. It was not known 
if such a deal was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosshard said his wife worked for the Patuxent Institution, a  
maximum-security prison in Jessup, but was fired last year. It was 
not known if she currently has a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland correctional officials would not comment on Ms. Feil's  
employment. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told me she had been fired because she was trying to  
institute a program for better inmate conditions. I'm not sure of 
anything she told me now,'' Bosshard said.

<HEADLINE> Widespread Abuses Found in Customs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Customs Service created ``a fear of  
reprisal'' among employees who reported wrongdoing and mishandled 
investigations so that wayward agents were neither disciplined nor 
prosecuted, a Treasury Department audit says. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency that runs the nation's ports of entry promoted  
employees who had been disciplined for infractions and let managers 
investigate subordinates despite clear conflicts of interest, the 
Treasury Department inspector general reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was presented to the Senate Finance Committee, which  
is conducting a major review of the Treasury Department agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Murphy, a spokesman for Customs Commissioner Raymond  
Kelly, said Kelly immediately began addressing these problems after 
assuming his post nine months ago -- and already has made changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The former head of the internal affairs unit was replaced, an  
impartial board was established to handle discipline problems and a 
``cold case unit'' was formed to review old investigations and 
reopen them if necessary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said Kelly recognized that the agency's internal affairs  
office -- which was singled out in the report for mishandling 
investigations -- ``was a fractured organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among key findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--A supervisor who had been drinking with an employee was placed  
in charge of the investigation when, the night of the imbibing, the 
employee drove a government vehicle under the influence of alcohol 
and left the scene of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	--An inspector who admitted placing marijuana in a passenger's  
luggage was only admonished by a supervisor, and later received 
seven cash awards and one promotion over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Investigators never tried to resolve conflicting witness  
statements during the investigation of an inspector who admitted 
placing marijuana in the luggage of a cruise ship passenger. The 
case never was presented to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	--There is no indication that prosecutors were told of an  
employee involved in smuggling of aliens. 
</P>
<P>
	--A prosecutor concluded a sensitive corruption investigation was  
compromised when an internal affairs agent assigned to the case was 
promoted as a supervisor of the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	--Awards and promotions were granted to employees who were under  
investigation and later disciplined. Others received promotions 
after discipline, including an agent who had made false statements 
and obstructed justice. The agent was never prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	--A case was not thoroughly pursued and subsequently closed, even  
after law enforcement sources provided information that an employee 
was involved with individuals suspected of money laundering, gun 
running and armored car robberies. 
</P>
<P>
	``One AUSA (assistant United States attorney) described IA  
(internal affairs) as dysfunctional and almost unwilling to enforce 
criminal laws,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report concluded, ``There is an overall perception of  
favoritism in the application of the disciplinary process, and in 
many instances, there is a fear of reprisal from management for the 
reporting of wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, the agency spokesman, said Kelly replaced the head of  
internal affairs with a career Justice Department official. 
</P>
<P>
	To end the perception of unfairness, Murphy said, the agency now  
sends serious disciplinary cases to a national review board rather 
than a local manager. 
</P>
<P>
	And nobody becomes a manager without a complete review of the  
official's past record, Murphy said.

<HEADLINE> Regulators Watch ATM Service Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Banking regulators have ordered a big ATM  
company serving banks in 13 western states to provide assurances by 
June 30 that it is ready to address the Y2K computer glitch, or 
face possible contract cancellations by 750 banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The directive given to TransAlliance LP by the Federal Reserve  
and four other agencies reflects the increased attention being paid 
to banking industry support companies to make certain they are 
prepared for the year-end computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A failure by these service companies to become Year-2000  
compliant could be just as devastating as a failure by the banks 
themselves, officials said. Scenarios of a Y2K failure range from 
consumers being temporarily unable to use ATM machines to having 
their entire financial information wiped out when computer systems 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Government regulators have lauded the nation's banking industry  
for its work preparing for the technology problem, when some 
computers originally programmed to recognize only the last two 
digits of a year could interpret 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement with regulators, TransAlliance will make  
needed changes in its computer systems so that all its bank 
customers will be able to successfully complete their Year 2000 
testing by June 30 -- the deadline set for banks by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	TransAlliance, based in Bellevue, Wash., agreed to have its own  
systems ready by that date. ``We are pleased that we could agree 
with the regulators on the steps we are taking to ensure Y2K 
readiness,'' James D. Benson, TransAlliance's president and chief 
executive officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company provides automated teller machine services,  
including electronic transaction services, to some 750 banks, 
thrifts and credit unions in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, 
Hawaii, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, 
Washington and Wyoming as well as British Columbia in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	A random sample of interviews of people who use ATMs in Seattle,  
Wash., suggested that while most are not worried about the Y2K 
problem, they also plan to put a little money aside -- and keep 
closer recores -- in case something goes wrong with the machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it'll be fine,'' said Jocelyn Francis, 30 of Seattle,  
who said she does all her banking through ATMs. Still, she said 
she's worried about possible minor distruptions and plans to take 
some money out early. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Hopps of Maple Valley, Wash., said he's being more careful  
on keeping paper records of all his transactions to keep better 
track of his bank balance as the end of the year approaches -- just 
in case. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic Data Systems, the technology company founded by  
billionaire Ross Perot, owns 50 percent of TransAlliance. The other 
half is owned by a group of 24 banks in the West which operates the 
Exchange ATM network. Its customers include Washington Mutual Bank, 
KeyCorp, the credit union for employees of Boeing Co. and First 
Mutual Bank of Bellevue. 
</P>
<P>
	Although TransAlliance provides electronic services to some  
50,000 outlets where machines take cards for payment at gas 
stations, convenience stores and other locations, that system is 
not covered by the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In the event the conditions weren't met, the banks that  
TransAlliance serves would be allowed without penalty to annul 
their contracts with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators also would have the authority to impose fines on  
the company, but that isn't mentioned in the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association,  
said the regulators ``are doing their job and making sure that 
consumers' money is safe. ... It brings pressure on companies that 
provide services to financial institutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers have promised consumers that ATM machines, credit cards,  
checks and banking services will function normally through the 
millennial date change. However, banks, thrifts and credit unions, 
all of which are closely regulated, are linked with numerous 
companies that provide services to banks and operate with less 
government supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these (service) firms may not be ready for the Year  
2000,'' said Edmund Mierzwinski of U.S. Public Interest Research 
Group, a consumer advocacy organization. ``I'm happy that the 
Federal Reserve is putting its foot down early.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Approves Lightning Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- It's official. Michigan billionaire William  
Davidson is the new owner of the Tampa Bay Lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of the struggling NHL franchise received the unanimous  
approval of the league's board of governors on Friday. In March, 
Davidson reportedly agreed to pay about $115 million to add the 
team to an entertainment empire that includes the NBA's Detroit 
Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson made a contingency-burdened offer to buy the Lightning  
from Japanese holding company Kokusai Green, which rejected him and 
sold the team instead to Palm Beach insurance tycoon Art Williams 
for a no strings-attached bid of $117 million in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams cleared the 8-year-old franchise of debt, but incurred  
self-projected losses of up to $20 million as the last-place team 
struggled on the ice and at the gate last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Pistons, Davidson's Palace Sports and Entertainment  
Group includes the WNBA's Detroit Shock, the International Hockey 
League's Detroit Vipers, the Palace of Auburn Hills arena in 
suburban Detroit and the nearby Pine Knob Music Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lightning sale includes the team's lease to the Ice Palace  
arena and six acres of nearby undeveloped real estate in downtown 
Tampa.

<HEADLINE> US Moves Toward Marijuana Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to pressure from scientists and  
voters, the Clinton administration loosened restraints Friday on 
medical marijuana research. The move is expected to prompt more 
studies to see if the drug helps people with AIDS, cancer or eye 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists with private grants will now be able to get legal  
marijuana from the government's supply -- grown on a small plot of 
land in Mississippi to make sure it's all the same strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, only scientists who had won federal grants had  
access to that marijuana. And only a few such federal studies have 
been approved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all thought the time was right'' for the new guidelines,  
said Steven W. Gust, a special assistant to the director of the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes 
of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidelines were created after Cabinet-level discussions  
among agencies involved in America's war on drugs, including the 
Department of Health and Human Services, NIH's parent agency, plus 
the Justice Department, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the 
White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, Gust said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug control office, headed by Barry McCaffrey, favors  
marijuana studies ``as long as they pass a peer review process to 
make sure the research is good science,'' said Charles Blanchard, 
the office's chief counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey has opposed actions by states to permit medical uses  
of marijuana, claiming that would prejudge serious scientific 
research. Two recent expert reports recommended more research on 
marijuana, citing evidence of its possible benefits to some 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Mississippi grows the government-approved  
marijuana on 1.8 acres at a closely guarded site. A crop is 
harvested on alternate years. So far that has been more than enough 
to supply the few approved researchers, Gust said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new guidelines do prompt more research, the agency is  
prepared to grow more marijuana, opening up additional fields if 
necessary and planting every year instead of alternate years, Gust 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new guidelines, privately funded researchers  
conducting ``scientifically valid investigations'' reviewed and 
approved by the National Institutes of Health will be allowed to 
purchase the government marijuana. The price for Uncle Sam's pot 
has not been set, and the drug is not expected to be ready for 
researchers until December. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cancer, AIDS and glaucoma patients already use marijuana,  
often bought illegally on the street. At least six states have 
passed measures to permit the drug's medicinal use if prescribed by 
a physician. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law, however, bans the drug. And many doctors are  
reluctant to approve it for their patients because of the 
controversy over its benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The tough federal stance on medical marijuana prompted some  
doctors in California to get a court injunction to block what they 
feared would be federal reprisals for prescribing marijuana to 
patients under that state's compassionate-use laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts found in two recent reports that marijuana for some  
patients is effective in relieving pain, nausea and vomiting caused 
by cancer and AIDS. Some glaucoma patients also smoke the drug to 
help relieve pressure inside the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 report by a National Institutes of Health panel concluded  
that there is enough evidence about marijuana's benefits to merit 
further research. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the  
National Academy of Sciences, also urged scientific research. The 
institute also favored compassionate permits for use of the drug by 
patients who were not helped by other medications. 
</P>
<P>
	Four federally financed research projects are ongoing, NIDA  
officials said. Three other proposals failed to get federal money 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Thomas of the Marijuana Policy Project said his group is  
pleased the guidelines will encourage more research, but he said 
the action will not help patients in pain who need the drug now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very disappointed that they failed to approve  
single-patient, compassionate use, as the Institute of Medicine had 
recommended,'' Thomas said.

<HEADLINE> Fugitives May Have Jumped Wyo. Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAWLINS, Wyo. (AP) -- Authorities feared today that two  
survivalists suspected of killing a Colorado policeman last year 
jumped a train to elude capture this week in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty confident we did a pretty good job of covering  
what we could, given the darkness and all,'' said Carbon County 
Sheriff Jerry Colson. ``We were all over the county.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies continued searching today for Alan Pilon and Jason  
McVean. Authorities suspect they robbed a restaurant bar Wednesday 
near South Pass City, a ghost town that has been restored as 
tourist attraction in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Colson said he feared that Pilon and McVean hopped an eastbound  
train late Wednesday. Deputies were checking transients and 
passengers on Union Pacific trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilon and McVean are accused of killing Dale Claxton in Cortez,  
Colo., on May 29, 1998. The officer was slain with automatic 
gunfire during a traffic stop before he could unbuckle his seat 
belt. In an ensuing chase and shootout, two sheriff's deputies were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of officers couldn't find the men after they  
disappeared into the rugged terrain of the Four Corners region, 
where New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Arizona meet. An alleged 
accomplice was found a few days later, dead from a self-inflicted 
gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects in the Wyoming robbery wore military boots and ski  
masks and took about $500. No one was hurt. They escaped in a 
stolen white truck and abandoned the vehicle at a gas refinery 
before fleeing on foot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colson said a caretaker at the plant identified the suspects as  
Pilon and McVean based on photographs. Authorities were awaiting 
the results of tests on fingerprints from the truck to verify the 
suspects' identity.

<HEADLINE>  Stars-Avalanche Set To Face Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Ed Belfour of the Dallas Stars is intent on  
shaking his reputation as a goaltender who can't win the big one. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be no better way to do it than by outdueling  
Colorado's Patrick Roy in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	When the series begins Saturday, Belfour and Roy will be going  
head-to-head in the playoffs for the first time since a 1996 
second-round series between Colorado and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour and the Blackhawks won the first game. Then he  
contracted food poisoning and missed Game 2. When he returned, 
Belfour played great, but Roy was even better as the Avalanche went 
on to win the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	That title further cemented Roy's status as the gold standard of  
goalies. It was the third time his name went on the trophy and it 
came under the pressure of having been acquired at midseason 
specifically for that type of postseason leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy did it again last round as Colorado went from being down 2-0  
as the series shifted to Detroit, then winning four straight to 
eliminate the two-time defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no better playoff performer than Patrick,'' Avalanche  
coach Bob Harley said. ``He feels that pressure. He lives for that 
pressure. He can handle that pressure while raising his own game 
and force the guys around him to raise their own game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is what a true leader will do for a hockey club.''  
</P>
<P>
	Dallas gave Belfour a three-year, $10 million contract last  
season to be that kind of leader. He lived up to the challenge as 
the Stars rode their hot goalie to the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with the series 1-1, Belfour made mental blunders in  
consecutive games that led directly to Detroit goals. The Red Wings 
won the series in six games and back came the talk that the 
ultra-intense Belfour couldn't put a team over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour's pattern of grand success followed by failure began in  
1992 when he helped Chicago win 11 straight playoff games, then was 
swept by Pittsburgh in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Belfour became just the fifth goalie with multiple  
40-win seasons, then lost four straight in the playoffs. Another 
one-round exit followed in '94. Chicago reached the finals again in 
1995, but Detroit won three overtime games to advance. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this postseason, Belfour has been superb. His 1.68  
goals-against average is best among the four remaining playoff 
goalies and he and Roy are tied for the best save percentage at 
.929. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little things aren't bothering him,'' said Mike Keane, who was  
traded to Colorado with Roy in 1995 and joined Dallas last season. 
``Some teams have tried to get under Eddie's skin, but he's not 
really worried about stuff like he was last year. He won't take a 
whack at a guy or start chirping at them. He's just stopping pucks. 
That's what we need from Eddie Belfour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Belfour won't be spooked by  
having Roy in the opposite net, but also said he doesn't expect his 
goalie to be motivated by Roy's presence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Eddie's gone a long ways past that now,'' Hitchcock  
said. ``Eddie's more into the light at the end of the tunnel. I 
think his own personal challenges are within, and they're all 
structured around our team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just see him more focused on his job and not on the  
peripheral stuff that comes with this business. I watch his 
routine. He wastes no extra energy on any other area that is not 
relevant to winning hockey games. I think being able to do that is 
what makes special athletes special.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Provide Colombia Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department promised Friday to  
provide documents on U.S. contacts with Colombian guerrillas that 
were subpoenaed by Republican congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Committee on  
Government Reform, issued the formal demand this week for records 
of e-mail messages and phone conversations involving State 
Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton has been critical of U.S. dealings with the Marxist FARC.  
The Clinton administration said the contacts were at the request of 
the Colombian government and in the interest of achieving peace, 
but Burton contends they violate long-standing policy of not 
negotiating with terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are being fully responsive to the request from Congress for  
information, and we intend to turn over the relevant documents,'' 
department spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the department already offered to make available  
reports of its meetings with FARC, the Revolutionary Armed Forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin would not comment on a Friday report in The Washington  
Times that a State Department official had e-mail and telephone 
contact with the FARC. He said department lawyers advised that it 
was more important to respond to the legal requirements of the 
subpoena than to respond to questions on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has until May 28 to honor the congressional  
subpoena.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Push Gun Debate in House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to capitalize on momentum, Democrats  
are pushing for House action by Memorial Day on the juvenile 
justice bill and its new gun restrictions just passed by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Republicans, anxious to let the issue cool, refused to  
budge Friday from their plans to hold committee hearings on the 
matter next week with no floor debate until mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to make sure that we do this in a reasonable,  
rational and responsible way,'' said John Feehery, spokesman for 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the families of the slain victims and those  
wounded in the Columbine High School shootings in Colorado last 
month as well as the students wounded Thursday in Georgia deserve 
quicker action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not take a Memorial Day recess until we pass a  
proper memorial for the slain students in Littleton, Colo., and 
other school gun tragedies,'' said Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, 
the Judiciary Committee's ranking Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the push, President Clinton urged 18 House Democrats  
on Friday to keep up the pressure for a quick vote. He is expected 
to devote his weekly radio address Saturday to the same message. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Democratic and administration aides, Clinton told  
lawmakers at the White House that ``we shouldn't settle'' for only 
the Senate-passed restrictions and should push in the House for 
additional measures raising from 18 to 21 the legal age for 
possessing and purchasing handguns, semiautomatic assault-style 
weapons, and high-capacity ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	But as lawmakers headed home for the weekend, Democrats had no  
consensus on what gun measures they wanted the House to vote on 
next week. Some wanted to pursue Clinton's demand for a limit of 
one handgun purchase per month, a proposal that Senate Democrats 
rejected because it was unlikely to win enough Republican support 
for passage. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans, for their part, were eager to let the issue  
to cool after it caused a public relations meltdown for their party 
during two volatile weeks of Senate debate. To that end, House 
Republicans were expected to change the subject in their weekly 
radio address from guns to proposals that would limit the ways 
Congress can spend Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Public sentiment and Democratic pressure in the wake of the  
Columbine shootings prompted Senate Republicans to retreat on gun 
policy several times before lawmakers there included new firearms 
restrictions in the juvenile justice bill that passed Thursday, 
73-25. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a member of the National Rifle  
Association's board, Republicans initially defeated a Democratic 
amendment to the bill to require background checks on all firearms 
purchases at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a half-dozen rank-and-file Republicans complained to  
Craig a few hours later, Republicans agreed to make those checks 
mandatory. By the final vote, senators of both parties also 
approved measures that would require background checks for all gun 
transactions at pawn shops and all handguns to be sold with trigger 
locks. 
</P>
<P>
	In an additional defeat, public pressure to pass a juvenile  
justice bill forced Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to 
back down on his threat to kill the bill outright. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning finale just hours after the shootings in suburban  
Atlanta, Vice President Al Gore, a White House hopeful, broke a tie 
and cast the deciding vote in favor of a Democratic amendment 
imposing still more restrictions on guns that the Senate had 
rejected a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, more Republicans voted for the underlying bill,  
sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, than opposed it. Lott was 
among the senators who voted for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats rejoiced, declaring victory over a powerful gun lobby  
whose long-standing influence in the halls of Congress made such 
new restrictions improbable at best before the Colorado shootings. 
As Democrats crowed, Lott advised Democrats and the rest of 
Congress to ``move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the political dust settled Friday on the Senate side of the  
Capitol, House leaders kicked up more even before any real 
bipartisan talk had begun on the content of their version of the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, criticized Minority Leader  
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., for trying to break what Delay said had been 
an agreement a day earlier to hold hearings on the matter next week 
and debate in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all quite surprised that Mr. Gephardt did not stick to  
our agreement,'' DeLay said in a statement. ``To address this issue 
in a haphazard fashion does not do justice to the victims of 
violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt, who had rejected that timetable from the House floor  
Thursday, denied Democratic leaders had ever struck such a deal and 
lobbied for quicker action. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time did Mr. Gephardt agree to the Republican plan,''  
Gephardt's spokeswoman, Sue Harvey, said in a statement. ``Any 
statements to the contrary are false.''

<HEADLINE> No Record Tax Surplus Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alas, there was no April budget surprise this  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department reported Friday that the federal  
government ran a large surplus last month of $113.5 billion. But 
unlike in the past two years, that was right in line with 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 and 1998, huge surpluses far surpassing forecasts were  
recorded for April, including a record $124.6 billion surplus for 
April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	That unforeseen revenue, which came is as millions of taxpayers  
filed income tax returns, helped congressional and White House 
negotiators reach agreement in 1997 on a five-year plan to balance 
the budget, then to actually accomplish the feat ahead of schedule 
in 1998, when the government recorded a $64.9 billion surplus, the 
first time that had occurred in 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the $113.4 billion surplus for April this year was slightly  
lower than many private economists had forecasted, and it was 8.9 
percent below last year's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, private economists said the federal government is likely  
to achieve an even bigger annual surplus this year, projected by 
the Clinton administration to reach $79 billion for the fiscal 
year, which ends on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first seven months of the fiscal year, through April,  
the surplus totaled $64.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on track to reach the largest annual budget surplus  
ever,'' President Clinton said in a statement Friday after the 
April budget figures were released. But he added, ``Despite the 
good news, this is not a time for complacency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the new figures dashed hopes that extra revenue  
would make it easier to provide tax cuts or shore up Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who was hoping for a sudden boost, a much bigger  
surplus that would provide them a little room to do something, it's 
just not going to be there,'' said Stanley Collender, senior vice 
president of the consulting firm Fleishman Hillard. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for the lower April surplus this year as compared to  
last April was an increase in tax refunds of almost 59 percent, to 
$36.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	That reflects the new $400 per child credit and new credits for  
higher education as well as the increasing popularity of electronic 
filing and direct deposit, which offer speedier refunds than paper 
tax returns and paper checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Year to date, tax refunds are up nearly 33 percent compared to  
the corresponding period in fiscal 1998.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Rangers and captain Brian Leetch  
have agreed to a four-year, $35 million contract, the Daily News 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement to the record-setting contract was reached  
Wednesday night, but won't be formally signed or announced until a 
press conference at Madison Square Garden on Monday, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leetch's $8.75 million annual salary would be the highest in  
team history and the highest among all NHL defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Leetch scored 55 points -- fifth among defenseman  
-- this season. He is third on the Rangers' career scoring list with 
755 points -- leading all defenseman.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Seek To Protect Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spurred by testimony from two women  
strip-searched by U.S. Customs agents, a Georgia congressman is 
drafting legislation to guarantee basic rights to international 
travelers detained at American airports for drug searches. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said the testimony Thursday by Amanda  
Buritica of Port Chester, N.Y., and Janneral Denson of Palm Beach, 
Fla., reminded him of his treatment by Mississippi authorities when 
he was arrested and strip-searched after the Freedom Rides during 
the civil rights movement in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	``We no longer live in an America that will tolerate the basic  
civil liberties of our citizens being violated by law enforcement 
officers,'' he said. ``We have worked too hard and come too far to 
turn back the clock of civil rights at our nation's borders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Buritica, a Colombian-born U.S. citizen, said she was  
strip-searched and forced to take laxatives by agents who suspected 
her of carrying drugs when she arrived at San Francisco 
International Airport in 1994 on a flight from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so embarrassing,'' she said, describing how she was  
forced to remove her clothes and get down on her hands and knees. 
``It was the most humiliating thing I have ever had to go 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Denson said she was almost seven months pregnant when she  
arrived at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in 
1997 on a flight from Jamaica. She said Customs agents 
strip-searched her, took her to a hospital, forced her to take a 
laxative, and shackled her to a bed for two days so they could 
monitor her bowel movements. Eight days later, she said, her son 
was born prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we do not know what permanent effects the  
premature birth will have on my son,'' she said. ``There is not a 
waking hour that goes by that I don't worry about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No drugs were found on either woman. A jury awarded Ms. Buritica  
$450,000 last year in her lawsuit against the Customs Service. Ms. 
Denson's lawsuit against the agency is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The two women testified at a House Ways and Means oversight  
subcommittee hearing into allegations that Customs officials have 
been selecting airline passengers for drug searches based on their 
race. Ms. Denson is black, and Ms. Buritica is Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said 43 percent of those stopped by Customs in 1998 were  
black or Hispanic, and black women are 20 times more likely to face 
body searches than white women. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly said agency policy prohibits  
the selection of search targets on the basis of race, but he 
conceded that there might be ``a mindset'' among some agents that 
leads to racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to ferret it out,'' he said, insisting that racial  
bias ``will not be tolerated as a Customs Service practice 
anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response to a recent spate of allegations of racial  
profiling, Kelly appointed an independent commission last month to 
review the agency's policies and practices. He said he has ordered 
several internal changes, including requiring that all personal 
searches be authorized by a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kelly said such searches are necessary because drug  
smugglers are using all types of people to carry drugs into the 
country hidden on and inside their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs officials said 64 percent of the nearly 3,000 pounds of  
heroin seized in the U.S. last year was taken from airline 
passengers, including 640 pounds concealed inside bodies. A 
kilogram of heroin, or 2.2 pounds, will bring $200,000 on the 
street and provide fixes for 40,000 junkies, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said his legislation would require that travelers be given  
access to an attorney within 24 hours of being detained, that a 
magistrate approve any detention beyond 12 hours, and that Customs 
inform travelers of both their rights and search processes and 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it also would require Customs to keep annual data on the  
race and sex of passengers stopped and searched and provide annual 
training and retraining of all inspectors, especially in the area 
of racial sensitivity.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Kosovo Spending Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a $15 billion  
spending bill Friday to support the military operation in 
Yugoslavia and peace in the Middle East, and provide relief to 
Central American hurricane victims and Midwest farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing so, Clinton set aside his objections to several  
``ill-advised'' items added to the measure in Congress. But he 
warned that he would reject future budget bills that include 
extraneous riders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that members attached unnecessary and  
ill-advised special projects onto essential emergency 
legislation,'' Clinton said in a statement issued by the White 
House. ``Were it not for pressing needs in Kosovo, Central America, 
the Middle East and America's heartland, I would have rejected 
several of these measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 64-36 on Thursday to approve the measure sent  
over by the House on Tuesday. Clinton put pen to the paper in the 
Oval Office on Friday, ending three months of wrangling over the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a real emergency here,'' said White House press  
secretary Joe Lockhart, explaining why Clinton signed a bill he had 
so many reservations about. ``The emergency need takes 
precedence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials criticized a provision forbidding the  
federal government from claiming any of the $246 billion the states 
have won from tobacco companies in a legal settlement. Clinton 
wanted to use some of that money for health care and antismoking 
initiatives. But the nation's governors welcomed the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``States now have the certainty and flexibility to meet the  
health and welfare needs of the citizens in their own states,'' 
said the chairmen of the National Governors' Association, 
Republican Michael Leavitt of Utah and Democrat Thomas Carper of 
Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	In defeats for the environmental lobby, the measure will delay  
tighter restrictions on mining companies that use government lands. 
Higher royalties on oil companies that drill on federal property 
also will be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration warned that it wouldn't accept efforts to  
attach similar provisions to other spending bills this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is no way to do the people's business,'' Clinton said.  
``The Congress should not permit, and I will not tolerate, special 
interest meddling as we complete the annual budget process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives criticized the package because it is stuffed with  
local provisions that they said were hardly the emergencies the 
bill proclaims them to be. These included $250,000 to help 
revitalize a downtown Los Angeles neighborhood; $2 million to 
intensify security at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in 
Washington; and increased federal payments to some Northwestern 
wheat farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	They also complained that all but $2 billion of the measure's  
price tag would be paid with this year's federal surplus, which 
comes completely from Social Security -- money Republicans had 
pledged to leave alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders focused on the bill's $12 billion -- double Clinton's  
request -- for the conflict with Yugoslavia, the Kosovo Albanian 
refugees, Balkan countries near the fighting and U.S. forces around 
the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill will keep our military readiness strong,'' Clinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill included $1 billion to help Central American and  
Caribbean nations recover from last fall's deadly hurricanes, Mitch 
and Georges and $900 million to help victims of the recent killer 
tornadoes in the Midwest. The measure also has $574 million to help 
American farmers facing low prices for hogs, wheat and other 
commodities.

<HEADLINE> Revlon Stock Up on Buyout Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Revlon Inc.'s stock rose today on a report that  
the struggling cosmetics company was in talks to sell all or part 
of the company to leading fragrance maker Coty Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest surge in Revlon's stock since the company  
confirmed in early April that it was seeking to sell some of its 
divisions. In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, 
Revlon's stock was changing hands at $31.12 1/2, up $1.87 1/2 or 6.4 
percent from its closing level yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock had traded as low as $13.62 1/2 on March 19, before  
merger rumors began circulating. Other rumored bidders have 
included Unilever, the maker of Calvin Klein and Elizabeth Arden 
cosmetics and fragrances, 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman for both Revlon and Coty declined to comment on the  
report of the talks, which were first reported by The New York 
Times on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Billionaire Ronald O. Perelman, chairman and chief executive of  
Revlon, owns 83 percent of the company's stock through his firm 
MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon's sales and profits have been slipping amidst cutthroat  
competition in the cosmetics field, and the company has a heavy 
debt burden of about $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Revlon makes Revlon and Almay makeup, Flex shampoo and Charlie  
perfume. Coty, which is owned by the Dutch holding company Joh. A. 
Benckiser, makes several leading fragrances, including Vanilla 
Fields for women and Stetson for men.

<HEADLINE> Peca Taking Lead for Sabres / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Wiry, bespectacled Michael Peca of the  
Buffalo Sabres is no menace in street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	On the ice, the former Selke Trophy winner as the NHL's top  
defensive forward has been quite a bit of trouble for the likes of 
Alexei Yashin, Jason Allison and Mats Sundin. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wouldn't know it to look at him, but he's probably one of  
the best open-ice hitters in the game,'' Buffalo center Brian 
Holzinger said. ``He knows how to hit people and when to hit 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin and the Ottawa Senators were swept by the Sabres two  
rounds ago, and Peca kept Yashin from collecting any points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Bruins, alluding to Peca's smothering of Allison for  
much of the six-game second round, accused the Sabres captain of 
``getting away with murder'' after Peca's hit on Bruins captain Ray 
Bourque. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eastern Conference final between Buffalo and Toronto starts  
Sunday. Peca will zoom in on Sundin, who has four goals and five 
assists in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Peca insists the isolated matchups are lost in the big picture.  
``It's a team game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But every good hockey team has a virulent pest. For the Sabres,  
now that Matthew Barnaby is with the Pittsburgh Penguins, that job 
belongs to the 5-foot-11, 181-pound Peca. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play tough against him,'' said Maple Leafs  
defenseman Dimitri Yushkevich, who could be assigned to pester Peca 
while Peca dogs Sundin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we'll make a couple of hits on him and see how he feels  
about it,'' Yushkevich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We might put a big guy back in and try to pound him,'' said  
Maple Leafs coach Pat Quinn, who has 6-6 Chris McAllister and 
pugilist Tie Domi ready to go. McAllister was a healthy scratch in 
the Leafs' 4-2 series win over Pittsburgh. Domi has been cleared to 
play after recovering from a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't surprise Peca that the Leafs have tried to intimidate  
him before he can intimidate them. But he doesn't believe in 
off-ice ploys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they think they're psychologists and they know how to  
get into people's heads,'' Peca said Friday. ``I don't get involved 
in those things. If somebody wants to take a run at me, then so be 
it. It's happened before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peca does a lot more than bother people. He leads the Sabres in  
scoring with four goals and seven assists in the playoffs, 
including a shorthanded goal, and his forechecking is relentless. 
</P>
<P>
	With Buffalo's leading scorer Miroslav Satan day-to-day with an  
ankle bruise sustained in the Ottawa series, the Sabres need all 
the offense they can muster. Peca's shooting and playmaking skills 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gives us defense and offense,'' Holzinger said. ``That's a  
good mix to have, especially in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another plus for Peca is that he's playing healthy. Buffalo  
advanced to the conference finals last year, but Peca wasn't much 
of a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	He went into the playoffs last year with a sprained knee and  
reinjured it in the second round. As if that weren't enough 
agitation, his wedding date looked like it could collide with a 
possible Game 6 in the Stanley Cup finals. His teammates teased him 
about china patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	This season the Sabres look to Peca for leadership, not laughs.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different story in this year's playoffs because he's  
matured as a player,'' said linemate Dixon Ward. ``When you look at 
the careers of veteran leaders around the league, you can always 
look back and see defining moments that catapulted them into the 
spotlight. This is a start for Mike in that direction.''

<HEADLINE> Details of Gun-Control Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some questions from polls released this week on gun control and  
school violence. When results don't total 100 percent, the 
remainder did not know or refused to answer. 

</P>
<P>
	--What do you think is more important -- to protect the right of  
Americans to own guns, or to control gun ownership? (Pew Research 
Center) 
</P>
<P>
	Protect rights to own guns, 30 percent; control gun ownership,  
65 percent. The number who want to give priority to controlling gun 
ownership rose 8 percentage points since a poll in December 1993. 

</P>
<P>
	--Do you favor or oppose stricter gun control laws in this  
country? (ABC-Washington Post) 
</P>
<P>
	Favor -- 67 percent; oppose, 31 percent. That's about the same  
level of support as when that question was asked in March 1993. 

</P>
<P>
	--Would you favor or oppose a law that banned the sale of  
handguns? (Pew Research Center) 
</P>
<P>
	Favor, 44 percent; oppose 50 percent. That level of opposition  
is the same as in a December 1993 poll. 

</P>
<P>
	--Do you think that TV news is too full of violence, or not? (Pew  
Research Center) 
</P>
<P>
	TV news too full of violence, 63 percent; News not too full of  
violence, 33 percent. The 63 percent is an 11-point increase from 
1993 in the number of people concerned about TV news violence. 

</P>
<P>
	--Are there any groups at your school who you think are violent  
or capable of violence based on what they do, what they say, or 
what they claim they will do? (Gallup poll of teens.) 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, 46 percent; no, 54 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	--Which political party, the Democrats or the Republicans, do you  
trust to do a better job of handling the issue of gun control? (ABC 
News) 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, 39 percent; Republicans, 31 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	The Gallup telephone poll of 403 teens, ages 13-17, was  
conducted May 5 to May 17. It has a margin of error of plus or 
minus 5 percentage points. The Pew telephone poll of 1,179 adults 
was taken May 12-16 and has an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 
percentage points. The ABC-Washington Post telephone poll of 761 
adults was taken Sunday and has an error margin of plus or minus 
3.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Climbers Recuperate After Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Three British climbers were plucked off  
North America's highest peak after a blizzard forced them to 
retreat just 300 feet from the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopters on Friday ferried the three to a hospital to  
recuperate after battling hypothermia since the storm hit Mount 
McKinley on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the group tried to retreat from the blizzard, Nigel Vardy,  
nearly blinded by frostbite, stumbled. That sent him and his 
roped-together companions, Antony Hollinshead and Steve Ball, on a 
300-foot tumble. 
</P>
<P>
	They called for help. While they waited for rescue, temperatures  
dipped to 30 degrees below zero, with 50 mph winds. The men had 
taken no sleeping bags or shelter on their final push for the 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Badly frostbitten and exhausted, Vardy, 29, and Hollinshead, 33,  
were picked up from the mountain early Friday in a daring 
high-altitude helicopter rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball, in better shape, had tried to descend to a ranger camp  
Thursday afternoon for help. But he didn't make it and was found 
Friday afternoon at the 17,500-foot level, severely hypothermic, 
dehydrated and with a broken left leg, said Jane Tranel, a Park 
Service spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball, 42, was in critical condition Friday night, a nursing  
supervisor said, and doctors were still trying to determine the 
extent of his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Vardy was in serious condition Friday with severe frostbite.  
Hollinshead, also frostbitten and with an injured shoulder, was in 
fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
	About 350 climbers now are on Mount McKinley. Ten people have  
reached the summit so far this spring, said Tranel of the Park 
Service.

<HEADLINE> Relations in Space Similar to Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Astronauts someday may slip the bonds of Earth  
and race across the heavens toward new planets, but they're going 
to take along the all-too-human emotions that plague everybody 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	A psychiatrist who studied astronauts and cosmonaut crews said  
Thursday that after a few months of tight confinement in space, 
irritability tends to set in. Leadership erodes, cliques develop 
and everybody gets mad at Mission Control back on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Nick A. Kanas of the University of California, San  
Francisco, said outbursts of emotion may be inevitable in outer 
space, but he and other experts are developing ways to teach the 
astronauts how to cope. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to train the crews before they go up, so they will be  
aware of what is happening and can apply some self-correction to 
prevent onboard tension,'' said Kanas, a speaker at the annual 
meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Anger in space, by astronauts and cosmonauts, has been common  
since early in the manned space program. Some Apollo crews in the 
1960s griped at Mission Control even during short-duration 
missions. On Skylab missions that lasted up to 84 days in the 
mid-70s, astronauts regularly ranted about their workload and 
malfunctioning equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tempers also flashed occasionally aboard Mir, the Russian space  
station where astronauts and cosmonauts spent months in an aging 
craft prone to breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Kanas said, he expects anger and tension to be a part of  
missions to the International Space Station in the next decade, and 
again on the 2-to-3-year-long missions to Mars expected in the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is hard to live with two or three people in space for  
months,'' Kanas said. ``If you have a fight on Earth, you can go 
out to a movie or something and it is all better. But in space, you 
can't go anywhere. You are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Research on the Mir suggests that highly professional space  
travelers do well for several months, working smoothly and 
compatibly with each other, Kanas said. But eventually, emotions 
tip over and tempers flare. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians believe it starts after just a few months. Kanas'  
research suggests it takes up to four months before emotions boil 
to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	What happens, he said, is that crew compatibility breaks down,  
with some members ganging up on others. The dynamics of onboard 
leadership may change in subtle ways. And the crew develops a 
tendency to blame Mission Control for all problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a feeling that things are tough on board and nobody  
cares on the outside,'' Kanas said. 
</P>
<P>
	In severe cases, the powerful emotions affected sleep, attention  
to work and even caused physical weakness. Experts are still 
searching for answers, but Kanas said studies have established some 
fundamentals: 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of people in a crew is crucial.  
</P>
<P>
	``Three is the most difficult number for a crew. With three,  
somebody is excluded. You have a majority and one is a loner,'' 
said Kanas. ``Eleven and nine are good numbers. For instance, you 
might have a majority of six, but those in the 'out' group still 
have somebody to talk to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--A variety of people may be better than a crew of one sex, one  
race or one nationality. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a school of thought that diversity during a long-term  
space mission might be a positive, because it keeps them interested 
in each other longer,'' Kanas said. ``I would guess that the first 
trip to Mars probably will be multicultural, with at least two 
languages and include at least one woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Studies suggest, he said, that crew members who are well  
traveled, sophisticated and able to speak different languages ``are 
used to working with other people and will be less tense and more 
cohesive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The compatibility of crew members can be evaluated in advance.  
</P>
<P>
	Russians, the world's leaders in long-term space flight, pay  
much attention to how cosmonauts get along and base crew selection, 
in part, on compatibility. Crew members work together for a year 
before launch, and if tensions develop, they are broken up. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, crew members are excluded based on  
``obvious psychopathology,'' but selecting for compatibility ``is 
not well developed,'' Kanas said.

	ACOMA PUEBLO, N.M. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, decked out in  
a cowboy hat and turquoise, toured an ancient Indian village atop a 
sandstone mesa Friday to promote the preservation of America's 
past, including a 360-year-old mission church. 
</P>
<P>
	``After all, at the time of the first millennium, you were the  
only Americans here,'' Mrs. Clinton said, drawing enthusiastic 
applause from a crowd of 800 people at the Acoma Pueblo. ``And when 
we talk about saving America's treasures, we have to begin by 
saving the first Americans' treasures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton visited Acoma, Santa Fe and Albuquerque on Friday  
on a tour of the Southwest. She visited Arizona on Wednesday and 
then headed later in the day to Mesa Verde National Park in 
Colorado for a Saturday tour of Cliff Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sky City, the Acomas' ancient village atop a 367-foot mesa,  
she toured the water-damaged San Esteban del Rey, a massive adobe 
Roman Catholic mission built in the 17th century. She collected 
handmade pottery from more than a dozen Acoma artists and watched 
two traditional dances. 
</P>
<P>
	A 93-year-old potter, Concepcion Faustine, is among 30 people  
who live year-round atop the mesa, which has no electricity and 
only three cisterns to collect water. Most residents haul water 
from a pool 14 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton and the tiny, bent-over woman embraced, and the  
potter, tears in her eyes, kissed Mrs. Clinton on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	``No other first lady or president has ever come to our sacred  
place,'' former pueblo Gov. Ron Shutiva said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was in the Southwest to promote the Save America's  
Treasures program, a public-private partnership between the 
National Trust for Historic Preservation and the White House 
Millennium Council. 
</P>
<P>
	It has raised more than $60 million, including $30 million in  
federal funds, to protect threatened cultural treasures, including 
documents, maps, arts, journals and historic structures.

	Georgia Boy Got Guns at Home  
</P>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The teen-age suspect accused of opening fire  
on classmates, wounding six of them, got his guns from a locked 
cabinet in his home and concealed the rifle he took to school in a 
pants leg, police said today. Authorities also said that 
investigators seized a videotape from a surveillance camera in the 
area where the shootings happened. Thomas Solomon Jr., 15, was 
charged with aggravated assault after allegedly shooting six 
students yesterday, none of whom were critically injured. The 
attack was the sixth mass shooting at an American high school or 
middle school since October 1997.

	NATO Reportedly Bombs Prison  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO bombed a Kosovo jail six times  
today, killing at least 19 people and injuring scores in the 
initial strikes, Yugoslav media reported. Meanwhile, a new tide of 
Kosovo refugees poured across Yugoslavia's borders into Albania -- 
breaking a weeklong lull. Many in the wave of 3,700 spoke of Serb 
security forces ordering them to leave their homeland. After days 
of reports of desertions by Yugoslav army reservists, the 
government said troops who showed up in two Serbian towns this week 
were just soldiers returning home as part of a reduction of forces.

	Clinton Signs Kosovo Spending Plan

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a $15 billion  
spending bill today to support the military operation in Yugoslavia 
and peace in the Middle East, and provide relief to Central 
American hurricane victims and Midwest farmers. In doing so, 
Clinton set aside his objections to several ``ill-advised'' items 
added to the measure in Congress. But he warned that he would 
reject future budget bills that include extraneous riders.

	Clinton Lawyers Address Contempt

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- President Clinton should pay no more than  
$33,737 in legal reimbursements for being found of contempt of 
court in Paula Jones' sexual harassment case, his attorneys told a 
federal court today. Mrs. Jones' lawyers recently asked that U.S. 
District Judge Susan Webber Wright order Clinton pay nearly 
$500,000. The proposal from Clinton's lawyers came a month after 
Wright found Clinton in contempt for giving intentional, false 
testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his 
January 1998 deposition in the sexual harassment case.

Mahoney said the parting was amicable, although sources close to 
the candidate suggested it resulted partly from a power struggle. 
Mahoney, however, had assumed an unusual amount of control for a

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened narrowly higher. The  
Dow Jones industrial average is up eight points in today's early 
going. Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 5-3 lead 
over decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up ten points and the S&AMP;P 500

</P>
<P>
	There is an absence of market-moving news today: no big economic

	And analysts say because of that, the market will likely  
continue its recent drifting pattern.

<P>
	This week has seen relatively low trading volume, small moves by  
the major market averages, and little in the way of market 
volatility.

<HEADLINE> Many Plan To Withdraw Cash for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost two-thirds of people questioned in a  
survey about the Year 2000 computer problem said they expect to set 
aside extra cash in the days before New Year's, but most said it 
won't be a large amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gallup poll of 1,606 adults, released today, also showed  
that the vast majority -- nearly 79 percent -- said they fully expect 
the Y2K problem to have ``little or no impact'' on their personal 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings reflect a shift in the nation's mood -- from early  
fears of Y2K problems causing widespread failures to more recent 
views that the date rollover will more likely present scattered 
inconveniences. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted by telephone, was commissioned by Star  
Systems Inc., the nation's largest electronic banking network, with 
its Honor and Star automated teller machines, which serve 79 
million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the public is becoming more confident as they learn  
more about Y2K preparations, including testing, that the financial 
and electronic funds transfer industries have been making,'' said 
Ronald V. Congemi, Star's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Congemi said the results showed 80 percent of people expect to  
be able to conduct transactions at ATMs or grocery stores and gas 
stations on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're excited that consumer confidence has risen so high,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government experts have lauded the nation's financial industry  
for its work preparing for the technology problem, when some 
computers originally programmed to recognize only the last two 
digits of a year could interpret 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Most financial institutions -- which are federally regulated --  
have set June 30 as a target date for completing all their Y2K 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-four percent of those surveyed said they plan to withdraw  
extra cash before Jan. 1, but 52 percent said the amount won't 
exceed what they typically spend for a weekday, weekend or holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, these people will follow the advice of numerous  
government and consumer organizations, recommending that people 
make any withdrawals in small increments well in advance of Dec. 
31,'' Congemi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey was conducted April 7-22, with a margin of  
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today as investors,  
worried about the effect rising interest rates might have on 
big-name stocks, moved money into small-cap issues. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed down 37.46 at 10,829.28. Broader stock 
indicators were mixed. Most indexes were lower, but advancers 
outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange. Advancers and 
decliers were about even on the Nasdaq stock market. The Nasdaq 
composite fell 21.59 to 2,520.64. ``Some of the money coming out of 
the large-cap stocks is just looking for a new home,'' said Tony 
Cecin, director of institutional trading at Piper Jaffray in 
Minneapolis. Today was a ``double witching'' day, when stock and 
index options expire and traders adjust their portfolios. There was

	2 Bomb Threats at Kmart in Michigan  
</P>
<P>
	TROY, Mich. (AP) -- Kmart Corp. closed its suburban Detroit  
headquarters and sent 3,500 employees home early this afternoon 
after receiving two bomb threats, the nation's No. 3 retailer said. 
The first threat came in about 7:30 a.m. and the second shortly 
after noon, company spokesman Stephen Pagnani said. Police swept 
the building and failed to find any bomb, he said. He said he had 
no idea why the caller or callers may have made the threats. 
However, Kmart has received more than 200 angry calls this week 
from National Rifle Association supporters following talk show host 
Rosie O'Donnell's verbal tussle with actor Tom Selleck on her show. 
O'Donnell is a celebrity spokeswoman for Kmart. Selleck recently 
filmed an ad for the NRA.

	FCC Told To Review Phone-Fee Plan

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A battle over fees that make up a big part of  
long-distance bills is headed back to federal regulators. A federal 
appeals court said the way the fees were calculated wasn't 
adequately explained. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia today ordered the Federal Communications Commission to 
review part of a 1997 decision that resulted in lower phone bills 
for millions of Americans. The United States Telephone Association, 
which represents local phone companies, had maintained that the 
agency's calculations made unjustified cuts to the fees. AT&AMP;T and 
MCI had challenged the calculations on grounds that the agency 
should have adjusted the formula to result in deeper cuts.

with the government to say when the Justice Department first 
learned of his $10 billion purchase of Netscape. Case was 
interviewed today in preparation for the next phase of the trial of 
the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp. Microsoft 
lawyers focused on AOL's purchase of Internet pioneer Netscape, 
which was publicly announced last November, after executives from 
both AOL and Netscape testified against Microsoft. Case defended 
AOL's conversation with Justice Department lawyer David Boies, 
saying that if trial testimony approached the secret negotiations, 
``We would have some problems and have to object to those 
questions.''

		   Buyers Cautious About Online Food  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some of the Internet's elite, such as retailer  
Amazon.com and the founder of software pioneer Netscape, are 
betting big money that consumers will soon be salivating over the 
idea of buying everything from fresh tuna steaks to raisin bran 
online. It's all about experience, and and offering something 
better than the consumer can get at the store, according to Michael 
May, an analyst at Internet research firm Jupiter Communications. 
Online grocery sales totaled just under $150 million last year, 
less than 1 percent of the more than $440 billion in total 
supermarket sales, according to Jupiter. While Jupiter expects 
sales to rise to more than $3.5 billion by 2002, the market is 
developing slowly as Web grocers gear their businesses to the needs 
of individual communities rather than take the riskier route of 
going global.

company, TransAlliance LP, agreed to the regulators' conditions in 
a signed document, the Federal Reserve and four other agencies 
announced today. Under the agreement, TransAlliance will make 
needed changes in its computer systems so that all its bank 
customers will be able to successfully complete their Year 2000 
testing by June 30 -- the deadline set for banks by the federal 
government. TransAlliance also agreed to have its own systems ready

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Drops Internet Chat Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When the Raytheon Co. suspected some employees  
were chatting behind its back on the Internet, the defense 
contractor took them to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming 21 people were using aliases to divulge company  
secrets, Raytheon got their real identities and the Web talk 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after four of the workers quit, and the rest entered  
corporate ``counseling,'' Raytheon this week dropped the suit and 
on Friday claimed victory. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say the company used the court to chill free speech.  
</P>
<P>
	``We felt like our internal investigation had accomplished what  
we wanted it to accomplish. It was time to put the matter behind 
us,'' David Polk, a spokesman for the Lexington, Mass.-based 
company, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to protecting proprietary information from  
being communicated on a public forum. We think we've done that to a 
certain extent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Raytheon filed suit in Middlesex Superior Court  
against the 21 ``John Does,'' accusing them of discussing such 
matters as rumored mergers and acquisitions, impending divestitures 
and possible defense contracts on a public Internet site run by 
Yahoo! Inc. The company asked the court on Thursday to drop the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	The chatters used aliases like ``Rayman-mass'' and  
``RaytheonVeteran'' -- names they may have thought would protect 
their true identities. But Raytheon obtained subpoenas against 
Yahoo! and other Internet services, and Polk said Raytheon 
eventually learned all 21 names. 
</P>
<P>
	Polk said ``the vast majority'' were Raytheon workers.  
</P>
<P>
	They exchanged gossip about the company and its executives,  
griped about Raytheon's stock price and discussed business deals, 
finances and staffing. Like much on the Internet, some of the 
comments were speculative and inaccurate and some covered 
information that already had been made already public. 
</P>
<P>
	Online privacy advocates accused Raytheon of misusing the  
courts' subpoena power to get the chatters' names. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that the sole objective of Raytheon was to identify  
these individuals,'' said David Sobel, general counsel for the 
Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based research 
group financed by the nonprofit Fund for Constitutional Government. 
``It raises questions about the legitimacy of the way the court's 
discovery procedures were used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sobel said while it is not uncommon for companies to try to  
identify anonymous Internet users, he said the number of people in 
the Raytheon case appeared to be the largest he had seen targeted 
by such an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the situation illustrated the need for standards to  
ensure that online anonymity is not too easily compromised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not prepared to say that it's the responsibility of the  
Internet companies to fight these efforts, but they do need to make 
sure that their subscribers are given notice of these subpoenas,'' 
he said, noting that some Internet companies don't even require a 
subpoena to divulge information about their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Raytheon case, America Online received subpoenas.  
Whenever AOL receives such a subpoena in a civil case, it has a 
policy requiring the customer be notified and given 14 days to try 
to block the subpoena. Only after that time has expired will the 
company turn over the information, said AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said targets of criminal investigations are not  
given such a luxury. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the substance of Raytheon's order couldn't be  
immediately confirmed, AOL is the most popular provider of Internet 
accounts, so some of the chatters could have had their names 
registered with AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, which hosted the Raytheon chat site and was also  
subpoenaed, has a general policy of attempting to comply with 
subpoenas. Jon Sobel, the company's associate general counsel, said 
Yahoo! does not inform users when it complies with court orders, 
but is considering doing so in the future.

<HEADLINE> Congress Pushed To Recycle Trash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A decade of cajoling by recycling advocates  
did not work, so a House committee on Thursday approved a measure 
to force lawmakers and their staffs to separate cans and bottles 
from their leftover lunches. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation by the House Appropriations Committee would turn  
a voluntary program into a compulsory one and send money earned 
from recycling to the chamber's child care center. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., author of the amendment to the money  
bill that finances House operations, predicted it would be 
``embarrassing politically'' for anyone to propose deleting the 
language. The measure goes to the full House and does not apply to 
the Senate, which has taken no similar action. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported last month that after a decade of  
failed, voluntary efforts, most congressional offices still were 
mixing garbage, aluminum cans, bottles and different grades of 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, agencies throughout the federal government  
successfully have been separating their trash and selling 
recyclable material -- just as local governments are doing 
throughout America. 
</P>
<P>
	The recycling failures, along with workplace health and safety  
citations issued to the architect's office, are examples of 
congressional noncompliance with programs and rules other Americans 
are expected to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The House earned $25,000 for recycling in fiscal 1998, according  
to federal government statistics. That is far short of the $150,000 
that could be earned if 60 percent of the product were sorted, 
according to the chamber's former recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers complained at Thursday's committee session that  
congressional maintenance employees, working under the Architect of 
the Capitol, have dumped the contents of recyling bins into the 
same containers in offices that attempted to separate throwaway 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	``We separate all of it and they take it all and just throw it  
together. They just put it in a big bin. That's why we get such a 
low rate'' of recycling, said Rep. James Moran, D-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The Appropriations Committee chairman, Rep. C.W. ``Bill'' Young,  
R-Fla. added, ``I personally saw all three different bins'' of 
trash in his office ``deposited in the same place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Taylor, R-N.C., chairman of the legislative branch  
subcommittee, had urged the measure's defeat, contending it would 
give the architect authority over House members. 
</P>
<P>
	``This puts a legal requirement on the members to participate,''  
Taylor said before the voice vote approving the language. ``I'm not 
sure that's where we want to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said that even if the amendment  
later were removed from the spending bill, the provision would 
``get the attention'' of the architect and improve recycling 
compliance.

<HEADLINE> Rock Music Used To Define Psychoses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He didn't ``Bang a Gong'' or use any ``Crystal  
Blue Persuasion,'' but Henry B. Nelson III had his audience singing 
along at an American Psychiatric Association workshop. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force psychiatrist offered what some might call  
Rorschach rock, a sampling of classic rock 'n' roll music to make 
the complex symptoms of mental illness easier to digest. 
</P>
<P>
	Suffering from pyromania? ``Light My Fire'' by the Doors may  
spark your interest. Steppenwolf's ``Born to be Wild'' is the theme 
of the anti-social while the depressed can sympathize with Mick 
Jagger and the Rolling Stones, who ``(Can't Get No) Satisfaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small. And  
the ones that Mother gives you, don't do anything at all,'' sings 
Jefferson Airplane's Grace Slick in ``White Rabbit,'' as Nelson 
discusses drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	And turning to people who want to be loners, he is joined by the  
voices of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel singing ``I am a rock, I am 
an island ... I have no need for friendship, friendship causes 
pain. It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blame those long seasons in Alaska, says Nelson, who began  
asking rock 'n' roll trivia questions at staff meetings while 
stationed in Alaska in 1989. Today he's based in Utah and finds the 
music handy in training technicians and others in recognizing 
diseases set forth in the psychiatrist's mantra, a book called 
DSM-IV, which lists mental disorders and their symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	While other psychiatrists are asking patients to look at  
inkblots and describe them -- the traditional Rorschach Test -- 
Nelson's thoughts turn to music, sort of ink spots for the ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Relationship problems? ``You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling,''  
croon the Righteous Brothers, while Diana Ross and the Supremes 
order: ``Stop! In the Name of Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many criminals can identify with ``I Fought the Law'' and the  
law won, by the Bobby Fuller Four. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end what it may all come down to is another lyric by Paul  
Simon, ``Still Crazy After All These Years.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Trade Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's foreign trade fell sharply in the first  
quarter of this year compared with the first three months of 1998, 
the Interfax news agency reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop reflected the government's decision to devalue the  
ruble last August in response to internal pressure, making imports 
more expensive, and to the financial crisis in emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
	According to information from the State Statistics Committee  
published by Interfax, exports in the first quarter were $15.6 
billion, down 15.5 percent from the year-earlier total. Imports, at 
$9.4 billion, were down 48.9 percent, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also said inflation-adjusted per capita income  
fell 27.6 percent in the first four months of the year, compared 
with the year-earlier period, and real monthly wages dropped 38.5 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Breaking Senate Ties Is Gore's Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's tie-breaking vote on  
gun control legislation Thursday was his fourth such vote in more 
than six years in office, according to research by his office and 
the Senate Library. 
</P>
<P>
	The job of breaking ties in the Senate is set out in Article I  
of the Constitution. Vice presidents have cast deciding votes 235 
times since John Adams performed that duty for the first time on 
July 18, 1789. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics compiled by the chamber's foremost historian, Sen.  
Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., show Adams, with 29 tie-breaking votes, 
holds the record for the most deciding votes cast by any vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his vote Thursday, Gore broke two tied votes in 1993 on  
President Clinton's deficit reduction package. In 1994, he cast the 
deciding vote on a spending bill for veterans, housing and 
environmental programs.

<HEADLINE> Yes, the Bulls Are in NBA Lottery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) -- During the Michael Jordan era, the only  
reason the Chicago Bulls came to the New York area in May was for a 
playoff showdown with the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	The post-Jordan era has supplied a new reason -- the NBA Draft  
Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off their worst season (13-37) in franchise history, the  
Bulls on Saturday will be part of the lottery for the first time 
since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been here in a while and we're proud of that,''  
Jerry Krause, the Bulls' vice president of basketball operations 
said by telephone. ``I don't want to make a habit of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With their last lottery pick, the Bulls took Stacey King with  
the sixth pick overall. Two years earlier, they engineered a trade 
with Seattle and got the rights to Scottie Pippen, the fifth pick 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	No one will forget 1984 when Chicago got Jordan with the third  
pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning six of the last eight championships kept the Bulls far  
away from the pingpong ball lottery used to determine the top three 
picks in the draft, which will be held June 30 at the MCI Center in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve teams, including two that made the playoffs this season,  
will have a shot at one of the three top picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver, which won only eight games in the lockout-shortened  
season, has the best chance (25 percent) of having one of its 
four-digit combinations drawn in the event at the headquarters of 
NBA Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Clippers, who used the No. 1 pick in last year's  
draft to select center Michael Olowokandi, have a 20 percent shot 
followed by the Bulls, who will have 157 of the 1,001 combinations, 
or a 16 percent chance at the top choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto has two shots at the top pick, including the fourth best  
overall, because of a trade that sent Chauncey Billups to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota, Washington, Boston, Phoenix, Golden State, Cleveland,  
Toronto, Seattle and Charlotte have the next best chances, in that 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	After the top three picks are determined, choices four through  
13 are based on the records of the teams not getting a pick in the 
top three. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota, which was beaten by San Antonio in the first round of  
the playoffs, is in the lottery because it owns New Jersey's pick, 
acquired in the Stephon Marbury trade earlier this season. Phoenix, 
beaten by Portland in the playoffs, has Dallas' pick because of a 
trade involving Steve Nash last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver has the right to convey its pick to Detroit but that's  
unlikely since it cannot be lower than fourth overall. Cleveland 
has the right to take Boston's pick if it is not among the top 
three under terms of the deal that sent Vitaly Potapenko to the 
Celtics this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever gets the top pick will not face an easy choice, like two  
years ago when San Antonio won the right to take Tim Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	Elton Brand of Duke, Richard Hamilton of Connecticut, Lamar Odom  
of Rhode Island and Steve Francis of Maryland head the group of 
underclassmen who have made themselves eligible for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards Andre Miller of Utah, Jason Terry of Arizona, Trajan  
Langdon of Duke and forward Wally Szczerbik of Miami, Ohio are 
among the more well-known seniors eligible for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause refused to discuss anyone eligible, saying it would be  
foolish to do that without speaking to them, testing them and 
getting to know them. 
</P>
<P>
	He also doesn't intend to bring a good luck charm or even worry  
about the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have a good breakfast in the morning, work out and have a  
good lunch,'' he said. ``What can you do? You can't manufacture 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lottery will be broadcast live on NBC-TV around 6:30 p.m.  
EDT.

<HEADLINE> Judge: N.Y. School Violated Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A federal judge ruled Friday that a  
school district violated the religious rights of three Catholic 
families by having youngsters cut out elephant-head images of a 
Hindu god, make toothpick ``worry dolls'' and build an altar for an 
Earth Day liturgy. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Charles Brieant ordered the Bedford Central  
school district to stop the activities and give clear instructions 
to teachers about Supreme Court standards for the separation of 
church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedford Central attorney Warren Richmond said the ruling will  
have a chilling effect. He said the decision went further than any 
court in the country in directing the behavior of an individual 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began in 1995, when students in the well-to-do  
Westchester County district began playing the strategy card game 
Magic: The Gathering. Some parents complained that the cards, 
bearing images ranging from fairies to a woman about to be 
sacrificed, were satanic. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-week trial, which wrapped up in March, brought a parade  
of witnesses, including a yogi-numerologist, a psychic-telepath and 
a mineralogist who denied that crystals have special powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brieant rejected the families' complaints about yoga lessons,  
cemetery visits and the use of the card game. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he found ``subtle coercive pressure to engage in the  
Hindu religion'' when a third-grade teacher, during a lesson about 
India, had her pupils make construction-paper cutouts of elephant 
heads after reading a story about Ganesha, an elephant-headed Hindu 
god. 
</P>
<P>
	``While reading the Ganesha story can be part of a neutral  
secular curriculum, this court fails to find any educational 
justification for telling young impressionable students to 
construct images of a known religious god,'' Brieant said. 
</P>
<P>
	He found that the district had allowed ``worry dolls'' -- tiny  
yarn-and-toothpick figures -- to be made in class and sold in a 
school store as a way for students to keep bad dreams away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business with the worry dolls is a rank example of  
teaching superstition to children of a young and impressionable 
age,'' Brieant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some rituals in the school district's Earth Day celebration,  
including the erection of an altar, were ``truly bizarre'' and 
crossed over into religious teaching, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the parents who sued, Mary Ann DiBari, said she was  
delighted with the ruling but had hoped the use of the card game 
would be found to be a constitutional violation.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Students Embrace Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- From their terror and tears of one month  
ago, Columbine High School students made for President Clinton -- 
and the nation -- a foot-stomping pep rally, their raised fists 
shaped to sign ``I love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who faces next a battle in the House over gun control,  
pressed the students to lend their conquering spirit to his 
fledgling national campaign against youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	He sounded at a loss to address the latest eruption of school  
gunfire -- in Conyers, Ga. -- and said briefly that it was ``deeply 
troubling to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Thankfully no one was killed, but it should never have  
happened,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady spoke Thursday to the Colorado  
community shattered on April 20 when two Columbine students opened 
fire on their classmates, killing 13 and injuring 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love you, and we need you,'' Clinton told Columbine  
students, rescuers and community leaders assembled in the gymnasium 
of Dakota Ridge High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High is still a closed crime scene.  
</P>
<P>
	That tragedy ``pierced the soul of America'' and gave the  
Columbine community a national voice, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to help us here. ... You can help us to keep guns  
out of the wrong hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a soft-pedaled plea at the close of a bitter fight in the  
Senate for tighter gun restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	After angry calls from constituents, the Senate on Thursday  
approved a Democratic plan to require background checks for buyers 
at gun shows. Vice President Al Gore cast the deciding vote; 
Clinton called him from Air Force One with congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle now shifts to the House Judiciary Committee where  
Georgia Rep. Bob Barr, a board member of the National Rifle 
Association, holds a seat in the Republican majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepping inside Dakota Ridge's gymnasium after a private,  
emotional visit with families of the dead students and teacher, the 
Clintons appeared to be surprised by the festive atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Students in white Columbine T-shirts stood on folding chairs,  
stomped their feet on the bleachers, and led a cheer that bounced 
from one side of the gym to the other: ``We are ... Columbine! We 
are ... Columbine!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she was struck by their enthusiasm:  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real statement about who you are and, indeed, who we  
all are. Because in a very real way, what happened here at 
Columbine has so deeply affected the rest of our country that we 
are all Columbine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica Rauh, 15, a Columbine freshman, said it was important to  
put on a positive face for the Clintons' visit. ``We have a lot of 
school spirit and we wanted people to know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president surveyed the student body -- predominantly white  
and upper middle class -- and said, ``When America looks at 
Jefferson County, many of us see a community not very much 
different from our own. We know if this can happen here, it can 
happen anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton noted that Columbine seniors will graduate on  
Saturday, and she recalled the summer their own daughter, Chelsea, 
graduated from high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember the conversations around our kitchen table and  
listening to her friends as they were planning their summer, or 
thinking about college, or going to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Columbine, she said, graduates should also think about how to  
take their school tragedy and ``use it to make more opportunities 
for others to live the kind of lives we would have wished for those 
who were lost.''

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Bombs exploded in a working-class  
neighborhood, wounding 21 people and damaging 14 houses, officials 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The blasts occurred Thursday in Florencia, 325 miles southwest  
of Bogota and capital of Caqueta state. Police defused a third bomb 
that failed to explode. 
</P>
<P>
	Florencia is 55 miles from a region cleared of government troops  
in November as a concession to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia, or FARC, the country's oldest and largest rebel band. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace talks aimed at ending Colombia's 35-year civil war were  
launched in January. 
</P>
<P>
	A local military commander blamed FARC guerrillas for the bomb  
attack, but no group had claimed responsibility. Right-wing 
paramilitary leaders have repeatedly threatened to attack the 
region, a longtime rebel stronghold.

it hit a tree and exploded on the grounds of the Air Force Cadet

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Argentina's labor minister  
abruptly resigned Friday, the second cabinet minister in a month to 
leave the administration of President Carlos Menem. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls for Antonio Erman Gonzalez to step down arose after local  
newspapers reported that he began collecting a monthly pension 
worth $8,000 in March on top of his regular salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez denied the accusations. However, he said Menem accepted  
the resignation ``because the retirement issue was represented to 
the public as something incorrect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez is the second minister to resign from Menem's cabinet  
this month, following the departure of Education Minister Susana 
Decibe. She stepped down in opposition to $1 billion in 
controversial budget cuts.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's interior minister resigned the  
nation's second-highest office Friday to campaign for the ruling

<P>
	Under party rules approved last week, Francisco Labastida --  
widely viewed as President Ernesto Zedillo's favorite for the 
nomination of the Institutional Revolutionary Party -- was required 
to resign before the primary campaign officially opens Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	His post as Cabinet secretary in charge of domestic political

until late last year was governor of the southern state Oaxaca, one 
of Mexico's poorest.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Despite the steepest quarterly drop in  
production in more than 20 years, Colombia's economy will still 
grow in 1999, a top economic official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Planning Minister Jaime Ruiz said the country's gross domestic  
product fell 4.8 percent in first three months of the year, 
compared to the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month decline was the fourth consecutive quarter of  
recession in a country which has traditionally had one of Latin 
America's most stable and vibrant economies. 
</P>

	Despite the drop, Ruiz said the government is standing by its  
forecast of at least 1.3 percent growth for the year. He predicted 
a turnaround based on rising exports and strengthening prices for 
Colombia's main legal exports, oil and coffee.

<HEADLINE> US Regrets China Ban on Port Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States regrets a ban China imposed  
on port calls to Hong Kong by U.S. warships in May and June, the 
State Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on visits apparently was a reaction to NATO's mistaken  
bombing this month of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia's capital, 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the Hong Kong ban  
marked the first time China has taken such a step since it became 
responsible for Hong Kong's foreign affairs and security after the 
British colony reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret that these mutually beneficial port calls, which  
bring economic benefit to Hong Kong as well as shore leave benefits 
to U.S. Naval personnel, are unable to take place at this time,'' 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States is ready to resume the visits when  
China gives permission. U.S. warships have stopped at Hong Kong 70 
times since the handover.

<HEADLINE> Ray, Stewart in Pole Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The rivalry is heating up between Greg Ray  
and Tony Stewart, the man he replaced at Team Menard. 
</P>
<P>
	Those two are considered the drivers to beat on Saturday in pole  
qualifying for the Indianapolis 500 on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a former Indy Racing League champion who has moved on  
to become the hottest rookie in NASCAR's Winston Cup series, left 
Team Menard at the end of the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	His seat was filled by Ray, a fast but unproven driver who IRL  
officials hope develops into a star, much as they hoped Stewart 
would become their main man before he chose to concentrate on stock 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	When practice began last Saturday at the Indianapolis Motor  
Speedway, it was Ray who set the pace for the first few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Stewart emerged, driving for a new team of which he is a  
co-owner. He turned it up Wednesday, running the fast lap of the 
week at 226.683 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about Ray, Stewart said, ``I haven't paid much  
attention to those guys, but he's got all of my old setups, so they 
ought to be going fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray answered on Thursday, retaking the top spot on the speed  
chart with a lap of 227.192. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels nice to be this consistently quick,'' Ray said. ``We  
regard our competition very highly. We're not taking anything for 
granted. From here, we want to try to go even faster but, above 
all, keep it off the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart wasn't able to keep his car off the wall.  
</P>
<P>
	Shaking down his primary car, he got too high in turn 3 on the  
2 1/2-mile oval and bounced twice off the concrete wall before 
stopping on the main straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed about 12 more inches of racetrack,'' Stewart said.  
``Unfortunately, I just ran out of racetrack and hit the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The car was not badly damaged, but Stewart was upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just made a stupid mistake,'' he said. ``I'm disgusted with  
myself. They pay me to drive a race car, and I take these things to 
heart. Thankfully, it wasn't too bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knock on wood, we haven't had an engine problem of any kind  
yet, and I've had more fun so far this week, and the most relaxing 
week leading up to qualifying that I've ever had at Indy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray is having fun, too, except when he is asked about replacing  
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of hearing his name,'' Ray said earlier in the week.  
``I have a lot of respect for Tony's ability, but I just don't want 
to answer any more questions about him. He's Tony Stewart and I'm 
Greg Ray, and I want to concentrate on my team and my effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only problem is the head-to-head duel on Saturday could be  
short-circuited if Stewart gets a late draw in the qualifying order 
or if the weather turns wet. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Stewart is committed to drive Saturday night in  
The Winston, a NASCAR all-star event at Lowe's Motor Speedway in 
Concord, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	To make it in time, Stewart must leave Indianapolis no later  
than 1:30 p.m., local time. Concord's time is an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying is scheduled to begin here at 11 a.m., but the early  
weather forecast is calling for possible morning rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would mean we'd have to qualify on Sunday, but the most  
important thing is to make the race. I've won the pole,'' said 
Stewart, who has started first, second and fourth in his three 
previous Indy races. ``I want to win the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Race day will be a long haul for Stewart, who is scheduled to  
fly to Concord immediately after the 500 to race in NASCAR's 
Coca-Cola 600. The only other driver to pull off that double is 
current Winston Cup regular John Andretti, who finished 10th in the 
1994 Indy 500 and then crashed out of the 600. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's practice, Robby Unser, last year's top Indy  
rookie, jumped to fourth overall at 225.079. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fast drivers on Thursday included two-time Indianapolis  
champion Arie Luyendyk, retiring following the May 30 race, at 
225.073; Stephan Gregoire at 224.792, 1996 Indy winner Buddy Lazier 
at 224.361 and defending champion Eddie Cheever Jr. at 224.193. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Unser, Robby's cousin, also crashed in practice Thursday,  
spinning in turn 3 and hitting the wall twice. He also escaped 
injury.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyers Address Contempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- President Clinton should pay no more than  
$33,737 in legal reimbursements for being found of contempt of 
court in Paula Jones' sexual harassment case, his attorneys told a 
federal court Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawyers recently asked that U.S. District Judge  
Susan Webber Wright order Clinton pay nearly $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal from Clinton's lawyers came a month after Wright  
found Clinton in contempt for giving intentional, false testimony 
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his January 1998 
deposition in the sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright ordered Clinton to pay Mrs. Jones' lawyers any  
``reasonable'' expenses they incurred as a result of his false 
testimony and gave the Jones legal team until May 7 to come up with 
the figure. Clinton's lawyers had two weeks to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, who issued her ruling April 12, now must decide what  
reimbursement is reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers said the fees and expenses requested Mrs.  
Jones' attorneys and The Rutherford Institute ``are unreasonable'' 
and ``bear no relationship to the actions that gave rise'' to the 
judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	They said in a court filing that Wright asked for $1,202 for  
expenses she incurred in attending Clinton's deposition in 
Washington and that the amount ``provides a useful benchmark for 
the reasonableness'' of other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing said Mrs. Jones' attorneys have interpreted the  
judge's order far too broadly. It said the request included 
innumerable fees and expenses ``that bear no relationship to the 
conduct sanctioned'' by the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's filing said The Rutherford Institute's request for  
$58,533.03 in fees and expenses should be rejected outright because 
the institute was not specifically included in the judge's order. 
The institute is a conservative legal group that paid for some of 
Mrs. Jones' legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing said fees and costs totaling $17,861.85 appear to be  
the only costs that fall under the order. 
</P>
<P>
	If this court were to determine that some portion of the legal  
fees incurred during the president's deposition should be 
reimbursed, then the maximum should be $3,348, or about 20 percent 
of the time spent by Mrs. Jones' attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers contended that Mrs. Jones' attorneys could be  
entitled to another $12,527.50 if the court decided that the costs 
for submitting their statement of fees and expenses is included in 
the order 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Jones' lawyers, in seeking the higher amount, have  
argued that the president ``must be sanctioned not only to redress 
his contemptuous misconduct but also to deter other litigants who 
might ... harbor the impression that a party to a federal lawsuit 
may willfully disregard'' court orders. 
</P>
<P>
	They submitted itemized bills for $437,825 incurred by the  
Dallas law firm that represented her and an additional $53,333 
incurred by the Rutherford Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure is significantly higher than the $300,000 amount that  
Mrs. Jones' lawyers recently proposed to Clinton's legal team 
during settlement discussions. Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett had 
dismissed the $300,000 figure as outrageous and greedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Any money would be in addition to the $850,000 Clinton has  
already paid Mrs. Jones to settle the sexual harassment's case 
without admitting any wrongdoing. Clinton denies any wrongdoing and 
has said he settled the sexual harassment case simply to bring an 
end to a public crisis.

	NATO Hits Yugoslav Security Complex  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO bombs struck a security complex  
and set fuel depots ablaze today, lighting the Belgrade skyline and 
a town near the Hungarian border with the orange glow of burning 
fires. The United States apologized for an airstrike that damaged 
the Swiss ambassador's residence during a diplomatic reception. A 
Yugoslav foreign ministry spokesman, meanwhile, denied U.S. and 
NATO reports of army desertions. Allied officials have cited the 
desertion accounts as evidence the NATO air campaign that began 
March 24 was working and raising the levels of internal unrest.

	Georgia School Had Security Devices

	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- In the wake of the nation's latest school  
shooting, administrators insisted they did everything possible to 
avoid such an incident. ``Over the course of the day, I've talked 
with at least 20 different experts about whether we could have done 
anything differently -- and the answer was emphatically no,'' said 
Jim Borland, a Rockdale County Board of Education member. ``Nothing 
can prevent what happened.'' A 15-year-old sophomore armed with two 
guns opened fire yesterday morning at Heritage High School in 
Conyers, shooting six classmates. None of the injuries was 
critical.

and injuring two others, police said today. The shootings happened 
yesterday at a high school about 30 miles south of Durban after 
teachers refused to give students refunds for a field trip. The 
students had paid $1.60 but were told the cost was only $1.30. 
Students began throwing stones, and the principal and a teacher 
opened fire, police Director Bala Naidoo said. The principal and 
teacher were charged with murder and attempted murder and were 
released on $160 bail each, said Mandla Msibi, a spokesman for the

interviewed today in preparation for the next phase of the trial of

<HEADLINE> Agent Says Lewis Was Entering Prime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Had the late Celtics star Reggie Lewis lived and  
played basketball into his late 30s, he might have earned more than 
$117 million in contracts and endorsements, a sports agent 
testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony came during the trial of a malpractice suit  
brought by Lewis' widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, against Drs. Gilbert 
Mudge, Mark Creager and Peter Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed and died in 1993 at 27 while shooting baskets,  
and Harris-Lewis claims the doctors misdiagnosed and mistreated his 
heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles-based agent Arn Tellem told the Suffolk County jury  
that Lewis was ``entering the prime of his career'' and might have 
earned $113.5 million from his playing and product endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	Tellem also estimated that Lewis could have earned an additional  
$5 million from working as a sports commentator, bringing his 
potential earnings to more than $117 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reggie Lewis had a brilliant career ahead of him as a  
basketball player,'' said Tellem, who also represents Indiana 
Pacers star Reggie Miller. ``There was no reason to believe 
(Lewis') career wouldn't have gone on for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But defense attorney William Dailey questioned Tellem's figures,  
pointing out that between 1987 and 1993 Lewis had earned only 
$15,000 in endorsements from autograph shows and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Dailey also questioned whether Lewis could have earned millions  
as a color commentator, saying only a few such jobs are available 
and salaries are not always so high. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Dailey said, former Celtics star Cedric Maxwell  
makes only $75,000 annually for doing commentary for the Celtics.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Get Missile Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House proponents of a national missile defense  
system say they will make sure that President Clinton lives up to 
legislation committing him to build a system capable of stopping 
attacks from rogue and terrorist states. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved and sent to the president Thursday a  
Senate-modified bill that would commit the United States to a 
limited anti-ballistic missile defense system. Clinton is expected 
to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 345-71, but many of the chief sponsors said they  
were dissatisfied with the final compromise worked out by the 
Senate to meet administration objections. Their concern was that it 
was not strong enough to force the administration, long lukewarm 
about missile defense, to move ahead with deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton signs the bill, said House Majority Leader Dick  
Armey, R-Texas, ``we can by rights conclude that he agrees with the 
plain English language of that bill, and that is that the United 
States is committed to deploy a national missile defense as soon as 
is technically possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has said it will not decide on deployment of  
a defense system until June next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., who has led efforts to build a system  
to defend the nation against the growing missile threat from rogue 
nations, contended the administration would wait until next year to 
help the presidential campaign of Vice President Al Gore. ``It 
doesn't say, Mr. President, next year. It says today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, a leading Democratic  
defense expert, cited military testimony that it will be at least 
2005 before tests can determine whether a credible defense system 
can be built. ``We ought to be very sober about any of these 
exhortations ... from people who want to wish this into 
existence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton vetoed a similar measure in 1995 and strongly opposed a  
House version passed in March, saying it did not make clear that 
the defense system would be limited and focused against threats 
from rogue states rather than existing nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate changed the language to state that deployment would  
come only after it is technically possible, that budgets must be 
approved annually by Congress, that the system would be limited and 
that negotiations with Russia on reducing nuclear arms would 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has objected to U.S. proposals to build a missile defense  
system, saying that violates the U.S.-Soviet 1972 Anti-Ballistic 
Missile treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	President Reagan challenged that treaty, based on ``mutually  
assured destruction'' in 1983 when he proposed the space-based 
Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That system was never built and current proposals are for a  
land-based system that would provide defenses against missile 
attacks from such states as North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton budget calls for spending $10.5 billion between 1999  
and 2005 on developing a national defense plan. The administration 
has become more positive about eventual deployment since North 
Korea last year tested a missile that flew over Japan.

</P>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- William Alfred, a playwright and Harvard  
professor, died Thursday in his sleep. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Known to students as ``The Professor,'' Alfred specialized in  
early English literature and taught courses on ``Beowulf'' and 
playwriting. 
</P>
<P>
	His play, ``Hogan's Goat,'' had a long and successful  
off-Broadway run in 1966 and gave Faye Dunaway her first starring 
role. The play earned him the New York Drama Desk Award in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Other works included ``Agamemnon,'' 1982's ``The Curse of an  
Aching Heart'' (also starring Dunaway); ``Nothing Doing,'' and 
``Who to Love,'' a musical adaptation of ``Hogan's Goat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was credited with influencing a number of Harvard students  
who went on to theatrical careers, including Stockard Channing, 
John Lithgow and Tommy Lee Jones.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Elizabeth Robinson Schwartz, the first woman to  
win an Olympic gold medal in track, died Tuesday at age 87. 
</P>
<P>
	She had cancer and Alzheimer's disease.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1928, Mrs. Schwartz won the gold medal in 100-meter dash in a  
then-world-record 12.2 seconds in Amsterdam. It was her fourth 
competitive race. She also won a gold in the 400-meter relay during 
the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Her track and field career at Thornton High School in suburban  
Harvey, Ill. Her biology teacher at the time was on a commuter 
train when he saw her running to catch the train. Astounded at the 
girl's speed, he suggested they start training together. 
</P>
<P>
	Her career nearly ended in 1931 when she was seriously injured  
in a plane crash south of Chicago. She was no longer able to crouch 
down for the sprint position, so she began running relays. 
</P>
<P>
	She retired from track shortly after the 1936 Olympics.

	PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- Sheldon Judson, a Princeton University  
geosciences professor who researched Stone Age archaeological sites 
in North America and Europe, died Thursday of pancreatic cancer. He 
was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Judson was the author of several geo-archaeological reports and  
co-wrote textbooks and workbooks used in introductory geology 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his research topics were ancient North American Indian  
sites and France's rock shelters of the late Paleolithic period, or 
Old Stone Age era circa 10,000 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Judson's best-known textbook is ``Physical Geology,'' co-written  
with L. Don Leet in 1954 and with Marvin E. Kauffman in revised 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Judson was a member of the Princeton faculty from 1955 to 1982.  
Between 1970 to 1982, he was the chairman of its geosciences 
department. He held the rank of dean when he served as chairman of 
the University Research Board in the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Unknown Soldiers May Be Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon for the first time will attempt  
to use DNA technology to identify remains of U.S. troops killed in 
the Korean War and buried as ``unknowns'' at the National Memorial 
Cemetery in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 sets of remains are candidates to be disinterred at the  
cemetery, commonly called the Punchbowl, where 864 remains of 
unidentified soldiers from the Korean War are buried. They were 
turned over to the United States by North Korea after a cease-fire 
ended the conflict in 1953, but the remains could not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the 70 are considered candidates because the records  
associated with them, such as military unit or recovery location, 
suggest a name, Pentagon spokesman Larry Greer said. Name 
associations are vital because the DNA technique for positive 
identification requires a comparison blood sample from the maternal 
bloodline. 
</P>
<P>
	The names were not released. Greer said not all of the families  
had been contacted. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Dunton of the Korean War/Cold War Association of the Missing  
said her organization and others have lobbied the Pentagon for 
years to use DNA testing more aggressively on Korean War remains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an excellent thing,'' she said in an interview. ``It  
needs to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's announcement follows the successful identification last  
year of Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Blassie, the former Vietnam War 
unknown from the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National 
Cemetery. The same mitochondrial DNA technology used in the Blassie 
case will be used in the Korean War cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blassie case stirred emotional debates about whether the  
Tomb of the Unknowns should be disturbed, whether a replacement set 
of unknown remains from Vietnam should be put in, and, later, 
whether the Defense Department should set a policy of disinterring 
potentially identifiable remains at war cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The work will be done by forensics experts at the military's  
Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii. The Pentagon certified 
the use of mitochondrial DNA testing as a reliable forensic tool in 
1995 and has used the technique to identify some Korean War remains 
turned over by North Korea in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Greer said no firm timetable had been set for beginning the  
disinterments at the Punchbowl cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The records associated with each of the unknown remains in the  
Punchbowl cemetery will undergo rigorous evaluation before a 
decision is made to disinter,'' the Pentagon said in its 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 864 sets of remains at the Punchbowl are among the  
approximately 8,200 men listed as unaccounted for from the Korean 
War. Most of the rest are in North Korea, and the Pentagon has been 
working with the North Korean government in recent years to recover 
remains at former battle sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually the Pentagon may disinter remains from World War II  
cemeteries, Greer said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Bomb Threats at Kmart in Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TROY, Mich. (AP) -- Kmart Corp. closed its suburban Detroit  
headquarters and sent 3,500 employees home early on Friday 
afternoon after receiving two bomb threats, the nation's No. 3 
retailer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first threat came in about 7:30 a.m. and the second shortly  
after noon EDT, company spokesman Stephen Pagnani said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did evacuate the building and are sending people home for  
the day,'' Pagnani said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first caller said a bomb would explode at 9 a.m., the  
spokesman said. The employees were evacuated at 8:30 a.m., police 
swept the building and failed to find any bomb, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees remained outside for about an hour, Pagnani said. But  
Kmart got a second threat shortly after noon and decided to send 
the employees home early, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had no idea why the caller or callers may have made  
the threats. However, Kmart has received more than 200 angry calls 
this week from National Rifle Association supporters following talk 
show host Rosie O'Donnell's verbal tussle with actor Tom Selleck on 
her show Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart said it had no plans to fire O'Donnell from her position  
as a celebrity spokeswoman for the company. Selleck recently filmed 
an ad for the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	Troy police did not immediately respond to calls seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart is the nation's third-largest retailer, behind Wal-Mart  
Corp. and Sears Roebuck and Co. Kmart has 2,162 stores in all 50 
states, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands.
