<HEADLINE> UK Hospitals Face Serious Nurse Recruitment Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain's National Health Service
(NHS) is being threatened by a mounting crisis in recruiting and
retaining nurses, national newspapers reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of its annual congress, the Royal College of Nursing
(RCN) was quoted as warning that the NHS may not exist in 10 years
if it fails to attract and keep its nurses.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the NHS is facing its worst nurse
shortages ever with vacancy rates of up to 25 percent, 8,000
vacant posts and one in three students dropping out before
completing the nursing courses. Of those who do qualify, fewer are
staying on.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Health Department, nurses still
working for the NHS two years after qualification dropped from 96
percent in 1990 to 86 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey said that more than eight out of ten
hospitals in England reported difficulty in recruiting nurses.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade hospitals were treating 23 percent more
patients but the number of registered nurses had gone up only six
percent.
</P>
<P>
Christine Hancock, RCN general secretary, said that the
situation would only get worse with a quarter of nurses reaching
retirement age in two years.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that problems with nurse recruitment tend to
follow the economic cycle, that is in economic booming times, as
at present, young people tend to desert nursing as job
opportunities are plentiful and pay rates are high.
</P>
<P>
Hancock said that nursing had to be made more attractive in
terms of pay, training and job satisfaction.

<HEADLINE> French Foreign Minister Defends Policy Toward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine Monday defended the policy of the French government in the
early 1990s to support the Hutu military government in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily La Croix, Vedrine said that
France decided to support the former Hutu government of Rwanda in
1990, because Rwanda was threatened with an invasion from a
neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine was referring to Uganda, which supported the Tutsi
forces of Rwandan Patriotic Front which began to attack Rwanda
from 1990.
</P>
<P>
He said that this policy was similar with the one adopted
several years ago by France to help Chad fend off an invasion of
Libyan troops.
</P>
<P>
France intervened in Chad in the mid-1980s by staging the
"Epervier" operation sending an air force squadron and more than
800 land troops to the Saharan African nation engaged in a
territorial dispute with Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
"The idea of that time was to provide security to all the
(African) countries linked with France (through military treaties)
and to provide them with confidence. Short of that, the stability
of the whole region would be jeopardized," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine also said that France had done all it could to prevent
a genocide from taking place in Rwanda in the early 1990s, and
rejected the accusation that France supported Rwandan President
Juvenal Habyarimana without condition until he was killed in an
attack on his plane on April 6, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The death of Habyarimana immediately triggered the massacres of
Tutsis and moderate Hutus by the Hutu military regime of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"It is this policy which led to the agreements of Arusha of
August 1993," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also regretted that the Arusha agreements, which called for
a sharing of power between the Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda, had
never been implemented.
</P>
<P>
"If they were really applied, perhaps all the horrors could
have been avoided," he added.

<P>
ANKARA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces captured
61 illegal foreign immigrants in the western province of Mugla
province on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 48 Afghans and 13 Iraqis had been found attempting to enter
neighboring Greece on board a truck before their detention in
Dalbuku region in Mugla, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency

The report quoted some illegal immigrants as saying that they
were bound for the Sombeki Island of Greece.
</P>
<P>
The captured included 13 women and 14 children.

<P>
Last Thursday, Turkish frontier troops detained 18 Pakistanis,
six Iranians and eight Afghans on the Turkish-Iranian border and
Van province linking neighboring Iran, said the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been used as a springboard by illegal immigrants
from Asian countries en route to Europe.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Research University's Methods Faulted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The acclaimed research
university of the United States is shortchanging its undergraduate
students, particularly freshmen, according to a leading
education-policy organization.
</P>
<P>
The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching found
that undergraduate students are often taught by graduate students,
not teachers, and many are graduated without "a coherent body of
knowledge."
</P>
<P>
The report, to be released today and reported by the New York
Times, concluded that universities should involve more
undergraduates in institutions' research projects, including those
in medicine and the humanities, beginning with freshmen.
</P>
<P>
"What we need to do is to create a culture of inquirers, rather
than a culture of receivers," said Shirley Strum Kenny, the
president of the State Universities of New York at Stony Brook
and chairwoman of the 11-member commission that wrote the report.
</P>
<P>
"Too often the freshman curriculum is a bore and freshman
instruction inadequate. Senior professors, when they teach
undergraduates, tend to teach majors in advanced courses," the
report said. "As a result, freshmen, the students who need the
very best teaching, may actually receive the worst."
</P>
<P>
The commission said that the nation's 125 research universities
have as important a role in education as in research, since they
grant nearly a third of the baccalaureate degrees though they
represent only 3 percent of colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
The report proposed rewarding faculty members more for good
teaching, using technology more creatively and fastering more
interdisciplinary work.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended that freshmen be placed in small groups
where they live together and take the same courses. It also says
students should be involved in the research conducted by senior
faculty and that they should be encouraged to conduct original
research that could become their transition into graduate
school.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Trade Union Membership Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-four percent of all
registered non-agricultural South African workers were members of a
trade union at the end of 1997, Labor Minister Tito Mboweni said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a 13 percent increase from 1996 and
translated to a total union membership of 3.4 million workers, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Briefing on the ministry's annual report, Mboweni said the rise in
trade union membership was in part due to the new Labor Relations Act (LRA).
</P>
<P>
The new act provided for the registration of trade unions in
sectors, such as the public sector, which were not covered by previous
laws, and it simplified the registration procedure, he said.
</P>
<P>
There was a sharp increase in the number of trade unions and
employer organizations. According to Mboweni, trade unions increased by a
fourth from 334 in 1996 to 417 in 1997, and meanwhile employer
organizations rose by 32 percent from 196 to 258.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern about the number of small unions trying to
register, some with as few as 50 members, as well as splits taking
place in some unions.
</P>
<P>
"The growth of small trade unions spreads limited capacity and the
emergence of non-bona fide unions can bring our labor relation's
framework into disrepute," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his department was monitoring this situation closely and
would consider legislative amendments if necessary.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of Afghanistan's
Anti-Taliban Northern Alliance is likely to arrive in Pakistan
Thursday for talks with Taliban militia, according to a report by
the News Network International on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan opposition team, comprised nine senior officials of
the Northern Alliance, will arrive in Peshawar, capital of
Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province, for the Steering Committee
meeting scheduled to be held in Islamabad on April 27, the report
quoted Sibghatullah Zaki, an opposition spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban earlier named five senior officials for the
proposed meeting of the Steering Committee while the Northern
Alliance has nominated nine members.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first face-to-face meeting between the Taliban
and their rivals. Taliban leaders believe that the Steering
Committee should discuss the composition of proposed Ulema
(religious scholar) Commission and arrange the religious scholars
meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition spokesman said the Steering Committee
should also discuss matters relating to cease-fire, release of
prisoners, removal blockade of central Afghanistan and
establishment of a broad-based government.

<HEADLINE> Arab Countries to Sign Anti-Terrorism Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- An agreement drafted by Arab
countries to fight terrorism will be signed at a meeting of
interior and justice ministers from 22-member Arab League here on
Wednesday, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cairo will host on Wednesday the landmark joint meetings of
Arab interior and justice minister councils to sign the first Arab
anti-terrorism strategy.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted a report issued Monday by a committee of the
ministers as saying that the agreement has been accepted by all
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The pact confirms the right of peoples to armed struggle
against foreign occupation and aggression. It legitimizes the
struggle to liberate their land, obtain the right to
self-determination and independence and maintain their national
unity in accordance with the principles and resolutions of the
United Nations, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The draft agreement stipulates the cooperation of signatory
states for the prevention and combat of terrorist crimes in
accordance with the laws and internal measures of each country.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, no signatory state would be permitted
to organize, finance, commit or take part in committing terrorist
act in any way.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Interior Minister Habib al-Adly has termed the accord
as "a great and unprecedented achievement in the world," which
would crown intensive Arab activities to curb terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"This conference comes after the call President Hosni Mubarak
has made during the past years for an international effort to
confront terrorism," he told reporters Sunday after a meeting with
his aides to prepare for Wednesday's conference.
</P>
<P>
Around 30 Arab ministers of interior and justice will initial
the Arab agreement on countering terrorism in its final form at a
special gathering to be inaugurated by Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Pledges Strong Security Commitment to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen pledged on Monday that the United States
will do its best to help Israel maintain a strong military edge.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with his Israeli
counterpart Yitzhak Mordechai at the Defense Ministry, Cohen said
that Israel wants to build a strong defense system and "the United
States intents to do its part to help Israel to maintain its
military edge."
</P>
<P>
Cohen had met Mordechai five times in the past, but this is his
first visit to Israel as U.S. defense secretary. He received full
military honors after his arrival from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"We want Israel to be strong so that it can take the risks for
peace," Cohen stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's long-term military modernization plans
and its acquisition of the third Arrow anti-ballistic missile
battery, Cohen said that the United States will provide funds to
Israel to develop this system.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged the U.S. commitment to revive the Middle East
peace process and asked all parties concerned to make positive
efforts to push the process forward.
</P>
<P>
"(U.S.) President (Bill) Clinton remains commitment to working
for a comprehensive peace plan that will make Israel's second 50
years more secure than the first 50 years (after the founding of
the Jewish state in 1948)," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's proposal for withdrawing its troops from
south Lebanon, Cohen said Israel's initiative may not satisfy
Syria and Lebanon, but this initiative is an important one, adding
both Syria and Lebanon should response positively to it.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon with the aim to protect its northern areas from
Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government announced on April 1 its decision to
accept the U.N. Resolution 425 adopted in 1978 and promised to
pull out its troops from south Lebanon after reaching security
arrangements for its northern territories with the Lebanese
government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution called on an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon. Lebanon and Syria, which has much
influence on in Lebanon, have rejected Israel's withdrawal
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said he discussed with Cohen Israel's overall
strategic defense plan during their meeting, but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold talks with Cohen
in Jerusalem on Monday evening on security cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel is the forth leg of Cohen's current Middle East tour,
which has already taken him to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Govt Acts to Curb Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The three-member cabinet of
Nepal Monday took various decisions with a view to bringing the
soaring governmental expenditures under control and strictly
adopting a policy of financial discipline and austerity.
</P>
<P>
Under the decisions, official and unofficial visits from the
government sector, holding of meetings by parties, assistance for
medical expenses and financial assistance distributed
unnecessarily will be brought to an immediate halt, the official
RSS news agency said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to visits abroad, participation in meetings and
conferences at the government expense will be stopped except in
the case of meetings of international and regional organizations,
of which Nepal is a member.
</P>
<P>
An immediate reduction of 10 percent will be made in all
administrative expenditures other than salaries and allowances,
and formation of committees, commissions and task forces which
will create new staffing vacancies, and open new offices or
increase expenditures will be brought under immediate control, the
RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the customs and sales tax waiver and foreign exchange
now provided to MPs and other officials including those of
constitutional bodies for importing private vehicles will be
terminated, and the misuse of vehicles imported under such
facilities will be immediately ended, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, calls for controlling corruption rampant in
the Himalayan kingdom are growing.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary Public Accounts Committee on Sunday directed
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and his cabinet members to
initiate actions to bring financial discipline in the country.
</P>
<P>
As Koirala is planning the expansion of his cabinet which took
office on April 15, he is under intense pressure from within his
own Nepali Congress party to refrain from inducting MPs perceived
as corrupt into his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Koirala's is a one-party minority government.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
continue to promote the growth of the small-and-medium scale
enterprise sector, President Robert Mugabe said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF)
which will begin Tuesday in Zimbabwe's second largest city of
Bulawayo, Mugabe said that the sector's exhibition would afford
it an opportunity to establish links with industrial and
commercial organisations, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government "is not only promotive but also
supportive of the growth and expansion of this sector,'' Mugabe
said, adding that he is also pleased with the large numbers of
women exhibitors, particularly those showcasing rural craft work.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa is expected to officially
open the show.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that Zimbabwe and Tanzania have a very long period
of cooperation even before the attainment of Zimbabwe's
independence in April 1980.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries are members of the Southern African
Development Community, a body that is aimed to promote economic and
social well-being of about 173 million people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Industry and Commerce minister Nathan Shamuyarira
said the ZITF is the most important annual event on the
country's business calendar in that it has become a unique
occasion bringing togetgher different nationalities to share
experiences and exchange ideas.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Zimbabwe's products must be of a standard
which competes with others in regional or world markets.
</P>
<P>
''If we turn out goods of a poor quality they will be rejected
on the world market. Even here at home they will be replaced by
better products from outside our borders,'' He added.

<HEADLINE> Asian crisis Jeopardizes Creation Of Jobs In UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Direct investment from the Far
East in Britain has virtually stopped owing to the Asian financial
crisis erupted last Summer, according to a study into inward
investment released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Melanie Lansbury, senior economist with Business Strategies,
the forecasting group, said that up to 100,000 jobs could be
jeopardized over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The warning comes after Asian companies have announced delays
to big projects in the UK as they struggle with a collapsed home
market and a saturated world market for some electronic products.
</P>
<P>
Lansbury said: "This projection is a worst-case scenario. But
already we are seeing a number of big investments being
postponed."
</P>
<P>
Inward investment has created about 100,000 jobs over the past
ten years as Britain has succeeded in attracting many companies
with a combination of government subsidies and an increasingly
cheap and flexible labor force.
</P>
<P>
Investment from the Far East accounts for 40,000 jobs. Of
these, 11,000 are in Wales, 9,000 in Scotland, 9,500 in northern
England, and 2,700 in Northern Ireland.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The government of Irish Republic
kicked off a nationwide campaign against alcoholism in Dublin on
Monday, urging people to control their drinking, according to
press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony, Irish Minister for Health
and Children Brian Cowen said that alcohol abuse cost the Irish
economy more than 300 million Irish pounds (about 420 million U.S.
dollars) a year in lost production, work absenteeism, court time,
and health and police costs.
</P>
<P>
"The aim (of the campaign)is to have sensible drinking accepted
as the norm. For those of us who drink it means accepting that
less is better," Cowen said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government will also launch a multimedia advertising
campaign across the country in an effort to persuade Irish people,
renowned for a strong drinking culture, into drinking less.

<HEADLINE> Lake Weed Hampers Power Production in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The water hyacinth in Lake
Victoria interferes with the electricity production of the Uganda
Electricity Board (UEB) and the power firm, and cost them about
32,000 U.S. Dollars each month to remove the weed.
</P>
<P>
A report by the national environment management authority says
that the UEB, located at the Owen Falls Dam in Jinja, losses of
6.212 million Ugandan Shillings (6,212 U.S. Dollars) every four
hours when the turbines have to be shut down to remove the weed,
East African Weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A floating boom, which was installed to prevent the weed from
entering the turbines, has broken under the weight of the weed.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released by the Ministry of Natural
Resources, some 2,000 to 4,000 hectares of the lake's shoreline
and bays in Uganda's territorial waters are now infested by the
hyacinth and the whole lake is estimated to contain 1.25 million
metric tons of the weed.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has been using mechanic means to rid
the land-locked lake of the weed and the Owen Falls Power Plant,
which opened in the 1950s, supplies power to Uganda, Kenya,
Tanzania and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Tolerate With Marijuana Smokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Belgium is likely to take a more
middle-of-the-road approach toward users of such light drugs as
marijuana and its derivatives.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Justice Minister Stefaan de Clerck made public on
Monday a directive agreed upon late last week along with five
prosecutors-general from around the country.
</P>
<P>
De Clerck presented the directive to the justice commission of
the Belgian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The directive said that there would be no more legal action
taken toward users of marijuana and its derivatives though
commercial trafficking and distribution of the drug is still a
penalizable crime.
</P>
<P>
Previously, users of light drugs once found would be detained
and later sued by public prosecution in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The directive added, however, marijuana smokers would from now
on be interrogated by police on questions such as the place and
time marijuana is used and how much and how often.
</P>
<P>
Marijuana smokers may also have to justify their financial
sources that bankroll their habit.
</P>
<P>
The new approach was deemed to be between those of France and
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Though both bordering Belgium, France is very strict and harsh
on drug users whereas the Netherlands is more tolerant with users
of light drugs.

<HEADLINE> LIFFE Announces Initiatives On STIR Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (EIFFE) announced Monday a series of
initiatives that will be implemented to enhance its Short Term
Interest Rate (STIR) products up to, and beyond, EMU.
</P>
<P>
Danel Hodson, LIFFE's Chief Executive, said: "These initiatives
will further improve LIFFE's STIR product range, and ensure a
successful migration of relevant STIR activity into our Three
Month Euro Interest Rate ("Euro") contract."
</P>
<P>
LIFFE now has a wider range of European short term interest
rate futures than any other exchange, and has around a 90 percent
market share of open interest in contracts denominated in
potential euro currencies.
</P>
<P>
Hodson said that for delivery months after January 1999 LIFFE's
market share rises to more than 90 percent. Open interest is
building fast, and has increased by almost 50 percent since the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, LIFFE's Three Month ECU futures
contract will be relaunched as the Three Month Euro futures
contract on 30 April 1998.
</P>
<P>
LIFFE will develop its Euro contract so that it precisely
mirrors the Three Month Euromark. On and from 30 April 1998 the
floor trading hours for the Euro contract will be extended to
match those of the Euromark contract.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Euro contract, the Board has decided to
extend half basis point pricing across all delivery months of the
Three Month Euromark contract from 30 April, 1998 in response to
member demand.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Germany Still Dependent on Huge Aid from West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Eight years after the German
reunification in 1990, eastern German states still remain highly
dependent on huge subsidies handed out by the western half of the
country, the German central bank said in a report on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates from the central bank, known as the
Bundesbank, the total government subsidies to help rebuild eastern
German economy are expected to rise to a post-reunification high
of 189 billion marks (104 billion U.S. dollars) this year,
outstripping the 183 billion (101 billion dollars) and 187 billion
marks (103 billion dollars) registered in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The persistently high state subsidies came as the eastern
German economy had apparently lost momentum now to catch up with
the west, the Bundesbank said.
</P>
<P>
For the eight years after the reunification as a whole, public
subsidies injected into eastern German economy would total about
1.37 trillion marks. After the deduction of tax revenues from
eastern Germany, the financial assistance would still amount to
about 1.03 trillion marks in real terms, the Bundesbank said.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Reports 4th Madcow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Agriculture Minister
Karel Pinxten announced on Monday that this country has found
another case of madcow disease, its fourth.
</P>
<P>
The newly-found diseased cow, four and half years old, was
sorted out in a farm at Tielt in the Western Flandre province.
</P>
<P>
It was the third diseased cow found in western Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The cow was first suspected of contracting the disease on March
23 and was killed for diagnosis two days later. The corpse of the
cow had already been incinerated.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-two other cows raised along with the diseased cow will
also be killed and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, the Belgian agriculture minister said that the
findings of madcow disease was only sporadic and isolated in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Early last month a five-year-old milk cow was found to have
contracted the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the
Western Flandre province.
</P>
<P>
The country's first case of madcow disease was reported last
October and the diseased cow was found in a farm in eastern
Belgium at Mean.
</P>
<P>
Prior to medical diagnosis, some parts of the first diseased
cow were used to produce animal feed that had later been exported
to the Netherlands and Poland, as well as for domestic
consumption.
</P>
<P>
BSE or commonly known as the madcow disease was first
discovered more than a decade ago in Britain where a total of
170,000 heads of cattle had been diagnosed as having contracted
the disease.
</P>
<P>
A human form of BSE has already claimed 23 lives in Britain.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Refutes Butler's Statement on Arms Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Monday refuted chief
U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler's statement that no progress
was made in the past six months on arms inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Butler has also said that there are still
some obstacles standing in the way of inspection and that Baghdad
has not fully cooperated with the United Nations, nor has it
presented adequate information.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi official spokesman, whose name is unknown, dismissed
the statement, saying it is coinciding with U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen's criticism of Iraq during his current visit
to the Mideast that Iraq had not presented an evidence for the
destruction of its stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the U.S. government, together with its
representatives in the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
disarmament of Iraq, had resumed a propaganda campaign against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The lies of (the United States) and those of its ally Britain
had been revealed in the wake of the visits made by the special
group to the Iraqi presidential sites," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A special group of senior diplomats and arms experts inspected
the eight Iraqi presidential sites from March 26 to April 2, but
they did not find banned weapons or materials in those sites.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi presidential sites were at the center of the recent
Iraq-U.N. arms inspection crisis, during which the United States
and Britain threatened to launch air strikes against Iraq to
force its compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had been refusing the arms inspectors to enter its
presidential sites on grounds of sovereignty. On February 23, Iraq
and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan signed an agreement on
peacefully ending the crisis and allowed the special group to
enter the eight presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that during the period from October
1997 to April 1998, about 29 UNSCOM inspection teams visited 221
sites in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, these teams had not found anything in support
of the claims, lies and falsities unleashed by the U.S. and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Could all these then lead to say that no progress had been
made in the work of the Special Commission?" asked the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Is it not our right to demand from the Security Council to
ask Butler if there is a logic in the saying that the work of all
these teams has made no progress? And if it is so, why then
Butler continue sending these teams and waste all these efforts,
money and time?" the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 can not be lifted unless UNSCOM verifies that Iraq
has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.

</P>
<P>
The security and normal life in central Angola's Benguel,
Huambo and Huila provinces were endangered by the remnants of the
former rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), local media reported Monday.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Visit Angola Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will pay a state visit to Angola next week to
boost the peace process in the country, presidential spokesman
Parks Mankahlana said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The visit, planned for April 29, was provisionally scheduled
to last only one day, during which Mandela would hold talks with
his Angolan counterpart Eduardo Dos Santos, Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
The visit was "really about bilateral relations and
strengthening ties", he said.
</P>
<P>
Angola had been high on the Southern African agenda and
Mandela had been involved in negotiations to get the warring
parties -- Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the governing Popular
Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA) -- to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process has been going very well. He (Mandela)'s
going to give his blessings to (it)," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The South African-Angolan Business Forum said last week that
some of its members would form part of a delegation organized by
the South African Department of Trade and Industry to accompany
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) urged the
world to uphold United Nations sanctions imposed on UNITA last
October.
</P>
<P>
The OAU also called on UNITA to implement the final phases of
the peace plan. The movement has yet to hand over a number of the
some 335 towns it held since the peace pact was signed in
November 1994, though most of its strongholds have been
relinquished.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. officials are coming to
Turkey in a fresh effort to help reactivate the peace process in
Cyprus, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
United States' Special Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Miller
will arrive in Ankara on Tuesday, carrying a letter from President
Bill Clinton to Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on a
settlement to Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Miller arrived in Cyprus Monday for talks with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides, leader of the Greek Cypriots, and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted diplomatic sources as saying that
U.S. Special Envoy for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke will pay his visit
to Cyprus and Turkey at the beginning of May in a bid to solve the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a "Turkish republic of
Northern Cyprus" in the north in 1983, which is only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish troops are stationed in northern
Cyprus to secure security of the Turkish Cypriots on the divided
island.

<HEADLINE> Lott Says Public Indifferent to Washington Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Just from Congress's two-week
vacation, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott said Monday the
people back home are more interested in getting a new bridge
across the Mississippi River than in Washington scandal.
</P>
<P>
Lott said he was not asked a single question during his stay in
his home state of Mississippi -- in public, at least -- about U.S.
President Bill Clinton's alleged sexual escapades, nor about the
controversial tobacco settlement. He said questions at public
events focused on decaying roads and overcrowded schools, United
Press International reported.
</P>
<P>
Back in Washington Monday, where both issues have considerably
more interest, Lott told reporters that House Republicans'
decision to prepare for possible impeachment proceedings against
the president is "the responsible thing to do." But he said the
Senate has no plans to mirror House attempts to draw up an
investigating committee or to hire additional staff.
</P>
<P>
He said he is not sure whether the tobacco bill drafted by
Republican Senator John McCain will pass the Senate, but it could
come up for a floor vote before Congress adjourns for next month's
Memorial Day break. Lott said the bill's chance of passage would
improve if "the administration would get involved and show more
leadership than it has so far...there has been no leadership,
(Clinton has) shown no courage."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Ireland will hold
two separate referendums on the Amsterdam treaty of the European
Union (EU) and the Northern Ireland peace agreement on May 22,
according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
An Irish government official was quoted by Reuters as saying in
Dublin Monday afternoon that the Irish cabinet has decided that
"Both referendums will take place on the same day".
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern reportedly favored holding
the two referendums on the same day to ensure a higher turnout as
some political analysts predicted that a separate referendum on
the EU treaty might produce a low turnout of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
Under the historic Northern Ireland peace accord reached on
April 10, the Irish electorate will be asked to decide whether
Ireland should drop its constitutional claim to the disputed
province.
</P>
<P>
The Amsterdam treaty, which succeeds the Maastricht Treaty of
1992, is designed to strengthen cooperation on crime, health,
unemployment, consumer protection, and the environment within the
15-nation block.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Accepts Blair's Proposal on London Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gaza, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
accepted Monday the proposal put forward by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair for high-level peace talks with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in London next month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference held with Blair here,
Arafat said he responded positively to the British initiative for
discussing the United States ideas on breaking the Mideast peace
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Netanyahu in Jerusalem Sunday, Blair
secured the Israeli prime minister's commitment to meet with Arafat
in London next month. The summit is expected to be a four-way
meeting to be attended also by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the main purpose of the proposed London meeting is
to define where the peace process is standing and what positions
the two sides hold. He said the meeting is important because it
will give people the hope that the parties are trying to get
progress.
</P>
<P>
The British proposal is expected to be finalized later this
week when U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross returns to the region
for a new round of mediation. Ross is to broker an agreement on
Israel's further troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat stressed that he was "waiting for this initiative to be
introduced officially and publicly." Blair said he believed that
the U.S. would soon issue invitations to all the parties.
</P>
<P>
Arafat thanked Blair for his efforts to bridge the gaps
between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on
some issues. He also urged the EU to play an effective and
genuine role in convincing Israel to stop unilateral steps that
have stalled the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not demanding for the moon, I'm only asking for the
precise and accurate implementation of the agreements signed,"
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, whose country holds the rotating European Union (EU)
presidency, emphasized the need to ensure that the Middle East
peace process regain momentum. "It is going to be a very
difficult task, but we have a structure there already in place,
that is to begin with the interim issues... and move to the
final-status talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that, for achieving a lasting peace in the future,
"the single most important thing is to get on with that process
and make it work, and to resolve all the issues that stand in the
way."
</P>
<P>
The British leader reiterated that Britain and the EU will not
try to cut across the role played by the U.S. as the leading
mediator. The EU role, especially on economic issues, will only
facilitate and supplement the U.S. efforts to advance the peace
process, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat gave his warm congratulations to Blair for securing the
peace agreement on ending the Northern Ireland peace talks,
hoping that he could do the same in bringing about peace between
Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
But Blair played down any expectation for his visit to achieve
drastic breakthrough, saying there exists huge difference between
Northern Ireland peace process and the Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The London summit aside, Arafat and Blair also discussed the
joint efforts to fight terrorism and the interim issues, such as
the opening of Gaza airport and the Karni industrial park between
Israel and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
And the two leaders witnessed the signing of an agreement on
creating a permanent security committee on fighting terrorism in
order to protect the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The current Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stalled
since March 1997 over Israel's repeated delays in carrying out
the West Bank redeployment due to the dispute over the size of
the pullbacks and Israel's continued settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on Arafat's recent comments about his
intention to declare an independent Palestinian state in May next
year, Blair said that Britain supported the Palestinian right of
self-determination. He also urge Israel to time out the
settlement activities and other unilateral steps.
</P>
<P>
Blair arrived here Monday afternoon from Israel and visited a
refugee camp near Gaza. He returned to Israel late the day and is
to hold a second round of talks Tuesday morning with Netanyahu to
brief him on the results of his meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Blair has already visited Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan in his
current Mideast trip.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Remains Determined to Win Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- With only five months ahead of
Germany's national election in September this year, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl Monday expressed confidence about his
chance to win re-election despite his worsening showing in recent
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at news conference in Bonn on Monday, Kohl also voiced
anger at a recent public quarrel within his own conservative
alliance over a draft election platform and called on his allies
to concentrate the election campaign against the opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that leaders from his Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) and the allied Christian Social Union (CSU) had agreed
to bury the squabbling and sit down to draft a common election
platform in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
While renowned for his political comebacks, Kohl appears to be
facing the gravest crisis as recent opinion polls show that the
leftist SPD is running about 10 percentage points ahead his party.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing speculations that a grand coalition might have to be
formed between the CDU and SPD after the elections, Kohl said on
Monday that he would stick to his current coalition partners which
also include the Free Democratic Party (FDP).

<HEADLINE> Khamenei: Iran Not Against Jews, But Zionists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei said on Monday that Iran is not against the Jews, but
the (Israeli) Zionists.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with visiting French writer Roger Garaudy,
Khamenei said that Iran's campaign against the United States and
Zionism is based on the Islamic principles and has nothing to do
with racism or religious prejudice.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. had not been arrogant and the Zionists (Israelis)
had not committed such shameful crimes, we would not have held the
same stand toward them that we hold now," Khamenei said. He added
that Iran has no prejudice against the Jews and "the Jews are
leading a peaceful life in Iran."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader said that the Zionists shared similar stand
with the Nazis as well as their racial behavior toward others.
He blamed the U.S. and Europe for their support for Israel.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, they deplore the racial behavior of the
Nazis toward the Jews and on the other they support the Zionists
who have the same behavior as that of the Nazis," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei expressed regret that the U.S. statesmen were
completely influenced by the Zionists, saying that "we believe a
power founded on bullying and interfering in the internal affairs
of other countries cannot last."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the U.S. economic sanctions against Iran
could not work, adding that the sanctions serve the independence
of Iran and Iran would never relinquish its principles.
</P>
<P>
Garaudy, currently in Iran for lecture tour, was fined 20,000
U.S. dollars by a Paris court last month for his book "Founding
Myths of Israeli Policy," in which he said that the extermination
of 6 million Jews by the German Nazis during the World War II was
a myth used to justify Israeli actions against the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Meet Netanyahu, Arafat in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat separately in London on May 4
in a bid to find a way out of the current stalemate in the Middle
East peace process, the State Department announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told a regular briefing
that the purpose of the separate meeting with the two leaders was
to determine if U.S. peace proposals "can provide a basis for a
breakthrough" on interim peace issues and lead to the beginning of
final permanent status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He also said Washington was looking for the two sides to make
hard decisions on peace, saying: "We are looking for substantive
decisions from the leaders, real decisions."
</P>
<P>
Rubin, however, admitted the United States had not seen "any
substantive change" in Israeli and Palestinian positions on the
West Bank and the prospect to resume their negotiations was still
bleak.
</P>
<P>
When asked if Washington could break off mediation efforts for
the Middle East peace process once the London meetings proved as
unsuccessful as other recent negotiating sessions had proven,
Rubin said: "It's impossible to say that in advance."
</P>
<P>
The United States has proposed that Israel makes a further
withdrawal of 13.1 percent of land from the West Bank in the next
phase of pullback, but Israel rejected the proposals on the ground
of security, saying it could only cede 10 percent of the land,
which it occupied after the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Albright will fly to London from Mongolia on May 3, at the end
of a week-long trip to Asia, and meeting with Netanyahu and Arafat
will be on May 4. Rubin said a three-way meeting was unlikely, but
he did not rule one out.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also said Washington appreciated the efforts British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and other European leaders were making
to try to reopen the Israeli-Palestinian talks after a year-long
delay.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Kibbutz Communities Undergo Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Kibbutzim in Israel, the
largest communitarian movement in the world today, have seen great
changes in recent years to suit new social conditions, an Israeli
scholar said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Members of Kibbutzim, or collective farms or settlements in the
Jewish state, are now enjoying more freedom like disposing their
own money, said Shlomo Getz, head of Institute for Research of
Kibbutz of Haifa University.
</P>
<P>
The communities' responsibilities for each individual have been
reduced, the professor said as briefing a group of foreign
reporters on the development of Kibbutz.
</P>
<P>
Some communities have even adopted the reward system to wipe
out equalitarianism, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel's first Kibbutz was established in 1908 on the shores of
the Sea of Galiee as the realization of the ideology of the
communal. Its members were organized on the basis of public
ownership. Its principle was self-reliance, equality and
cooperation in production, consumption and education.
</P>
<P>
There are now 275 kibbutz communities in Israel, scattering
throughout the country from the Golan Heights in the north to the
Red Sea in the south. Most of them are in the northern hills and
valleys and in the Negev desert in the south.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why kibbutz communities have survived for nine
decades, Getz pointed out to their ability to make changes to
different conditions and adapt to advanced technologies and
management methods.
</P>
<P>
More and more kibbutz communities are separating economic
management system from the social management system, Getz said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that the kibbutz communities that
focused on agriculture production have begun to develop industrial
projects. Industry now makes up about 70 percent of the total
kibbutz production.
</P>
<P>
Getz noted that the kibbutz communities are now playing a very
important role in Israel's economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 125,000 kibbutz members constitute only 2.5
percent of Israel's population, but their contribution to the
national economy accounts for 40 percent in agricultural sector,
7.7 percent in industrial output, 8.4 percent in industrial export
and 10 percent in tourism.

<HEADLINE> Africa to Intensify War on Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of drug control
agencies all over Africa and elements of the international
community gathered here Monday to probe ways to intensify war
against drug through closer co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Noting the continued trend in the cultivation, abuse and
trafficking of cannabis, otherwise known as Indian hemp, and the
emerging illicit trafficking in psychotropic substances and
chemical precursors in Africa, participants at the meeting vowed
to find lasting solutions to the multi-dimensional problems
associated the traffic in and abuse of the drug substances.
</P>
<P>
The 10th meeting of the Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement
Agencies in Africa, dubbed HONLEA-Africa Abuja '98, which is
jointly organized by the United Nations Drug Control Program
(UNDCP) and Nigeria's National Drug Law Enforcement Agency
(NDLEA), also draws observers from such international
organizations as ICPO-Interpol and World Customs Organization, as
well as those from Canada, France, Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address at the meeting, Nigerian Head of State,
General Sani Abacha urged all African countries to take urgent
steps to become party to all existing UN conventions on drug
control.
</P>
<P>
Abacha said although illicit drug trafficking and abuse is
something of recent in African countries, the situation is
totally different, "as we are faced with a crime completely alien
to us with the result that most African countries are battling
with couriers of these drugs."
</P>
<P>
"What is more worrisome," he added, "is that several African
cities are graduating from transit to consumer countries."
</P>
<P>
As a result, Abacha noted, "Africa is no longer only
confronted with problems of political instability and poverty,
but is today constrained to contend with multi-faceted problems
associated with the illicit traffic and use of narcotic drugs and
psychotropic substances."
</P>
<P>
Tony White, UNDCP representative, while praising the positive
reaction of African countries to the deteriorating illicit drug
situation within the continent, said UNDCP will continue to
enthusiastically back the regional and sub-regional drug control
action plans they have adopted.
</P>
<P>
It is the hope of UNDCP, he added, that "African governments
will now place emphasis on effecting special national measures
that will translate regional drug control declarations into
concrete action and results."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the five-day HONLEA meeting will provide a
good opportunity for African countries, UNDCP and the entire
international community to strengthen co-operation in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted the current HONLEA meeting, a biennial event,
is of crucial significance to drug control in Africa, as it is
held only little more than six weeks from the 20th special
session of the UN General Assembly on International Drug Control.
</P>
<P>
The UN conference is designed to offer leaders of the world
their first opportunity for several years to consider together
the issue of illicit drugs and reaffirm their commitment to
taking decisive and united action to overcome the evil.
</P>
<P>
African countries are expected to be well prepared at the
forthcoming UN conference, to be held under the slogan "A
Drug-Free World -- We Can Do It". The HONLEA meeting is a forum
for this effort.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.N. to Focus on Averting Freshwater Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATION, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Beginning Monday, the U.N.
Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) is holding a
two-week session with an aim at improving freshwater management,
as the matter has drawing world attention.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980 some 2 billion people in developing countries have
gained access to better water supplies and another 400 have got
better sanitation.
</P>
<P>
However, these gains have been largely offset by population
growth. One billion people worldwide still lack adequate supplies
of clean drinking water and over 2 billion do not have access to
adequate sanitation facilities, according to U.N. figures.
</P>
<P>
There is pressing demand on water supplies from agriculture,
industry, households as water use has been growing at more than
twice the rate of population increase in this century.
</P>
<P>
Besides, rivers and groundwater are becoming increasingly
polluted, ignoring the need to sustain natural ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has found that unless action is taken, two
thirds of the world's people will face severe water resources
problems by the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
It is under these circumstances that the UNCSD, set up to track
progress after the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, is bringing
government officials together to forge an international consensus
on a strategic approach towards the challenge.
</P>
<P>
A series of proposals and ideas have been raised in this
direction, among them a call on donor countries to provide new and
additional financial resources to developing countries for
investment and management in water infrastructure and management.
</P>
<P>
Others include better coordination between donors and
recipients to use existing resources more efficiently and
enforcement of regulation to protect rivers through public-private
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of the current discussions stands further
access to water trough pricing, private investment and other
market mechanisms while ensuring that poor people can afford
adequate water.
</P>
<P>
The other point of interest is the improvement of assessment of
freshwater supplies and other economic, social and environmental
factors as a basis for policy-making.
</P>
<P>
A message from the World Bank is that it is prepared to lend
half of the 60 billion-80 billion U.S. dollars needed for external
financing in basic water projects in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials hope that the dialogue ending on May 1 will come
up with new consensus on the solution of the water problem under
the theme of "water for all, all for water," as UNCSD chairman
Cielito Habito put it.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Hails U.S. Help in Anti-Missile Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday he is "more than pleased" with
U.S. commitment to funding Israel's acquisition of a third Arrow
anti-ballistic missile battery.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before his meeting with visiting
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Netanyahu said that the
American assistance shows its "tremendous understanding" of the
security needs of Israel.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with his Israeli counterpart Yitzhak Mordechai
early Monday, Cohen announced that the U.S. is ready to fund
research and development of the third Arrow battery of Israel,
which he said would improve Israel's defense capability against
missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that Arrow battery has shown success in a
number of trials, and it could open a hope for solution to the
proliferation of ballistic missiles into "irresponsible hands."
</P>
<P>
Cohen stressed that the U.S. is deeply committed to Israel's
security and maintaining Israel's qualitative edge in weaponry.
</P>
<P>
He said he would cooperate with Israel in every way to explore
Israel's desire and need to modernize its defense capability.
</P>
<P>
The cost of establishing the third battery is reportedly about
150 million U.S. dollars. Cohen, who arrived in Israel on Monday,
will return home via Greece on Tuesday. His tour in the Middle
East has taken him to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Senior EU Official Urges Rethinking Over Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Union (EU)
Commission official urged here Monday the international community
to reconsider the seven-year-old international sanctions imposed
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a London conference on the U.N. oil-for-food program
opening early Monday, EU Humanitarian Affairs Commissioner Emma
Bonino said that the long-standing trade embargo upon Iraq had
left the country facing "unbearable hardships."
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi experience gives rise to a number of questions about
whether we should not reconsider the way economic sanctions are
drawn up, decided and applied," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed that the international community "must
remember that sanctions have humanitarian side-effects which
affect innocent populations."
</P>
<P>
"It would be unfair not to bear in mind that we, the
international community, have also played a part in the disarray
of Iraqi society," she added.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day conference, representatives from 15 EU
countries, the United Nations, major donors and non-governmental
organizations will discuss how to meet the humanitarian needs of
the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi government has launched verbal attacks upon
the London conference, calling it an attempt to interfere in
Iraq's international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf dismissed the
two-day London conference as "evil," saying it was "doomed to
fail."

presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
The Special group, set up under the Memorandum of Understanding
reached between the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Iraqi
Government on February 23, accompanied the weapon experts form the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect the presidential sites from
March 25 to April 4, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report says the inspection was conducted in a very smooth
way due to the cooperation provided by the Iraqi Government, and
there were no prohibited weapons or materials and database found.
</P>
<P>
The report says the initial entry to the eight presidential
sites in Iraq mainly have three gains: the acquired database will
allow UNSCOM and IAEA to conduct more focused subsequent
inspections and support both ongoing monitoring tasks as well as
searching for prohibited materials and related documents; the
visits allow the inspectors to gain a much better understanding of
the nature of the facilities in these areas and that will help
dispel many uncertainties and concerns; the precedent of access to
the sites and the use of normal UNSCOM/IAEA inspection techniques
was demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
The report also points out there was very little equipment,
documentation or other material in the sites at all. It was
clearly apparent that all sites had undergone extensive
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
It says it was apparent that some key issues will arise again
in the not too distant future and the United Nations Security
Council should be prepared to face them, Certainly, the matter of
continuing access is unsettled and will ultimately re-emerge as
the Iraqi side clearly feels that the phase in the February 23
Memorandum of the Understanding referring to "initial and
subsequent visits" means a limited period only.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Fight Against Hashish Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will take action
against the production, smuggling, trade and consumption of the
drugs like hashish, a senior official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Acting General Precurator Antonio Namburete said in his work
report to the Parliament that the government is to map out plans
to prevent, control and treat the drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that in the past five years, about 220 tons of
hashish, the strongest form of the drug cannabis, has entered
Mozambique and then smuggled into other countries and regions
like North America, Europe and South Africa after being repacked.
</P>
<P>
Namburete said the hashish smuggling came to light in 1993
when police authorities in Holland, Canada and Switzerland
warned that they had found hashish smuggled into their countries
in tins packed as tea and cashew nut from Mozambique's Nacala port.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Visit Angola Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will pay a state visit to Angola next week to
boost the peace process in the country, presidential spokesman
Parks Mankahlana said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The visit, planned for April 29, was provisionally scheduled
to last only one day, during which Mandela would hold talks with
his Angolan counterpart Eduardo Dos Santos, Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
The visit was "really about bilateral relations and
strengthening ties", he said.
</P>
<P>
Angola had been high on the Southern African agenda and
Mandela had been involved in negotiations to get the warring
parties -- Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the governing Popular
Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA) -- to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process has been going very well. He (Mandela) is
going to give his blessings to (it)," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The South African-Angolan Business Forum said last week that
some of its members would form part of a delegation organized by
the South African Department of Trade and Industry to accompany
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) urged the
world to uphold United Nations sanctions imposed on UNITA last
October.
</P>
<P>
The OAU also called on UNITA to implement the final phases of
the peace plan. The movement has yet to hand over a number of the
some 335 towns it held since the peace pact was signed in
November 1994, though most of its strongholds have been
relinquished.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy in Cyprus for Peace Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. State Department special
coordinator for Cyprus Tomas Miller arrived here Monday for a
brief visit to hold talks with Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders
on the stalled peace process on the island.
</P>
<P>
Soon after his arrival, Miller crossed into the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern part of Nicosia where he held a
two-hour-long meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash,
Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation TV reported.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Miller told reporters that he was pleased
to see Denktash again. "I look forward very much to
returning to the island in the not too distant future with
Ambassador Holbrooke for what will be a very very important
visit, in the early part of May," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy refrained from giving any details about the
content of his talks with Denktash, saying only that they had
discussed the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was more optimistic now, Miller replied, "I do not
get optimistic or pessimistic, I am here to do a job, a job that
our government, that President Bill Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright think is a very important job."
</P>
<P>
Denktash also told reporters that it is always helpful to talk
about the Cyprus problem with people "who have good intentions of
trying to help us, especially with trusted friends who are not
trying to remove the problem away from the context of the U.N.."
</P>
<P>
Later Monday, Miller had a meeting with Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides, but the content of the meeting was not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Miller described his
visit as "very very important."
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts to try to address the core issues of the Cyprus
problem will continue," the U.S. envoy said, adding that "we are
trying our best and this is an intensive American effort and we
will do the best we can."
</P>
<P>
Miller's visit is widely seen here as laying the ground for a
visit to the island by U.S. presidential emissary Richard
Holbrooke, who is expected to arrive in Cyprus on May 2.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke and Miller visited the island early this month in an
effort to resume the bicommunal dialog.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process was bogged down after Denktash's
refusal to attend the bicommunal talks in protest of the European
Union's decision to start accession talks with the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens
coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who will leave here Monday night, is due to visit
Ankara and Athens for further talks on the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Strives to Pay Debt: Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's retired
President Julius Nyerere Monday called on people to understand
the government's attitude to try hard to repay its debt.
</P>
<P>
Opening a seminar on debt relief for poverty reduction in Dar
es Salaam, Nyerere said, "The government has no choice. It should
squeeze itself to pay the debt so as to earn respect and borrow
more."
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, the founding father of the nation who still has a wide
political influence, was reacting to a growing outcry by common
people that the government should give up debt repayment since
most of the country's social services are deteriorating with the
increase of external debt.
</P>
<P>
He urged people not to confuse the government's moral duty to
pay and its limited capacity of doing so.
</P>
<P>
The desire and willingness to pay is very different from the
capacity to pay, he said, adding that even the donor community
knows that Tanzania is difficult to pay its debt.
</P>
<P>
"If you borrow you can't avoid the obligation to pay. If you
don't pay, you shouldn't borrow any more," he said. "You pay so
as to be qualified to borrow."
</P>
<P>
"I can't see realistically if a poor country like Tanzania can
say no to service its debt," Nyerere said at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The external debt of Tanzania, which has a population of 30
million, has risen from three billion U.S. Dollars in 1998 to
eight billion dollars at present. The country is spending 35
percent of its revenue on debt service.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nyerere appealed donor countries to consider
writing off poor countries's debt because there is also a moral
obligation for them to do so. He said a big portion of the money
borrowed by Tanzania is going back to the creditors in one way
or another.
</P>
<P>
"What the poor countries can gain is known while the loss to
donor countries is negligible," he said. "The benefits will be
immediate."
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by the Nyerere Foundation, was attended
by government officials, diplomats, academicians and the public.

Zhu said that the two countries have cooperated on implementing
the joint declaration on Macao and that China will strictly abide
by it and try to settle issues related to the handover of Macao in
a spirit of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to Hong Kong's smooth handover and the maintenance of
its stability and prosperity as an example, Zhu said that with
such success, the issue of Macao will be resolved in an even
better manner.
</P>
<P>
Both countries, in handling the matters related to Macao,
should give consideration to the overall friendship and long-term
interests and demonstrate a spirit of cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Guterres said that Portugal is willing to see the "One Country,
Two Systems" policy implemented in Macao, and that he hopes Macao
will become a bridge between the two countries after 1999.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said they agree that the two countries should
show more concern and give more guidance to the China-Portugal
Joint Liaison Group.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views on the situation in Asia and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Chinese "Tourist Paradise" Now Getting Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The city of Suzhou, which is known
as a "tourist paradise" in China, has visitors from around the
world who come to see its gardens and traditional architectural
attractions.
</P>
<P>
Few people have perhaps noticed that the city is quietly
building itself into a "paradise" for overseas investors as well,
with its five-year-old Suzhou New District, a key hi-tech
development zone that has been designed for foreign-funded
companies, with its modern buildings and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
A number of financial, educational, cultural and health-care
facilities have also been set up in the zone. Trees and grass
cover 35 percent of the district. More than 300 million yuan was
spent on building the zone's 12 schools.
</P>
<P>
A trim, efficient district government has also been established
to provide good services for foreigners doing business there.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have begun to pay off. International rating
services have given the New District the highest rating of the
country's 14 state development zones, and more overseas investors
have come to the zone.
</P>
<P>
By early April, over 300 overseas-funded enterprises had been
set up in the zone, including international giants like Japan's
Mitsubishi and the U.S.'s Motorola.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, the New District had a GDP of 6 billion yuan, 15
billion yuan in industrial output value, and 680 million US
dollars worth of exports, up 50 percent, 67 percent and 70
percent, respectively, from the previous year.
</P>

The Suzhou Hi-Tech Industry Joint Stock Co. Ltd. was listed in
August 1996 and remains a blue-chip stock.

The fourth floor of the building in downtown Changsha suddenly
crumbled at around 5:00 p.m., injuring four people on the third

<P>
The four were rushed to the hospital but there were at least
six other people still trapped under the rubble, one of whom was
confirmed dead, according to local sources.

Resue workers had to tunnel about 10 meters through the debris
to make an opening to the trapped people to pass them water and
food, while efforts to remove parts of the structure continued.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti government would
remove all stumbling blocks hindering the economic reform and
development mainly in trade and industrial fields, Kuwaiti
Commerce and Industry Minister Abdel Aziz Al-Dekheel said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dekheel told Kuwait's first businessmen conference, which
opened here Monday, that "we are keen on restructuring the
commerce and industry ministry" to "strengthen our ability to
remove all obstacles blocking the trade activities."
</P>
<P>
Dekheel indicated that the Kuwaiti government is intended to
review legislations and enact new laws in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"We will work on establishing a new law to organize
investments of foreign capitals and to reconsider the law of
trade and insurance companies, as well as registering patents and
copy rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is organized by Kuwaiti Chamber of Commerce and
Industry to discuss the country's economic problems and attended
by 600 participants, including ministers, senior officials,
parliamentary leaders and local businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting is being held at a time of Kuwait's highest
budget deficit since 1991, a bad employment situation and a
long-delayed privatization process.
</P>
<P>
Local economists believe that measures must be taken to check
the budget deficit and the demographic and manpower disorder.
</P>
<P>
For the purpose of boosting trade exchanges and quicken the
process of economic reforms, Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah said at the
opening of the conference Monday that his government would adopt
"structural reforms" to strengthen economic freedom, promote
foreign investments and curb red tape.
</P>
<P>
He added that his government is keen to establish a free trade
zone which would provide an appropriate social, political and
economic environment to enhance the role of the private sector.

<P>
OTTAWA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien will visit Cuba from April 27 to 28 at the invitation of
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
The visit, announced Tuesday by the Canadian government, will
be the first by a Canadian prime minister since Pierre Trudeau
made the trip to the Caribbean island nation 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
News of the two-day trip was leaked last weekend when Chretien
was in Chile to attend the 34-nation summit of Americas, which
focused primarily on launching a new trans-America free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Asked to confirm the visit, Chretien replied that Canada had a
long-standing relationship with Cuba. "It was about time" to make
the visit, Chretien said at the time.
</P>
<P>
"Canada has long practised a policy of constructive engagement
with Cuba," Chretien said in a government news release Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the best way to promote our values is through
dialogue, not isolation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
During the visit to Cuba, Chretien will meet with President
Castro, church and business people and members of non-government
organizations.
</P>
<P>
He will also participate in the inauguration of a new terminal
at Havana's international airport, which has been built with
Canadian financing.
</P>
<P>
Canada and Cuba "have maintained active, uninterrupted
diplomatic relations since 1945," said the press release.

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji, who presided
over a State Council discussion in Beijing today, said that a

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Ready to Cooperate for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides Reiterated Tuesday his readiness to cooperate in any
initiatives, under U.N. auspices, for a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, read for him by Government Spokesman
Christos Stylianides, Clerides noted that the visits here by
U.S. Presidential Emissary, Richard Holbrooke, and State
Department Special Cyprus Coordinator, Tom Miller, "are part of
the initiative, that will be stepped up in May."
</P>
<P>
"The Cyprus government thanks (U.S.) President (Bill) Clinton
for placing the solution of the Cyprus problem within
U.S. Priority issues and for entrusting the promotion of the
American initiative to Mr. Holbrooke, an experienced, tried and
tested negotiator," he added.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, accompanied by Miller, had visited Cyprus early
this month and is expected back in early May.
</P>
<P>
Miller was in Cyprus Monday and met both Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
However, the contents of the meetings were not disclosed since
the parties involved have kept the contacts confidential.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek Cypriot side is ready to cooperate constructively
in any initiatives under the U.N. umbrella, to back the
U.N. Secretary-General's good offices mission, aiming at a
comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem," Clerides said in
his statement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the solution must be based on
U.N. resolutions on Cyprus and two high-level agreements reached
between the two sides in 1977 and 1979, stipulating for a bizonal,
bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports about a four-party meeting on Cyprus,
attended by Greek and Turkish Cypriots, and representatives from
Greece and Turkey, Stylianides said at his daily press briefing
that "this issue has not been raised with us by anybody."
</P>
<P>
"The Cyprus government believes that any procedures or
consultations must be carried out under U.N. aegis," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign envoys involved in the Cyprus peace effort have been
trying to persuade Denktash to return to the negotiating table
after he announced he would not participate in peace talks unless
his breakaway state in northern areas of Cyprus is recognized.
</P>
<P>
Denktash announced his decision after the European Union (EU)
reconfirmed last December that accession talks with Cyprus were
to open as scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Food Situation Critical in S. Sudan: WFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
Tuesday warned that the food situation in Bahr el Ghazal region
in southern Sudan has reached a critical level and the region
would face catastrophe unless it receives more relief food within
a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued here Tuesday quoted David Fletcher, head
of WFP's southern sector operation for Sudan, as saying that "the
threat of thousands of people dying from lack of food and disease
is becoming a reality."
</P>
<P>
At present, it said, WFP is barely meeting 30 percent of the
food needs in Bahr el Ghazal which is estimated at a minimum
requirement of 6,000 tons for 350,000 of the worst affected
people in the region.
</P>
<P>
WFP is currently authorized to fly only one C-130 Hercules
into southern Sudan and unless it receives permission to double
or triple its airlift of relief food, the region will face
catastrophe, the release noted.
</P>
<P>
Following heavy fighting erupted recently in the region, WFP
sent an emergency mission to nine key locations last weekend to
determine how many more people may now be in need of urgent
humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
A lot of people in the region have to rely more heavily on
scarce wild foods which are quickly consumed while most farmers
have eaten their household stocks of seeds.
</P>
<P>
WFP said that farmers in the region would not be able to
cultivate a crop during the current planting season unless the
international community acts quickly to provide seeds and tools.
</P>
<P>
The Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) said some 230 tons of seeds
have so far been delivered to Bahr el Ghazal and an additional
110 tons in the base camp at Lokichoggio of northern Kenya are
awaiting delivery. But the region needs double this amount of
seeds, it added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Bahr el Ghazal crisis, WFP pointed out,
other areas like Upper Nile and Eastern Equatoria are facing
serious food shortages due to a combination of drought and
insecurity.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Portuguese Prime Ministers Hold Talks In Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji met with
Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Guterres in Beijing today to
discuss bilateral ties and cooperation on the handover of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that Guterres' visit will inject new
vigor into the bilateral friendship.
</P>
<P>
In the 19 years that diplomatic ties have been established,
co-operation in various spheres has gone smoothly, and the
increasing number of high-level contacts have played an especially
stimulating role, Zhu noted. China is willing to work together
with Portugal for an overall partnership geared to the new
century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Guterres praised China's achievements in its reforms and
opening up, and said he believes China is the ideal cooperative
partner for Portugal and other EU countries, and Portugal will
continue to try to improve the EU-China relationship.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders said that, with the globalization of the economy,
international political relations have become more diverse, and
all countries, big or small, should play a due role in world peace
and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They said they agree that there is great potential in bilateral
economic and trade co-operation, and government departments should
increase contacts and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he believes that the Portuguese entrepreneurs
accompanying Guterres on his visit will create an opportunity for
both countries to deepen understanding and expand cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Portugal encourages mutual investment and cooperation, and is
keen on setting up a new cooperative partnership with China in the
economy, trade, science and technology, Guterres said.

exchanged views on bilateral ties and regional and international
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that Sino-Japanese relations are now in a period of
inheriting the past and ushering in the future. This called for
joint efforts to promote Sino-Japanese friendships from generation
to generation.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the two nations should take lessons from history and
proceed from the strategic views of maintaining world peace and
promoting development.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bank Governor Outlines China's Financial Reform Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The governor of the People's Bank
of China, Dai Xianglong, said today at the World Bank Forum's 1998
China Business Summit that China this year will bring into effect
most of the major policies for the financial and banking sector
reform.
</P>
<P>
This way, China will change the PBOC's structure and improve
its controls of the money supply by introducing more advanced
monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
The country will centralize state-owned commercial bank
operations in large and medium-sized cities to improve banking
services for large and medium-sized enterprises. Commercial banks
will be given full autonomy and be self-regulating.
</P>
<P>
China will have more local commercial banks in urban areas,
with local governments, enterprises and residents holding shares.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that the Chinese government will also reform the
credit cooperatives so as to better serve the collectively-owned
and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The securities and insurance business will be separated from
the banks, and subject to different regulations.
</P>
<P>
China also needs to streamline management of the central bank
and develop internal controls in accordance with international
practices, he said.
</P>
<P>
China began its banking reforms in 1985 and has established a
financial system supported by the state-owned commercial banks
under PBOC's supervision, with financial policy separated from
commercial practice, and more ways for enterprises to get funds.

</P>
<P>
Committee coordinator BI Director Miranda Goeltom is assisted
by three foreign experts from the International Monetary Fund

recent agreement reached between Indonesia and the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has conducted economic and financial reforms since
October last year in accordance with the agreement it signed with
the IMF. At the end of October last year, the government closed 16
ailing private commercial banks in a bid to improve the efficiency
of the country's banking system.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the government announced the suspension of
seven private commercial banks and placing of another seven banks
under the management of the Indonesia Bank Restructuring Agency
(IBRA).

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Albanian exports in the first
quarter have increased by 66 percent to reach 6.1 billion leks
(38.4 million U.S. dollars), compared with the same period last
year, the Albanian Telegraphic Agency says.
</P>
<P>
The agency said textile products and leather shoes, the two top
exports, brought in almost one fourth of export incomes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's mining industry has resumed production
gradually and boosted mineral product exports.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the exports increase to the resumption of
production in Albania's small enterprises, especially small
processing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the corresponding period last year, the country's
imports rose by 61 percent from January to March, accounting for
28.5 billion leks (179 million dollars).

<P>
Raw textile materials, food, machines, mechanical and
electrical equipment and spare parts are among the major import
items.

<HEADLINE>   Approval of Kiriyenko not a Certainty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A Russian official said Tuesday
that the endorsement of Sergei Kiriyenko as prime minister in a
parliamentary third vote is not a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Kitenkov, President Boris Yeltsin's representative in
the State Duma (the lower house of parliament), denied that the
president had exerted strong pressure on the parliamentary parties
on this issue.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that after the third nomination of Kiriyenko
the president had not sent to the Duma any other letters. "This is
up to the president," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, Acting First Deputy
Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov believes the president's nomination
of Kiriyenko is heading for approval on the third vote of the Duma.
</P>
<P>
He said he thought Kiriyenko would be approved "at any rate."
</P>
<P>
Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov on Tuesday announced after the
Council meeting the Duma decided to consider Kiriyenko's
endorsement as prime minister at a plenary meeting of the house on
Friday, April 24.
</P>
<P>
He said the lower house wished the president would introduce
the candidate at the Duma's third vote, and he would like to have
consultations with the Speaker of the Federation Council (the
upper house) Yegor Stroyev soon.
</P>
<P>
The upper house speaker, for his part, told reporters on
Tuesday that the Federal Council would discuss on Wednesday a Duma
appeal in connection with Kiriyenko's candidacy for prime
minister.

<HEADLINE> Vehicle Population Increases in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's capital of Harare, a
city of nearly two million people, now has a total of 261,059
vehicles, making it possible for every eight people sharing one
car, a government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of vehicles was expected to grow in the next few
months, bringing about more traffic congestion problems in the
city.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Transport and Energy told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that the city's roads were not designed for
such vehicle numbers and measures need to be taken to improve the
flow of traffic in the capital.
</P>
<P>
He said the increases in the number of people buying vehicles
in the city had created parking space shortages and traffic jams
during peak hours.
</P>
<P>
"The vehicle population, it seems, will continue to grow and
one solution will be to educate people to use public transport at
times," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said the majority of motorists in the
city could only use public transport if it is improved and
becomes more reliable.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Harare City Council banned heavy vehicles in
the city during peak hours and increased parking fees in an
effort to reduce the flow of vehicles in the city.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Wins First Rounder to Face Sampras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi recorded his first
round win with ease on Tuesday, only finding his next opponent too
strong in the Monte Carlo Open tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Agassi routed Todd Martin 6-2, 6-1 in 55 minutes in the opening
round but would next face Pete Sampras who was to regain his top
spot from Chilean Marcelo Rios.
</P>
<P>
"To play Pete so early in the tournament is unsettling. He's
the guy you always expect to play at the end of the tournament,"
said Agassi.
</P>
<P>
Agassi played one match on clay court last year and lost the
second round at the French Open two years ago, his last European
tournament on the slow surface.
</P>
<P>
But against Martin, Agassi sailed further rather smooth, even
rallying back from 0-40 in the first game of the second set to win
next five games for a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Sampras lost the No. 1 ranking to Rios after the Chilean beat
Agassi in the Lipton final.
</P>
<P>
Rios injured an elbow and withdraw from the Davis Cup match and
the tournaments in Barcelona and Monte Carlo, which will cost Rios
the top ranking.

<HEADLINE> World Economic Forum Discusses China's Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Qin Xiao, president of the China
International Trust &AMP; Investment Corporation, told the first
plenary session of the World Economic Forum that, after avoiding
the Asian financial crisis and achieving high economic growth and low
inflation in 1997, China is on the threshold of having a greater
impact on the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The soft landing in 1996 has expanded the country's role as a
stablizing force in the Asian economy, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Schwab, the founder and president of the forum, said that
China's economic controls during the financial crisis became an
important factor in the direction of the global economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He said that by not devaluating the yuan after the currencies
of countries nearby plunged, China showed how it could be a
"stablizing force" in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lin Yifu of Beijing University and Yukon Huang,
director of the World Bank's China Unit, said that the deepening
of the economic restructuring will guarantee the stability of the
Chinese currency and future economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Laurence Brahm, managing director of Hong Kong's Naga Group,
said the pragmatic policies of the Chinese government in the
reform of state-owned enterprises, which concentrate financial aid
in 1,000 large enterprises and encourage the liberalization of
240,000 medium-sized and small ones, provide a sound environment
for Chinese enterprises to adapt themselves to the market economy.
</P>
<P>
According to a three-year reform plan, the central government
will use re-organizations, mergers, acquisitions, leasing and
stock holding for the small and medium-sized State enterprises.
</P>
<P>
And, to ensure a stable exchange rate for the Renminbi, China
could suffer a decline in exports this year, but the country's
competitive edge in labor prices will still be a big attraction
for foreign investment, according to Chen Bangzhu, vice-minister
in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, and Chen
Zhong, the executive deputy-director of the China Enterprise
Management Association.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, said
that the bank will increase the currency supply a slight amount
this year to ensure eight-percent growth in GDP.

<HEADLINE> Experimental Direct Shipping Successful: official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Direct shipping between China's
mainland and Taiwan has been sound and smooth since it started on
a trail basis one year ago, according to an official in charge of
Taiwan affairs.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 10 ships from ten companies, six from the mainland
and four from Taiwan, are operating in the waters between Fuzhou,
Xiamen and Kaohsiung, and have handled some 185,000 TEUs of
cargoes.
</P>
<P>
The official noted the pilot direct shipping has been carried
out in an orderly manner and no safety problems or disputes have
been raised. Most shipping companies have achieved book balance or
are beginning to make profit.
</P>
<P>
He said that the experiment in direct shipping between the
mainland and Taiwan marks an important progress in developing full
direct navigation across the straits as it has broken the impasse
between the two sides that was in existence for nearly fifty
years.
</P>
<P>
However, due to Taiwan authorities' policies, the shipping is
not direct in nature as desired by the mainland side, but needs
transferring station like Kaohsiung, which makes cost go high
while leaving shipping companies little profit margins, the
official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He called on Taiwan authorities to remove the restrictions to
facilitate real direct shipping to the interests of people on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
"Once Taiwan authorities lifts the ban on customs entry and
allows direct cargo shipping, there will be no problems for the
mainland to open its main ports to Taiwan," the official
said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto: Indonesia Tries to Overcome Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
Tuesday called for an all-out effort to overcome the economic
crisis to prevent the country's businesses from being taken over
by foreign corporations.
</P>
<P>
"What will happen if (the economic turmoil) continues? Our
industries will be paralyzed, giving way for foreign corporations
to take over Indonesian companies that have collapsed," the
president said when inaugurating an industrial center in Sukabumi,
West Java, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
He said the country has been badly hit by the monetary crisis
that has swept through Southeast Asia and has weakened its
currencies, with the Indonesian rupiah falling the hardest, from
2,500 per U.S. dollar to 10,000 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said the country could use loans from the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in solving the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia could also generate fresh funds by selling the assets
of state-owned companies, he said, noting that 100 of the 160
state companies are sound.
</P>
<P>
"If we sell some of (the assets of these companies), we could
secure funds to continue development. If we fail to get loans from
foreign parties, we could still earn about 5 billion U.S. dollars
from selling the assets of state companies," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia also has various natural resources which it could
rely on, such as crude oil and coal, he said.
</P>
<P>
He promised to continue efforts to eradicate poverty amidst the
economic crisis.

think a woman is a petite person, not to be knocked around."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's stand centers on a clause in the constitution
forbidding discrimination on grounds of race, color or religious
persuasion.
</P>
<P>
However, Tunstall said if it has health risks for women boxers,
the sport might be heavily criticized by female participants.
</P>
<P>
"This move by New Zealand is totally unfounded," Tunstall said,
"and I believe 95 percent of women think as I do."

<HEADLINE> ICRC Reiterates Call for Immediate Release of Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC) and International Federation of Red Cross
and the Red Crescent Societies Tuesday reiterated the call for
the immediate and unconditional release of their staff members
abducted in Mogadishu, Somalia.
</P>
<P>
An ICRC press release issued here Tuesday said, following the
broadcast of TV pictures, the ICRC and the other agencies are
extremely worried about the situation of their staff members
abducted in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The pictures showed a man threatening an ICRC delegate with
his gun and issuing a ransom demand together with an ultimatum,
the release said.
</P>
<P>
Shocked by the spectacle, the ICRC and the other international
aid agencies appealed to all parties concerned not to expose the
captives to public curiosity, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC is in constant contact with elders of the Somali
clans and with politicians and influential Somalis who are
holding discussions with the kidnappers, it said.
</P>
<P>
"No ransom demand has been made through these channels. The
ICRC remains confident that it has adopted the right approach and
in commitment of all those involved to secure the unconditional
release of the hostages," the ICRC added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that unidentified Somali gunmen kidnapped 10
aid workers from a small airstrip north of Mogadishu. The ICRC
condemned the kidnapping of the aid workers and called for their
immediate release.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Saudi Arabia on Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat arrived in the Red Sea coast city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
Tuesday to discuss with Saudi leaders the possibility of a Arab
summit for activating the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mustafa Deeb was quoted
by the Kuwait News Agency as saying that Arafat would meet with
Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdel Aziz and Crown Prince Abdullah Bin
Abdel Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on the proposal to hold an emergency Arab
summit in order to put Arab perceptions towards the deteriorating
situation in the peace process, Deeb said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has been calling for
an Arab summit to confront Israeli activities and its refusal to
comply with the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat would also evaluate with the Saudi leaders results of
the tour to the region by British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
means of pushing forward the stalled peace process, Deeb
said. Arafat met Blair in Gaza on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deeb said the Palestinians welcome Blair's proposal over
hosting a summit to include Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to salvage the peace process, but he put the
summit conditional on the participation of Europeans and Americans.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is also expected to discuss means of activating the
Saudi role in containing the current crisis between PNA and Hamas
in light of the assassination of Hamas' military leader Mohei
Eddine Sherif early this month.
</P>
<P>
Arafat last visited Saudi Arabia in June 1997 to drum up
support for Palestinian position on the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
During his stay there both sides reiterated that a
satisfactory peace in the Middle East would not be achieved
unless the legitimate Arab demands, based in Madrid peace
conference, are met.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Pledges to Set up Sports Facilities in time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia pledged on Tuesday
that 450 million U.S. dollars worth of sports facilities will be
ready in time for the Commonwealth Games in September, dismissing
worries about smog and water shortages.
</P>
<P>
"We will deliver what we promised to deliver," said Information
Ministry secretary general Zawawi Mahmuddin in a news conference
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
New facilities including a stadium with a capacity of 90,000
seats, would be ready by the end of June, Mahmuddin said.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 athletes and officials from more than 60 countries
and regions are expected to compete in the games slated from
September 11 to 21.
</P>
<P>
However, some athletes have expressed concerns about a
recurrence of heavy smog from forest and bush fires which
blanketed much of Southeast Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
Mahmuddin explained that the El Nino phenomenon was a natural
disaster that cut rainfall in much of Southeast Asia and stoked
fires, and no one can predict how long it would last or if the
weather would worsen.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Selangor state government, responsible
for water management at the main site of the games outside the
capital, had taken steps to ensure adequate water supply.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Games organisers have said contractors are having
difficulty getting enough clean water to test venues before
handing them over to the government.
</P>
<P>
A games official said contractors needed 12 million liters of
water, including three million for the new swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
Authorities were expected to meet this week to take up the
contractors' request for water despite the shortage.

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital is busy
building a subway to prepare for the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China next year.
</P>
<P>
Construction on the 13.5-kilometer Fuxingmen-Bawangfen subway
started in 1989 and halted in 1992 because of funding problems
after completing about two kilometers. The subway was originally
scheduled for completion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the former State Planning Commission, the State
Development Bank and the Construction Bank of China provided loans
to the project, setting the project rolling again. The whole
subway will cost 7.57 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion in September of 1999, 30 pairs of trains with a
hourly capacity of 60,000 passengers should greatly alleviate
traffic problems in the city.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has a ring subway and another subway that links the
southwestern corner of the ring subway with Pingguoyuan in western
Beijing. The total length is 42 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> China Confident of Achieving Economic Goals, Vice-Premier Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China is confident of meeting
its economic growth target, curbing inflation and maintaining a
stable currency exchange rate this year, Chinese Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing said today.
</P>
<P>
Li made the statement while addressing the ongoing 1998 China
Business Summit, jointly sponsored by the China Enterprises
Management Association and the World Economic Forum. More than 450
leading business leaders from 40 countries are attending the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Li said, "I can tell all of you present here that we are fully
confident of realizing this year's set objectives of 8 percent
economic growth rate, less than 3 percent of inflation and a
stable exchange rate of RMB."
</P>
<P>
The objectives were announced by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
last month.
</P>
<P>
China's current economic performance is basically normal, Li
said, citing the more than 10 percent growth rate of exports in
the first quarter and the anticipated 7 percent-plus growth of the
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
To ensure steady economic growth, China, while making
efforts to maintain the growing trend in exports, is focusing on
expanding domestic demand, increasing investments in
agriculture, water conservation, forestry, railway and highway
construction, telecommunications, environmental protection and
high-tech sectors. In addition, China is speeding up residential
housing construction, with a view to guiding rural consumption and
expanding rural markets.
</P>
<P>
Facts have shown that the Chinese government is capable of
handling the overall economic development under the conditions of
a socialist market economic and opening wider to the
outside world, Li said, and is capable of maintaining a long-term,
sustainable and rapid and sound economic development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile problems also exist in China's economic development,
he pointed out, citing an irrational economic structure, potential
financial risks, increasing employment pressure and especially the
loss of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We'll help most of the money-losing medium-sized and large
state firms pull themselves out of difficulties by means of
reform, re-grouping, restructuring and improved management, in a
bid to attain the goal of enabling them introduce a modern
enterprise system by the end of this century," he said.
</P>
<P>
The leader stated that the solution to the state firm issue is
a complicated systematic project.
</P>
<P>
As a support reform measure to the issue, he said, "We'll be
engaged in a strategic restructuring of our state-owned economy,
the establishment of the social insurance system, the financial system
reform and the reform of governmental economic management system."
</P>
<P>
He noted that China will do its utmost to carry out reforms in
the grain circulation, the investment system, the housing system,
the medical insurance system, and the finance and taxation system, in
an effort to make breakthroughs.

CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri arrived here on Tuesday for a three-day visit, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hariri is expected to hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on Israel's proposal to withdraw from south Lebanon and
ways of reviving stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He will brief Mubarak on the outcome of a recent summit between
Lebanon and Syria relating to Israel's offer.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to accept the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 425, which calls for a unilateral Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon. But meanwhile, it said it would not exit
unless security arrangements for border areas are worked out with
Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and his Syrian counterpart Hafez
al-Assad on April 13 reiterated the stance of the two countries on
rejecting the Israeli offer. They insisted that the Israeli
withdrawal must be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's trip followed a brief visit here last Wednesday by
al-Assad. A flurry of diplomatic activities are being carried out
aimed at coordinating Arab stances on the latest development in
the issue of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Hariri will also discuss with Egyptian
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri means of promoting bilateral
cooperation in economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
He will meet with Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on issues of common interest.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Red Cross
has asked foreign countries and non-governmental organizations to
provide assistance to victims plagued by the drought brought about
by the El Nino abnormal phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency Tuesday quoted Teresita Ilsapdin, a
Red Cross public relations officer, as saying that they made the
decision fearing that the local resources may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
Ilsapdin was in the southern Philippines to see for herself the
on-going relief activities and food distribution to families
affected by the drought in the southern Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 2.4 million people have been hit by the
famine caused the drought and at least 53 of them had died in the
south.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the initial fund released to the Presidential
Action Center could not suffice to the demand of affected
residents, that is why we are asking for more donations whether in
kind or cash," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also encouraged politicians to help financially and
physically in the distribution of rice and food in their
respective areas if it is really their intention to serve the
public.
</P>
<P>
However, critics feared that some politicians will take
advantage of the opportunity to "buy" votes for the coming May 11
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine National Food Authority earlier announced that
it has enough buffer stocks to last through the lean months.
</P>
<P>
The government has declared several provinces in Mindanao
calamity areas and released at least 38 million pesos (about 1
million U.S. dollars) as assistances to the victims.

NEW DELHI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China and India, two big
neighbors, have expressed the desire to enhance scientific and
technological cooperation between the two countries at a seminar
held here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the Sino-Indian Technological and Economic
Cooperation Interaction, former Lt. Governor of Delhi Tejendra
Khanna said that there were immense potential of cooperation in
the areas of biotechnology, electronics, communication, energy and
high technologies. There was no rivalry between India and China,
but they complemented each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in India
Lin Shanglin said that the holding of the seminar was a beneficial
exploration and an innovative step for further cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
To keep a long term friendly relationship with its neighboring
countries is the basic national policy of China, he said, adding
India was an important adjacent country and the Chinese government
attached great deal of importance to the development of bilateral
relationship with India.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between the two countries could be manifested
in the fields such as agriculture, energy, electronics, mechanics,
environmental protection and high technology. And new areas of
cooperation should be continually identified, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Indian Technological and Economic Cooperation
Interaction was jointly organized by the World Association for
Small and Medium Enterprises (WASME) and the State Science and
Technology Commission of China in collaboration with the Small
Industries Development Bank of India and the State Bank of India.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Last Apartheid Old Guard Quits from S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Western Cape
Premier Hernus Kriel resigned Monday from his post, marking the
exit of the last National Party (NP) heavyweight of the apartheid
era from politics.
</P>
<P>
The departure of the 56-year-old NP stalwart was interpreted
by other political parties as the end of the NP era and possibly
the start of the crumbling of the NP, which thrived in the
apartheid days.
</P>
<P>
Kriel's quit is perceived to make way for a colored new NP
provincial leader, a move to secure the party's colored votes in
Western Cape, the last NP stronghold constituency, in the 1999
general election.
</P>
<P>
The NP's provincial head council will meet on Thursday evening
to elect an acting Western Cape leader, who will automatically
become premier.
</P>
<P>
The province's Health MEC (Member of Executive Council) Pieter
Marais and Safety MEC Gerald Morkel, both high-profile black
members of the NP, are tipped to be the most likely candidates.
</P>
<P>
Kriel, who held the key portfolio as Minister of Law and Order
from 1991 until the 1994 democratic elections before taking over
the premier office, said his departure would help the NP to put
on a new image.
</P>
<P>
"With my going, the NP will be truly a new NP - both at
national and provincial level," Kriel said while announcing his
resignation to the provincial legislature late Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I have always considered myself to have been part of the old
guard, and that is why I supported the election of our new
leader, Marthinus van Schalkwyk," he said.
</P>
<P>
"New innovative thinking is necessary. In order to achieve
this, a break with the old guard is necessary," said Kriel, the
last of the once powerful NP cabinet to quit the national stage.
</P>
<P>
He said the timing of his quit will give his successor a
chance to establish about him or herself, given that the
elections be held in some time from May to July next year.
</P>
<P>
The new office bearer will be sworn in on May 11. The
appointment will need to be confirmed by the party's Western Cape
congress in September.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress (ANC)'s new Western Cape leader
Ebrahim Rasool, said that Kriel's quit and the NP's search for a
colored leader would not save the party in the coming election.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party (DP) leader Tony Leon said Kriel's
resignation was yet a further blow to the NP. "There is no real
experience left in the National Party," he said.
</P>
<P>
With more veteran NP members deserting the battlefield, the NP
faces an uncertain future in the 1999 election, Leon said.
</P>
<P>
Kriel, who has been in politics for more than 20 years, said
he would go into business "here and there" and would stay out of
politics for the rest of his life.

KAMPALA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's local election at
district level has ended peacefully, local media reported

<P>
Five more districts are about to announce the final results of
the election ended on Monday. They are the districts of Kotido in

<HEADLINE> Philippines Upholds Ban on Lumber Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Tuesday announced that the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources has decided to withdraw its order lifting the ban on
lumber exports.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference here after a Cabinet meeting, the
president said Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Victor
Ramos has withdrawn the order which would have allowed, at a
limited scale, the export of semi-finished lumber.
</P>
<P>
He said the secretary made the decision after due consultations
with the affected sectors and after the Cabinet approved the
recommendations of the consultative meetings held by the
department all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Secretary Victor Ramos was ordered by the president to
exercise due diligence in conduct of hearings with the affected
sectors on the lumber export issue.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Environment and Natural Resources earlier
decided to lift the ban on lumber exports in order to create
employment amid the financial crisis sweeping the country.

<HEADLINE> Global Efforts to Speed up China's Entry of WTO Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese leader today
called for joint efforts of the international community to quicken
the pace of enabling China to enter WTO.
</P>
<P>
The call was issued by Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing at the
ongoing 1998 Business Summit which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Li said, China, as the biggest
developing country in the world, still has a low GDP per
capita and a low living standard, in addition to many traditional
factors restraining its economic development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
China will stick to the set policy of reform and opening up,
and will as always follow the development road suited to China's
national conditions, in order to speed up the establishment of a
socialist market economic structure through opening up wider and
strengthening economic ties and trade with the rest of the world,
and by involving itself in international cooperation in the
process of economic globalization, Li Lanqing said.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing Summit is jointly sponsored by the China
Enterprises Management Association and the World Economic
Forum. More than 450 participants from 40 countries present at the
meeting focus their discussions on policies, prospect, laws and
market of industrial sectors that should be given top
priority.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Soccer legend Pele made his
latest forecast on Monday that Argentina will pose a major threat
to Brazil and will eventually enter the semifinals in the World
Cup this summer.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here, Pele who won three World Cup titles for
Brazil, said that Argentina will be a major threat to Brazil's
hope of retaining the World Cup, saying "they (Argentina) will
reach the semis without doubt."
</P>
<P>
The outgoing Brazilian sports minister said that Argentine
coach Daniel Passarella "already has a well-established team"
whereas Brazilian Mario Zagallo "has not yet formed the crux of
his side."
</P>
<P>
He lamented that Zagallo "has the best players in the world as
individuals, but they are not established, not as organised. And
they will find they have some problems in defence."
</P>
<P>
The soccer legend also forecast that his young compatriot
Ronaldo, the FIFA world player of the year, will become one of the
best stars of the sport should he withstand the pressure.

<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A total of 344 vehicles have been
stolen in Harare and Chitungwiza near the capital in the first
three months of this year, the Herald paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On average, there are three or four cars stolen each day in
Harare and Chitungwiza, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Economic hardships and the ever-expanding ready market for
cheap spares have been blamed for the escalation in car theft and
hijacking cases, the report quoted Superintendent Mbanga (one
name only), Vehicle Theft Squad of the Criminal Investigation
Department as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, most of the vehicles were broken for
spares to be sold in the local market. But luxury vehicles and
the latest range of pick-ups were fraudulently finding their way
into neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The situation is expected to worsen following the influx of
second hand cars with poor spares back-up, the report added.

<HEADLINE> India Plans to Source Components for Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- India's Bharat Electronics
Limited (BEL), one of the country's defense public sectors, has
decided to open an office in Southeast Asia to source critical
components for the company.
</P>
<P>
Singapore was a choice for the office and a high level BEL team
had visited that country late last year to explore the
possibilities, said V. K. Koshi, chairman and managing director of
the company.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia was a place from where most of the critical
components required by BEL could be sourced and the present
currency crisis in the region would make such sourcing economical
for the company, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, BEL was also looking for sourcing the components from
Europe and Japan, he further said.
</P>
<P>
The new move is to overcome a U.S. regulation restricting
import of critical components.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. slapped a unilateral regulation on BEL for its
suspected contribution to the Indian missile and space programs in
June last year, Koshi said.

KAMPALA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- India-based Excel Industries
Limited has offered Monday to Uganda a technology to deal with
hyacinth and gabages, The New Vision reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
S. Maley, the vice president of the Indian company, told Boney
Katatumba, the president of the Uganda Chamber of Commerce and
Industry that his technology is based on injection of enzymes
into garbage and the weed to decompose them. The final product is
a menure and the decompose process can destroy germs in the
garbage.
</P>
<P>
Decomposing thus can avoid spreading diseases such as cholera
and get rid of contamination of environment, the vice president
claimed.
</P>
<P>
The final product is a fertiliser and friendly material to
environment, he underlined.
</P>
<P>
The plastic bags can be collected for making other products
such as flower pots, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Hyacinth is a serious environmental problem for the African
nation suffocating water organisms and blocking transport in the

<HEADLINE> No Need to Devalue RMB, Says Chinese Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said today that there is no need for China to devalue its
currency, whether from the country needs of economic development
or from the country's responsible attitude toward Asia's economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks at the ongoing 1998 Business Summit
attended by 450 leading business people from 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's repeated statement on no devaluation
of RMB has been solidly based on the following facts: adequate
foreign exchange reserve of 140 billion U.S. dollars, an
appropriate foreign debt scale and a rational debt structure and
the gradual and stable opening of its capital market.
</P>
<P>
Within the coming three years, China plans to invest more than
750 billion U.S. dollars in capital construction and therefore
China's market potential is enormous, Li Lanqing said.
</P>
<P>
With efforts over the past ten-plus years, China has formed an
all-faceted, multi-level and broad-area opening up structure,
and has made substantial progress in its economic ties and
trade with other countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China registered a 12.1 percent increase in foreign
trade over the previous year, becoming the tenth largest trading
country in terms of total imports and exports. And this enbaled
the ratio of China's imports and exports to global trade to rise
to 3.9 percent last year from 1.7 percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In introducing foreign funds, Li noted, China has become the
second largest overseas investment destination, next only to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has brought in a total direct foreign investment
of 220.3 billion U.S. dollars and in 1997, China used 64 billion
U.S. dollars in overseas funds, of which 45.3 billion U.S. dollars
are direct investment.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Li said, China is expected to reach a total
trade volume of 400 billion U.S. dollars. With this trade scale in
sight, China would provide an increasing bigger commodity market
for the world as well as more opportunities for overseas
investment, he added.

PARIS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Three-time winner Thomas Muster had
a bad day on Tuesday when he crashed in the first round of the 2.2
million U.S. dollars Monte Carlo Open.
</P>
<P>
Within one hour, Muster, once known as king of clay court, was
toppled by Spaniard Carlos Moya 6-0, 6-3, failing to increase his
record of 42 tournament victories with the last win dated back to
1996.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Austrian, a former world No. one, lost the
first set in 24 hours with all his serves broken, the first time
for Muster to lose a set 6-0 since 1993 against compatriot Horst
Skoff.
</P>
<P>
Muster, winner in 1992, 1995 and 1996, once fought back in the
second set to claw against 14th-seeded Moya, semifinalist last
year, but failed to convert five break points before bowing out of
the rich tournament.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important tournament for me as it is a step
towards the French Open," said Moya, "last year I reached the last
four and I would like to do even better this year here."

TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran has criticized the United
Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) for failing to post a fair
report on its human rights status, the Tehran Times newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the English-language paper, Secretary of
Iran's Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) Hassan Ziaiefar said
the UNHRC rapporteur Maurice Capithorne has been "dishonest" in
his report submitted to the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Capithorne has not based his report on reliable sources, but
mainly on groups "which are terrorist by nature and are opponents
of the Islamic system," Ziaiefar said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.N. rapporteur of not taking a comprehensive
look at the Iranian society as a religious one, and neglecting the
positive developments of human rights in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The IHRC was formed in 1995 to defend Iran's stance on human
rights against western countries' criticism in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Iran maintains that human rights should be based on the Islamic
laws and regulations.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Promises to Create More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa said
Tuesday that the government will take measures to create job
opportunities for the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the citizens to be confident that Hong Kong's
economic situation will become better after a period of
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
In response to reporters' inquiries after the Executive
Council, Tung said that Hong Kong's prospects are bright and its
fundamentals are sound.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the steady growth of the economy of China's
mainland will also bring opportunities to Hong Kong, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility for the government to provide
relief fund to the jobless. He described the relief fund, which is
a common practice in Western countries, as "not good" for the whole
society and has turned out to be a failure in these countries.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in Hong Kong climbed to 3.5 percent in
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said that the Hong Kong citizens are always
very hard working and the government will encourage them and
create opportunities for them to help themselves.
</P>
<P>
The long-term resolution to the problem of the unemployment is
to train and retrain the unemployed, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
In fact the economy of Hong Kong is in a period of adjustment
as a result of the recent Asian financial turmoil, the high
inflation rate and the weakened competitiveness caused by the
increasingly high production costs in Hong Kong, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the SAR government is well aware of the pains
of the jobless and has done a lot to relieve their sufferings.
</P>
<P>
In the Financial Budget made by Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang in February, the government reduced the tax by nearly 13
billion HK dollars (1.66 billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government is investing heavily in
infrastructure projects, which will create job opportunities and
at the same time strengthen the long-term competitiveness of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The construction of a new subway, a new railway, new houses, the
new airport at the Chek Lap Kok and a new dock will create several
thousand jobs, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Of course it takes time for the economy to adjust and the
citizens should be confident about themselves, he said. After this
painful period of economic adjustment, Hong Kong's economy will be
better, Tung added.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Determined to Tackle Jobless Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong government
official said Tuesday that unemployment in Hong Kong is not
as bad as being described by some people and both the government
and the business sector are working out measures to tackle the
problem.
</P>
<P>
In response to inquiries from reporters, Donald Tsang,
financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR), said the labor market as a whole is not shrinking but
expanding.
</P>
<P>
As the newly created posts can not make up the lost jobs, he
said, it will take a period of time to solve the problem of a high
 unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
The latest labor force statistics released on Monday by the
Census and Statistics Department showed that for the first quarter
of this year, the jobless rate climbed 0.6 percent to 3.5 percent
from 2.9 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said preparations for high-level meetings between him and
experts to fight unemployment as tasked by Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa on Monday are under way.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary said that for the past months the
government has been in touch with the business sector and
employers to deal with the unemployment problem caused by the
Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"And now we can do this work in a more systematic way," Tsang
said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Tung expressed his concerns about the unemployment
situation in Hong Kong and asked Tsang to meet with experts in the
next few weeks to look into the unemployment problem and to
explore ways and means of creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
Tung hoped that these high-level meetings to be convened by the
financial secretary will address the problem in a pragmatic and
constructive manner without fanfare.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Acting Secretary for Education and Manpower
Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said employment prospects remain
positive.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Foreign Reserves Fall to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's foreign reserves have
declined to the lowest level in eleven months, and could only
meet about seven weeks of national import requirements in case of
a disaster, Financial Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reserves, which reached 255 million U.S. Dollars in
September last year and dropped to 237 million U.S. Dollars in
December, fell to 165 million U.S. Dollars in February this year
as the country continued experiencing very low inflows of foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that, said the paper, unless foreign exchange
inflows improve, Zambia's gross international reserves may run
dry by the close of the year, a situation which may put the
country at great risk in case of disaster.
</P>
<P>
A country is supposed to keep reserves that can meet national
import requirements for a period of four to six months, otherwise
there is danger.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's foreign exchange inflows in the first quarter of 1998
have been too little to sustain the foreign exchange market,
hence, the continued depreciation of the Kwacha against other
currencies.
</P>
<P>
During the period from January to March, inflows to the Bank
of Zambia, the central bank, amounted to merely 3.981 million U.S
Dollars, of which only 1.676 million U.S. Dollars came from
donors and 2.305 million U.S. Dollars from non-government
sources, mainly non-traditional exports and retentions.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the central bank, the
inflows have been very minimal mainly due to reduced earnings
from copper sales, Zambia's traditional biggest foreign exchange
earner, and non-inflow of donor funds allegedly because of
disagreement on good governance issue.
</P>
<P>
To the contrary, 84.29 million U.S. Dollars were released to
service external debt in the past 11 months, to support other
government expenditure requirements as well as to support the
foreign exchange market that has experienced high demand leading
to continued depreciation of the Kwacha against other currencies.
</P>
<P>
The central bank released 28.8 million U.S. Dollars (mainly in
January) onto the foreign exchange market to beef up the
dwindling market to save the Kwacha from further butchering, but
this did nothing to change the situation.
</P>
<P>
The Kwacha continued depreciating and now stands at an average
of 1,747 Kwacha for one U.S. Dollar based on Bank of Zambia's
mid-rate as on April 17, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The continued dwindling in foreign exchange inflows may have
an adverse effect on Zambia's economy as this may erode the
purchasing power of the Kwacha which may in turn force
manufacturers to push up prices of their goods, bringing a chain
reaction in price spiral.
</P>
<P>
The paper predicted that the ultimate result is high inflation
rate and economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the paper further pointed out, low reserves
mean that the government has less ability to meet unforeseen
obligations such as natural calamities, floods and even war,
which may require reliance on its own resources to meet import
requirements.

<HEADLINE> Epoch-Making China Film Series to Be Produced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A 7.2 million U.S. dollar
contract has been signed to produce the Dragon's Ascent, an
epoch-making film series on the history and development of China's
civilization and culture.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Civilization Education Trust in Hong Kong told
Xinhua Tuesday that the film series, based on the works of the
late Joseph Needham (1900-1995) who is widely recognized as the
greatest Sinologist of his day, is to be released in 2000 which is
also the Year of the Dragon in the lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
To foster a deeper understanding of China worldwide, the
Needham Research Institute of Britain's Cambridge University, the
Institute for the History of Natural Science of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and Britain's Totem Productions Limited drew
up a joint plan for the production of the film series.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996, the East Asian History of Science Trust in
Cambridge, representing the Needham Research Institute and the
Institute for the History of Natural Science, signed a memorandum
of understanding with Totem Productions Limited regarding the
production of the Dragon's Ascent.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Civilization Education Trust was set up in Hong
Kong in September last year to raise funds for this important
project. Now it has obtained pledges of donations amounting to
nearly 7 million U.S. dollars and around 3.7 million dollars has
been received as the first installment.
</P>
<P>
The 10 one-hour program film series will be distributed
worldwide and shown in the world's major museums under the plan
for its launch.
</P>
<P>
Needham received the title of Friendship Ambassador from the
Chinese People's Association for Friendship With Foreign Countries
in 1990 and became an overseas member of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Cabinet Expanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala Tuesday brought out a full-fledged government by
inducting 24 more members six days after he took office, the
official RSS news agency said.
</P>
<P>
As Koirala has promised, the new government is much leaner than
the previous one led by Surya Bahadur Thapa in terms of the number
of ministers, state ministers and assistant ministers. In addition
to the prime minister, the new government has 17 ministers, eight
state ministers and one assistant minister.
</P>
<P>
Another feature of the cabinet is that five persons hold
concurrently the top posts of two ministries as there are more
portfolios but less holders, and Koirala himself holds
concurrently the portfolios of defense minister, foreign minister
and minister for royal palace affairs.
</P>
<P>
The present government of Nepal is a one-party minority
government of the Nepali Congress, the largest party in the Lower
House of parliament.
</P>
<P>
When Koirala took office on April 15, he had only three cabinet
members including himself.
</P>
<P>
The three-member government won the vote of confidence last
Saturday in the Lower House of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Sacked Australian Workers Reinstatement Order Frozen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- An Australian federal court
ruling that 1,400 sacked unionized workers in a nationwide labor
dispute be reinstated was later frozen for 24 hours by another
court order on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a move which put Patrick and the federal government in a
difficult position, Australia's Federal Court Justice Anthony
North made the order that 1,400 unionized dock workers sacked on
April 7 by Patrick be reinstated as the dismissal of the entire
union labor is illegal.
</P>
<P>
The interim order was made ahead of a trial in the coming weeks
on union claims that Patrick conspired with other parties to
unlawfully sack its workforce.
</P>
<P>
However, the order was frozen for 24 hours three hours after
the first order.
</P>
<P>
"The full bench of the Federal Court has agreed to suspend the
order reinstating the 1,400 sacked Patrick workers until 17:00
(Melbourne time) tomorrow," the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation News Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Before the latest court rule, Australian Workplace Relations
Minister Peter Reith, who has been behind government's efforts to
encourage the mass sacking by Patrick in a bid to break the
monopoly of the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) over the
nation's ports, called on Patrick Stevedores on Tuesday to adhere
to the previous order, but warned the court decision was likely to
be unworkable.
</P>
<P>
"Patrick should comply with the order, whether or not
reinstatement is necessarily the effect of the orders I don't
know," the minister was quoted by the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the two orders, the minister told News Radio that
"from the government's point of view, this legal back and forward
situation will not in any way impact our resolve to fix up the
waterfront."
</P>
<P>
Before the latest federal court suspension decision, Patrick
Stevedores Chairman Chris Corrigan said the company said the
interim order appeared unworkable.
</P>
<P>
The first court order was warmly welcomed by dock workers on
the nation's major ports, including those in Sydney and Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
MUA National Secretary John Coombs said the decision marked a
turning point in the battle to prove that the dismissal of
Patrick's entire unionized workforce was illegal.

<HEADLINE> Macao Cuts Issues of New Stamps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Macao Posts and Telecommunications
Department (CTT) has decided to cut the issues of new stamps by
300,000 pieces following a bearish stamp market in the region.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Lopes, director of CTT, told reporters at a press
conference on Tuesday that his department has made the decision
after orders from China's inland declined 400,000 pieces.
</P>
<P>
The Goddess of Ma Chou, the set of four new stamps to be issued
on Thursday, for instance, will be issued at 1.90 million pieces
for each stamp. The previous amount of stamps issued this year was
usually at 2.10 million pieces.
</P>
<P>
"We cut the issues for the quality of Macao stamps," said
Lopes. "We made the decision for the benefits of stamp collectors
and dealers. We must make adjustments as market changes."
</P>
<P>
Over the past several weeks, stamp markets in China's inland
and Macao have plunged into the lowest in years. Many dealers had
to sell their stamps below their face value.
</P>
<P>
But Lopes said he was optimistic about the market revival.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure Macao stamps will gain added value in the near
future," he said. "It has great potential."
</P>
<P>
The director said CTT will carry out more promotion works in
China's inland. There will be four exhibitions of Macao stamps in
Beijing and Shanghai this year.
</P>
<P>
The price of Macao stamps soared to the highest last year
following a similar stamp fever in Hong Kong. CTT's gross income
from stamp sales for 1997 reached 150 million patacas (18.75
million U.S. dollars), more than double the previous year.

<P>
CANBERRA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar received a
brief stay along with 1,400 sacked Australian dock workers on
Tuesday after an Australia's Federal Court ruling that the workers
be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
The local currency benefited from the news as the market
welcomed some sign of a breakthrough in the stalemate on
Australia's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 64.97 U.S. cents from 64.72 U.S. cents
late Monday and 64.66 U.S. cents at the open of the local session.
</P>
<P>
The court's interim order was made in Melbourne on Tuesday
afternoon, ahead of a trial in the coming weeks on union claims
that Patrick conspired with other parties to unlawfully sack its
unionized workforce.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar kicked up a little bit on the back of
the federal court decision," Rothschild Australia Treasury Manager
Paul Macarounas said.
</P>
<P>
"It was reasonably positive news for the currency but I don't
think the market is going to get too carried away," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was at 85.53 Japanese yen from
the close of 85.68 yen on Monday and at 1.1625 Deutsche marks from
1.1696 marks previously.

BONN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to a continued export boom,
Germany's trade surplus soared to 11.7 billion marks (6.5 billion

<HEADLINE> US to Import Uganda's Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. businessman said they are
to import Uganda's Tilapia for American market, the daily Monitor
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If Nile Tilapia (Nile Crucian) finds a market in the United
States, it will be a big boost to the fishing industry in the
African country, the newspaper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Nile Tilapia is a good protein source for Americans and can
find a huge market of 100 million tons annually, said Barry
Costa-Pierce, a member of the American business team.
</P>
<P>
Pierce, an analyst with the Department of Environmental
Analysis and Design in Irvine, California, told Uganda Chamber of
Commerce and Inustry that Tilapia "is the most valuable protein
fish for the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Fish industry is a developing section of LUganda's economy.
And it has maily two staples of fishes: Nile Perth and Tilapia.
</P>
<P>
The main market for fish export is the European Union,
especially Spain, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But EU has imposed a ban on the ground of poor sanitation of
fish landing sites since last November when a cholera broke out
in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
But fish goods usually do not spread cholera since consumers
take them cooked, local specialists noted.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy, water purification equipment and technology are
also targeted as the projectives of their investment, said some
members of the business team who are visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is to receive the U.S.
business team which started touring the country since mid-April,

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Play No More Free Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of Zambia
(FAZ) has decided that its national soccer team will no longer
play international friendly matches without charge.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, FAZ spokesman George
Kasengele on Tuesday confirmed the decision, adding "it is only
fair that some sort of appearance fee is paid to foot bills for
players winning and daily allowances."
</P>
<P>
However, he added that not all the foreign teams are willing to
pay for Zambia because "there are some regional countries we also
like to play to prepare ourselves and the deal is usually
reciprocal."
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported that FAZ has charged oil-rich Saudi
Arabia 100,000 U.S. dollars for a World Cup training match on May
9 in France.
</P>
<P>
And the South African Football Association has agreed to pay
the Zambian national team at least 10,000 dollars to help South
Africa's Bafana Bafana prepare for the World Cup tournament slated
in June in France.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Curb Fuel Smuggling, Hoarding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
decided to set up special tribunals for offenses of fuel
smuggling and hoarding, in an effort to end the periodical fuel
crisis in the oil-producing country.
</P>
<P>
This was decided Monday night at a meeting of the National
Council of State in Abuja, which was attended by the Head of
State, General Sani Abacha, state administrators and several
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with correspondents in the capital, Ondo State
Administrator, Commander Anthony Onyearugbulem said, "those found
to be militating against government's effort at finding lasting
solution to the crisis would be dealt with seriously."
</P>
<P>
"Tribunals will be set up to deal appropriately with
offenders. I think the penalty will be very very heavy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, with a daily production of about two million barrels
of crude oil, has been suffering from persistent fuel scarcity
for years.
</P>
<P>
Though it is agreed the country's illing refineries is mainly
to blame, fuel smuggling to neighboring countries also makes the
problem worse, as fuel is cheaper in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Persistent fuel scarcity has also forced Nigerians to always
keep some storage in their houses, while some workers of filling
stations are making money from illegal selling at black markets.

The eight others died from injuries they received after a road

A reporter of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Eddy
Smith, also reportedly died in the above-mentioned ambush.

SINGAPORE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to fall
lower on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index declined by another 18.05 points to close at

<HEADLINE> Tehran Mayor Case to be Tried in Open Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's judiciary head Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi announced Monday the case of Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi would be tried in an open court, the
pro-government Iran Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Yazdi made the announcement in a meeting
with judiciary officials. However, he did not say if Karbaschi
would appear in the court.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi criticized those individuals and groups at home and abroad
who deliberately added political motives to the case with an
attempt to develop a controversy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was detained by conservative judiciary on April 4 on
charges of embezzlement, misappropriation of public fund and
mismanagement, which were rejected by the moderates who support
the government led by president Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The detention triggered tensions between the conservative and
moderate factions of the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
The moderate Mayor was released on bail last Wednesday with
the intervention of Khatami and former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
However, Conservative parliamentarian Ahmad Rasoulinejad warned
Monday that if Rafsanjani continued to support the mayor, he
would disclosed the names of those had pocketed windfall wealth
due to connection with the Mayor and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, 44, is a close ally of president Khatami and strongly
supported him in last May's presidential election.

JERUSALEM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu held
second round of talks Tuesday in Tel Aviv and discussed in detail
the issues to be addressed in the upcoming London meeting.
</P>
<P>
Britain will play host to both Netanyahu and the Palestinian

U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross will return to the region
Friday to finalize the agenda for the talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will meet with
Netanyahu and Arafat separately in London to determine whether the

The U.S. has proposed that Israel hand over 13.1 percent of the
West Bank, to be reciprocated by Palestinian security measures.
Israel opposed the idea, saying any withdrawal of more than 9
percent would imperil its security.

think there's a chance that the leaders will make the hard
decisions," Rubin said. "If we conclude in London that they are
not, then that may be the end of it," he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria: Referendum to Replace Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A national referendum on the
presidency of General Sani Abacha will be held in Nigeria in
August in place of presidential election as originally planned,
official sources have said.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express, a major national newspaper, Tuesday quoted
an unnamed highly placed government source as saying that the
adoption of General Abacha by the country's five political
parties as their consensus presidential candidate has made the
election unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
"A presidential election has become unnecessary and I don't
see the government subjecting itself and Nigerians to the rigor
of presidential polls when all the five political parties have
chosen the head of state as their presidential flagbearer," the
source within the Federal Executive Council said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the referendum will be a legislative plebiscite
or a popular one, the source said: "Whichever one applies, all
that is pretty predictable now is that a general presidential
election may not be held on August 1."
</P>
<P>
The Post Express report confirmed an earlier report by the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which quoted Alhaji Saleh
Hassan, a member of the Transition Implementation Committee (TIC)
as saying the same.
</P>
<P>
Another member of the Committee, Ukeje Nwokeforo, said the TIC
saw nothing wrong with the consensus candidacy of Abacha. His
words are: "It shows that Nigerians have grown above personal
interest. They now approach issues from a mature standpoint."
</P>
<P>
The development, however, draw strong criticism from the U.S.
and Britain, as well as Nigeria's opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department, in a statement Monday accused the
Nigerian government of manipulating the transition program to
secure Abacha's nomination.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the British government was also quoted by the
BBC as condemning the development, saying that the transition
lacked credibility.
</P>
<P>
Bolaji Akinyemi, former External Affairs Minister and overseas
spokesman of the dissident group, the National Democratic
Coalition, told the BBC that he had known from the beginning that
General Abacha would perpetuate himself in power through a
scheme.
</P>
<P>
Akinyemi urged the opposition to strengthen its civil
disobedience, saying that there should be more demonstrations all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
Another opposition group, the United Action for Democracy, has
called for a boycott of the national assembly election scheduled
for Saturday and all other subsequent elections under the
government's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the five parties will present their resolutions on
Abacha's candidacy to the head of state in Abuja Thursday, said
Pat Abii, the national publicity secretary of the Democratic
Party of Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Trains to Run Faster in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Major inter-city rail journeys in
China will be slightly quicker as of October 1 when train speeds
are marginally increased, according to a senior official from the
Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
Trains with a speed of 140-to-160 kilometers per hour will run
on three key lines linking Beijing with Guangzhou, Shanghai, and
Harbin, said Vice-Minister Liu Zhijun at a national railway
transport meeting held here today.
</P>
<P>
The speed of trains will also be raised on railway lines from
Hangzhou to Zhuzhou, Houma to Yueshan, Baoji to Zhongwei, Nanning
to Kunming, and Wuwei to Urumqi, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A national railway map is being adjusted to cater to the
speed-raising campaign," said Liu, adding that the effort is to
sharpen the competitive edge of trains in the transportation
market.
</P>
<P>
A high-speed train will soon be introduced on the
Guangzhou-Shenzhen line to maintain a speed of 200 km per hour
under existing track conditions.
</P>
<P>
Another source said that China will begin building a high-speed
railway linking its capital with its largest industrial center,
Shanghai, in the year 2000, with a total length of 1,300 km at a
designed of more than 250.
</P>
<P>
Liu also said that his ministry will increase the number of
fast trains, arrive-in-a-night trains and arrive-in-daytime
trains, and arrange more special trains for tourists, non-local
workers and football fans.
</P>
<P>
"We are making full preparations to raise train speeds," Liu
said, adding that tracks, bridges, crossings, signals, and
telecommunications facilities for concerned railways will be
consolidated. Fly-overs will be built on rail crossings on the
lines with a speed exceeding 140 km per hour, and the high-speed
lines will be barred in the future.
</P>
<P>
As of April 1, 1997, the average travel speed of China's trains
increased to 54.9 from 48.1 km per hour. On the three major lines
from Beijing to Guangzhou, Shanghai and Harbin, the highest per
hour speed reached 140.
</P>
<P>
Railway transport has been challenged by express highways and
civil aviation in recent years. Statistics show that train
transport volume accounted for only 38.8 percent of the country's
total transportation volume, compared with 60.5 percent in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Right-wing Party Seeks to Join Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Moledet Chairman Rechavam Zeevi have been
holding talks on the possibility that the right-wing party will
join the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The Haaretz daily said on Tuesday that the move was proposed by
the Moledet and the negotiations began a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The Moledet, which has two members in the Knesset (parliament),
opposes the Oslo accords signed between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moledet's leadership discussed the issue Monday night and
decided to hold official talks with Netanyahu, according to the
daily.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu Monday confirmed the report.
</P>
<P>
"It should be clear that the intention is for Moledet to be
able to express its opinion on any subject in the cabinet, but it
must accept the government guidelines," Netanyahu told the press
before meeting with United States Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
If the deal goes through, it would help advance the peace
process by strengthening the government, he added.
</P>
<P>
After former foreign minister David Levy and his five followers
of the Gesher (Bridge) party in the Knesset quitted the government
in January, the hardline Likud-led coalition enjoys a slim
majority of 61 seats in the 120-seat Knesset.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Wang Dan's Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The release of Wang Dan on bail
for medical treatment, which was announced by the Chinese judicial
authorities on Sunday, was strictly in accordance with Chinese
laws, according to Zhu Bangzao, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, here today in the routine press briefing.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, more than 10,000 Chinese prisoners are
allowed to be released on bail for medical treatment every year
after taking into consideration of their health conditions.
</P>
<P>
Zhu declined the hint that Wang's release was due to "an
agreement" between China and the United States before
U.S. President Bill Clinton's June China visit.
</P>
<P>
"After Wang issued a written application to the Chinese
judicial authorities for medical treatment in the United States,
the judicial authorities, on the basis of his application,
approved his requirement in accordance with relevant Chinese
laws," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
However, "Wang Dan has not finished his prison term. If he
wanted to end his medical treatment in an alien country and apply to
return, the Chinese authorities will make a decision in accordance
with the law," Zhu said, adding that Wang Dan "himself is clear
on the issue."
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about whether Wang Dan will be
allowed to visit the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR), Zhu said that "It was a matter to be decided by the Hong
Kong SAR government."

<HEADLINE> China's Crude Oil Production Remains Steady in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China produced 34.82 million tons
of crude oil in the first quarter of the year, almost the same as
the first quarter last year, according to China's State
Administration of Petroleum and Chemical Industry.
</P>
<P>
The production from January to March accounted for 22.2 percent
of the target set for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
China turned out 35.11 million tons of crude oil in the first
quarter of last year. And this year, it expects to produce 157
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, in the first two months of this year, the
sales revenue of China's petroleum and natural gas industry was
24.07 billion yuan, down 1.99 billion yuan or 7.6 percent less than
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The industry made 1.27 billion yuan in profit, a
400-million-yuan decrease on a yearly basis. The reduction was
23.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a total of 3,287 wells were shut in China's seven
major oil fields such as Daqing, Liaohe, Shengli and Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the impact on annual production is estimated at
nearly 3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, China's sales volume of crude oil in
the first quarter was 31.6 million tons, and 1.1 million tons were
not marketable.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Leaves for Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri left here Tuesday morning for Cairo on a three-day visit
to seek support of Egypt to its position toward Israeli
conditional withdrawal offer.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Hariri is expected to hold talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri over the
latest developments in the region, especially the Israeli
withdrawal offer.
</P>
<P>
He will explain to Egyptian leaders why Lebanon and Syria
find the Israeli conditional offer unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Israel has agreed to withdraw its forces from south Lebanon in
line with the 20-year-old United Nations Resolution 425, but
demands negotiated security arrangements that would protect its
northern towns from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria firmly rejected the offer, saying
the resolution asks Israel to leave Lebanon without any conditions
and therefore any implementation of it being attached with
preconditions will be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with its 40,000-strong forces deployed in Lebanon as
peacekeepers, has been accused by Israel of holding south Lebanon
as a "bargaining chip" in forcing it to return to Syria Golan
Heights it captured in the 1976 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's visit to Cairo will be the start of his planned
global tour which will also take him to the capitals of
the five permanent member states of the U.N. security council,
non-aligned nations and some key Arab states in efforts to
muster international backing for Lebanon's position over the
Israeli offer.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border
enclave in south Lebanon since it declared the area as a
"security zone" in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Reopen Sena Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Alberto Chissano has urged the reopening of Sena Railway in a bid
to promote economic cooperation with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The railway is not only important for enhancing Mozambique's
economic cooperation with Malawi, but it is also an alternative
for its trade with Zambia, the Mozambican News Agency quoted
President Chissano as saying Monday at the Conference on
Coordination of Technology and Finance held in port city Beira.
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by Railway and Port Corporation of
Mozambique, was focused on the rehabilitation of Sena Railway and
its feeder Marronmeu/New Frontier Village railway.
</P>
<P>
President Chissano noted that a repaired and reopened Sena
Railway will link up the three provinces of Tete, Sofala and
Zambezia, greatly boosting the economic development in the Valley
of Zambeze.
</P>
<P>
Moatize in northwestern Tete Province produces coal and in
central Sofala Province, Caia produces cotton while Muanza
produces limestone. The transport of these products depends
largely on the railway.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, large-scale projects will start on agriculture,
livestock farming, afforestation and industry, as well as tourism
and trade.
</P>
<P>
Sena Railway will play an important role in maintaining the
balanced and sustained development of Mozambican economy and
narrowing the gap between different areas in the southern African
country, President Chissano stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sena Railway is 600 kilometers long and it is a major part of
the Beira-Moatize railway line. It was out of operation in
September, 1983.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Warns against Infiltration Attempts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Acting Prime Minister
Abdullah Ensour has urged neighboring countries to refrain from
allowing armed groups to "infiltrate" into Jordan, the Jordan
Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"One of the pillars of our foreign policy is not to interfere
in other countries' internal affairs in any form and we expect
others to reciprocate," Ensour said.
</P>
<P>
Ensour emphasized Jordan's will to maintain good relationship
with all the Arab countries, hoping the infiltration attempts "do
not exist."
</P>
<P>
"They are not missions of good will. We do not want to
point the finger at this state or that. All the attempts
that were aimed at hurting the country have failed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ensour did not name any specific country, but local media have
in the past weeks reported in details infiltration attempts by
Hezbollah militants from Syria. But the reports have not been
confirmed by either government.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-Syrian relations have deteriorated since Jordan
signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. High-ranking Syrian
officials criticized Jordan for staying close to the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Fighting Parkinson's Disease (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 patients with
Parkinson's disease have had their suffering alleviated by a
surgical procedure in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have applied microelectrode technology in their
operation, which can increase the precision of locating
pathological cells in the brain, said Gao Guodong, director of the
Neurosurgery Department of Tangdu Hospital attached to the No. 4
Medical College of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Gao told Xinhua today in a telephone interview that since the
first successful operation in October, more than 110 patients have
been operated on in his hospital with an effective rate of 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's disease, which usually afflicts people 60 and
older, is a nerve ailment characterized by trembling in the hands,
muscle rigidity and a shuffling walk.
</P>
<P>
The hospital has established an International Parkinson's
Disease Treatment Research Center. Twenty patients from the
Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong
region have written letters asking for treatment in the center.
</P>
<P>
The center currently carries out two operations every day, but
many patients will have to wait until 2000 because of a shortage
of beds.
</P>
<P>
Gao said the treatment expense in the hospital averages 25,000
yuan (3,000 U.S. dollars), compared with 30,000 U.S. dollars in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Gao, 44, explained that he first cuts a centimeter-long hole in
the patient's cranial bone, then sends the microelectrode into the
brain to detect the pathological cells, and then kills those cells
and blocks the wrong nerve conduction.
</P>
<P>
A 73-year-old man living in Nanjing in east China had been
plagued by Parkinson's disease and confined to bed for years. He
couldn't turn over in bed unassisted. But ofter the operation, he
immediately got out of bed and walked without help.

<P>
Parkinson's disease is caused by nerve cells which send wrong
signals. Patients with the disease cannot help trembling, and
those reaching the advanced stage are confined to bed, then
usually die of complications.
</P>
<P>
At present, several million patients suffer from the disease
worldwide, and the number in China exceeds one million. Late
Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, and well-known
mathematician Chen Jingrun all died of the disease. Former US
President Ronald Reagon and US super boxing star M. Ali are
suffering from the disease.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have all along tried to treat the disease through
operation. But the technology used before was imprecise and liable
to cause complications such as paralysis and aphasia.
</P>
<P>
"To increase the precision of the final targets is of vital
importance to treatment," said Gao, who has been engaged in
neurosurgery research for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
The hospital introduced the technology and equipment from the
United States in October.
</P>
<P>
"Specifically speaking, operations can only block the wrong
signals sent by the pathological cells, but cannot radically cure
the disease," said Gao, adding that patients have to take medicine
after the operation to assist the treatment.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Monitoring for Red Tide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China has strengthened its
monitoring of the red tide along its southern coastline to reduce
losses.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fei, director of the Monitoring Department of the National
Bureau of Oceanography (NBO), said that its South China Sea Bureau
is keeping a close eye on the development of the red tide.
</P>
<P>
"The country's monitoring network on the ocean environment is
also in operation," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the red tide hitting the coastal waters of China's
Guangdong Province and Hong Kong has killed more than 300 tons of
fish, causing direct losses of more than 40 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Red tide is a brownish-red discoloration of marine waters
caused by huge aggregations of a seaweed that produces a poisonous
substance that kills shellfish.
</P>
<P>
Specialists here say that the red tide is mainly caused by
pollution from the land and the large-scale seawater agriculture,
which gives the seawater too many nutrients with nitrogen and
phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
The warm weather in Guangdong Province has also provided the
algae with good growing conditions.
</P>
<P>
The red tide is beginning to ebb and water in some places has
returned to normal, sources say.
</P>
<P>
However, another small-scale red tide has occurred near the
city of Yangjiang, and has the tendency to expand to the western
part of the Pearl River mouth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the NBO shows that the frequency of the red
tide along China's coastal areas is climbing. The bureau is
considering cooperation with Hong Kong in monitoring oceanic
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Increased Exports Lower Kenya-France Trade Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's trade deficit with
France fell from 1996's 3.8 billion Shillings to about two
billion Shillings last year, according to French statistics on
external trade.
</P>
<P>
This means the trade deficit dropped from 64.4 million U.S.
Dollars in 1996 to 33.9 million last year, as currently about
59.5 Shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar on the foreign exchange
market.
</P>
<P>
The decline is mainly due to the 25 percent increase of Kenyan
exports to France last year, the East African Standard reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya exported goods worth 4.79 billion Shillings to France in
1997, thanks to both the revival of the French economy and the
better external competitiveness of Kenyan products, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's imports from France fell by 11 percent to 6.8 billion
Shillings last year.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Kenya's exports to France is agricultural products
with low added value and imports from France is professional
equipment goods, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Cape Town Safest City in S. Africa: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Although almost half of
Cape Town's residents have been victims of crime during the past
five years, it is still the safest metropolitan city in South
Africa, a survey showed.
</P>
<P>
The reason is simple. The problem in other big cities is
worse.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three percent of residents in Johannesburg and 59
percent in Durban were victims of crime between 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The findings were presented by the Institute for Security
Studies at a Business Against Crime forum in Cape Town Monday,
The Citizen newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of Capetonians, 77 percent, believed crime
had increased in their areas, but 85 percent had no form of
protection for their dwellings.
</P>
<P>
Whites felt safer at home and feared the city center most
while black and colored respondents feared crime in the areas in
which they lived.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that only about half of some violent
interpersonal crimes, such as assault, were ever reported to the
police, mainly because the offenses were not considered serious
and because the police were unavailable or not trusted.
</P>
<P>
According to the findings, most Cape victims were not
satisfied with the way in which police dealt with their reports.
</P>
<P>
The majority, 52.7 percent, felt the police were not doing a
good job in controlling crime in their areas.
</P>
<P>
The survey, in which Capetonians across the metropolitan area
were polled, was being used by Business Against Crime to help
draw up strategic plans around crime and policing issues.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey were presented ahead of the Cape
Town launch of the Business Against Crime initiative.

<HEADLINE> Nike Charged with False Advertising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Nike, the world's largest
maker of athletic shoes, was charged Monday with violation of
California's false-advertising laws by a group of consumer and
business lawyers in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in the Superior Court, is directed against
Nike's public statements of its labor policies, which were proven
to be untrue.
</P>
<P>
The suit is the first in the United States over Nike's labor
policies.
</P>
<P>
To entice consumers who do not want to purchase shoes made in
"sweatshops", the suit said, Nike has publicly stated that it
complies with government rules on wages, hours and health and
safety conditions.
</P>
<P>
Nike guarantees a "living wage" to all workers, according to
the statements. Its workers in Southeast Asia enjoy free meals and
health care, and are protected from corporal punishment, the
company said, adding that they make twice the local minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
The suit pointed out, however, that these statements are
refuted by studies from labor and human rights groups, news media
investigations and a January 1997 audit by the Ernst &AMP; Young firm.
</P>
<P>
The audit, commissioned by Nike, found that employees in a
large Vietnam shoe factory contracted with Nike were exposed to
cancer-causing toluene and suffered a high incidence of
respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
These public statements should be considered the equivalent of
false advertising claims, said the suit.
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks repayment to California of all sums Nike made
from illegal business practices in the state, said Philip Newmark,
a consumer lawyer taking part in the suit. It also seeks a
company-funded "public information campaign" to correct past
untruths and a ban on future misrepresentations.
</P>
<P>
Nike has about 22,000 employees but most of its products are
made by 450,000 workers in Asian factories run by contractors.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Tea Output to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Tea producing countries in
Africa, Kenya in particular, will bounce back this year after
poor weather hit production in 1997, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's tea yield fell to 220 million kilograms last year from
257 million in 1996. But in the first two months of 1998 it had
risen to 58 million kg against 20 million in the same period last
year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
World tea production is likely to increase by at least 50
million kg this year and international prices could be pushed
down as a result, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The rise "could even go up to 80-90 million kg," Christantha
Perera, the director of Forbes &AMP; Walker Ltd, Sri Landa's biggest
tea broker, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Global consumption of tea, including in tea producing
countries, increases between two and three percent annually. This
is roughly 60 million kg and should set off much of the increase
in production," said Perera.
</P>
<P>
However, total global production figures were not immediately
available, industry officials said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Central Bank Raises Certificate Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia (BI), the central
bank, announced on Tuesday that it will raise BI Certificate (SBI)
interest rates again starting Tuesday in a bid to stabilize the
rupiah against the U.S. dollar and curb the growing inflation in
the country.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here Tuesday, BI Governor Syahril Sabirin
said all the short-term SBI interest rates will be raised by
between 4 to 5 percentage points annually.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, overnight SBI interest rate will
be raised from 40 percent to 44 percent, two-day SBI interest rate
will be from 41 percent to 45 percent and three-to-six-day SBI to
46 percent from 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate for one-week SBI will be raised from 43
percent to 48 percent while that for two-week SBI from 44 percent
to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
The one-month SBI rate will be increased to 50 percent from 45
percent, while the two-months will be increased to 44 percent from
40 percent and the three-months will be raised to 34 percent from
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The six-month and one-year SBI rates will be raised
respectively from 20 percent to 23 percent and from 18 percent to
21 percent.
</P>
<P>
SBI is short-term rupiah-denominated obligations issued by the
central bank to drain excess liquidity from the market.
</P>
<P>
The BI first raised its SBI rates on August 19, 1997 after the
monetary crisis hit the country and the value of the rupiah
dropped sharply against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The last rise of the SBI was done on March 23 this year
following the fluctuation of the rupiah and a sharp increase in
the prices of basic commodities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of rupiah, which has lost more than 70
percent of its value against the greenback in the past nine
months, picked up to 7,500 per dollar from 9,500 per dollar in the
last few weeks following the signing of the economic reform
program between the Indonesian government and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
However, it dropped again to 8,000 per dollar last week on the
suspicion over the Indonesian government's commitment to economic
reforms in exchange for the IMF-led bailout package of 43 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Syahril blamed the weakness of the rupiah and the high
inflation on the huge circulation of money in the public.

<HEADLINE> 4 More Turkish Marshlands Under World Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Four more marshlands in Turkey
have been officially put under the protection of the international
Ramsar Convention, the Daily News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Turkish Environment Minister Imren Aykut
at a press conference on Monday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The four marshlands are Uluabat, Gediz, Akyatan and
Kizilirmak. The Akyatan marshland near the southern city of Adana
is one of the biggest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
To date, a total of nine Turkish marshlands enjoy international
protection.
</P>
<P>
Aykut said that the traditional one-sided thought concerning
marshlands should be changed and their importance to environment
and human life must be well understood.
</P>
<P>
"Now marshlands are known to be an important part of the
ecosystem. Damage to the marshlands causes climate changes, and
agricultural and ecological unbalances," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Ramsar Convention is known as an internationally-recognized
agreement on protecting marshlands. It covers 896 marshlands the
world over.

<HEADLINE> Two NBA Teams Fire Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Denver Nuggets and Los
Angeles Clippers fired their coaches respectively one day after
the completion of 1997-98 NBA regular season.
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets on Monday fired Bill Hanzlik simply because the
team under his instruction had the worst record during the
just-ended regular season: 11-71.
</P>
<P>
For almost the entire season, the Nuggets were a threat to
surpass the league's worst record ever -- 9-73 by the 1972-73
Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
"Playing Denver is like playing a high school team," Dennis
Rodman of Chicago Bull said during the season, adding that " It is
the worst team in the history of basketball."
</P>
<P>
Assistant coaches T.R. Dunn and Brian Winters were also
dismissed. The search for a new head coach will begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Bill Fitch, head coach of Clippers, was fired
after guiding the team to a 17-65 season, the third worst record
among the 29 NBA teams.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the disappointing season, I know we've had
injuries and all, but the organization felt we should have had a
better season," said Elgin Baylor, Clippers vice president of
basketball operations, during a telephone conference call with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Fitch, 63, led Boston to the NBA championship in 1981, and
guided Houston into the finals in 1986.

GUANGZHOU, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in south China's
Guangdong Province plan to train one million laid-off workers
before 2000, officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates, the state-owned and collectively owned
enterprises will lay off about 1.7 million employees between now

</P>
<P>
The professional training will focus on the metallurgical, coal

</P>
<P>
In addition, Guangdong urged secondary technical schools
affiliated with the above three industries to make the training of
laid-off workers their main task.
</P>
<P>
The province will also try to re-employ the laid-off workers,
endeavoring to reach the re-employment rate at 70 percent this
year. It promised to control the registered unemployment rate
below three percent.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Bank Interest Rates Fall in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The inter-bank overnight
interest rates eased slightly in Kenya compared to the previous
week's 25-30 percent band to 20-25 percent last week, the Daily
Nation reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the inter-bank rates was attributed to Treasury
Bill maturities from the previous week's auction, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Last week's auction also resulted in a net-in amounting to 1.4
billion Shillings (23.5 million U.S. Dollars) but the market may
tighten this week given the pending VAT payments and the first
installment of corporate tax payment.
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive week, the 91 day tenor rate remained
unchanged while the 182 day paper shed 113 basis points to 26.60
percent in the east African country, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
This comes in the wake of the austere measures announced by
Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae who stressed the need to see a
reduction in interest rates in order to stimulate private
sector-led economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The minister further revealed that the government will spend
an estimated 31 billion Shillings (some 521 million U.S. Dollars)
of its ordinary revenue to repay the current stock of the 91-day
treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
The weekly roll-over of the 91 days tenors, however, makes it
difficult to reduce the interest rates from their present high
levels.
</P>
<P>
Trading activity continued to improve at the bond market with
turnover up 34 percent from the previous week's 223 million
Shillings (3.75 million U.S. Dollars). The second issue this year
traded bonds worth 165 million Shillings (2.77 million U.S.
Dollars) accounting for 74 percent of the weekly turnover.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Shilling maintained its strength against the U.S.
Dollar, riding on the back of inflows from tea and horticulture
as importer demand remained low.
</P>
<P>
The local unit, however, lost against the other listed
currencies in the cross currency calculations reflecting the U.S.
Dollar's weakness on international markets.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Turn Port City into Free Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is to turn its Red Sea port
city of Aqaba into a free trade, industrial and agricultural zone
by January 1999, semi-official Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Aqaba will be a comprehensive free region, not only a storage
area for goods" by that time, the paper quoted Acting Prime
Minister Abdullah Ensour as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Once Aqaba becomes a free zone, it will have its own
financial system, a different tax system and there will be no
taxes on the banks that are working within the region, which will
encourage the establishment of more banks there," Ensour said.
</P>
<P>
The region will also include a variety of industrial and
agricultural projects, according to Ensour.
</P>
<P>
A 1-million-U.S.-dollar feasibility study about Aqaba is to be
completed in the coming six months and the government still need
three more months to evaluate it, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exact area of the free zone has not been defined, but the
feasibility study will decide if the port region or the entire
governorate will be included, Ensour added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has 27 kilometers out of a total of 367 of the coastline
of the Gulf of Aqaba. This is one of the kingdom's primary tourist
attractions and its only port access.
</P>
<P>
The port can serve as trade links between the Far East and
Jordan, Israel, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
retrench between 60,000 and 100,000 civil servants in the next
three years, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move was aimed at enhancing efficiency in the civil
service by having a small well-remunerated work force as opposed
to the current one, the paper quoted Head of Civil Service Fares
Kuindwa as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, as many as 60,000 civil servants have been sacked
countrywide and the government intends to retrench more when
restructuring government departments.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae warned two weeks ago that the
government would reduce its expenditure on salaries by 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer afford the luxury of budget deficits in
Kenya," Nyachae said, adding that activities which will be phased
out should be identified so that expenditure on salaries and
allowances can be reduced by 20 percent a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of
Engineering (CAE) and the Hong Kong Academy of Engineering will
expand cooperation to develop the country's high-tech industry,
said Zhu Guangya, president of the CAE.
</P>
<P>
China's interior areas will provide abundant resources in
scientific personnel and technology while Hong Kong can improve
the industrialization of high-technology and help high-tech
products enter the market, Zhu told a meeting between the two
academies on the development of the high-tech industry in Beijing
last week.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the interior areas have 19.13 million
professional employees in science and technology, of whom 422,700
are involved in research and development. This ranks China third
in the world, following the United States and Japan in the number
of people engaged in research and development.
</P>
<P>
China also has a vast domestic market, which is beginning to be
connected more closely to the world market, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
If the commercial systems and personnel in Hong Kong can be
used as a supplement to the overall development of the high-tech
industry, China will have a bigger potential in high-tech
development, according to the Science and Technology Daily.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the two academies have selected information,
biological technologies and new-material technology, which are
vital to economic growth in the 21st century, as major fields for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A permanent organization will be established between the two
academies to promote cooperation in the development of the
high-tech industry, he said.

<P>
NICOSIA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Five slight earth tremors were
registered earlier Tuesday morning by the Geological Survey
Department, near the southern coastal town of Limassol, Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the department, Kyriakos Solomi, said that
most of the tremors measure between 3.5 and 4.5 on the Richter

</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the tremor was on land, some 64 kilometers
north of Limassol. No injuries or damage have been reported so far.

<P>
The spokesman said that the possibility of having more seismic
activities is rather remote.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Get Kidnapped People in Somalia Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is continuing
its talks with the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) to secure the release of a South African pilot and nine
other aid workers kidnapped in Somalia last week.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was relying on the ICRC to resolve the matter,
local daily Sowetan quoted Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman
Marco Boni as reporting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South African pilot Robbie Burt, eight workers of the ICRC and
Red Crescent societies and a Kenyan pilot were abducted Wednesday
after their ICRC-chartered aircraft landed at an airstrip north
of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers are believed to be renegade members of the
Abgal sub-clan which controls north of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has had no central government since the 1991 civil
war, when the country disintegrated into a fiefdom of warring
clans.
</P>
<P>
Kidnappings of aid workers were not unusual in Somalia. But
the victims had been released unharmed within hours and days,
according to ICRC officialsgs.
</P>
<P>
South Africa reportedly has no direct contact with Somali
kidnappers. Boni said earlier that the ICRC was in contact with
clan chiefs, negotiating with the captors.
</P>
<P>
"We have full confidence in the ICRC because they are best
placed to deal with the matter," Boni said.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's high commission in Nairobi, Kenya,
reported on Monday morning that there were no new developments in
the ongoing negotiations.

<HEADLINE> China's Crude Oil Production Remains Steady in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China produced 34.82 million tons
of crude oil in the first quarter of the year, almost the same as
the first quarter last year, according to China's State
Administration of Petroleum and Chemical Industry.
</P>
<P>
The production from January to March accounted for 22.2 percent
of the target set for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
China turned out 35.11 million tons of crude oil in the first
quarter of last year. And this year, it expects to produce 157
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, in the first two months of this year, the
sales revenue of China's petroleum and natural gas industry was
24.07 billion yuan, up 1.99 billion yuan or 7.6 percent less than
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The industry made 1.27 billion yuan in profit, a
400-million-yuan decrease on a yearly basis. The reduction was
23.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a total of 3,287 wells were shut in China's seven
major oil fields such as Daqing, Liaohe, Shengli and Xinjiang.
This has resulted in a reduced daily production of 2.2 tons of
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, this affected the production of 700,000 tons of
crude oil in the first quarter. The impact on annual production is
estimated at nearly 3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, China's sales volume of crude oil in
the first quarter was 31.6 million tons, and 1.1 million tons were
not marketable.

<HEADLINE> S. African Farmers to Seek Zambian Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A South Africa-based farming
organization has begun negotiating with the Zambian government
for the relocation of the country's farmers to Zambia in a
venture expected to bring massive investment into the sector.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's Investment Center Director Bwalya Ng'andu, quoted by
Zambia Daily Mail Tuesday, confirmed here Monday that the South
African Chamber for Agriculture Development in Africa (Sacada)
approached his delegation which held an investment promotional
week in South Africa two weeks ago with the proposal for the
project.
</P>
<P>
However, Ng'andu said no commitment has been made by the
Zambian delegation as to how much land farmers will be allocated
or how many will be allowed into Zambia which has vast land to be
cultivated.
</P>
<P>
A Sacada official is expected in Zambia in two weeks' time at
which firm contracts may be signed with the organization,
according to Ng'andu.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report released by Zambia News Agency said that
Sacada is to be holding talks with the Zambian government for the
purchase of huge tracts of land to settle farmers.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Sacada as hoping to negotiate the purchase
of 200,000 hectares of prime agricultural land in Zambia by
April.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Financial Condition Stays Strong: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The financial condition of the
Philippines remains strong despite the effects of the region-wide
currency turmoil, the country's central bank said in its latest
report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that our economic prospects remain generally
positive. Indeed, we recognize this crisis as an opportunity to
make the needed corrections and to further strengthen our economic
foundations," said Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson.
</P>
<P>
As of December 1997, the central bank's total assets stood at
686 billion pesos (18 billion U.S. dollars), the highest so far
since its creation in July 1993, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
During the last quarter in 1997, its total resources rose by
56.5 billion pesos (1.5 billion dollars), 5.2 billion pesos (136.8
million dollars) higher than the 51.3 billion peso (1.35 billion
dollars) growth in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that the growth in assets was traced mainly to the
45.4 billion peso (1.2 billion dollars) net increase in central
bank holdings of domestic securities, as the central bank provided
additional liquidity to banks by buying their Treasury Bill
holdings.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's net worth also grew by 5.8 billion pesos
(152.6 million dollars), representing additional interest income
from a higher interest-earning asset base such as the holdings of
government securities and loans granted.
</P>
<P>
It reported that total revenues reached 20 billion pesos (526.3
million dollars) against total expenses of 13.3 billion pesos (350
million dollars), exclusive of losses from foreign exchange
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is optimistic that despite the growing
uncertainties, the Philippines will be able to maintain its
prudent monetary policy in the hope of balancing growth and
inflationary concerns.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Four more children belonging to
the Tiruray tribe in North Upi, southern province of Maguindanao,
died of cholera, a top provincial health official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tahir Sulaik, Maguindanao provincial health officer, said the
latest figure brought the total number of people killed by the
deadly disease to 24 following a reported outbreak in at least
three villages.
</P>
<P>
The fourth victim died at the Cotabato Regional and Medical
Center early Tuesday morning after being ordered by Presidential
Assistant for Mindanao Jesus Dureza to be airlifted for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Durerza, together with Maguindanao health teams, was in North
Upi on Monday, to have a first hand assessment of the area's
health situation.
</P>
<P>
The young fatalities reportedly suffered from severe abdominal
pain, loose bowel movement and vomiting before they died.
</P>
<P>
Sulaik said unsafe drinking water in the area might have cause
the outbreak. Samples of suspected contaminated water have been
submitted for tests to determine the real cause of death of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said earlier that at least 50 people have died in
the drought-ravaged southern Philippines, due to the outbreak of
cholera and severe food shortages which threaten thousands of
families reeling from the effects of El Nino phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> China's Market for Raw Plastic Materials Remains Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Related departments predicted
that this year's market for raw plastic materials will continue
its decline because of a weak domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said China plans to produce 6.8 million tons
of raw plastic materials this year, an increase of 700,000 tons
or 11.4 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, this year's total demand for raw plastic materials
is expected to be 13 million tons, about the same as last
year. Analysts ruled out the possibility of big increases in
demand in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the consequences of the Southeast Asian financial
crisis have led to price declines in the regional market, which
will have a negative impact on China's raw plastic materials
industry. Foreign producers are expected to compete in the Chinese
market with their price advantages.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the industry suggest that domestic producers
should pay close attention to product mix readjustment, and
that efforts should be made to develop cost-efficient products
that best fit the market.

<HEADLINE> Albania's Imports, Exports Grow in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Albania's exports rose by 66
percent in the first quarter this year while its imports went up
by 61 percent over the same period of last year, the Albanian
Telegraphic Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The exports totaled 6.1 billion leks (38.36 million
U.S. dollars) while the imports increased to 28.5 billion leks, or
179.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Textile products topped the list of the country's exported
commodities totaling 873 million leks (5.49 million dollars).
Leather shoes came second with a total of 681 million leks (4.28
million dollars), followed by mineral products, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in exports was attributed to the resumption
of production by some small businesses after a nationwide riot at
the beginning of 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Albania maintained a strong momentum in
imports due to scant domestic production. The major imported items
include raw textile materials, food, machines and equipment as
well as spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Italy and Greece remained as Albania's major trading partners.
Exports to the two countries totaled 1.5 billion leks (9.43
million dollars) and 606 million leks ( 3.81 million dollars)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Albania imported about 4.8 billion leks (30.19 million dollars)
worth of goods from Italy and 3 billion leks (18.86 million
dollars) from Greece.

Unemployment is becoming an acute problem as China's economic
restructuring has touched some state-owned enterprises, while the
world's biggest population is continuing to churn out surplus
labor.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted various measures, including the development
of the service sector and improvement of the social welfare
system. But experts said that the most direct way to improve their
job situation is to open training courses for laid-off workers,
most of whom are from state-owned factories who know little about
modern knowledge required by other industries.
</P>
<P>
"This will improve their job-seeking capability, and enable
them to become familiar with market competition," said Li Peilin,
an expert from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also urged schools to provide subsidies for
children from families with laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
There are 200 million students in middle and primary schools,
and three million in universities. Reports say that the number of
students facing tuition problems has been increasing because
family members have lost jobs.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Province Expects to Increase Cotton Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in north China's
Hebei Province expect to increase their income this year because
of an expansion of "anti-pest" cotton fields.
</P>
<P>
As one of the major cotton-production areas of China, Hebei
Province seeded 200,000 hectares of anti-pest cotton this year to
vitalize agricultural sectors through science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Cotton production in Hebei Province has long been endangered by
such pests as bollworms, and its total cotton output was just
249,000 tons last year, the lowest since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
However, local farmers increased their cotton fields to 420,000
hectares this year because of their increasing interest in the
cotton strain that does not use as much fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhiguo, a local farmer in Xiaohedao Village, Zhouxian
County of Handan City, said that it cost about 100 yuan per mu
less than before to use the anti-pest cotton seeds.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wensheng, vice mayor of Handan City, said that the city
had 46,000 hectares of land seeded with anti-pest cotton. The
city's coverage of cotton fields reached 420,000 hectares this
Spring.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Meets With Ugandan Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen
said today that cooperation between China and Uganda has been more
"substantial and dynamic" in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark here this morning while meeting with Eriya
Kategaya, Uganda's first deputy prime minister and minister of
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have had "good cooperation" in political,
economic, cultural and other areas in the past 35 years since the
establishment of the diplomatic ties between the two countries,
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian emphasized that the two visits paid by Uganda's President
Yeweri Museveni to China contributed a lot to such wide-ranging
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier expressed his hope to consolidate and
develop the China-Uganda relationship based on the traditional
friendship and joint efforts by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he appreciated the efforts made by the Uganda
government on seeking national stability and development after the
National Resistance Movement took power in 1986, adding that the
efforts are beneficial to regional peace and stability, as well as
economic cooperation in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting Qian also expressed the concern of the Chinese
government on changes on the African continent, saying that the
coming century will be a time of African economic revival even
though the road ahead is still long.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya extended his gratitude to China for its political and
economic support to the African countries, including Uganda. He
also briefed Qian on the efforts made by African countries, in
particular the East African countries, for seeking political
stability and developing economies.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Vows to Dredge Urban Waterways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Rivers and lakes in the Chinese
capital which are troubled by worsening water quality and heavy
sediment will be dredged with fresh water.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year and lasting for three years, more than 46
kilometers of waterways in urban Beijing will be realigned to
improve the quality of local water by isolating foul-water sources
and returning them to navigable status.
</P>
<P>
Among the projects are the Beijing-Miyun water-diversion
channel, six lakes including Zhongnanhai, the Tongzi and Tonghui
rivers, and the city moat.
</P>
<P>
The plans also include dredging the waterways of sediment,
reinforcing the banks with cement and planting trees on the river
banks, today's Beijing Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The whole project, which was inaugurated Monday, is expected to
cost one billion yuan (120 million U.S. dollars), the largest
investment of its kind since 1949, and return the beauty of the
ancient city to people living and working there today.
</P>
<P>
There are 30 rivers and 26 lakes in Beijing's urban areas,
which have an important bearing on the local economy and its
social development.
</P>
<P>
However, water shortage, deterioration of water quality and
backward water conservation facilities have seriously affected the
functions of urban waterways and the image of Beijing as an
international metropolis.
</P>
<P>
During the course of the project, at least 700 households will
have to make way for realigning local rivers.
</P>
<P>
Local departments concerned have been called to take a
down-to-earth attitude to build a first-class project and make
great contributions to local water conservation efforts.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Defense Services
'98 (DSA '98) exhibition opened here Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Santiago Summit Sets Mile Stone Toward FTAA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santiago, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The just-concluded Second Summit
of the Americas in Santiago, Chile, is regarded as an important
ground-breaker for building the Free Trade Area of the Americas
(FTAA) by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Initiated by U.S. President Bill Clinton, 34 heads of state in
the western hemisphere gathered at Miami, U.S., in December 1994,
to map out a blueprint for the FTAA.
</P>
<P>
After nearly four years of consultation and discussion, the
Santiago summit has made a decision to kick off formal
negotiations for establishing the FTAA. The leaders asked their
ministers to achieve progress by the end of the century and
conclude all talks by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The journey from Miami to Santiago demonstrates that the 34
countries in the western hemisphere are turning their words into
the deeds they have so often talked about during the summit.
</P>
<P>
To build the world's largest market, which would extend from
Alaska in the north to Tierra del Fuego in the south, is no longer
a plan only in words or on paper, but a plan that will be put into
practice. If it succeeds, it will create the largest common market
with a total population of some 750 million potential customers
and an annual output of nine trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Santiago Summit made remarkable progress toward the FTAA,
as showed in the two important documents: the Declaration of
Santiago and the Plan of Action, signed by 34 leaders at the
concluding session.
</P>
<P>
They directed their Ministers responsible for trade to "begin
negotiations for the FTAA, in accordance with the March 1998
Ministerial Declaration of San Jose."
</P>
<P>
The leaders reaffirmed their determination "to conclude the
negotiation of the FTAA no later than 2005, and to make concrete
progress by the end of the century. The FTAA agreement will be
balanced, comprehensive, WTO-consistent and constitute a single
undertaking," the document said.
</P>
<P>
They also reached a wide-ranging consensus on education,
consolidation of the democratic process, economic integration and
jobs."
</P>
<P>
Education was on top of the agenda for the Santiago summit.
"Education is the determining factor for the political, social,
cultural and economic development of our peoples," the declaration
noted.
</P>
<P>
"We undertake to provide access of all inhabitants of the
Americas to preschool, primary, secondary and higher education,
and we will make learning a lifelong process," it said. "In order
to meet our goals within the agreed time-frames, we reaffirm our
commitment to invest greater resources in this important area, and
to encourage civil society to participate in developing education."
</P>
<P>
The leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to coordinating
their efforts in fighting against corruption, money laundering,
terrorism, weapon and drug trafficking and all forms of
discrimination, and for strengthening democracy, justice and
promotion of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Although the general goal has been established with a timetable
set for the FTAA, there still exist some differences and
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Some small countries are worried that the FTAA could only
benefit major industrial nations while some others are concerned
that the deadline of 2005 could not be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as the Clinton administration failed to gain its
foreign trade "fast-track" authority in 1997, the FTAA
negotiations could be easily deadlocked if the U.S. Congress
raises its voice against them and puts up strong opposition.
</P>
<P>
Some South American countries have even threatened to end all
FTAA negotiations if the Clinton government cannot win the
"fast-track" within six months.
</P>
<P>
The Santiago Summit's consensus to start free trade
negotiations indicates that some differences were overcome at the
summit. President Clinton openly pledged to win the "fast-track"
authority as a step to advance the FTAA process.
</P>
<P>
Prior to and during the Santiago Summit, Chile, the U.S.,
Mexico, Brazil, Canada and Argentina signed a number of trade
contracts and bilateral cooperation agreements as well as some
intention agreements to promote regional economic integration
and enhance mutual free trade.
</P>
<P>
All these have given a new push to free trade and integrated
development in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- One hundred and eight Sri Lankan
garment factory workers, mostly women employed in a Sri
Lanka-owned garment factory in the Maldives, will return to the
country Tuesday after an industrial dispute, the Maldivian High
Commission here said.
</P>
<P>
The workers were employed at the "Five Star Maldives Pvt.
Ltd.," which is a sister company of Sri Lanka's Tri Star Apparels
Pvt. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a press release Tuesday that the workers
are returning because of an industrial dispute that arose between
the workers and the employer.
</P>
<P>
It said that since the parties involved are Sri Lankans, the
government of the Maldives had sought to ensure that the
employment contract was implemented.
</P>
<P>
It had succeeded in getting the employer to agree to pay the
workers part of the due wages in the Maldives itself while the
balance would be paid in Sri Lanka, the release added.
</P>
<P>
The workers had agreed to this arrangement.

<HEADLINE> Delegates Call for Reform of ESCAP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Delegates attending the 54th
session of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (ESCAP) Tuesday called for reform of the agency so as
to make it more effective.
</P>
<P>
They said ESCAP could become more efficient, transparent and
accountable to respond to economic crises and face new challenges
if the reform is carried out successfully.
</P>
<P>
Surin Pitsuwan, Thailand's foreign minister, said ESCAP should
proceed with the reform in line with the U.N. bid to reduce
administration budget, with a view to increasing its efficiency,
effectiveness, transparency and accountability.
</P>
<P>
"We need effective implementation with sound measures,
appropriate programs and adequate resources," he said. "This
requires partnership of governments, non-governmental
organizations, communities, sub-regional, regional and
international organizations and people themselves."
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the U.N. body to assume a greater role in
promoting social development in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Priorities, he said, should focus on poverty alleviation, if
not eradication, because it is still the greatest threat to
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who inaugurated the
ministerial segment of the session on Monday, said Asian and
Pacific countries should make development strategy more balanced
and more responsive to the needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
Other delegates like U.S. charge d' affaires in Bangkok Ralph
Boyce and Japanese State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Masahiko
Koumura echoed Surin's call for reforming the U.N. body.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP, said Boyce, has yet to address issues of its priorities
despite reducing its programs from 15 to five. It has to look
closely at all activities to determine whether they are the best
use of scarce resources and whether ESCAP is the best and the only
organization to perform them.
</P>
<P>
The session, which opened on April 16 and will continue till
April 22, focuses on the impact of the financial crisis on social
and economic development in Asia and the Pacific and on ways of
relevant countries to defuse the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Fired Australian Dock Workers Win Court Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Patrick Stevedores' 1,400 fired
dock workers won a Federal Court order on Tuesday that they be
reinstated, Australian national media reported.
</P>
<P>
The interim order was made ahead of a trial in coming weeks on
union claims that Patrick conspired with other parties to
unlawfully lay off its workforce.
</P>
<P>
Federal Court Justice Anthony North made the order in Melbourne
early Tuesday afternoon, Australian Nine Network Television and
the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Patrick forcibly dismissed 1,400 unionized waterfront workers
throughout Australia on April 7 with the support of the Australian
government in a bid to break the monopoly of power of the Maritime
Union of Australia (MUA) over the nation's ports.
</P>
<P>
The fired workers, backed by MUA and other labor unions, have
been trying to block the operations of Patrick at the nation's
major ports and recover their lost jobs.
</P>
<P>
While the union welcomed the court decision, no comment is
available from Patrick and the Australian government.
</P>
<P>
MUA National Secretary John Coombs said in a statement that the
decision marked a turning point in the battle to prove that the
dismissal of Patrick's entire unionized workforce is illegal.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that Patrick immediately let the workers return to
work.
</P>
<P>
In another development on Tuesday, about 25 dismissed Patrick
stevedore workers were arrested by police after blocking trucks
from entering the port of Australia's third largest city,
Brisbane, a MUA spokesman was quoted by the AAP as saying.
</P>
<P>
MUA delegate Rod Orreal said about 50 unionists were staging a
sit-down protest on the road leading to the port when police moved
in at about 14:00 local time, the wire service said.
</P>
<P>
But the report could not be confirmed independently.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi cabinet has
approved a five-year (1997-2002) import policy, the United News of
Bangladesh (UNB) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The approval was made on Monday at a cabinet meeting chaired by
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that an import policy has been
formulated for five years instead of two.
</P>
<P>
The new policy withdrew a mandatory provision of radiation test
of perishable items in South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation countries. It also removed the restriction on the
import of gold, silver, crude oil and palm oil.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the policy imposes restriction on the import
of re-conditioned fax machines, phones, computers, photocopiers,
typewriters and telex machines.
</P>
<P>
The policy allows conditional import of some items such as
ethanol oxide gas.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the policy makes insurance compulsory for local
letters of credit with Sdharan Mima Corporation or any other
Bangladeshi insurance company.

<HEADLINE> Air France Says 53 Killed in Colombian Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of Air France
confirmed that all 53 people aboard a Boeing 727 leased by the
company were killed when the Quito-bound plane crashed into a hill
in Bogota on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The jetliner belonged to Ecuador's military-run TAME airline
and spokesmen for the company, in Bogota and Quito, Ecuador,
initially said it was carrying 51 passengers and a 10-member crew.
</P>
<P>
They corrected the figure later by saying that there were 43
passengers and 10 crew members.
</P>
<P>
"That's official according to the tickets we have," said the
spokesman, who said he was unable to given nationalities of those
aboard the doomed aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Only four passengers got on the plane in Bogota and the 39
others were going to Quito from Paris. Most were believed to be
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The plane slammed into the mountains east of Bogota three
minutes after taking off from the city's El Dorado airport.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Calls on Americans to Rethink U.N. Involvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday called on Americans to see the United Nations
as related to their daily lives instead of a charity body.
</P>
<P>
"If you thought the U.N. was something of a charity, existing
only for the poor and less fortunate on earth, think again;
Americans are not only giving to the U.N., they are living the
U.N.," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a luncheon in San Francisco on the first
leg of his four-day tour of the western United States.
</P>
<P>
In his speech on "The United Nations in Our Daily Lives,"
Annan said that Americans "need look no further than your own
lives to experience the U.N. system at work."
</P>
<P>
He said his recent agreement with Iraq on access by U.N.
weapons inspectors shows what a united and determined
international community can achieve through the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"This was neither a victory nor a defeat for any one person,
nation or group of nations, it was a victory for peace, for
reason, for the resolution of conflict by diplomacy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Appealing to the international community for its political will
to accomplish U.N. causes, the secretary general said he was
"constrained and disturbed by the Organization's precarious and
perpetual financial instability."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is on the edge of scaling back its operations and of
being unable to meet the most basic expectations of the world's
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of commitment runs wide and deep," he said, terming
the U.S. as "the biggest debtor" to the U.N. while attributing
another 40 percent of the unpaid U.N. dues to other debtor nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. owes the U.N. 1.6 billion U.S. dollars, the latest
U.N. figures show.
</P>
<P>
Advocating his U.N. reform plan, Annan said the current U.N. is
not a "bloated bureaucracy" or a "paper factory," as the amount of
the paper it uses for documents in a year "is equivalent to that
used by the New York Times for a single Sunday edition."
</P>
<P>
"We are making direct and vital connections with your daily
lives and aspirations, but I need your help," he added.

<HEADLINE> TAT to Emphasize Intra-ASEAN Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of Thailand
(TAT) is to emphasize intra-ASEAN travel in a bid to reduce the
capital outflow from Thai tourists to other countries, according
to TAT Deputy Governor for Marketing Pannara Choochan.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the TAT will encourage Thai and other ASEAN
tourists to travel within the region.
</P>
<P>
Since the economic crisis began last year, Thai tourists have
changed their traveling behavior. Outbound trips to Europe and the
United States have been reduced due to the tumble in the value of
the baht, the country's currency.
</P>
<P>
Pannara was quoted Tuesday by the newspaper The Nation as
saying that it is now a good time to boost the domestic and
regional markets. Traveling for short periods of time with less
money has become more popular with Thai tourists. This concept is
suitable not only for Thai tourists but also for those from other
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
suffering from the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that the TAT will encourage travel by car to boost
intra-regional tourism and that this campaign will help spread the
income to people in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The TAT Tuesday announced a motor-travel program, under which
four trips will be organized between May and November this year
and each trip will last three days and cost around 2,000-2,500
baht (40-62 U.S. dollars) per person.

<HEADLINE> Emperor's Bathroom Found at Ruins in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- An ancient bathroom fitted with
well-designed drainage systems reportedly was found on the
Jiangnushi Ruins site in northeast China's Liaoning
Province. Archeologists say the bathroom was used by the emperor
and his concubines about 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The ruins, first discovered in the early 1980s, was a temporary
palace of the Emperor Qin Shihuang during his inspection of
northwestern coastal areas. The palace consisted of six parts
stretching in a T-shape and covering an area of 25 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The internal structure of the newly found bathroom remains
intact and is quite similar to that of a modern bathhouse. "It was
used by the palace owners before every solemn ceremony at that
time," experts say.
</P>
<P>
Lots of escape tunnels were found on or under the floor
connected with cisterns, in which wastewater was stored, instead
of directly flowing into the sea. "It shows people of the Qin
Dynasty (221-206 B.C.) already had a sense of environmental
protection," experts say.
</P>
<P>
They also discovered a badly damaged hall, however, people can
imagine its past magnificence in accordance with a well-made
stage, big holes where great pillars used to stand and rammed
earth floor paved with white stone.
</P>
<P>
Excavations will continue at the site. Experts believe more
discoveries will provide rich evidence for the study of
architecture, art, religion, science and technology of ancient
times.

<HEADLINE> Fire Damage in Indonesia Reaches 938 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Fires raging in Indonesia's East
Kalimantan Province have cost 7.5 trillion rupiah (938 million
U.S. dollars) in lost timber revenues, a local government official
said.
</P>
<P>
The loss did not include the damage to biodiversity, the
decline in tourist visits and health costs, East Kalimantan Deputy
Governor Suwarna Abdul Fatah said on Monday in the provincial
capital of Samarinda, according to reports reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the latest estimate of the forest area ravaged by
uncontrollable fires over the last three months was close to
400,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
"The vast area burning, the presence of at least 39 permanent
hot spots and the continuing drought have made the fires hard to
control," Suwarna said.
</P>
<P>
"A lighted cigarette end carelessly dropped could threaten
thousands of hectares of forest," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Suwarna, the permanent hot spots are scattered
around the 61,000-hectare Bukit Soeharto forest reserve and the
200,000-hectare Kutai National Park, both of which have suffered
devastating damage over the last three months.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to extinguish the blazes -- blamed largely on big
companies and farmers using slash-and-burn methods to clear land
for planting -- have generally been unsuccessful in the
drought-stricken province where little rain has fallen since last
July, officials said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senator Says NATO Expansion Poses Nuclear Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan warned Monday that expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) could pose the greatest risk of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Associated Press's 150th anniversary, Moynihan,
a New York Democrat, said the alliance's expansion seriously
threatened the U.S.-Russia relations and Russia could perceive the
move as a threat warranting use of its nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
"This would come about not from Russian strength, but Russian
weakness," Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
"If we go ahead, we have to recognize that without having
intended it, we may have raised the prospect of nuclear war to the
most intense point it has ever reached since the beginning of the
nuclear age," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last July, NATO leaders decided to accept Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic as its new members and signed accession
protocols with the three in December last year.
</P>
<P>
The protocols need to be approved by the Senate. A vote of
two-thirds is necessary for the approval.
</P>
<P>
A group led by Moynihan and Senator John Warner, a republican
from Virginia, proposes that the measure be accompanied by a
three-year freeze on additional membership beyond the three.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Senate Majority leader Trent Lott decided to
postpone the vote just weeks after the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee voted overwhelmingly to approve it.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Gross Foreign Assets Grow Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's gross foreign assets
reserves were 16.8 billion U.S. dollars as of April 15, up
slightly from the 16.59 billion dollars recorded at the end of
March, Bank Indonesia said.
</P>
<P>
Central bank director Achjar Iljas said Monday that the current
assets are enough to finance non-oil and gas imports for 4.3
months.
</P>
<P>
The rise was partly attributable to revenues from non-oil and
gas exports amounting to 77 million dollars and the withdrawal of
standby loans amounting to 60.1 million dollars, the official
Antara News Agency Tuesday quoted the director as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that as of April 15, Bank Indonesia still had standby
loans of 985.8 million dollars at various international commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
Achjar also announced that the amount of the country's net
international reserves stood at 13.3 billion dollars as of April
15, up from 13.13 billion dollars at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The country's net international reserves declined significantly
from 24.556 billion dollars in September 1997 to the latest figure
due to the prolonged economic crisis, in which the rupiah, the
country's currency, has fallen more than 70 percent against the
U.S. dollar since July last year.
</P>
<P>
Gross foreign assets comprise net international reserves and
Bank Indonesia's liabilities that mature within one year, forward
market obligations and foreign exchange deposits at Bank
Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Build More Affordable Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to build nearly
49 million sq.m. of floor space this year, spending 41.9 billion
yuan, as part of its national housing reform.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior Ministry of Construction official, the
country will adopt a commercial housing policy and stop the
housing allocation as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
By then, people will have to buy their own houses, and about 90
percent of them will be looking for more affordable apartments.
</P>
<P>
China's housing market has huge potential, the official said,
with its urban population of 350 million, and average per capita
living space of 8.4 sq.m.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, the country will have additional 13
million newlyweds in need of housing and the urban population will
grow by 10.75 million from the 1996 figure, the official said.
</P>
<P>
To increase the average per capita living space to 9 sq.m. for
urban residents by the end of the century, the country has to
build 175 million sq.m. annually, and it has to renovate and
rebuild 125 million sq.m. of old housing annually.
</P>
<P>
Urban Chinese spending on housing remains low, at 7.7 percent
of their total expenditures, far lower than that neighboring
Japan, India, or Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
But their income and bank deposits keep increasing and more
people are willing to buy their own houses, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A study in Beijing has shown that most urban residents plan to
buy their own houses.
</P>
<P>
The official said that this could help the country reach its 8
percent economic growth target.

<HEADLINE> China's Securities Legislation Pressing Ahead: Zhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A top official with the China
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) vowed yesterday to push
the drafting and enactment of the long-awaited Securities Law this
year, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhengqing, CSRC chairman, was quoted as saying that work
on preparing the law will be a significant part of the securities
watchdog's efforts in improving the anti-risk mechanism of the
market.
</P>
<P>
Zhou made the remarks while delivering a keynote speech at the
opening ceremony of the 1998 China Business Summit, co-organized
by the World Economic Forum, the State Economic and Trade
Commission and the China Enterprise Management Association.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has promulgated about 250 rules and regulations
for the capital market, which have played a critical role in the
construction of a legal framework for the market and in fighting
the over-speculative activities in the market in the past two
years, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
But the Securities Law, regarded as the leading legal tool in
regulating the market, is still unresolved. Zhou said the ongoing
government shake-up will help build a untied regulatory system and
raise the efficiency of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the government's commitment of enlisting the market
to support the restructuring of the State-owned enterprises, Zhou
stressed the significance of listed companies' sound performance
for a sustained development of the market.
</P>
<P>
Institutional investors need to be fostered to support the
listing of the State firms.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC is concerned about the problems in the languishing
foreign currency denominated B-share market and is considering
taking necessary measures to enable the market to develop in a
healthier way.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said the debut of China's first three securities
investment funds this month was successful. China would gradually
expand the size of the funds, which is expected to help stablize
the market.
</P>
<P>
Foreign securities companies' participation in the fund
industry can be expected after the promulgation of the regulation
on the Sino-foreign joint venture securities fund management.

<HEADLINE> More Drought-Related Deaths Reported in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Eleven more people died in a
remote village in the drought-ravaged southern Philippine island
of Mindanao last week, bringing to 53 the death toll from the El
Nino-induced long dry spell, local newspaper Manila Bulletin said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential assistant for Mindanao Jesus Dureza said the 11
deaths were reported in North Upi Town, Maguindanao Province, one
of the worst-hit by the El Nino weather phenomenon in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Six of the 11 died of food poisoning after eating wild yam
while the other five were struck down by cholera and diarrhea in
three mountain villages, he said.
</P>
<P>
Two medical teams and boxes of medicines and foodstuffs were
sent to the town Monday by air force helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Dureza, who is leading round-the-clock relief to Mindanao, said
2.6 million people have been affected by the El Nino-caused
massive famine which has prompted many hungry villagers to eat
wild yam.
</P>
<P>
At least 42 people have died from eating wild yam during recent
months, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dureza warned that an outbreak of diseases is
possible among some half a million families in 11 drought-stricken
Mindanao provinces hit hard by the drought.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Free of Major Contrat Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Three Gorges Dam Project
has so far been free from major contract disputes, thanks to
preventional measures, according to Lu Youmei, general manager of
the Three Gorges Construction Group Company.
</P>
<P>
Lu says that, to avoid disputes, project lawyers checked and
helped improve more than 2,900 contracts involving some 15 billion
yuan (1.7 billion US dollars), and from the very beginning, all
sub-contracting had to be notarized.
</P>
<P>
"Large construction projects used to take long time for
mobilization, but now, with the new market mechanism, all
obligations are clearly defined by contracts," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The projrct is on the main stream of the Yangtze River in Hubei
Province, and is expected to cost over 200 billion yuan. It also
involves relocation of over one million people from the submerged
areas.
</P>
<P>
The dam's main purpose is to prevent floods, removing a mjaor
threat to the more developed lower reaches of the Yangtze,
according to experts .

<HEADLINE> 97 Ginkgo Trees Lived Through 1,000 Years in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-seven ginkgo trees in the
city Suizhou which are more than 1,000 years old have been
equipped with lightning rods and placed under special protection by
local villagers in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
In return, the ancient trees brought villagers financial
rewards of nearly 1 million yuan (120,000 U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
A 1,100-year-old ginkgo, 20 meters tall and 1.5 meters in
diameter, produced 350 kilograms of fruit worth more than 10,000
yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the most outstanding one. The highest annual
output of an ancient ginkgo reached 500 kilograms," said a
villager.
</P>
<P>
The city is also home to 4,637 ginkgo trees over 100 years old
and most of the 1,000-year-old ginkgo trees are in the Dahong and
Tongbai mountainous areas of the city, according to the city's
forestry bureau.
</P>
<P>
The fruit and leaves of the ginkgo are widely used in Chinese
traditional medicine and have great value. The city gives priority
to the development of the ginkgo industry. More than 10 million
ginkgo trees have been grown in more than 20 towns, with the
annual output of ginkgo fruit surpassing 800 tons, making the city
China's largest center of ginkgo production.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yaping, a member of the China Ginkgo Research Association,
said that ginkgo trees used to be wide-ranging in the Northern
Hemisphere as early as 200 million years ago. But most of them
became extinct as the result of glaciers about 2 million years
ago. Only a few of them survived in several parts of China.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Congress to Pass Anti-Smoking Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday urged lawmakers to pass strict anti-smoking legislation in
an effort to prevent children from smoking.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the White House, Clinton said the highest
priority for lawmakers should be preventing an estimated 3,000
children from smoking this year.
</P>
<P>
"All these children have been targeted by a massive,
multimillion-dollar media campaign that preys on their
insecurities and their dreams," Clinton said. "We have an
opportunity and an obligation now to put aside politics, to turn
aside the pleas of special interests, to act in the interest of
the health of generations of our children."
</P>
<P>
The president said the country has a responsibility to put a
stop to "predatory practices by tobacco companies that have
targeted our children."
</P>
<P>
The president made the call when there was a debate on tobacco
settlement. A new bill was proposed by Senator John McCain
recently that would cost cigarette makers an estimated 516 billion
U.S. dollars over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies now oppose the measure, saying the cost would
be tens of billions of dollars higher than originally intended.
And it would be higher than the settlement reached last year
between the tobacco industry and state attorneys general to help
states recover the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses and
help tobacco companies shield themselves from future lawsuits.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen to Consider Improving Rolls-Royce Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Volkswagen AG confirmed
Monday that it may make an improved bid for British luxury car
manufacturer Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday, Volkswagen announced that its
supervisory board will meet Saturday to discuss a possible new
bid.
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce's parent Vickers announced on March 30 that
Volkswagen's German rival BMW was the preferred bidder for
Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the two companies are in exclusive negotiations
about BWM's 340 million pound (570 million U.S. dollar) bid which
Vickers reportedly wants the German carmaker to improve further.
</P>
<P>
Vickers also set the exclusive bargaining period for 30 days,
which means that after May 1, Vickers will in a position to
consider any improved bids.
</P>
<P>
German press reports earlier said that Volkswagen might
increase its offer from 1.2 billion marks to 1.3 billion marks
(from 649 million to 703 million dollars) along with a commitment
to making significant investment in Rolls-Royce in the future.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar was mixed
against other major currencies Monday, posting slight gains
against the yen that were limited by fears of new Japanese
intervention.
</P>
<P>
At the closing, the dollar was quoted at 132.15 yen, up from
131.79 late Friday. It also was changing hands at 1.8012 marks,
down from 1.8083.
</P>
<P>
Traders sought dollars against yen while awaiting Friday's
expected release of further details about Japan's latest economic
stimulus plan, which was unveiled earlier this month. But the
dollar's gains were limited by concern that the Bank of Japan
might intervene in the market again to sell dollars for yen.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Japan's central bank intervened twice to halt
the yen's plunge. The Japanese currency was at a more than
six-year lows at the beginning of this month, threatening to
further destabilize the country's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday:
1.4975 Swiss francs, down from 1.4989; 6.0390 French francs, down
from 6.0595; 1,781.30 Italian lire, down from 1,787; and 1.4271
Canadian dollars, down from 1.4285.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.6716 U.S. dollars, down from
1.6832 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> IBM Earnings Down, Shares Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM), the world's giant computer maker, said
Monday it earned 1 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter, down
from 1.2 billion U.S. dollars a year ago, its first quarterly
decline in income in two years.
</P>
<P>
The company said its revenues in the period increased by just 2
percent to 17.6 billion U.S. dollars. IBM had warned the market in
January that its results would fall below the year-earlier period
due to one-time expenses related to the acquisition of a software
company and marketing expenses for the winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The strong U.S. dollar also affected the earnings of the
company, according to IBM. Otherwise, it said, its revenue would
have increased by 6 percent instead of 2 percent without currency
exchange factors.
</P>
<P>
During the after-house trading, IBM's shares were quoted at
111.25 U.S. dollars, compared with its opening of 107.94.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Iraq Not Cooperative in Weapons Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
accused Iraq of not cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors
despite its agreement with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. accusation came after the U.N. inspectors said last
Friday that they made almost no progress over the past six months
in verifying that Iraq had destroyed any remaining weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
It "presents clear and disturbing evidence that Iraq has failed
to cooperate in coming forward with the information needed to
allow the United Nations to conclude Iraq has indeed destroyed the
weapons it says it has destroyed," State Department spokesman
James Rubin told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the possible lift of sanctions imposed by the
U.N. Security Council after the 1991 Gulf War, Rubin said the time
was "far away" for the sanctions to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Non-cooperation "shows how far away they are from the time the
U.N. could declare them in compliance with the relevant provisions
of the relevant resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that while Iraq may have complied with its promise
to let U.N. inspectors examine Baghdad's presidential palaces,
Iraqis "continue to lie and hide the truth" regarding weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspectors have recently completed their
examinations of six presidential sites in Iraq and found no
evidence that weapons of mass destruction were installed in these
palaces.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has thus demanded that sanctions that have caused great
sufferings to the Iraqi people be lifted.
</P>
<P>
But Richard Butler, the chief weapons inspector, said he was no
closer to giving Iraq a clean bill of health than when he issued
his last major report last October.
</P>
<P>
He said in a report to the Security Council that a four-month
crisis over weapons inspections had made it impossible for his
experts to do their work. "Virtually no progress in verifying
disarmament has been able to be reported."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council planned to discuss Butler's report this
week to see if sanctions on Iraq could be lifted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Private investors are set to benefit
from the 1999 introduction of the single European currency, the
euro, thanks to expanded investment opportunities, reduced
currency risks, and rising competitions, the German central bank
Bundesbank said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest monthly report issued Monday, the Bundesbank said
that as national currency boundaries vanish and most European
stocks and bonds are denominated in euros, investors will be able
to make use of a variety of cross-border investment opportunities
in the euro area which will become the second largest capital
market in the world.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, investors are also set to benefit from reduced
transaction costs and improved market transparency resulting from
heated competitions among financial institutions after the advent
of the euro, the Bundesbank said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Carol Mellamy, executive
director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), on Monday
called for the immediate, unconditional release of the 10
international aid workers from the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) by Somali gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified Somali gunmen kidnapped the 10 relief workers
from a small airstrip north of the capital Mogadishu on Monday.
They include seven ICRC staff, two workers from the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and one from
the Somali Red Cross Society.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy asked the Somali faction leaders holding the hostages
to recall the great contribution of ICRC to all Somali citizens
during the most difficult times in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The small faction leaders must remember the basic principles of
African and Somali culture which respect human life," she said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that incidents such as appalling kidnapping of
ICRC staff would make it virtually impossible for aid agencies to
work in the country.
