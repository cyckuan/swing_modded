<HEADLINE> Senate Agrees to Spending to Crack Down Teen Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Wednesday
agreed to the Clinton administration's request for 34 million
dollars to pay for a nation-wide crackdown on illegal sales of
tobacco products to youths under age 18.
</P>
<P>
In July, the Senate approved only 4.9 million dollars for the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) program, but on a voice vote
agreed to an amendment to the agriculture spending bill adding 29
million dollars. An effort to kill the amendment failed by a 28-70
vote.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the House of Representatives has approved 24 million
dollars for the FDA program. Differences between the House and
Senate spending bills have to be resolved in a conference
committee.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore told senators in a letter made public on
Tuesday that the FDA needs the full amount requested if all 50
states are to check whether stores are complying with new rules
requiring identification checks tobacco buyers.
</P>
<P>
More than one billion dollars worth of tobacco products are
illegally sold to minors each year, Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Continue Cautious Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
maintain its cautious fiscal and monetary policies and the
relaxing liquidity will be continued in stages, Finance Minister
Mar'ie Muhammad said today.
</P>
<P>
"The interest rate will be decreased in stages in line with the
situation," the minister told the press when announcing the
results of a limited cabinet meeting on economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's revenues will fall significantly due to
excessive rupiah fluctuation against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's rupiah, like other regional currencies, has come
under fierce speculative attacks following the de factor
devaluation of the Thai baht and the Philippine peso in July.
</P>
<P>
The value of the rupiah has dropped more than 22 percent in the
past eight months, far higher than the 5 to 6 percent planned by
the government for each year.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the rupiah devaluation, "some of the projects
financed by the state budget might be canceled or rescheduled as a
consequence of the reduced state budget," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He also said the present monetary crisis in several countries
indicates that the banking sector has an important role in
improving or worsening the situation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the sharp devaluation of the rupiah, the government did
not sacrifice its foreign exchange, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia (central bank) Governor Soedradjad
said the country's foreign exchange reserve at present stands at
20.3 billion U.S. dollars, excluding a two billion U.S. dollars
stand-by loan.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the government will raise the interest of short term
certificates of Bank Indonesia (SBI) and when would trading of
securities be carried out, he said they would depend on the latest
developments.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie also said that the situation in the country's capital
market as well as those in other Southeast Asian countries might
be gloomy.
</P>
<P>
To revitalize the capital market, the government would revoke
the regulation on the limitation of foreign investors in buying
bonds traded in the bourse, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National
Reconnaissance Office (NRO) is studying the feasibility of a
constellation of communication satellite to relay data to and from
military, intelligence and civil spacecraft, U.S. space and
defense officials said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed National Space Communication Program would replace
separate satellite relay systems operated by National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Defense, the
Defense News weekly quoted the officials as saying in its
September 1-7 edition.
</P>
<P>
The program was planned to start late next decade. The system
also would relay communications to and from NASA's space shuttle,
the international space station and civilian spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
The NRO, which buys and operates U.S. spy satellites, is
developing the relay system requirements with input from the
military and civilian space sectors and U.S. industry officials,
the weekly said. And the system would be owned and operated by the
U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The defense space architect office, established in 1995, is
planning the mix of satellite systems that will meet the U.S.
military's future needs, it said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government spends about 1 billion dollars annually to
operate its military, intelligence and civilian spacecraft.

JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said today that Asian countries within the Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM) have yet to discuss the participation of Myanmar in
the group's summit in London next year.
</P>
<P>
Alatas told reporters before a cabinet meeting that parties
which will participate in the ASEM meeting next April in London
are Asia and West Europe, instead of ASEAN and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Alatas also said that countries attending the summit would meet
individually rather than inter-groups.
</P>
<P>
He said the Asian countries of ASEM are still working on the
requests of India, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand to attend
the meeting. "We have yet to reach a consensus."
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook recently said Europe would
oppose the participation of any Myanmar representative to the
ASEM, citing the human rights reason.
</P>
<P>
The first ASEM was held in Bangkok last year, attended by the
ASEAN countries, China, South Korea, Japan and 15 European
countries.

ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) now groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines,

<HEADLINE> British PM Urges Scotland to Postpone World Cup Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair urged here today the Scotland Football Association (SFA) to
postpone Saturday's World Cup qualifying match between Scotland
and Belarus as a respect to Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
The funeral of Diana, who was killed in a tragic car crash
Sunday morning, will be held at London's Westminster Abbey
Saturday morning. Most of Britain's sporting organizations have
decided to call off various events on that day.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Britain's Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar
had voiced deep concern over the SFA's decision to go ahead with
the scheduled game.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said this afternoon: "The Prime
Minister has spoken to Donald Dewar and totally supports the
action he is taking to try to persuade the Scottish Football
Association that it would be inappropriate for the game to go
ahead."
</P>
<P>
The Scottish football authorities had decided that the football
match would go ahead in Aberdeen with all the players wearing
black armbands and observing one minute's silence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most players of the Sottish team have attacked the
go-ahead decision with Ally McCoist, the star player, pulling out
of the squad.
</P>
<P>
"Given the circumstances I would not do either myself or the
fans justice on Saturday and I have asked not to be selected,"
McCoist said.

</P>
<P>
EAC Executive Secretary Francis Muthaura was addressing a

There was need to identify and explore specific areas of
co-operation which would benefit the three member states, he
noted, as some existing laws might hinder the secretariat's
course of action.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura said that areas of co-operation had been identified
during the phase one, and the next step would focus on specific
recommendations and their implementations.
</P>
<P>

included the revival of the court of appeal for east Africa, the
implementation of cross border legal practice and the revival of

<HEADLINE> Russia, Chechnya Bargain over Oil Transit Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin Wednesday ruled out the possibility of a compromise
in the transportation of Caspian oil via Chechen territory,
describing it as to be "misplaced", the Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry, it offered
0.43 U.S. dollars for transportation of one ton of oil via
Chechen territory, while the Chechen side proposed that it receive
2.20 U.S. dollars per ton, which includes expenses for
management, guards and so on.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said the figures on which the Russian side is
insisting at the talks on oil transit were not "somebody's
caprice." Russia has a broad experience in the transportation of
energy supplies both on Russian territory and abroad and therefore
the tariffs proposed by the Russian side are dictated by the
situation on the market, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin pointed out that if the issue of transportation of
early Caspian oil via Chechnya is not resolved "we will search for
different ways, and they exist."
</P>
<P>
The joint Russian-Chechen commission held its meetings Tuesday
in the village of Dagomys near the Black Sea resort city of Sochi,
which involved Russian Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin and
Chechen First Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov. The talks were
also attended by president of the Chechen oil company Yunko
Khodzhakhmed Yarikhanov.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted Yarikhanov as saying, Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov has rejected the Russian proposal made by Rybkin on the
transit of Caspian oil across Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov does not agree with the technique of determining the
amount to be paid, Yarikhanov was cited.
</P>
<P>
"Russia must rebuild the (Chechen) oil industry anyway while
Chechnya wants to cash in on the transit of oil," the Chechen oil
company president said. "By insisting on the tariff of 0.43 U.S.
dollars per ton of oil, the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry is
trying to downgrade Chechnya to a Russian region," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Yuri Lisin, vice president of the Russian
oil pumping company Transneft, arrived in Grozny Wednesday
afternoon to continue the discussion of oil transit with Yarikhanov
later the day.

<HEADLINE> IFBWW Congress Opens in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A three-day 20th congress of
the International Federation of Building and Wood Workers (IFBWW)
started here today with a call for trade unions to review their
effectiveness and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 delegates from 110 countries are attending the
congress which seeks to analyse the role of trade union movements
in the 21th century.
</P>
<P>
The congress will focus on the need for trade unions to adopt
and strengthen their position to best meet workers' needs in
modern societies which were increasingly influenced by the
changing political and economic environments.
</P>
<P>
The IFBWW groups trade unions in the building, wood, forestry
and allied sectors. It currently has 13 million members in 264
trade unions in 110 countries.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwe's public service, labour and
social welfare minister Florence Chitauro said although trade
unions had changed from being "mere agitators" to competent
negotiators in labour disputes, they were still faced with more
challenges.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge of today is for trade unions to be professional
in approach, guided by research and strategic planning ethics by
virtue of the fact that their purview has broadened to include
employment retention and creation," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe government was committed to the idea of
tripartism which promoted dialogue on economic issues between
trade unions, employers and itself, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The government has gone beyond provisions of ILO conventions
in consulting social parters by extending tripartite
consultations on economic decisions," she said.

LUSAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Norwegian government today
granted Zambia 2.5 billion Kwacha (about 2 million U.S. Dollars)
to help the country commercialize its state-owned electricity
company, the Zambian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The money is aiming at promoting the commercialization process

the money would help improve ZESCO'S efficiency.
</P>
<P>
She paid tribute to the Norwegian government for its support
to the country's development.
</P>
<P>
Jon Lomoy, Norwegian Ambassador to Zambia, said the money
would be used to purchase equipment and train ZESCO staff in an
effort to improve the operations of the company.
</P>
<P>
The money would also improve ZESCO's capacity to generate
power effectively to all parts of the country, stressed Lomoy,
adding that reliable power supply is vital to the country's
economic development.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Refugees Continue Hunger Strike in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian refugees today
continued their hunger strike for the third straight day in front
of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) building in the
Lebanese capital of Beirut, protesting its budget cut.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the protesters said UNRWA's budget cut
indicated an end to the agency's services to the Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
"Previous sit-ins did not lead to any results, so we decided
to go on a hunger strike, holding the donor countries responsible
for any human catastrophes," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
UNRWA, founded in 1950, is the sole provider of health and
educational services to 3.3 million Palestinian refugees in the
world, including 360,000 in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The agency's announcement of its budget cut of 7 million
dollars this year on August 20 triggered sit-ins and protests by
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The reduction is reportedly as a result of a 20 million dollar
deficit and lack of contributions from donor nations.
</P>
<P>
The major donor countries for UNRWA are the United States,
Japan, Canada and Sweden. Burden on the host countries, such as
Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Jordan, has been increasing since the
contributions to the agency have been reducing, local media
reported.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, who are abstaining from food but not water or
cigarettes, said their strike was part of a series of measures
against the agency.
</P>
<P>
"We shall fast day and night until UNRWA's austerity measures
in Lebanon are terminated," said a striker who refused to
disclose his name.
</P>
<P>
He said Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria and Gaza Strip
are also on a strike to protest the decision.
</P>
<P>
During the strike, the Lebanese government, which is also
against the budget cuts, sent policemen to the strike site to
help keep order.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Push Cyprus Political Settlement Forward: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The goal of the United States
is to help continue the U.N.-led talks for a Cyprus settlement, a
U.S. ambassador said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with President Glafcos
Clerides, U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus, Kenneth Brill, said that
the U.S. goal is "to keep people focused on how to move
forward a political settlement and to avoid things that cause
tension".
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he believed intercommunal talks would take place
in March, Brill said the goal of the U.S. and of other interested
parties is to see the talks resume once the presidential
elections are over in February next year, and hope that "things
can be done in between to prepare for those, to make them
constructive".
</P>
<P>
The two rounds of U.N.-sponsored direct talks held in the
U.S. and Switzerland in July and August, between president
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, ended in
failure because of Denktash's refusal to negotiate a settlement
if the European Union does not postpone accession talks with
Cyprus early next year.
</P>
<P>
Brill announced that Thomas Miller, U.S. State Department
Coordinator for Cyprus will visit the island later this month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus, Richard Holbrooke is
also expected to visit Cyprus "some time in the fall", but
his schedule has not been set yet, the U.S. diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that after failure of the two rounds
of U.N.-led intercommunal talks in the last two months, the
U.S. will intensify its peace efforts, trying to bring the two
sides on the island into a negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and
took over the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved despite the U.N.
and international community's peace efforts for past 23 years.

<HEADLINE> Large Scale Illegal Trading in CFCS Exposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A new report published today by
the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) exposed a large scale
Europe-wide illegal trade in CFCs, ozone depleting chemicals used
in refrigeration.
</P>
<P>
Production of CFCs has been banned in Europe since January 1,
1995. No import licenses have been granted since January 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, CFCs are traded around Europe and on to a lucrative
market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
EIA estimates the size of the European illegal trade in CFCs at
between 6,000 and 10,000 tons per year. The European Chemical
Industry council has put the figure much higher at 20,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The report entitled "Chilling Facts About a Burning Issue: CFC
Smuggling in the European Union", is the most comprehensive
dossier of information on the illegal CFCs trade in Europe ever
made public.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in London today, EIA Chairman Allan Thornton said:
"This evidence proves that there are large amounts of CFCs in
circulation around Europe, and that the Ozone protection regime is
in danger of unraveling."
</P>
<P>
"European governments must now implement a ban on the sale of
CFCs across the EU and close the loopholes which allow illicit
trade in CFCs to persist," he added.
</P>
<P>
Incidence of skin cancer has reached record levels as ozone
depletion allows more ultraviolet radiation to reach the Earth's
surface.
</P>
<P>
There are now 2,000 reported deaths from skin cancer each year
in Britain alone. It has been estimated that in the U.S. one in 70
Caucasians will contract skin cancer in a "quiet 20th century
epidemic", according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Iran Strongly Slams Israel-US-Turkey War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
strongly slammed the Israel-US-Turkey joint military maneuvers
scheduled for mid-November.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi stated that such
cooperation is a source of crisis in the region and is against the
world of Islam.
</P>
<P>
"Iran considers Turkey a member of the Islamic community
but rejects its cooperation with the Zionist regime as it is
detrimental to the interests of the Muslims in the region," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman condemned the scheduled joint maneuver between
Turkey and Israel and called it a threat to Arab states as
well as the whole region.
</P>
<P>
"The Zionist regime through this joint maneuver intends to
weaken the Arab side in the equations of the region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stated "Iran has time and again voiced its
utmost concern over the increasing influences of the Zionist
regime in the region and cannot be indifferent toward these
developments."
</P>
<P>
Stating that Tehran considers coordinated policies amongst
Islamic countries as a major obstacle in the way of the
Israeli regime's expansionism, Mohammadi declared Iran's support
for any decisive stance against the expansionist policies of the
Zionist regime.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Syria have already expressed their opposition to
the Israel-US-Turkey war games and rejected any justification that
the games were for rescue and search operations.
</P>
<P>
The military maneuvers involving troops of the three countries
will take place in mid-November in the eastern Mediterranean.

<HEADLINE> French Press Groups Disgusted by Legal Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Many French photographer and
press institutions today reacted with disgust to the decision by
the French judicial authorities to continue inquiry against six
photographers and one press motorcyclist for pursuing the late
Princess of Wales last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Investigation Court Tuesday decided to inquire into
the responsibility of the photographers in the car crash of Diana,
and could put them on trial for "non assistance to persons in
danger and involuntary homicide and involuntary injury."
</P>
<P>
In a statement published today, the National Federation of
Photo Press Agencies of France (FNAPPI) said: "The condemnation a
priori of the reporter-photographer journalists is unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
It also accused some press journalists for "bringing to their
reporter-photographer colleagues heavy and grave accusations"
after the accident took place.
</P>
<P>
The directors of some photo press agencies, considered to be
the best in the world, today also reminded the public that
professional photo journalists have paid a high price for covering
wars and other high risk events around the world.
</P>
<P>
One of the six photographers under investigation, Jacques
Langevin of the Sygma agency, is an award-winning reporter who
covered numerous high risk world events.
</P>
<P>
In an article published in the daily Liberation, Langevin said
that he did not participate in the chase of Diana that night, and
arrived at the scene of the crash in Alma tunnel all by accident.
</P>
<P>
All the press agencies stressed that the only concrete evidence
of the crash is that Henri Paul, the chauffeur of Diana and her
friend Egyptian billionaire Dodi Al Fayed, was drunk and was
speeding the powerful Mercedes at 180 kilometers per hour (110
miles per hour).
</P>
<P>
In a statement published today, the Reporters sans Frontieres
expressed its concern over the "graveness of the charges
maintained" against the six photographers and one motorcyclist.
</P>
<P>
"Reporters sans Frontieres tries to recall that the justice
should be exercised in calmness and sereneness, far from the
pressure of public opinion," it said.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial entitled "Red Carpet for Censorship," the
daily France Soir accused the judicial authorities of imposing
censorship on the photographers by putting them under inquiry
according to the will of the higher authorities.
</P>
<P>
"It is a red carpet, color of the circumstance, that the
justice worked yesterday in honor of the censorship on the
move," said the chief editor of France Soir in the editorial.
</P>
<P>
Roger Therond, the boss of the Paris Match photo magazine, said
that "all people are responsible" and that the "machine is
getting out of control."
</P>
<P>
"There is a phenomenon from the public who, weary of a society
they feel absurd, takes refuge in dreams," he said.

LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) traded 16.58
million contracts in August, an increase of 33 percent over the
same month of 1996.

Average daily volume amounted to 829,111 futures and options

and options contracts, a rise of 25 percent on the same period in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Deniel Hodson, LIFFE's Chief of Executive, said "The record
volume for the month of August reflects factors such as a rise in
Britain's interest rates and speculation over a possible rise in
German interest rates."

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government Calls for Peaceful Solution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus said today that it
takes seriously the threats made by Turkey and the Turkish
Cypriots, but at the same time it continues to pursue peaceful
solutions to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government is preparing for any event, Manolis
Christofides, Cyprus government spokesman, said at a daily press
briefing, but "to their (Turkey's and Turkish Cypriot) bellicose
threats, we reply with propositions for a peaceful solution to the
Cyprus question."
</P>
<P>
A settlement of the Cyprus issue "can be achieved only through
peaceful means," he was commenting on the threats made by Serdar
Denktash, the so-called "Vice President" of the Turkish Cypriot
regime in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Serdar Denktash said recently if the Russian-made missiles were
deployed in Cyprus, the Turkish Cypriots would settle in the
eastern town of Famagusta (Varosha).
</P>
<P>
Famagusta has been a ghost town, from which all residents were
evacuated, since the Turkish military intervention in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council resolution 550 considers
"attempts to settle in any part of Varosha by people other than its
inhabitants as inadmissible and calls for the transfer of this
area to the administration of the U.N."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government signed an agreement with Russia in
January to buy its anti-aircraft missiles. This deal has enraged
Turkey and Turkish Cypriots which have threatened to launch
military strikes against Cyprus if the missiles are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Delivery of the missiles is expected to be done by autumn next
year. But the Cyprus government said the deal could be canceled if
Turkish Cypriots agreed to Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides'
proposal for demilitarization of the island, or if there was
substantial progress on the Cyprus problem to justify their
non-delivery.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when the Turkey sent
troops took over the northern third of the island in the wake of a
failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. The
Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Preparing for Re-negotiations with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean military
government of Major Johnny Paul Koroma is 100 days in office
today but officials said there are no plans for any celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to see how we can offset the blockade and
sanctions imposed by west African leaders last weekend at their
summit (Economic Community of West African States) in Abuja,
Nigeria and provide improved living standards for our people," a
state house official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Other phone calls to leading government officials received
similar responses.
</P>
<P>
"We are too busy for interviews. We are looking at
alternatives and strategies," was all they could say.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the government is preoccupied with the
task of finding ways to restart negotiations with the ECOWAS'
Committee of Four on Sierra Leone on returning the country to
constitutional rule after the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
So far the government has not issued any official statement to
the blockade and sanction. But according to officials from the
Ministry of Trade, there are enough petroleum products and rice,
which is the country's staple food for the time being.
</P>
<P>
One businessman said, the sectors that could be affected
immediately are likely to be flour, onions and sugar. The price
for a loaf of bread has increased by four times from Monday to
Tuesday with its size shrinking to two-third of its original.
</P>
<P>
The pro-democracy clandestine radio which had openly called
for military intervention said Tuesday that the blockade and
sanction made against the regime "is a direct response of the
disgust of the international community."
</P>
<P>
According to the radio, all officials of the junta and their
relatives are now barred from entering western countries
including Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The government is hard-pressed for talks and two organizations
which are working independently announced Monday they are
"working behind the scenes to get talks started."
</P>
<P>
The groups, the Independent National Mediation Commission led
by one-time Youth Minister Musa Kabia and Mediators for Peace in
Sierra Leone led by businessman Ibrahim Sesay, said they have a
large number of paramount chiefs, university lecturers and
religious leaders supporting them.
</P>
<P>
"We want to urgently get Koroma and Kabbah (the ousted
president) together so that they can solve the current impasse
once and for all. This is our goal," Kabia added.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Ahara Bangali, secretary of state
finance, has been invited to the meeting of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in Hong Kong on September 23.
</P>
<P>
The IMF secretariat stated in a letter that the meeting will
review the activities of the World Bank and IMF and address the
issue of governance and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Bangali told Xinhua that "The World Bank and the IMF cannot
suspend a member country because of its political impasse," a
reference to the non-recognition of the junta government by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"Sierra Leone is still a member of IMF contrary to rumours
that it has been suspended by the organization," he added.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Voices Concern over Turkish-Israeli War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid today voiced his concern over the
Israeli-Turkish-U.S. war games and their impact on Arab national
security.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his disappointment over the timing of the
Israeli-Turkish-U.S. navy exercises that are scheduled to be held
on November 15-25 in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
"The military exercises come while the Mideast peace process
came to a standstill," the AL chief told reporters after a meeting
with Turkish Ambassador to Egypt Yasar Yakis.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since
March when Israel started to build a controversial settlement in
traditional Arab East Jerusalem, where the Palestinians want as
their future capital.
</P>
<P>
He said that "Turkey should have taken into consideration the
strong ties binding Ankara and the Arab world."
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid and the Turkish ambassador discussed the latest
developments of the Arab-Turkish ties and the dimensions of the
Turkish-Israeli military maneuvers during the meeting, which took
place at the request of Yakis.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish ambassador, on his part, reiterated that the
military exercises come within the context of "search and rescue
operations" and are "open to all countries of the region."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Turkish-U.S. joint maneuvers have set off criticism
from Arab countries already concerned about the growing
Israeli-Turkish alliance.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Tuesday that Turkey
and Israel sent a "negative message" to the region by planning to
hold military exercises in the Mediterranean. Syria has also
condemned such war games.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Turkey to Adopt Open Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- France today called on Turkey to
adopt a more open attitude toward ending the division of Cyprus,
but claimed that the future acceptance of Turkey by the European
Union is not directly linked with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Enlargement of the European Union to Cyprus calls for a
political solution (to the division of the island nation)," said
French Minister of European Affairs, Pierre Moscovici, after
holding a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission decided in July to start negotiations
next year with Nicosia on the admission of the Greek part of the
Mediterranean island into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"We told our Turkish friends that they are not the only one in
the problem, but that we hope that there will also be from the
Turkish side a more open attitude toward the future," said
Moscovici.
</P>
<P>
He said that France remains favorable to the wish by Turkey to
join the European Union and hopes that Turkey can soon participate
in the ministerial conference of European Union in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"The European conference is not a pack of consolidation. It is
an ambitious enterprise which should signify that all countries
should be treated as equal on the same departing line," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Turkey first applied for EU membership in 1987, which was
rejected by Brussels in 1989 mainly because of opposition from
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into the northern Turkish part and the
southern Greek part after an invasion by Turkish troops in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The international community recognizes the Greek Cypriot
government as the only legitimate government of Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Labor Department Releasing Welfare-to-Work Grants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- About 1.1 billion dollars
is on its way to states to help welfare recipients get job
training and experience, said Vice President Al Gore of the United
States Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"These funds represent a dramatic commitment to help break the
cycle of poverty in every state," Gore said at the White House,
where a coalition was discussing how to help welfare recipients
keep jobs once they find them.
</P>
<P>
The new budget law President Bill Clinton signed last month
included three billion dollars for welfare-to-work grants,
including 1.5 billion for the coming year and 1.5 billion for
1999.
</P>
<P>
Cities will compete for 25 percent of the money, sending
applications to the Labor Department administering the program.
But the rest is being awarded based on the number of welfare
recipients who live in each state.
</P>
<P>
In order to prepare mostly long-term welfare recipients to
someday take regular jobs, the grants may be used to subsidize
wages for private or public jobs, provide on-the-job training,
offer community service experience or pay for job readiness and
job placement.
</P>
<P>
The program will target welfare recipients who are in danger of
losing welfare due to time limits, have little education, drug
problems and a poor work history.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile states must spend one dollor of their money for every
two in federal funds they receive.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: G-77 Spearheads South-South Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
( by Xu Jianmei )
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Group-77 is dynamically
spearheading South-South cooperation in the fields of banking,
insurance, information exchanges, joint ventures and so on.
</P>
<P>
A draft feasibility study on the proposed G-77 Trade and
Development Bank has been submitted by Kenya, the expected venue
for the bank, to the G-77 Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI)
steering committee, CCI Chairman Tariq Sayeed said here today.
</P>
<P>
G-77's 132 member states will invest altogether one billion
U.S. Dollars as the initial capital of the bank which is aimed at
stirring export-oriented growth among development countries, said
Sayeed.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has provided more than 100,000 Dollars
to finance the operation of the Experts Committee of the planned
bank, whose official feasibility study is expected to be
completed by November this year.
</P>
<P>
G-77 is also preparing a Joint Ventures Conference in China
and a trade exhibition in India, both set for next year, in a bid
to boost economic information exchanges and cooperation within
the third world, said Sayeed.
</P>
<P>
A just-ended meeting of G-77 CCI steering committee
decided to set up a 15-member board in charge of the G-77
Joint Ventures centre. Each continent can hold five seats at the
board, he said.
</P>
<P>
China, "a leading role in South-South cooperation", will be
one of the five representatives on behalf of Asia in the board,
Sayeed told Xinhua, speaking highly of the fruitful development
of joint ventures in China.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that CCI has been installing a trade information
network to provide timely charged information to all the
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
"A G-77 web will be set up on the Internet where G-77 members
can post information on marketing products. Finally a data base of
information will be created for use by all CCI members," he said.
</P>
<P>
The G-77, the major forum for South-South cooperation, has
also made certain progress in setting up a re-insurance company
and a permanent exhibition authority, Sayeed said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he announced that the venue of the next CCI General
Assembly will be chosen among Kenya, Nigeria, Morocco and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the CCI meeting Monday, Sayeed called on
G-77 members to adopt a new strategy to boost South-South
cooperation and finally evolve a balanced, just and equitable
global economic order.
</P>
<P>
"The current global behavior indeed calls for evolving a new
strategy," he noted, citing a recorded 2,100-billion-U.S.-Dollar
foreign debt of the third world in 1996 and trade barriers by
developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Facing the situation, the developing countries first "should
unite ourselves and forge cooperation to address the crucial
issues emanating from trade barriers, conditionalities of IMF,
problems of trade deficit and mounting trade burden," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the G-77 members " should try to improve our system
by adopting modern techniques both for production and investment"
and "make collective efforts" to remove invisible trade barriers
like anti-dumping, environment and child labor, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
This is "a two-pronged strategy" the developing world has to
do, he announced.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries now account for about 25 percent of
the world trade, compared with 20 percent a decade ago, noted
Sayeed.
</P>
<P>
The Karachi-based G-77 group, which comprises of 132
developing countries from Asia, Africa, Latin America and the
Pacific and Carribean region, was founded at the first U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development meeting in Geneva in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The group set up CCI in 1986 in a bid to mobilize the
participation of the private sector for economic development.

<HEADLINE> Sudan, Uganda to improve ties: Sudanese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
Bashir said here today that the coming days would witness positive
developments in relations between Sudan and Uganda and the peace
process in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return today from a tour to South Africa, Tanzania
and Zambia, Bashir said in a statement at the airport that his
trip was successful.
</P>
<P>
He said he held talks with Ugandan President Yuri Musevini
during his visit to South Africa and discussed ways of resolving
differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Their talks were sponsored by South African President Nelson
Mandela and in the presence of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
in his capacity as chairman of the current Organization of African
Unity session.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the failure of the southern Sudanese rebel leader
John Garang to attend the talks, Bashir said "this was not the
first time that Garang avoided meeting with a Sudanese government
delegation."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his readiness "to meet with Garang at any time or
place."
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government had signed the Khartoum peace agreement
in April with six southern Sudanese rebel movements. But the
Garang faction, the largest rebel movement, boycotted the peace
move.
</P>
<P>
Mandela tried to arrange a meeting between the two Sudanese
leaders during Bashir's visit to the southern African countries,
but Garang turned down the proposal.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia still "categorically
objects" to the Baltic countries' plans to join the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said today.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Lithuania's capital Vilnius to take part in
the 11-nation summit on security and cooperation in Europe
scheduled on September 5-6, Chernomyrdin said if Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia join the NATO "there will inevitably arise
extra sources of mistrust and suspicion" in their relations with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia feels alarmed by the fact that the states of the
Baltic region are mentioned in the Madrid (NATO summit)
declaration, even though they are mentioned in connection with
future stages of expansion of the alliance and not as (states that
will) joint it immediately.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin noted "We believe that joining any bloc to ensure
the security of a state is not only a hopelessly obsolete
principle but also one that can lead to new dividing lines."
</P>
<P>
The premier said Russia is ready to do everything to build
relations of good-neighborly attitudes and cooperation in the
Baltic region.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Russia regard the strengthening of the
security of the Baltic countries as an important element of work on
a model for general and comprehensive security under a decision by
the OSCE (Organization for Security and cooperation in Europe).
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, meanwhile, expressed skepticism about the
promised reform of NATO, saying that "it is still not quite clear
what strategy the alliance has for the transformation of its
military or political structures."

<HEADLINE> French President to Visit Mauritania This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
will pay a two-day state visit to Mauritania to show his
"attachment to the African continent," said French presidential
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna today.
</P>
<P>
"Testimony to the line of particular solidarity which exists
between France and Africa, this trip will also be turned toward
the future," she said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, which is his fifth to Africa since becoming
president in May 1995, Chirac will announce a number of programs
to be offered by France to help Mauritania develop its water
processing capability, its agriculture and in its fight against
drought, said Colonna.
</P>
<P>
In the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott, Chirac will make a
speech on Friday laying out the new policy of France when
cooperating with African countries, which will be focused on the
needs of the African people and highlights the partnership between
France and Africa, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will also visit the desert region of Atar in the
northwestern African nation on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and former Prime
Minister Pierre Messmer, who was governor of Atar during the
French colonial rule in Mauritania, will accompany Chirac in the
visit.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said last week that France would adapt its Africa policy
to the great changes going on in the African continent, while
reinforcing its traditional relations with African nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that France would reevaluate its defense agreements
with a number of African countries and reaffirmed France's policy
of no interference in the internal conflicts of some African
countries, such as the Congo Republic and the Central African
Republic.

<HEADLINE> Istanbul to Build Third Bridge linking Asia and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government
announced today that a third bridge linking Asia and Europe is to
be built in Istanbul, the country's largest city.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made at a meeting of the High Planning
Council held this morning, according to the semi-official Anatolia
 News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the construction of a third bridge
aimed to cope with the increasingly growing traffic pressure.
</P>
<P>
The two bridges, the Bosphorus Bridge and the Fatih Sultan
Mehmet Bridge, across the Bosphorus Strait are not sufficient enough
to facilitate vehicles running between Asian and European sides.
</P>
<P>
The High Planning Council meeting, however, failed to announce
the concrete site where the third bridge will be built.
</P>
<P>
Instanbul's population has been increasing quickly due to
large numbers of migrants from underdeveloped eastern and
southeastern Turkey, bringing huge pressure on urban traffic.

<HEADLINE> Comoran Army Takes "Dispersuasive Action" against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Comoran army landed today
on the separatist island of Anjouan in a "dispersuasive action"
against the separatists who declared the island independent and
called for return of French rule on August 3.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Wadaane Mahamoud, the charge d'affaires of the Comoros in
Paris, said that the action is aimed at "making the separatists
under stand that one cannot return to the past."
</P>
<P>
He said that national unity and independence are "two
essential points on which the authorities cannot compromise."
</P>
<P>
He added that the Comoran troops have taken under their control
the strategic points of the island without a fight and that "the
situation is now normal."
</P>
<P>
The Comoran government announced this afternoon that the green
national flag of the Indian Ocean island nation was once again
flying on government buildings and mosques of Anjouan, replacing
the tricolor French flag which had flown there for one month,
according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
About 200 to 300 Comoran troops landed on the island at 02:00
GMT from two vessels taken from civilians, and took control of the
airport, the port of Mutsamudu and the town of Domoni by
afternoon, reported AFP.
</P>
<P>
The Comoran Foreign Ministry said today that "authority of the
state" was reestablished "without the flow of blood."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Defends Joint Maneuvers with U.S., Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said today its planned
joint naval exercises with the United States and Israel are not
directed against any other country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly news briefing, Turkish Foreign Ministry
deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that the war games will be
"a search and rescue operation" devoid of any strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that the U.S.-Israeli-Turkish joint
exercises are expected to be held in east Mediterranean off the
coast of Israel some time between November 15-25.
</P>
<P>
The announcement in June of the tripartite maneuvers prompted
severe criticism from some Arab nations, which have already been
on alert of the growing Turkish-Israeli military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa had said at a press
conference that the maneuvers "represented a negative message."
</P>
<P>
"We think that the reactions which emerged are probably based
on the fact that the real objectives of the exercise are not well
understood," Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
He added that any Arab state could join in the war games if
they like.
</P>
<P>
The deputy spokesman, however, declined to give the exact date
for the war games, saying November is "a possible time".
</P>
<P>
A Turkish military delegation will visit Israel next month to
make specific arrangements for the exercises, according to
earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Israeli military alliance have caused worry and
concern among the Arab states, which accused Turkey, a
predominantly Mulism but officially secular country, of betraying
the interests of the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Turkey signed two defense and military agreements with Israel
last year to allow, among other things, both countries' air planes
to train in each other's airspace. Turkey has also asked an Israeli
industrial company to upgrade 54 Turkish fighters.

<HEADLINE> U.S. General Stresses Need of Land Mines on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A top U.S. general on
Wednesday called the Korean Peninsula a "unique" place that should
be exempted from banning the use of land mines.
</P>
<P>
Gen. John Tilelli, commander in charge of U.S. and South Korean
troops on the peninsula, told a group of reporters that the
peninsula is "unique" because "it is an area... where hostilities
could occur."
</P>
<P>
He stress the Korean peninsula is one of the most heavily
militarized area in the world, and only a truce -- not a peace
treaty -- exists between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"It is a vestige of the Cold War," he added.
</P>
<P>
There are tens of thousands of land mines used by American and
South Korean troops in the demilitarized zone that divides DPRK
from South Korea where 37,000 U.S. troops are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Tilelli said The United States uses the land mines in the
peninsula out of "humanitarian" consideration.
</P>
<P>
"As the commander on the ground, I think protecting the lives
of the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines and civilians on the
southern side... is a humanitarian issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The general said he was pleased with the Clinton
administration's stand at an international conference on banning
land mines currently underway in Norway. Washington is seeking an
exemption for mines on the Korean Peninsula and for certain types
of mines.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there is any technical options to replace land
mines, Tilelli replied: "There is not right now a replacement
for land mines."

<HEADLINE> European Shares Slip on New Interest Rate Worries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Main stock markets in Europe
all gave up their early gains to end either lower or little
changed Wednesday, undermined by Wall Street's profit-taking and
new worries about possible German interest rate rise.
</P>
<P>
The London market, Europe's largest, had surged ahead by 1.5
percent or 75.1 points to 5,027.3,000 earlier today, boosted by
the Dow's overnight strong gains, before declining to stand only
0.5 percent, or 24.7 points higher at 4,976.9 by close.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that profit-takers shaved some of the market's
dramatic gains of the last two sessions.
</P>
<P>
The market took little notice of a weaker-than-expected UK
purchasing managers' report on services, although the survey gave
gilts a lift.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt ended 1.4 percent firmer, lifted by
New York's rally Tuesday. It closed off the top but still up 56.28
points at 4,103.65 as stronger-than- expected industrial output
data for July trimmed prices in late trade.
</P>
<P>
Stocks on the Paris bourse fell back after big gains in the
morning, as euphoria faded with the easier dollar.
Dollar-sensitive stocks were the hardest-hit. The CAC-40 index
closed down 3.23 points at 2,917.92.

<HEADLINE> Committees to Be Formed in Kenya to Speed up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The second meeting of Kenya's
Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group (IPPG) today decided to appoint
three committees to prepare recommendations on various reforms
following two-day dialogue between opposing parties.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 members of parliament attending the meeting mandated
the 13-member Co-ordinating Committee to draft resolutions for
the meeting which started here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A technical committee comprising nine Members of Parliament
from the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) and
opposition parties will make recommendations on constitutional,
legal and administrative reforms.
</P>
<P>
Another technical committee comprising five MPs from the
ruling and opposition parties will develop recommendations on the
draft electoral code and draft regulations to govern the
operations of the Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
An IPPG Committee comprising seven MPs will recommend to the
IPPG plenary meeting a collective resolution regarding the
current problems of insecurity and banditry in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Co-ordinating Committee has recommended that the dialogue
between KANU and the Opposition lawmakers be concluded in one
month time to enable Kenya's parliament enact the required
legislation before the impending general elections to be held
later this year.
</P>
<P>
The participants at the meeting unanimously endorsed a
proposal by Cabinet Minister Simeon Nyachae to extend the mandate
of the Co-ordinating Committee.
</P>
<P>
At today's session, Oki Ombaka from opposition Ford-Kenya
proposed that since the reforms dialogue is the seventh
parliament's best initiative, the committee's status should be
formalized through a parliamentary motion.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the MPs unanimously endorsed their unwavering
commitment to reform dialogue and embarked on a smooth debate on
a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
At the first meeting held last Thursday, the KANU and
Opposition MPs unanimously resolved to take up their
parliamentary roles to spearhead reform dialogue instead of the
National Convention Executive Council, an umbrella body of
opposition parties.

TEHRAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami today called for co-existence and fraternity in the
relations between Turkey and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old president made the remark while meeting with
Ali Tuygan, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel's special envoy
and Deputy Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, who delivered a
message of Demirel to the Iranian president.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides did not reveal any content of the message
or the timetable for returning their ambassadors to each other's
capital.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that exchange of views and visits by the two
countries' officials would pave the way for better relations
between them.
</P>
<P>
"We should understand that our enemies and the countries
which are against peace in the region and against strong
relations between Tehran and Ankara want to see disputes
appearing in the region, especially between such leading
countries as Iran and Turkey," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish envoy described his meeting with the Iranian
president as "useful" in solving the diplomatic crisis caused by
expulsion of ambassadors from each side in February.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara-Tehran relations became strained in February as Ankara
protested to Tehran for Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Reza Baqeri's
comments in favor of Islamic law at an Islamists rally in the
Ankara district of Sincan.
</P>
<P>
Ali Tuygan, who arrived here Tuesday night, had a talk with
Mohsen Amin-Zadeh, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for
Asia-Pacific Affairs, before delivering the message to the
Iranian new president this morning.

<HEADLINE> SADC Members Urged to Be Cautious in Choosing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) were urged today to be on alert
when assessing demands and suitability of potential investors in the
mining industry in their countries.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the SADC mining sector said in Blantyre, Malawi, that it
is important to make the access in the interest and aspirations of
their citizens because some mining companies and financiers have a
tendency of adopting hard and uncompromising stand on African
countries by adopting predetermined set of prescriptions which are
disproportionately biased, the Zambia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the press on the activities of the SADC mining sector in
the region, its coordinator John Chanda charged that investors have
been also playing down the attractive geological potential by
pronouncing physical infrastructure, security and political risk as
major factors affecting investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the light of these exploitative tendencies the SADC
committee of mining ministers approved the protocol which serve as a
vehicle for regional integration," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is necessary for SADC to commit itself to a
suitable cooperative mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Chanda said although the performance of SADC's mining industry
compared to the world mineral industry has declined due to lack of
investment in recent years, there is still scope for increasing
exploration, development and exploitation of mineral resources in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The protocol to be considered by the SADC council of ministers
Thursday is based on four principles including harmonization of
national and regional policies, strategies and programs related
to the development and exploitation of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
The protocol to be submitted to the SADC summit to be held next
Monday in Blantyre also includes the provision of information
exchange, enhancement of technological capacity, common standards,
small scale mining, environment protection, occupational health and
safety and the promotion of private sector participation.

<HEADLINE> SADC Members Urged to Invest in Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Mauritian official
urged the Southern African Development Community (SADC) member
states to invest more in the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Soobaha Fowdur, Principal Assistant Secretary of the Mauritian
Tourism Ministry, made these remarks Tuesday in Blantyre, a
southern city of Malawi while briefing the press on the operation
of the SADC tourism coordinating section under the chairmanship
of Mauritius, according to the Zambia News Agency (ZANA) today.
</P>
<P>
However, Fowdur didn't give any details on the operation of
the coordinating section.
</P>
<P>
He said that the development of tourism in Southern Africa is
hampered by the under-development of hotels, transport and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
SADC members need to invest in these three sectors if they are
to promote the tourism industry, said Fowdur, stressing that
these sectors are some of the attractions in the industry.
</P>
<P>
The ZANA quoted Fowdur as saying that some tourists in Europe,
south and north America like traveling in the SADC region but are
reluctant to come because of the "poor infrastructure" in
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The Mauritian official also urged SADC members to expedite the
proposed introduction of "univisas" to attract more tourists in
the region, which is losing foreign exchange by insisting on
tourists to have visas before they could be allowed entry in the
SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
The SADC, which was founded in 1992 and aimed at promoting
economic integration toward a fully developed common market in
the Southern Africa, pays much attention to tourism and considers
it to be a major element of the regional integration.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Major Tourist Assets Under Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's state-owned Holding
Company for Housing, Tourism and Cinema (HCHTC) announced today it
plans to sell all of its assets within a three-year privatization
process.
</P>
<P>
The company was established in 1991 with the primary objective
of organizing the sale of its portfolio of state-owned companies
(affiliated companies) to private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Currently, it has 76 assets and 16 companies, with businesses
ranging from tourism to housing, construction and industry.
</P>
<P>
In six months starting from December 1 with the opening of the
bidding process, 24 companies are scheduled for sale, Moustafa
Eid, chairman of the company, told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Eid expressed hope that by the end of 1999, all the assets of
this public company will be turned into private ownership.
</P>
<P>
The total value of the assets on sale is estimated at 5 to 6
billion Egyptian pounds (1.47-1.77 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the five-star Cairo Hilton will be sold
for 500 million pounds (147.06 million dollars), and Mariot is
valued at 1 billion pounds (294.12 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The actual sales of these assets to the international investors
will be launched at the Euromoney Conference to be held here on
September 9 and 10, said the company chairman.
</P>
<P>
The operational hotels offered for sale include several elite
names in the catering service such as Aswan Oberoi Hotel, Helnan
Shepherd Hotel and Isis Floating Hotel, said the business
sources.

<HEADLINE> US Analysts See 32-billion-Dollar Surplus in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The strong U.S. economy and
the budget deal between President Bill Clinton and the Congress
should produce a budget surplus of 32 billion dollars in 2002 that
would grow even larger, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office, the
paper said that without the bipartisan budget agreement, U.S.
budget deficits would continue unabated for at least a decade.
</P>
<P>
In their annual summertime fiscal update, nonpartisan budget
analysts in the U.S. Congress said the budget package Clinton
signed on August 5 would, as promised, help deliver surpluses in
2002 and the years immediately following. After hitting 32 billion
dollars in 2002, surpluses are expected to shrink a bit, then grow
to 86 billion dollars by 2007, the last year the budget office
examined.
</P>
<P>
But the analysts also warned that a weakened economy or failure
to live under the budget deal's spending strictures would
jeopardize those unusually healthy numbers.
</P>
<P>
A recession could add 100 billion dollars a year in unforeseen
red ink, they said.
</P>
<P>
They also said that even with the surpluses, a major problem
awaited on the horizon: the beginning of the retirement of the
huge baby boom generation late next decade, driving up costs for
many federal programs.
</P>
<P>
"Legislators will need to take substantial further action to
set the growth in Social Security and Medicare spending at
sustainable levels and to prevent spiraling deficits in the next
century," the budget office said.
</P>
<P>
The Congressional budget office had said that it expects this
year's deficit to be 34 billion dollars, down from last year's 107
billion.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government deficit has declined steadily since 1992
when it hit a record-high 290 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Protects Students Test Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today it would be a terrible mistake for the Republican
Congress to reject national testing to measure student
performance, an Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
"If there's one place politics ought to stop in America, it's
at the schoolhouse door," Clinton told a group of teachers as his
aides raised the prospect of a veto should Congress vote to
scuttle the tests.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who was on his summer vacation, drove to a teacher
orientation meeting at Oak Bluffs Elementary School in
Massachusetts to address the importance of national standards in
such basic subjects as reading, math and science and of the
voluntary testing to achieve the goals.
</P>
<P>
When the president was spoking on the subject, a vote was near
in the House on a bid by William Goodling, chairman of the House
education committee, to forbid the Department of Education to
spend any money to test fourth-graders in reading and
eighth-graders in math.
</P>
<P>
Goodling said recently, "The president's plan is a waste of
taxpayers' money and won't do anything except increase federal
involvement in our schools."
</P>
<P>
Education Secretary Richard Riley is pushing Clinton to promise
a veto of the bill, should Goodling prevail.
</P>
<P>
"The tests should not be misused but neither should we pretend
it's not needed," said the president.

<HEADLINE> US Mediator Holds Talks With Israeli Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator Dennis Ross
held lengthy talks today with an Israeli delegation ahead of
Madeleine Albright's first trip since she became the secretary of
state.
</P>
<P>
Ross and State Department officials avoided any description of
Ross's four-hour meeting with Israeli Cabinet secretary Danny
Naveh and Uzi Arad, foreign policy advisor to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to take the Middle East trip next Tuesday
and will meet leaders of Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt,
Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia and possibly Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley, replying reporters'
questions, declined to list the issues Ross and then Albright
would discuss with the Palestinians and Israelis. However, he
noted the security situation had improved since a twin suicide
bomb killed 17 people at a Jerusalem market on July 30.
</P>
<P>
Foley also called on Israel to release all taxes withheld from
Palestinian workers. And he criticized Jewish settlers who hurled
stones at Palestinian workers on a U.S.-funded road project in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Ross, Israeli Cabinet secretary Naveh
said the Palestinians had to "fight terrorist organizations and
infrastructure" before the peace process could advance.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is crucial they will take these measures and
they will take these steps in terms of fighting terrorism if we
want to see further progress in the peace process," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Ross will meet with a Palestinian delegation headed by top
negotiators Mahmoud Abbas and Saeb Erekat late this week.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have said they will not resume talks with
Israel unless it stops work on a Jewish housing project in
traditionally Arab East Jerusalem that began in March.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Minister of State in
the Prime Minister's Office, Mussa Nkhangaa, today called for an
improvement of the living environment in urban areas of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Nkhangaa made the appeal while opening a three-day consultative
meeting on City Health Plan for Dar es Salaam Health City Project.
</P>
<P>
He noted that whereas urban population is increasing at an alarming
rate, town planning does not conform to the reality of the city and
urban.
</P>
<P>
He said that urban dwellers in the country are in danger of
contracting various diseases if appropriate measures are not initiated
to improve the surrounding environment.
</P>
<P>
Most of the urban dwellers live in poor quality housing with
congested rooms, inadequate provision of clean and safe water, and
poor sewerage systems, but with no waste disposal systems in place,
Nkhangaa said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, jointly organized by the Dar es Salaam City
Commission, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Tanzanian
Ministry of Health, among other things, reviews the current health
situation in the city and the problems encountered in the provision
of health care.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Promises Compromise in Talks on N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, the leader of
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republic Army (IRA),
promised here today that his party would go into talks on the
future of Northern Ireland in a spirit of compromise.
</P>
<P>
Adams, who is on a lobbying and fund-raising tour of the United
States, told a press conference that his party would go into the
talks "in a spirit of generosity, accommodation and preparedness
to come to a compromise."
</P>
<P>
Adams arrived here Tuesday and is expected to meet with U.S.
political leaders, including National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The British government, satisfied that the IRA is committed to
a cease-fire announced in July, invited Sinn Fein for the first
time ever to all-party talks later this month in Belfast on a
settlement to years of conflict in the British province.
</P>
<P>
However, arguing that the IRA must give up their weapons, some
pro-British parties in the province, including the dominant Ulster
Unionist Party, have not yet agreed to take part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
"The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) is willing to participate in
talks with Sinn Fein/IRA if they show that they are an
ex-terrorist group by decommissioning their weapons," said a UUP
statement issued in Washington on Adams' visit.
</P>
<P>
"We see no purpose in negotiating with an active terrorist
group," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Adams said he hoped and expected that the Unionists would take
part in the talks when they open.
</P>
<P>
"We will say to them: `The door is open, your seat is here,
come and join us, come and do it on the 15th of September, do it
as quickly as possible,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that UUP leader David Trimble take part in the
talks.

<HEADLINE> Diana's Funeral Procession Route Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Buckingham Palace announced
here this afternoon that the funeral procession route of Princess
Diana would be extended and begin from Diana's London home
Kensington Palace.
</P>
<P>
The original procession route, which was from St James's Palace
to the Westminster Abbey, had been criticized as being too short.
</P>
<P>
A Buckingham Palace spokesman said that the procession plan was
changed because of safety considerations.
</P>
<P>
"We've always tried to consider a way of lengthening the route
in such a way that more people would be able to see the procession
in safety," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said that it was right that
the route was lengthened and as many people as possible involved
so they could express their sense of respect to Diana, who was
killed in a Paris car crash early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Downing Street also indicated this evening that the
presence of politicians at the funeral will be kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Blair, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott and
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook would attend the funeral, Downing
Street sources said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of Britain's main opposition parties and all the
surviving former prime ministers have also been invited to
participate.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM for Affordable Insurance Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye today urged insurance practitioners to
devise ways of making the insurance business sustainable, of high
quality and affordable by majority of the people in the country.
</P>
<P>
When launching the Tanzania Insurance Day in the capital,
Sumaye said that insurance agents and other practitioners should
utilize the existing good insurance policy and legal frame work
to attract customers by making it of good quality but affordable.
</P>
<P>
In order to get high value insurance products but of lower
premiums, the establishment of minimal standards in the conduct
of the insurance business is necessary, according to the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the practitioners to expand insurance coverage
to rural areas and middle income earners, saying the large scale
livestock keepers, crop producers, fishermen, construction
workers and other groups should be covered by the insurance
services.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye also expressed the need for promotion of regional
cooperation in the insurance industry within East Africa and
later to other parts of the region.

Li said that the Chinese side believes that past experience, if
not forgotten, can be a guide for the future, and in this way
China will look to the future and maintain friendship with Japan
for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken note of the fact that the Japanese leaders have
made it clear several times recently that they will face up to
history, acknowledge aggression, be introspective, and sincerely
apologize," Li noted, saying that that would be conducive to
maintaining the political basis of bilateral relations and helping
enhance understanding and trust between Japan and its Asian
neighbors.
</P>

"We hope that the Japanese government can provide Japanese
youth with a correct historical viewpoint in the spirit of being
responsible for history," he said
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said that the cabinet of former Japanese Prime
Minister Murayama Tomiichi said officially, concerning the
historical issue, on August 15, 1995, that Japan recognizes that,
because of its invasion and colonial rule, it brought great losses
and suffering to many Asian nations, and it sincerely apologizes.
</P>
<P>
This is the official stance of the Japanese government,
Hashimoto said, and as a cabinet member at that time, he
participated in the decision, and that he has stuck to it so far.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that he will visit the northeastern part of
China as Japanese Prime Minister for the first time to demonstrate
that he is interested in looking to the future on the basis of
correctly understanding history.
</P>

He reaffirmed that Japan will continue to take the path of
peaceful development, which is the desire of the Japanese people,
and that Japan will never take the militaristic road or become a

<HEADLINE> IMF Proposes Lower Taxes in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has called for Sweden to cut taxes and public
expenditure to reduce unemployment and boost its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The IMF board said in a report assessing Sweden's economic
policy that such measures would create more jobs in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
It said the Swedish strategy to halve visible unemployment by
expanding the educational system could hardly work -- partly
because of increased public expenditure incurred by the
educational reform.
</P>
<P>
While hailing Sweden's target of building a budget surplus
equal to two percent of gross domestic product, the IMF board
disagreed with Sweden's plan to offer elderly people early
retirement.
</P>
<P>
The board praised Sweden for the efficient ordering of its
public finances, solving its banking crisis in the early 1990's
and successfully controlling inflation.

<P>
SINGAPORE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa
said here today that he was confident that both Hong Kong and
Singapore will scale new heights of achievements in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a welcome dinner given by Singapore Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong, Tung said: "July 1, 1997 was a date to which we in
Hong Kong have looked forward to with pride and confidence."
</P>
<P>
"Pride that we at last will be united with China and to become
masters of our own destiny. Confidence that we can and will make
our city a even better place for our children and grandchildren,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong to China can not be more timely. Never
did China as a nation have such prosperity as she has today, nor
has China achieved greater recognition and dignity in the
international community as she has today," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We in Hong Kong look forward to a 21st century China which is
even more stable, open, and prosperous and a China which has taken
a rightful place among leaders of community of nations of the
world," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that a prosperous and successful Hong Kong
working under the One Country, Two System Concept in the years to
come can contribute greatly to China as she moves forward
confidently into the 21st century. We in Hong Kong, in turn, can
benefit greatly from a successful and confident China. So too I
believe can Singapore and the rest of this region," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Tung arrived here this afternoon on a three-day visit, his
first to Singapore as the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has come to Singapore to see for himself what
Singapore has achieved and that he is particularly interested in
the fields of education and housing which are key concerns for his
administration.
</P>
<P>
"Both Hong Kong and Singapore have achieved a great deal over
the past 50 years. But together, we can work harder. We can do
better. We are competitors sometimes, but other times we are very
complimentary. And it is important we continue to work together. I
am confident that both of us will scale new heights of
achievements in the 21st century," Tung said.

Goh Chok Tong said at the dinner that Singapore is pleased to
see Hong Kong prosper, and that Singapore's confidence in Hong
Kong is demonstrated in the Singapore Government's investment of
two billion U.S. dollars in Hong Kong, in addition to Singapore
private sector's investment of about 4.5 billion U.S. dollars
there.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming years, I see even greater synergy between the

the Chinese government's stance on the Taiwan issue when it
normalized ties with China. Taiwan is an inalienable part of the
People's Republic of China and the government of the People's
Republic is the sole, legal representative of China, he added, and
that Japan only maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan and
does not support "two Chinas" or Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
He told Li that Japan regards the Taiwan issue as an issue for
the Chinese people and that the two sides of the Taiwan Straits
should seek a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
Japan will act cautiously on the basis of the Japan-China Joint
Statement and the Japan-China Treaty of Peace and Friendship, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of the development of Sino-Japanese economic
ties and expressed the hope that the two sides expand co-operation
on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said they are happy to see that China and Japan
have reached a consensus in signing a new fishery agreement.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said it is good that negotiations between Japan and
China on the WTO issue had a breakthrough recently, and that Japan
will continue to support China's entry into the organization.
</P>
<P>
Li said it is good that the Sino-Japanese negotiations have had
a breakthrough on the issue and that he hopes Japan will continue
to play a positive role and will try to solve the remaining
problems in a constructive way.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to continue talks to reach a bilateral
agreement soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also spoke about Japan's proposals on co-operation in
environmental protection and energy, to which Li replied that
China is a country where the environment, energy and agriculture
are some of the most important issues.
</P>
<P>
China has always valued international co-operation and
exchanges in these areas, Li said, and the two countries can
further explore co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers agreed that a frequent exchange of
visits between the two countries' leaders is important for
increasing mutual understanding and advancing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto invited Li to visit Japan this year, and for the
invitation Li extended thanks.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, Li and his wife Zhu Lin held a banquet in honor
of Hashimoto, his wife, and their delegation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Japanese Leaders Hold Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, holding talks
today with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
said that China hopes the visit will yield positive results and
enhance bilateral ties in a healthy and steady way.
</P>
<P>
Li said he hopes the two sides discuss Sino-Japanese relations
and issues of common concern in a frank way and improve the
bilateral relationship that is based on the Sino-Japanese Joint
Statement and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 25th anniversary of normalization of
diplomatic ties between the two countries. In reviewing those 25
years, Li said that China believes the bilateral ties are good on
the whole and that the two countries' leaders have maintained
rather close contacts and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Japan have had much political, trade,
economic and technological co-operation that is important to both
sides.
</P>
<P>
The present-day Sino-Japanese relationship is the result of
efforts of the older-generation of politicians, Li said, and that
this hard-won achievement should be treasured by both sides.
</P>
<P>
He said that for historical reasons there are still problems in
the bilateral relations that shouldn't be neglected.
</P>
<P>
As long as the two sides stick to the principles of the joint
statement and the friendship treaty, and work in a spirit of
mutual respect and seek common ground while reserving differences,
and have frank dialogues and friendly consultations, these
problems can be solved in a proper way, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Both countries should develop good-neighborly friendly
relations of co-operation oriented toward the 21st century, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"To this end," Li went on, "both sides should make an effort,
take a strategic perspective of lasting interest in bilateral
ties, properly deal with the relationship, strictly follow the
joint statement and the friendship treaty, and safeguard the
political foundation for the bilateral ties."
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said his visit is an important step that is oriented
toward the future and that the Japanese government's consistent
stand is one of promoting Japan-China relations in keeping with
the joint statement and friendship treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said that a stable bilateral relationship is important for
both countries and conducive to peace and prosperity in Asia, the
Pacific and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries normalized diplomatic ties 25 years
ago, he said, bilateral relations have advanced a great deal, and
the reform and opening up in China has brought many opportunities
for bilateral cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Japanese government will continue to work
for bilateral friendship and support China's reform and opening up
drive.  More

<HEADLINE> Botswana Investigates Sex Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Allegations, published
in Zambia, that Botswana and Zamiba were conduits for children
trafficking for the international sex tourism trade were being
investigated, Botswana's permanent secretary for foreign affairs
Ernest Mpofu said in Gaborone today.
</P>
<P>
An Africa child watch report claimed 16 Zambian teenage girls
had been sent to Botwwana to await arrangements to be sent to Far
East.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Mpofu as
reporting that he had instructed police and immigration officials
to investigate a report from the Botwswanan high commissioner in
Lusaka that a farmer in Kassane, northern Botswana, a tourist
area, was involved.
</P>
<P>
There have been no previous reports in Botswana of such
trafficking, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
A farming source said farmers often encouraged young illegal
immigrants, male and female, to work on their farms and in their
homes.
</P>
<P>
The work was not a favorite of Botswana, even the unemployed.
However, if farmers were caught employing "illegals", they would
be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
The young people were poorly paid, but there had been no
reports of their being physically or sexually abused.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing,
speaking at a symposium on primary and middle-school education
today, said that every effort should be made to develop primary
and middle-school education.
</P>
<P>
It should cater to all children, he said, and there should be
less selecting of superior students and more universal secondary
education.
</P>
<P>
He said that primary and middle schools with lower educational
levels should be helped in order to narrow gaps in education, and
that they should develop students overall, including ethically,
intellectually and physically. They should focus on easing
students' burden in studies with better curricula, textbooks, and
teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
More scientific entrance exams and assessment procedures should
be used to provide a positive role in education, he said.
</P>
<P>
The quality of primary and middle-school teachers should be
improved and the education structure adjusted to create favorable
conditions for education, he said.
</P>
<P>
This needs the support of governments at various levels and of
society, which should in turn increase funding and provide
favorable policies for education, Li concluded.

Thursday's decision allowed Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve
to move a point closer to world championship leader Michael

</P>
<P>
Schumacher has 66 points and Villenueve 55 with five races left.

The 'McLaren Affair' began in practice when a petrol sample
from Hakkinen's McLaren was found to be different from that
registered with officials.
</P>

"Since 1996, we have met six times to discuss detailed
arrangements for the Annual Meetings. The discussions are very
helpful," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Seeing is believing," Ng said. "The meetings will bring an
opportunity for guests from around the world to see with their own
eyes that 'one country, two systems' is working well in Hong
Kong, Hong Kong and the Chinese inland areas are cooperating
well, and Hong Kong continues to be a leading international
business and financial center."
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong would benefit from the Meetings in a long
run. Local hotels and tourism industry will benefit immediately
from the huge number of visitors flooding in.
</P>
<P>
Ng was confident that the expenditure for the whole event would
be well controlled within the budget of 485 million HK dollars
(62.5 million U.S. dollars). A total of 70 million HK dollars
(nine million U.S. dollars) of sponsorship has been
secured.

<HEADLINE> New Paris Stadium Pitch to Be Laid Ahead of Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Workers will begin to lay the
pitch of the Stade de France -- venue of the opening game and
final of the 1998 World Cup tournament -- next week.
</P>
<P>
The work is one month ahead of schedule and it will take about
two weeks to lay the approximately 9,000 squares of grass seeded a
year ago at a nursery near Fontainebleau, south of Paris.
</P>
<P>
France's new stadium will take over all national football and
rugby union commitments from the Parc des Princes ground from its
inauguration in January.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated the 80,000-seat stadium, begun in May 1995,
will have cost 2.6 billion francs (425 million U.S. dollars) by
its completion at the end of November.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup hosts will play a friendly against Spain at the
inauguration and a week later the stadium will hold the first of
France's two home games of the season's Five Nations rugby union
championship.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Nuclear Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Scholars from the United
States, Canada and China discussed the latest developments in
nuclear medicine at a two-day symposium that closed here today.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, sponsored by a nuclear medicine branch of the
Chinese Medical Association, concerned the potential of nuclear
medicine in treating heart and brain diseases and tumors, the
major killers in the world today. Its important role in treating
diseases of the urinary tract was also stressed.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear medicine began to be used in clinical treatments in
the 1940s. It uses radio-nuclides and nuclear radiation in
diagnosing and treating human diseases.
</P>
<P>
Tomographic imaging is used in nuclear medicine diagnoses, with
radios-nuclides used to provide an image of the diseased area.
</P>
<P>
Also discussed were interventional nuclear medicine, the use of
synthetic peptides, and the radio-nuclide therapy for tumors.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Shizhen, "the father of Chinese nuclear
medicine", was honorary chairman of the symposium.

<HEADLINE> PNA Condemns Jerusalem Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua)-- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today swiftly condemned the three suspected
suicide bombings in central Jerusalem that killed at least five
people and wounded 140 others.
</P>
<P>
The PNA also called on Israel to refrain from tightening
straggling sanctions against the Palestinians as it usually did
after every terror attack.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Higher Education Hana Ashrawi described
the bombings as a "serious blow" to the already deeply-troubled
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi added that Israel should not impose sanctions against
the Palestinians in a form of collective punishment.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai ordered security
forces to reinstitute immediately the total closure of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, readily charged the PNA for not
launching a tough crackdown on terrorism and even giving "green
light" to attacks.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported that two or three suspected suicide bombers
blew up themselves in the bustling downtown pedestrian mall in Ben
Yahuda street at 3 p.m. local time (noon GMT).
</P>
<P>
Body parts clad with clothes were seen scattered on the street,
indicating the grave magnitude of the explosions.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Israel Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), which
claimed responsibility for the July 30 twin suicide bombings in the
Mahane Yehuda market in the same street, has reportedly claimed
also for today's bombings.
</P>
<P>
Israeli television showed pictures of the explosion scene in
complete chaos. A large number of ambulances arrived at the site
and police and rescue workers rushed to evacuated the wounded,
many of whose bodies covered with blood, to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem police said that among the three dead, at least two
of them were suspected to be Hamas suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
Police have sealed off the area.
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports over the number of explosions,
but it was believed that there occurred three explosions in
seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
This attack appeared similar to the one on July 30 in
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, barely one kilometer away from
today's bombing site, killing 17 people and wounding 170 others.
</P>
<P>
Israel radio reported that Netanyahu has canceled all his
scheduled activities in order to deal with the situation.
</P>
<P>
The terror attack took place just one week before the first
visit by United States Secretary of State Medeleine Albright to
the region aimed at reviving the peace process with Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel has just eased the total blockade on the Palestinian
self-rule territories early the week, which was imposed after the
July 30 bombings, to allow a limited number of Palestinians to
enter Israel.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Hong Kong Making Last Dash Preparing for WB/IMF  Annual Meetings (1) (By Chang Kefei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 4 (Xinhua) --- Hong Kong is making a final
 sprint in its three-year marathon preparations for the 1997 World
 Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Annual Meetings to be
held here in less than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Just scurrying back from an inspection at the venue -- the Hong
 Kong Convention and Exhibition Center (HKCEC) and its newly-built
 extension, Stephen Ng, head of a 100-member planning division for
 the 1997 Meetings, told Xinhua with relief: "Up to 90 percent of
the venue facilities have been completed."
</P>
<P>
Nine hundred makeshift offices, about 20 sq. m each, have been
set up at the Extension to the HKCEC within one month, said
Ng. All will be well appointed with computers, telephones and
furniture before September 10, and security checks are slated to
begin on September 12.
</P>
<P>
In addition, seven convention and exhibition halls, two
theaters and 56 meeting rooms will be put into use before and
during the Annual Meetings, scheduled for September 23 and 25.
</P>
<P>
Venue is the hardest nut to crack for Stephen Ng since the Hong
 Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government has no
official conference centers or hotels of its own and has to hire
them from private owners.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 major meetings, seminars, keynote sessions and
social events will be staged at the venue during the 10-day period
 starting on September 16.
</P>
<P>
Ng, an official of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),
leads a variety al of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),
arrangements for the meetings, ranging from venue facilities to
communications systems and to hotel accommodations,
transportation, security, airport reception, registration, social
events and cultural programs.
</P>
<P>
Security is the top priority for the most prestigious annual
event in the international financial community, which is expected
to draw 14,000 participants from more than 180 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that a bar-code system, in which computers are
installed to spot forged or stolen badges, will be used for the
first time at the entrance to the Annual Meetings'
venue. Accordingly, Hong Kong police have drawn out detailed plans
to tighten security both inside and outside the venue.

<HEADLINE> China To Increase Trade And Economic Ties With Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Wu Yi, China's Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, speaking at a conference
on Sino-African trade and economy today, said that China plans to
strengthen trade and economic ties with Africa in various ways.
</P>
<P>
She said that China views Africa as a new market with vitality
and will make a greater effort to explore it, while sticking to a
market strategy.
</P>
<P>
From a strategic perspective, Wu said, China should make full
use of Africa's natural resources and market potential to promote
bilateral trade and economic relations and improve overall
relations.
</P>
<P>
In addition to other assistance, China will increase
co-operation in trade, contract projects, labor services, and
investment, she said, adding that the African market should be
thoroughly explored, and full use be made of enterprises and
governmental and non-governmental connections.
</P>
<P>
China and Africa haven't seen any large-scale trade or economic
co-operation, she said, but since 1991, bilateral trade ties have
improved and in 1996 there was record trade worth 4 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Trade has shifted to contract projects, labor services, and
investment, helping Sino-African trade and economic relations, Wu
said. And from now on, China will offer government loans to expand
aid to Africa, encourage joint ventures and co-operative
companies, and combine aid with investment, trade and other forms
of mutually beneficial co-operation.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to the first six months of this year, Chinese
companies have signed 8.8 billion US dollars worth of contracts
with African companies.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Ecology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
called for increased afforestation and environmental improvements
that follow instructions President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li
Peng gave recently.
</P>
<P>
China's Wednesday papers published the full text of those
instructions, which called for long-term afforestation and
anti-desertification efforts.
</P>
<P>
At a forum in Beijing today, Chen Yaobang, the forestry
minister and deputy director of the National Greening Committee
(NGC), said the instructions were "mobilization orders from the
third generation of China's collective leadership with Jiang Zemin
at the core."
</P>
<P>
"These instructions ask the whole Chinese Communist Party and
the people of the whole country to go all out to improve China's
ecology and environment and for sustainable development in the new
historical period," he said.
</P>
<P>
China suffers from some of the worst environmental problems,
the minister said, and CPC leaders have attached a great deal of
importance to afforestation and improving the ecology.
</P>
<P>
"In 1991, President Jiang urged all Party members and the
Chinese people to take part in the nationwide tree-planting
campaign to green the country," he noted, and after years of
effort, China has scored great success.
</P>
<P>
"At present, attention should be paid to improving the
environment along the country's two major rivers, the Yellow and
the Yangtze, and in regions hit by wind and desertification
problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale afforestation project in many river basins,
provinces, and regions will have an effect on the country's
environment in the next century, he added.
</P>
<P>
The forum was held by the NGC and the Propaganda Department of
the Party Central Committee at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the ministries of Finance and
Agriculture, the State Science and Technology Commission, and
various departments were present. It was presided over by Xu
Guangchun, deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the Party
Central Committee.

HONG KONG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Three major tertiary
institutions, Hong Kong Baptist University, the Hong Kong
Institute of Education and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University,
signed a agreement today with Novell, a leading supplier of
network software.
</P>
<P>
Under the Master License Agreement (MLA), the universities will
upgrade their operating system to IntranetWare and implement other
network management services such as Novell Application Launcher
and Novell Replication Services.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Baptist University found that with Novell, it is able
to offer "broader and more cost-effective" network-based services
to its students and staff.
</P>
<P>
"Our university demanded a resilient network backbone and an
integrated network management facility," said Jerome J. Day,
director of Computing and Telecommunications Services Center at
Hong Kong Baptist University.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Institute of Education, which focuses on teacher
education, and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University also said
Novell provides them with fairly comprehensive network solutions.
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Wan, managing director of Novell Hong Kong
Ltd., the universities' ability to provide leading information
technology solutions to its students and staff is crucial to
providing top-notch educational services, which, in turn, are
essential in developing talents to support Hong Kong's continued
growth and competitive edge.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Retail trade figures released
today diminished market hopes for a near-term cut in official
interest rates, causing the Australian dollar to strengthen and
close just shy of 73 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended in Sydney at 72.96 U.S. cents, up from
72.72 yesterday.
</P>

Stephen Halmarick, NatWest Markets Australia's currency

strongly after the retail trade data, but then settled back around
the 73 U.S. cent level.

dollars) in June.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Newspaper Calls For Arab Unity Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi newspaper "Al-Thawara"
today called on the Arabs to get united against the
Israeli-U.S.-Turkish alliance.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, Turkey has been playing a dangerous
game which is part of a long-term U.S.-Israeli plan designed to
put pressure on nations of the region by keeping them under
constant threat of aggression, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that this plan serves no one but the U.S. and
Israel and Turkey is the loser in all cases.
</P>
<P>
"Al-Thawara" described the joint Turkish-U.S.-Israeli military
exercises, scheduled in November in the Mediterranean, as a
fresh piece of evidence that the relationship between Turkey and
Israel is a strategic political and military alliance with its
head in Washington and its arms in Ankara and Tel-Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that Israel is seeking to make Turkey to
be the second jaw of a pair of pincers to close in upon the region
by threatening or sponsoring aggression on it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is now more eager than ever to establish a military
alliance in southwest Asia with the aim of minimizing the European
Union's role in the region and strengthening Israel militarily so
as to ensure its strategic superiority over the Arabs, said the
paper.

It said that the two sides concluded negotiations on tariff and
non-tariff measures and on standards and the attestation system of
commodities, and reached an overall framework agreement on market
access to merchandise trade.
</P>
<P>
The two sides decided to speed up efforts to reach a
satisfactory conclusion on service trade as soon as possible, and
said that progress in these negotiations will further increase the
existing solid and strong friendly relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
They also reiterated that they will co-operate closely in
negotiations with the working group in Geneva to facilitate as
early an entry as possible for China into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
After the statement was issued in Beijing today, the head of the
Chinese delegation, Long Yongtu, told reporters that China's entry
into the WTO requires agreement on market access by China and all
its trade partners, in addition to the multi-lateral negotiations
in Geneva, which are looking for a commitment by China to observe
accepted international norms.
</P>
<P>
Because Japan is China's biggest trade partner, Long noted,
conclusion of this negotiation between China and Japan on market
access to merchandise trade is significant and will propel the
process of multi-lateral negotiations on China's entry into the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China is ready to follow a flexible and
practical principle which is reciprocal and on an equal footing to
continue negotiations with other countries, in order to reach
agreements with them as early as possible on the basis of a
balance between rights and obligations.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian-Syrian Trade Exceeds 130 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Trade volume between Jordan
and Syria exceeded 130 million U.S. dollars in 1996, a Jordanian
official disclosed here today.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Mustafa Khreisat, director of Jordan's
pavilion at the current Damascus International Exhibition in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Still, there is a wide prospect for expanding trade between the
two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Khreisat said trade balance in 1996 was in favor of Syria, when
Jordan imported some 90 million dollars worth of goods whereas
exports valued at about 40 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's most important imports from Syria are ready-made
clothes while cement tops Jordan's exports to Syria, he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Fell to Another Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso fell today
by 2.2 percent to another record low of 32.309 to the U.S. dollar
after the central bank decided to reduce the liquidity reserve
rate.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate went down to an all-time low of 32.43 pesos
against the dollar around midday. The volume of the transactions
reached 150 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was another setback for the peso which closed at 31.617 to
the dollar on Wednesday due to speculation arising from the
Central Bank's decision to cut the liquidity reserve rate from
eight to six percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the demand for dollars from importers and firms
with foreign exchange loans, the absence of supply coming from
portfolio investments and the slowdown of the country's economy
also fueled the fall of the peso.
</P>
<P>
Portfolio funds invested in the stock market have been flown
out of the country due to the unstable economic situation,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito announced on
Wednesday for the first time that the country would not meet its
seven-percent economic target for the year.
</P>
<P>
The economy, as measured by the gross national product, slowed
down to 5.9 percent in the first half of the year compared with
the 7.5 percent recorded in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The peso has devalued by 23 percent since the Central Bank
allowed it to float within a wider range on July 11.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Faces Thailand in U-17 World Cup Opening Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Surprise is expected tonight as
the Egyptian national under-17 team meets its Thai counterpart
here this evening in the opening match of the world championship
for the FIFA/JVC Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians will play on their own turf in the 76,000-seat
Cairo-stadium to the pride of millions of home fans. However,
tough competitions in the Group A come from Oman, Germany and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
But Thailand, reputed to be one of the dark horses in the
tournament that runs until September 21, seems to be fierce,
strong and distinguished as well.
</P>
<P>
Technical manager of the Thai team said that his boys did not
come here only to participate, but to win the match and return
home with the cup.
</P>
<P>
He added that he expects the opening match to be a surprise to
everyone, though he knows that the Egyptian team is equally strong
and one of the cup favorites.
</P>
<P>
The two teams met twice earlier before last April. At an
international tournament in Thailand, Egypt played two matches
against the host country, losing the first and winning the second.
</P>
<P>
Head coach of the Egyptian team Mohammed Ali said that the
Thais are a very strong team and plays quick football, and they
are going to be one of the surprises in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
During the team's training, the technical staff concentrated on
the two wings, and the ways to penetrate the opponent's defense
line. And in all the lectures the players have received, they
have been acknowledged with the importance of winning the first
game.
</P>
<P>
In order to decrease the stress, the players were allowed to
enjoy a movie and a rich dinner after every training course.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian team will not witness any changes in the line-up
which represented Egypt in the last encounters it played, sources
close to the team told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The tournament will be broadcast to an estimated 450 million
viewers in more than 70 countries and regions, a drastic increase
over those from 1991 in Italy, where it was aired to only 44
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Participating in this international event will be 16 teams,
representing all six football federations. They will be divied
into four groups of four playing in four cities, with the top two
from each group moving into the quarter-finals. An unprecedented
80 teams competed for one of the 16 slots.
</P>
<P>
Egypt won the coveted bid last May following a heated battle
with New Zealand to host this competition, which is but the first
of many such events to which it want to play host.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first time that this tournament take place in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
FIFA President Jaoa Havelange said earlier that the 1997 event
in Egypt will be "as good as its predecessors." He also predicted
that given the Egyptian team's strong performance in the African
Nations Cup," it could secure, if not first place, then at least
one of the top four slots.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reimposes Total Closure on Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua)-- Israel reimposed today a
total closure of the Palestinian self-rule territories after three
suspected suicide bombings in central Jerusalem killed at least
five people and wounded 140 others.
</P>
<P>
The closure order was given by Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai after he learned about the bombings, which were
claimed by the anti-Israeli Palestinian organization, the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas).
</P>
<P>
At least three consecutive bomb explosions went off in the
crowded Ben Yehuda Street pedestrian mall at about 15:00 local
time (noon GMT).
</P>
<P>
Israeli television showed pictures of the explosion scene in
the pedestrian mall in central Jerusalem, which was in chaos. A
large number of ambulances arrived at the site and police and
rescue workers rushed to evacuated the wounded, many of whose
bodies covered with blood, to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem police said that among the three dead, at least two
of them were suspected to be Hamas suicide bombers. Eyewitnesses
said they saw body parts clad with clothing scattered on the
street, indicating the grave magnitude of the explosions.
</P>
<P>
Police have sealed off the area.
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports over the number of explosions,
but it was believed that there occurred three explosions in
seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
This was the second terror attack since the July 30 twin
suicide bombings in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, about one
kilometer away from today's bombing site, killing 17 people and
wounding 170 others. As usual, the Israeli government is expected
to react strongly.
</P>
<P>
Israel radio reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
has canceled all his scheduled activities in order to deal with
the situation.
</P>
<P>
The terror attack took place just one week before the first
visit by United States Secretary of State Medeleine Albright to
the region aimed at reviving the peace process with Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has claimed responsibility for the July 30 twin suicide
bombings in Jerusalem Mahane Yehuda market that killed 17 people
and wounded 170 others.
</P>
<P>
Israel has just eased the total blockade on the Palestinian
self-rule territories early the week, which was imposed after the
July 30 bombings.

<HEADLINE> Manila Stock Exchange Urges Solution to Market Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange
(PSE) today recommended possible measures to arrest the sharp
decline of the country's stock market.
</P>
<P>
PSE President Jose Luis Yulo said that this can be effectively
done by getting government and local private funds to invest in
the bourse market, particularly when there is an outflow of
foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Despite high interest rates, some foreign funds were withdrawn
from the country due to the unstable economy, which showed signs
of a slowdown in growth in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
For various reasons, the composite index of the Philippine
Stock Exchange has fallen by 20 percent to around 2,000 points,
from 2511.5 on July 11, when the central bank announced the free
float of the Philippine peso.
</P>
<P>
Yulo said that at present local investors account for only 1
percent of the investments at the exchange, compared with 20
percent in other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said possible equities that could be tapped include the
Government Service Insurance System, the Social Security System
and other private funds.
</P>
<P>
These markets should be mobilized with a mechanism that will
enable and encourage them to buy shares whenever foreign funds are
selling in substantial amounts that may result in a sharp decline
in the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the development of funds from the local
retail investors and commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, banks should be allowed to hold stocks as part of
their reserve requirements, rather than just treasury bills which
have no real underlying value that creates wealth like what an
enterprise does," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yulo noted that taxes on stock transactions should
also be reduced back to 0.25 percent, saying documentary stamp tax
should be eliminated since the PSE is now on scripless trading.

COLOMBO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's textile and
apparel exports reached 1.78 billion U.S. dollars in the first
five months of this year and accounted for 45 percent of the
country's total industrial exports, according to the Export Broad.
</P>
<P>
During the period, textile and apparel exports recorded an
increase of 11 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, textiles and apparel have been Sri Lanka's main
export items. But at the same time, the country has been
importing, mainly from Asia, more than 90 percent of fabrics
needed by the export garment sector.
</P>
<P>
Since Sri Lanka does not grow cotton and produces little
man-made fiber, foreign businessmen are encouraged to invest in
the sectors to produce the raw materials, the board said.

<HEADLINE> China Maintains Political, Social Stability (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chen said the broad masses of the people have developed a keen
awareness and a greater ability to withstand various social risks as
the country's reform and opening drive continue to expand.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 million workers across the country have been declared
redundant, with a large number of people finding reemployment with
the help of governments at various levels and society. Chinese
people trust the government, and are willing to tide over
difficulties and share risk.
</P>
<P>
"This represents one of the most active and essential changes
in China's political and social life. This is, in fact, the basis
for confidence that China can overcome difficulties and make new
progress," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
He attributed these changes to the role of the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core in the nation's political
life.
</P>
<P>
The role of China's leadership finds expression primarily in
making policy decisions on major issues. The CPC always solicits
opinions of the CPPCC, various non-Communist parties, mass
organizations and representatives from various segments of the
community. The fact that said groups offer suggestions on major
issues and decisions has a profound impact on both the national
economy and the livelihood of the people.
</P>
<P>
Decisions are eventually implemented by the government after
being examined and endorsed by the NPC, said Chen, adding that the
said political system currently operates in line with actual life
in China.
</P>
<P>
He said the role of core leadership of the CPC over China's
political life is also reflected in the pioneering and exemplary
role of 58 million members of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Practice has proved that China's current political system is
effective, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue its efforts to introduce a socialist
market economic structure and to reform its political structure,
carry forward positive achievements and avoid mistakes in order to
score even greater achievements in democracy and a legal system,"
said Chen.

life has remained relaxed and stable from grass roots through the
highest level for a number of years, according to a senior
official from the National Committee Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinyu, deputy secretary-general of CPPCC, noted that China
has scored tremendous achievements in reform and opening up over
the past five years, with notable successes in democracy and the
introduction of a legal system, as well as economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Encouraging changes have taken place in the country's

according to Chen.
</P>

Common people in grass roots units, including factory workers,
farmers, intellectuals, traders and laborers, "are living a
relaxed life", with a constantly expanding range of employment,
self-development channels and choices, said Chen.
</P>

"People now can achieve prosperity through labor, and their
legitimate incomes are protected by law," according to the deputy
secretary-general. "Intellectuals can give a full play to their
intelligence and wisdom, and realize their ambitions, with society
providing much more opportunities than in the past."
</P>
<P>
The fact that ordinary Chinese people have been living a more
relaxed life and the democratic atmosphere has permeated social
life, coupled with a sense of security, serves as important
indicators for China's political stability and a necessary
condition for social progress, said Chen.

<P>
Chen pointed to the upper echelon of leadership by noting that
the nation's political life has remained normal and stable. The
country, under the leadership by the CPC Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at the core, has retained conventional approaches for
implementing predetermined plans for all sectors since the death
of Deng Xiaoping in February.
</P>
<P>
The annual sessions of the National People's Congress (NPC) and
the CPPCC National Committee were successfully held, and Hong
Kong's smooth return to the motherland represented a great step
towards peacefully reunifying the motherland. The 15th CPC
national congress will be convened as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Predictions that "China would surely witness chaos following
the death of Deng Xiaoping" have proved to be completedly wrong,
said Chen.
</P>
<P>
CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech
delivered at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee on May
29 this year showed that the CPC's third generation of leadership
with Jiang at the core will continue to hold high the banner of
Deng's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
"China's reform and opening policies have not changed, but
instead have been carried out in a more pragmatic manner. This
demonstrates that China's policies will not change simply because
of the change of leaders, and that the political life of the
country's upper echelon of leaders remained systematic," said
Chen.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Allow Further Fall of Peso: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
allow the peso to fall further rather than risk killing the
economy with high interest rates, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary
Cielito Habito said today.
</P>
<P>
Habito, who is also chief of the National Economic Development
Authority (NEDA), told reporters that opting for a peso
depreciation would be the "lesser evil" compared to high interest
rates that the central bank imposed to boost the peso value.
</P>
<P>
A higher exchange rate will have some negative impact in the
short term, but its mid-term effect can be positive since it can
create more jobs, especially in the export and import substituting
production sectors, Habito said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that higher interest rates will immediately
inhibit investments as it will be more difficult for new
businesses to obtain capital and even existing businesses to
invest more.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to prevent the peso from speculative attacks, the
central bank moved last month to keep its overnight lending rate
at as high as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the central bank also lowered its overnight
borrowing rate to 14 percent from a record-high of 32 percent, but
it hiked banks' liquidity reserves requirement to a five-year high
of 8 percent in order to siphon off excess liquidity in the
monetary system.
</P>
<P>
However, under the pressure of bankers and businessmen, the
central bank reduced the liquidity reserves requirement by one
percentage point Wednesday. The banking and business sectors
accused the monetary authority of sacrificing the economy for a
strong peso.
</P>
<P>
In the local currency market, the peso fell to a new low of
32.30 pesos to the U.S. dollar today, a surprising 22.3-percent
fall in its value since it was allowed to float in a wider band on
July 11, resulting in the de factor depreciation of the local
currency.
</P>
<P>
Habito said the peso depreciation should not be regarded as a
"bad thing" as it is a natural consequence of the so-called
"regional currency turmoil."
</P>
<P>
But he said prime lending rates should be allowed to drop to 12
to 13 percent or the level before July 11 "to sustain the momentum
that we have already built in the last few years."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Habito said the government will have to revise
down its economic growth target because of the peso devaluation
and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
According to Habito, President Fidel Ramos will convene an
emergency government meeting Friday to seek ways to cope with the
currency crisis.

<HEADLINE> Scotland Yard Sleuths in Paris on Diana Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- An unspecified number of agents
from the Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the London
Metropolitan Police, arrived in Paris today as ``observers'' in
the on-going investigation into the car crash which killed the
Princess of Wales last Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted police sources as saying that the
British agents met with French Criminal Brigade anti-riot police
officers and Judge Herve Stephan of the Paris Investigation Court,
who is in charge of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Judge Stephan Tuesday decided to put under judicial inquiry six
photographers and one motorcyclist for ``involuntary homicide and
involuntary injury'' and ``non-assistance to persons in danger.''
</P>
<P>
These photographers were blamed for chasing Diana on speeding
motorcycles after she and her boyfriend, Egyptian billionaire Dodi
Al Fayed, who was also killed in the crash, left the Ritz Hotel in
central Paris.
</P>
<P>
But one of the photographers, award-winning Jacques Langevin of
the Sygma agency, denied that he had participated in the chase and
said he arrived at the scene of the accident in Alma tunnel all by
accident.
</P>
<P>
Some photographers who did chase Diana that night but got away
from police were found to have sold their tapes and photos to
foreign television companies and press publishers.
</P>
<P>
Some French photographer and press groups have protested
against the legal action against the photographers who, they said,
had become scapegoats in the accident.

<HEADLINE> Bundesbank Chief Defends Remarks on Euro Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- German central bank president
Hans Tietmeyer Today defended his comments about the Euro made on
Wednesday, saying his remarks were not an argument in favour of a
delay.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before the central bank, Tietmeyer said
his comments to the weekly newspaper Die Woche on Wednesday only
meant to question what he thought to be some problems about the
startup of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were "clearly not an argument for postponing the
European Monetary Union", he insisted.
</P>
<P>
It would risk the confidence in a future common European
currency if people just talked about the number of countries which
would join in, but not the adherence to the qualification
criteria, Tietmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer was quoted by Die Woche on Wednesday as saying that
postponing the launch of the Euro from its scheduled date of
January 1, 1999 would not be a political or economic catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
"I simply cannot follow some arguments which I've heard
recently that in case of a delay of the Euro the sky would fall in
over Europe, or that the economy would fall apart," he told Die
Woche.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank president's remarks stirred up controversies
not only in Germany but also among European capitals. A Bonn
spokesman quickly stated on Wednesday that "the German
government is not having any debate" about delaying the Euro.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel today also gave a talk to
quell speculations that Bonn was now in favor of delaying the
Euro. He said any delay of the starting date for the European
Monetary Union (EMU) could mean the death of the entire project.
</P>
<P>
"The Euro must and will come punctually on January 1, 1999,
with strict adherence to the criteria agreed at Maastricht," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer's remarks come amid rising doubts over whether key
countries in the E.U., including Germany and France, would be able
to meet the fiscal criteria this year to qualify for the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty, countries wishing to join the Euro
club are required, among other things, to control their budget
deficit to less than three percent, and keep the overall national
debt below 60 percent of the gross domestic product. The first
wave of countries to join the EMU will be chosen in the spring of
1998, based on the EU states' full economic data in 1997.

COLOMBO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels are
demanding 1,000 rupees (about 17 U.S. dollars) for per acre of
land as taxes from farmers during this year's major paddy harvest
season in Batticaloa District of Eastern province, informed

<HEADLINE> Regional Strategy Being Drawn Up to Counter Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and other
countries in the region are working out a collective strategy to
counter the attacks mounted by international syndicates on
regional economies particularly the share markets and currencies.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here today by Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who described the current developments in
the region as an "economic war" waged by Western syndicates.
</P>
<P>
The Western syndicates are using the ASEAN's weakness in
defending its economies from attack as a weapon to wage lightning
raids, Anwar, who is also finance minister, told the joint opening
of the general assemblies of the Women Wing and Youth Wing of the
ruling United Malays National Organization.
</P>
<P>
He observed that even though the ASEAN is seen as "united"
economically, the economic interests of each member nation still
supersede the interests of the region as there is still
competition among ASEAN countries either conspicuously or
inconspicuously.
</P>
<P>
The attackers are aware of this weakness and their strategy now
is to launch sudden attacks against these countries one by one, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the consequences arising from the attack on the Thai
economy were not quickly seen as a smooth strategy by these
syndicates until Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore were also
affected.
</P>
<P>
The financial tumble in Thailand has affected all ASEAN
countries.

Ronaldo moved from Barcelona to Italian side Inter Milan in a

Inter paid four billion pesetas (26.1 million U.S. dollars)

a free agent.
</P>
<P>
But Barcelona are reportedly seeking a further 2.2 billion
pesetas (14.4 million U.S. dollars) as a transfer fee, whereas
Inter are said to have offered only 100 million pesetas (653,000
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Some 300,000 Facing Starvation in Papua New Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Up to 300,000 Papua New
Guineans are facing starvation due to a drought caused by the El
Nino weather pattern, which a Papua New Guinea (PNG) official
expects to last until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit areas are the highlands provinces of Enga,
Southern Highlands and Western Highlands, PNG National Disaster
and Emergency Services Director Leith Anderson was quoted by the
Australian Associated Press (AAP) as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The maritime provinces, which were devastated by Cyclone Justin
earlier this year, have also been hit by water shortages.
</P>
<P>
Milne Bay Province on the southeastern coast is being forced to
transport water from other areas, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
The drought has also led to the closure of the OK Tedi copper
mine in Western Province due to low water levels in the Fly River
stranding supply and transport vessels. Production at the Porgera
gold mine has also been slowed by the conditions.
</P>
<P>
Anderson said El Nino has caused the worst drought in 50 years,
with no sign of it abating.
</P>
<P>
"The El Nino forecast is looking pretty bleak for another three
to four months," he said.
</P>
<P>
The problem of food gardens being affected by the drought has
been compounded by recent frosts in the highlands, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
PNG Prime Minister Bill Skate has announced a 2.73 million U.S.
dollar assistance package to help the drought-affected provinces.
</P>
<P>
He said 300,000 people there are facing starvation, schools are
closed and there is a danger of a breakdown in health services.
</P>
<P>
PNG is not the only country suffering from El Nino in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Part of Australia has been under the influence of the El Nino
weather pattern, a recent world weather conference in Geneva has
revealed. Australian experts have also confirmed some parts of
their country are being affected by the weather pattern.

<HEADLINE> Australian Youth Jobless Rate Third Highest in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- About 28 percent of
Australian youth were jobless, ranking third in the world,
Australian Federal Training Minister David Kemp said today.
</P>
<P>
"It (youth unemployment) is a problem which is very serious in
international terms .... If you calculate youth unemployment as a
percentage of the total 15-24 year-old age group, Australia still
has the third highest youth unemployment in the world," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"That is a very disturbing fact and one that we should not in
any way seek to minimize," Kemp said when launching a campaign to
encourage employers to hire more youngsters.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, did not name the two countries with the
highest youth unemployment in the world.
</P>
<P>
"In Australia I believe we have become far too fatalistic about
youth unemployment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can't have a situation such as the one we've got at the
moment where some 25 percent of young people aged 24 who left
school early and haven't taken any further training, have not had
a year's continuous employment since they left school. That is
just an intolerable situation which damages the lives of those
young people."
</P>
<P>
Two programs have been launched nationwide recently to help
jobless youth get training or to spread a message across Australia
to employers to hire more young people.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show youth unemployment reached 27.9 percent
in July, compared to the 8.7 percent jobless rate for older people
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has remained high for the past decade and one of
the major domestic issues in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Australian federal government has said recently that the
jobless rate will fall as the economy has been improving with
lower inflation and interest rates.

installed at the world's most advanced airports including Denver,
Heathrow and Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The system has a number of safety features, according to
local English-language newspaper Hong Kong Standard.
</P>
<P>
Should an aircraft approach the runway too high or too low,
indicators on either side would flash white or red respectively,
warning the pilot to abort landing.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the system allows the runway to operate even
during very foggy conditions with horizontal visibility of less
than 200 meters and vertical visibility of less than 30 meters,
the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Authority estimated that more than 80 movements per
 hour could be handled by the two runways, more than double the
existing capacity of Kai Tak airport which handles 31 movements
her hour.
</P>
<P>
The southern runway was completed while the northern runway
would be in use by November next year, according to corporate
development director Clinton Leeks.

The World Bank, one of the major donors to the project, has
expressed its satisfaction with the overall status of the project

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Send Envoy to Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will dispatch a special envoy to the Middle East within the next
few days on a fresh mission to restore the peace march to its
right track, the Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the presidential envoy falls as part of Russia's
position as co-sponsor in the Mideast peace process that was
initiated with Madrid, MENA quoted a Russian high-ranking official
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Valeri Kosmain, deputy chairman of the Middle East and North
Africa department at the Russian Foreign Ministry, made the
statement on the sidelines of the ongoing seminar on the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat said that the return of the Russian envoy
to the region came within the context of recent intensive
diplomatic contacts by various parties concerned to get the peace
process off hook.
</P>
<P>
Victor Visselev, the presidential envoy, will hold intensive
contacts during his multi-leg tour to the region, Kosmain said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is keen on participating in the various diplomatic
efforts toward the activation of the peace march not only on the
Palestinian-Israeli track but also on the Syrian and Lebanese
ones," said the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
But this does not mean that they should be reactivated at the
same time, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt had received a message from Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov on Moscow's role in the troubled peace process,
which started under the co-sponsorship of Washington and Moscow in
1991.
</P>
<P>
The Russian mission is coincided with a high-profile trip by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to the region this
month. She is expected to bring a major U.S. initiative to revive
the peace process that collapsed in March when Israel broke ground
for a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In the past months, Russia has significantly lowered its
mediating profile and the United States was much criticized for
being "too passive" in breaking the impasse.

<HEADLINE> FIFA To Defray U-17 World Cup Cost Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Football
Federation (FIFA) has agreed to compensate Egypt for the huge gap
between costs and revenues of Under-17 Soccer World Championship
being hosted by the African country.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Executive Body of the Egyptian Higher Council of
Youth and Sports Abdel Menem Emara, said today that he expects the
revenues of the U-17 World Cup to reach three million Egyptian
pounds, acquired in ticket sales and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
But the cost for organizing this championship, which begins
here today and runs throughout September 21, amounted to seven
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
He said the actual fees could be much higher though total cost
will not be made available until the ten-day games are finalized.
</P>
<P>
"FIFA has promised to compensate for the difference between
revenues and costs to lift the financial burden off Egypt," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The tournament will be broadcast to an estimated 450 million
viewers in more than 70 countries and regions. This figure is a
drastic increase over those from 1991 in Italy, where it was aired
to only 44 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Participating in this international event will be 16 teams,
representing all six football federations. They will be divided
into four groups of four, with the top two from each group moving
into the quarter-finals. An unprecedented 80 teams competed for
one of the 16 slots.
</P>
<P>
Egypt won the coveted bid last May following a heated battle
with New Zealand to host this competition.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that this tournament take place in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Emara said, is capable of organizing the world soccer
championship for adults, especially after FIFA officials have
extolled its arrangements and preparations for the championship.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt has a solid and gigantic sports infrastructure that
provides it with great capabilities for hosting such
championships," he added.
</P>
<P>
FIFA President Jaoa Havelange is very supportive of Egypt's
capabilities and has the desire to have an African country host
the world soccer championship for adults, said the Egyptian
official.
</P>
<P>
Havelange said earlier that the 1997 event in Egypt will be "as
good as its predecessors." He also predicted that given the
Egyptian team's strong performance in the African Nations Cup," it
could secure, if not first place, then at least one of the top
four slots.

<HEADLINE> Qagano Defends Short Downhill Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Organizers for the Nagano
Olympic Winter Games defended on Thursday their decision to stage
the shortest ever Olympic men's downhill next February.
</P>
<P>
"The International Olympic Committee and Inernational Ski
Federation understood our position," Nagano director general
Makoto Kobayashi said.
</P>
<P>
"If the starting point had been raised the Nagano Games would
have been labeled the Games which destroyed nature," he added.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had objected to the downhill race -- the blue
ribband event of Alpine skiing -- starting higher than 1,680
meters.
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi pointed out they had never hidden the length of the
race, which will take under two minutes to ski.
</P>
<P>
"It was in our bid document," he said. Nagano won the right to
stage the Games in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But the ski federation had asked if the start could not be
raised to 1,800 meters.
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi also said they had asked Japan Railways to lay on
additional trains after 10pm to take spectators back to Tokyo
after late night events.
</P>
<P>
The bullet train, which will cut travelling time between Tokyo
and Nagano from four hours to 67 minutes, will start operating in
October.
</P>
<P>
A record 82 countries and regions -- up from 67 at Lillehammer
in 1994 -- will compete at Nagano.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy: Tung's U.S. Trip to Further HK-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. official said here
today that the forthcoming visit of Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, to the United
States would further the trade-economic relations between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
The important talks Tung will have with U.S. government
officials at the highest levels will "solidify the pattern and
pace of our future relationship," Consul-General Richard Boucher
said in an address at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Officials in Washington welcome his visit and look forward to
discussing the numerous issues which influence the ties between
Hong Kong and the United States," the senior U.S. diplomat said.
"I feel confident that those talks will establish a friendly and
solid working relationship that will carry us into the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
Tung is to arrive in the United States in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Boucher pointed out that the last American Chamber of Commerce
survey conducted before the July 1 handover showed that U.S.
business people here were overwhelmingly optimistic about Hong
Kong's commercial future.
</P>
<P>
"I might note that American interests in Hong Kong are
essentially the same today as they were before July 1: economic
and commercial involvement, law enforcement cooperation, U.S. Navy
port calls, and cultural and educational ties -- only more so," he
continued. "If anything, our interests have grown in recent
months."
</P>
<P>
According to Boucher, about 50,000 U.S. citizens now live in
Hong Kong. This means the American community here has doubled over
the past five years, he said, adding that U.S. "investment (here)
is also up."
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. consul-general pointed out, there also exist
a number of issues between the two sides and they need to be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for success in Hong Kong's efforts against the
theft of intellectual property," Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that software and video piracy not only harms
American exporters but steals from the legitimate earnings of Hong
Kong creative artists and singers and sets back Hong Kong's
aspirations to become a high-technology center.
</P>
<P>
"We also want to engage Hong Kong in the international fight
against money laundering, a crime which is naturally attracted to
one of the world's great financial centers," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong continues to be an important international hub and a
base for the development of international trading institutions,
Boucher said, noting that Hong Kong is a dynamic city which needs
to develop.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that "Hong Kong will remain the dynamic,
flexible catalyst for change which it has been in the past, and
that it will continue to change in the direction that Hong Kong
people have set for themselves, within the excellent framework of
the Basic Law and the (Sino-British) Joint Declaration."

<HEADLINE> No Golf Competition at Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Olympic Games
Organising Committee president Michael Knight said Thursday that
there would be no golf competitions for the 2000 games.
</P>
<P>
"The programme is closed. We cannot take on any more sports,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
International Olympic Committee sports director Gilbert Felli
had said on Monday IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch was
prepared to raise the question with the United States and
European PGAs at the Ryder Cup in Spain at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The Games programme will comprise 290 events, up from 271 at
Atlanta, spread across 28 sports.
</P>
<P>
Sydney, determined to stick to a maximum 10,200 participants
for the Games, has already agreed to reinsert four canoe-kayak
slalom events alongside two trampoline events incorporated into
the gymnastics timetable.
</P>
<P>
There is also to be a women's water-polo tournament, provided
the International Swimming Federation FINA gives its approval.
</P>
<P>
Knight revealed that more fans would have the chance to get to
events at Sydney following approval by the IOC of several venue
changes.
</P>
<P>
Another 176,000 tickets will be available after changes for
basketball, boxing, fencing, handball and volleyball.
</P>
<P>
This is in addition to another 144,000 seats provided by kayak
slalom (60, 000), trampolining (60,000) and possibly women's water
polo (24,000).

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Chief Urges Nigerians to Quit S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace-keeping
force (ECOMOG) which is to enforce an embargo on Sierra Leone has
urged Nigerians in that troubled country to leave.
</P>
<P>
"Total economic blockade will result in cries and hues. Those
who have families there should advise their relations to return
home," said ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu
Wednesday, quoted by press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Economic sanctions and embargo aimed to flush out Sierra
Leone's military junta which seized power in a coup in May were
ordered by the just-concluded summit of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone and the imperative for military action to
dislodge the junta led by Major Johnny Koroma dominated the 20th
ECOWAS summit which ended last week in Abjua, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The junta has not yet made formal response to the resolution
passed at the summit.
</P>
<P>
But Malu said if the coup leaders fired any shot at the
peace-keeping force, there would be bloody retaliation.
</P>
<P>
"My men will return fire for fire if the lives of my men are
threatened," said Malu, who left here for ECOMOG headquarters in
Monrovia, capital of Liberia, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops were sent to Sierra Leone in the wake of the
coup and have reportedly clashes with soldiers loyal to the junta
for several times.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Nigeria accused the junta of violating the
sub-regional resolution on the country by planning to launch
attack against ECOMOG troops in Freetown, the Sierra Leonean
capital.
</P>
<P>
"The planned attack on ECOMOG positions will be carried out
within 24 hours," said a statement issued by Nigeria's Defense
Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States has reiterated its willingness to
work with ECOWAS to resolve the political crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In a statement faxed to the News Agency of Nigeria in Abuja on
Wednesday, the U.S. Information Service said: "We look forward to
working with ECOWAS to help resolve peacefully regional issues of
mutual concern such as the crisis in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
It added that the gesture was in furtherance of the
cooperation demonstrated with the sub-region in the resolution of
the Liberian crisis which resulted in the restoration of
democracy last month after seven years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The statement praised ECOMOG for its contribution to the end
of factional fightings in Liberia, adding that "ECOWAS can take
pride in this achievement.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Issues Bill to Liberalize Power Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
issued a bill to liberalize power sector in a bid to meet set
conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced
late last month.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill called the Electric Power Bill 1997, the
private sector will be allowed to enter the field of commercial
generation of electric power, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
If passed by parliament, the bill will introduce new
provisions regarding the issuance, denial and revocation of
licenses for the generation or distribution of electric power.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for the establishment of the Electricity
Regulatory Board as an autonomous organization to regulate the
generation, supply, transmission and distribution of the
electricity and remove governmental involvement in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The bill also seeks to impose a five-percent levy on all
electricity consumers in the country to enable a fund to be set
up for supporting electrification programs in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Under one of the IMF conditions for loan-resuming negotiation,
which have been agreed on by the Kenyan government, Kenya should
improve management and push forward privatization in the power
industry.
</P>
<P>
Kenya also has to safeguard the independence of the Revenue
Authority, set up an independent and powerful anti-graft body and
ensure accountability and transparency in public finance.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has reiterated to the IMF its commitment
to making concrete measures to solve these problems as soon as
possible to pave the way for resuming negotiations over IMF aid
package arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The IMF halted 205-million-U.S.-Dollar loan package on July
31, citing high-level corruption and bad governance. The move
caused huge panics on Kenyan stock and foreign exchange markets
during the past month.

<HEADLINE> US Urged To Abide by Sino-US Joint Communiques on Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China has expressed the hope
that the United States will strictly observe the spirit and
principles embodied in the three Sino-US joint communiques on
Taiwan issue and not allow Lee Teng-hui to use any opportunity
to conduct activities aimed at creating "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang made the remark
this afternoon during a routine press conference when asked about
Lee's transit visa issued by the US.
</P>
<P>
China has made repeated representations to the US on the issue,
said Shen, adding that some Taiwan leaders may use various
opportunities and occasions to conduct activities aimed at
creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan". He stressed that
such activities harm the relaxation of relations across the Taiwan
Straits and the process of the peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Shen also touched on the question of why some people in Taiwan
want to restore talks on relations across the Taiwan Straits,
while laying aside disputes over sovereignty. He noted that the
"one China" principle has the key importance in the relations
across the Taiwan Straits and there is no room for compromise over
the principle because Taiwan is part of China, and the government
of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate
government representing the whole of China, a fact duly recorded
in United Nations resolutions and accepted by the vast majority of
countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Shen pointed out that there is absolutely no question
regarding laying aside disputes on the issue of China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.

<HEADLINE> Year 2000 Problem Hits Computers: Australian Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A computer expert with
Australia's largest company BHP claimed today that the "year 2000
problem" is already impacting on the performance of the world's
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
Michael Yastreboff, manager of the year 2000 problem for
resources giant BHP, told the Australian Unix and Open Systems
User Group Annual Conference that the problem has already started
to manifest itself in some areas.
</P>
<P>
BHP, or Broken Hill Proprietary Ltd. specializes in mining and
metalworking.
</P>
<P>
The areas to be affected include some automatic teller machines
(ATM) refusing to accept bank cards with an expiry year of 00,
which computers usually regard as the date missing, Yastreboff
said.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as warning
that the problem could affect up to 95 percent of all computer
applications in areas such as finance.
</P>
<P>
Some computers used for issuing driver's licenses have refused
to recognize any dates in the new millennium, although that
problem has since been fixed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some thermostat manufacturers have admitted that their products
will fail in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is some of the newest thermostats actually
compensate for the fact that it's winter or summer," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some prisoners (in the United States) were actually released
because in a computer their release year was 00, and the computer
interpreted that as 1900 and said 'those poor prisoners, they've
been in prison for that long'," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It actually printed some release orders, the prisoners got out
not knowing why, but I guess they're the only people who will
actually thank the year 2000 problem for something," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a similar incident which points to the problems that could
arise in 2000, two aluminum smelters, one in New Zealand and one
in Tasmania, an island off continental Australia, shut themselves
down at midnight on December 31, 1996, because they could not
calculate the end of the leap year.
</P>
<P>
Yastreboff said that around the home, equipment such as video
recorders and security systems are also liable to fail when year
2000 arrives.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's NCEC Plans to Intensify Mass Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The National Convention
Executive Council (NCEC) is committed to stepping up mass actions
and will release details of its plan to force the government to
undertake constitutional reforms before general elections.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here on Wednesday, Kivutha Kibwana,
spokesman of NCEC, announced that it would hold a peace and unity
reform rally on September 7 in Kisumu, western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He said that rallies similar to the Kisumu one were planned
for each constituency in the country to explain to Kenyans the
resolutions passed during its second plenary session held last
month.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC, an umbrella body of Opposition parties, dismissed
the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group (IPPG) talks on reforms
dialogue among members of parliament from the ruling Kenya
African National Union (KANU) and Opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The mediating team appointed last month to facilitate reforms
dialogue between KANU and the Opposition yesterday started
hearing views from interest groups.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday last week, more than 100 members of parliament
from the ruling and Opposition parties held a meeting and
resolved to form the IPPG to spearhead the reforms dialogue in
stead of the NCEC.
</P>
<P>
Before Thursday's meeting, the dialogue between KANU and NCEC
brokered by religious leaders had stalled after KANU refused to
talks to the NCEC, saying that the body was not elected.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the religious mediating team, the Reverend
Mutava Musyimi, said yesterday that "we are still watching this
development with a lot of interest and hope. We are ready to give
our contribution and should they need us, we shall be willing to
assist."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Reduce Car Duty, Increase Cigarette </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government has
decided to reduce the duty on imported cars and increase 10
percent tax on imported tobacco, Lebanese newspaper Beirut
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced after a weekly cabinet session
Wednesday by Lebanese Information Minister Bassem Sabaa.
</P>
<P>
Sabaa told reporters that the new duties will make imported
cars costing up to 20 million Lebanese liras (about 13,000
U.S. dollars) to carry a 20 percent duty, those between 20
million to 60 million liras (about 39,000 U.S. dollars) at 50
percent, and those above 60 million liras at 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government's original June measures set duties on cars
costing between 15 million liras (about 9,000 U.S. dollars) and
50 million liras (about 32,000 U.S.dollars) at 50 percent, rising
to 100 percent for the 50 million liras to 100 million liras
(about 64,000) price range, while the duty on luxury cars costing
100 million liras or more was set at 200 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sabaa said after the tax increase, the rate on imported
cigarettes will reach 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the moves came as part of the governmental
efforts to collect revenues to finance the rural development
projects and the repatriation of Lebanese refugees who had been
displaced during the civil war.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwea to Earn 470 Million Dollars from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco farmers are
expected to have sold a total of 196 million kg of flue-cured
tobacco when the selling season closes later this month, earning
them about 5.4 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (470 Million US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Tobacco Association Public Relations Director Lal
Taylor yesterday said the total production which had earlier been
estimated at 205 million kg has been revised downwards for the
fourth time this season, dashing hopes for a record crop.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the production has largely been attributed to
excessive rains which caused water-logging and leaching, she
said.
</P>
<P>
This has seen a decrease in the total earnings to farmers who
had earlier expected to earn over six billion Zimbabwe Dollars
(520 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
They are now expected to earn about 5.4 billion Zimbabwe
Dollars (470 million Dollars), almost the same amount which
accrued to them last season.

<HEADLINE> China Strives To Improve Urban Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China is to energetically push
forward urban environmental protection in a bid to improve the
urban ecology and people's quality of life, said Wang Yangzu,
deputy-director of the National Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
Wang recently told Xinhua that China has made some progress in
controlling urban industrial pollution, greening cities and
improving urban ecology since east China's Zhangjiagang was
conferred the title of "Model City in Environmental Protection"
last year.
</P>
<P>
In general, however, the country still has a lot to do in urban
pollution control, Wang noted, adding that urban green belt
coverage rate is quite low and the environmental management still
needs improvement.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed that China has to increase efforts to transform
all the cities into places with sustainable development, rapid and
healthy economic growth, a good environment and ecology, and
healthy residents.
</P>
<P>
As one of the steps toward the goal, China is to include the
yearly selection of the model environmentally-sound city into the
country's long-term social and economic development plan.
</P>
<P>
The title of "Model City in Environmental Protection" is the
country's highest honor in the field. The cities which receive the
recognition must have an overall clean environment while
witnessing rapid social and economic growth.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Drug-Carrying Ship Barred from Docking in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan authorities have
foiled an attempt by a ship suspected to be carrying over 30 tons
of hashish to offload its cargo in the country's southern beach,
the East African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
It could have been the largest cargo of hashish ever landed on
the Kenyan coast, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The ship, which was believed to try to find a suitable landing
ground for its drug along the south coast beach of Majoreni,
retreated to international waters last weekend when it saw Kenyan
Navy and anti-narcotics police waiting, said the report.
</P>
<P>
A senior governmental official confirmed the news and said the
ship remained in international waters until Sunday when it sailed
away.
</P>
<P>
The ship was first sighted in the high seas on August 26 while
at the same time a suspected Mombasa drug baron was seen driving
around the beaches where he allegedly made several stop-overs for
hashish trafficking.
</P>
<P>
An anti-narcotics team, together with the Kenyan Navy and
Kenya Wildlife Service, are pursuing the ship currently,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The whole of the Coast from Lamu Island to Vanga is now under
surveillance to ensure the ship does not anchor.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou Wednesday presented to the
council of ministers her draft law on the prevention of sexual
infractions and the protection of the minors. This law, which
follows the outline of the one drafted by her predecessor Jacques
Toubon, installs a clause on socio-judicial supervision of those
who have committed sexual infractions and have been released from
jail, as well as a requirement for them to undergo medical and
psychological treatment.
</P>
<P>
-- The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) of Algeria will announce a
ceasefire with the government within 15 or 20 days, according to
sources close to the Islamic group. Abdelkhader Hachani, one of
the three principal leaders of FIS, informed several government
personalities the decision by his movement on Tuesday. The
discussion was focused on the way for Abassi Madani, the number
one of the FIS, to make the announcement on state television.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The resignation of the president of Air France, Christian
Blanc, has become inevitable as the road for compromise has become
totally blocked between him and the prime minister's office, which
has accused him of trying to exert pressure on the government by
threatening to resign and placing his allies, particularly the
powerful Force Ouvriere union, to the center of the enterprise
committee.
</P>
<P>
Blanc had been trying to persuade Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
to let Air France open part of its stocks to the market out of
economic and commercial considerations. This demand was strongly
opposed by Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot who is backed
by the Communist Party of France.
</P>
<P>
-- The Casino supermarket chain group announced Wednesday that
it will purchase 416 supermarkets of the Franprix chain group and
241 shops of the Leader Price hard discount chain group from the
American group TLC at a value of 2.8 billion francs (466 million
U.S. dollars). This double acquisition will consolidate the
position of Casino in France and give it the second place among
chain groups in the country, after Carrefour.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels Satisfied With Accord With Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) has expressed satisfaction with a
three-point agreement it signed with the Philippine government,
the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, said
the rebels hope the agreement, which was seen as the key to their
formal peace negotiations with the government, will facilitate the
return of war evacuees to their respective places in Central
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
They also consider the agreement vital to the normalization of
peace and order in the region, the agency quoted Jaafar as saying.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by the joint government and MILF
sub-committee on cessation of hostilities Wednesday after a
two-day meeting in Cotabato City, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
It provides for the gradual repositioning of government troops
in Pikit, the southern province of Cotabato, to their positions
before June 16, when a month-long battle between the military and
MILF broke out.
</P>
<P>
It also contains provisions for the safe return of rebels who
reside in civilian villages provided they will not establish
outposts and display firearms and for the enforcement of law by
police with close coordination from MILF liaison offices in those
areas.
</P>
<P>
"If the agreement is implemented, I don't see any reason why
the evacuees will not return to their homes," Jaafar said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the two sides failed to create a
mechanism that will ensure the implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
In their two-day meeting, the two parties again failed to
discuss the ground rules for a general cease-fire agreement for
which the meeting was called.
</P>
<P>
But Jaafar explained that the negotiators intentionally set
aside the matters regarding the truce as the concern for the safe
return of evacuees to their places of origin was deemed more
immediate.

<P>
A group of resource development and infrastructure construction
projects have been launched in the autonomous regions, with the
increasing rate of the investment in both infrastructure
construction and technological renovations during the first half
of 1996 surpassing the rate for eastern areas for the first time
in history.
</P>
<P>
The central government increased its financial support to
ethnic minority regions in central and western China in 1996. In
May, it decided to allocate more than two billion yuan (230
million US dollars) in subsidies to ethnic minority regions. And
increased financial support by the central government has eased
the financial difficulties of these regions to some extent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese leaders, including President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Li Peng, have frequently visited Guizhou and Sichuan
provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
A series of projects have been launched to provide ethnic
regions with improved living conditions, science and technology,
education, information, and modern culture.
</P>
<P>
The compulsory education project introduced in China's less
developed regions in 1996 is the largest project in history
designed to relieve poverty through education.
</P>
<P>
The common goal of ethnic groups throughout China is to achieve
development and social progress. However, the economies in ethnic
regions have lagged behind the eastern coastal areas due to both
historical and natural factors.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, abundant energy, minerals, and land resources in
the central and western areas play a greater role in economic
growth in ethnic regions.
</P>
<P>
Development has opened a new world for people living in ethnic
regions. Members of ethnic groups are now equipped with new ideas
and concepts which have extended their horizons.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regions are opening wider to the outside world,
with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China forming
cooperation and trade relations with 82 countries and regions. The
autonomous region has, in fact, introduced some 700 types of goods
to the world market.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic groups in China have established equal, united, and
reciprocal relationships, and will continue to embrace common
prosperity in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
called for the submission of energy projects eligible for
co-financing under an international cooperation program.
</P>
<P>
The EU move, through the regional alliance's executive body,
the European Commission, is also designed to boost cooperation
with non-EU member countries, media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Through the Synergy energy cooperation program, which was
recently rolled over for 1997, the EU aims to secure energy supply
and achieve global competitiveness and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Apart from projects launched by EU nations, the program also
provides financial aid for projects initiated by non-EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member EU may contribute up to 50 percent of the total
cost of a selected project, which will not exceed 300,000 European
Currency Units (ECU), equivalent to about 390,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Projects may be submitted by specialized international and
regional organizations, national energy ministries, committees,
companies, financial institutions and other related organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Synergy program is due to run till the end of the year on a
temporary basis, pending adoption of the EU's medium-term
financial perspectives for the post-1999 period.

BONN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- German central bank president
Hans Tietmeyer Thursday defended comments he made in an interview

Speaking to reporters before the central bank -- the Bundesbank

Tietmeyer said his comments to the weekly newspaper Die Woche on
Wednesday were only meant to question what he thought were some
questionable arguments about the startup of the euro.
</P>
<P>
It would risk confidence in a future common European currency
if people just talk about the number of countries which would
join, but not the adherence of the qualification criteria,

<HEADLINE> China Witnesses Declining Green Peacock Population (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China's green peacock
population has dropped to around 1,000, according to a recent
investigation conducted in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The investigation, the first of its kind in the world, revealed
that Yunnan, the reputed "Home of Peacocks," is currently home to
between 800-1,000 peacocks.
</P>
<P>
Now, there are two species of peacocks worldwide -- blue and
green -- with the Chinese habitat of latter in southern, western
and central parts of Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
Historical documents indicate that peacocks thrived in vast
areas south of the Yangtze River in ancient times, but are
currently found only in Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
The peacock population has dropped dramatically since the 1970s
despite the fact that the birds have been placed under first-class
state protection. The green peacock is, in fact, classified as one
of the world's most endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Yang Lan, an ornithologist with a zoology institute in Kunming,
the capital of Yunnan Province, headed the investigation. Yang
recalled that flocks of peacock could be found throughout Yunnan
as last as the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
"I was truly disappointed that we were unable to find the birds
in most areas during the recent investigation," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Investigators discovered that many forests which were formerly
the habitat of peacocks have been turned into farmland.
</P>
<P>
"The destruction of the natural habitat of peacocks has greatly
reduced the range of the birds and has in turn resulted in
inbreeding which has weakened their ability to adapt to nature,"
according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
Poachers constitute another major threat to the peaceful
existence of peacocks, Yang said, adding that 11 birds were killed
in one remote county alone between 1980-1993.
</P>
<P>
Pesticides have also caused the death of a number of birds
searching for food on terraced fields.

BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Danish ambassador to the
United Nation recently commented that "China's successful
experience in uniting people from all ethnic groups provides an
excellent example which can be emulated by countries with ethnic
problems."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador made the remarks during a UN seminar on ethnic
problems and ethnic policies. Participants in the seminar also
responded enthusiastically to a speech delivered by the Chinese
representative.
</P>
<P>
The close unity between the military and civilians and the
unity of various ethnic groups have ensured social stability in
China's ethnic regions.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 advanced working units in the country's ethnic
regions have received high praise for close ethnic unity, with
military units garrisoned in various regions involved in the
construction of more than 30 major projects.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic regions, which account for 64 percent of the country's
total land space, have exerted strenuous efforts since the early
1990s to expand reform and develop the market economy.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the
State Council have paid great attention to economic and social
development in the national minorities' regions, and have adopted
a series of effective measures to help narrow the gap of
development between the said regions and eastern coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
The Fifth Plenum of the Central Committee of the 14th CPC
National Congress proposed five measures to narrow the differences
between the west and east.
</P>
<P>
The nation has supported economic development in major ethnic
areas in central and western China by injecting additional capital
input and launching more projects in these regions.

establishing more natural reserves for peacocks.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Southeast Asia's Export Growth to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Distressed by a continuous
turmoil in their financial markets, Southeast Asian nations may
feel somewhat relieved at the signs of an export recovery, which
could alleviate their pain of the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The grave impact of the crisis has already been felt by
Southeast Asian countries since their currencies and stocks began
to fall in early July.
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates are choking corporate expansions; weaker
currencies are raising the cost of foreign debt payments;
shrinking tax revenues are restricting government spending, and
lower consumer demand is forcing multinationals to pull back their
investment from job-creating factories and distribution channels.
</P>
<P>
But until now, most currencies in the region have not stopped
falling. On Wednesday, the Philippine currency tumbled to a new
all-time low of 31.83 pesos to the U.S. dollar. Other currencies
in the region have also dropped between 10 percent to more than 20
percent in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Though steady growth is still expected in most of Southeast
Asian countries in 1997 and 1998, economic slowdowns seem
unavoidable, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Except Singapore, economists said, all other Southeast Asian
countries which are suffering from the currency crisis would see a
slower pace of their economic growth in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to their latest forecast, Malaysia's gross domestic
product (GDP) will increase by 7.8 percent this year and 7.6
percent for next year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's GDP is expected to grow by 1.9 percent this year and
2.3 percent in 1998, while the Philippines' GDP is likely to
expand by 5.6 percent this year and 5.8 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted a 7.4 percent GDP growth for Indonesia in
1997 and 7.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, even the slower growth rates could only be achieved by
these countries through expanding their exports. Otherwise, they
would feel much pain of the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, signs of an export recovery are in sight, and most
countries in the region have reported faster export growth in the
past few months.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, merchandise exports increased 22 percent in
the first seven months to 13.76 billion U.S. dollars from 11.27
billion dollars a year ago. The growth rate was more robust than
the 17.3 percent recorded in the corresponding period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, whose trade drives two-thirds of its economy,
non-oil exports grew 6.9 percent in July from a year earlier,
exceeding the 5.5 percent predicted by analysts. In June,
Singapore registered its best export performance since May 1996
with a 8.8 percent increase in its non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Export Performance in Thailand, Indonesia and other countries
are also reportedly improving.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in the region's export performance can be
attributed to the rising global demand for electronic goods, the
major export products of Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
After a year's cyclical decline, the world's electronic market
began to show signs of a recovery in the first quarter of this
year. In the United States alone, orders for electronics and
electrical equipment rose by 12.5 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The rising demand for electronic products in the world market
would paint a better picture of the region's exports this year,
and this in turn will keep the region's economy growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
Another important factor which would stimulate the region's
export this year is the de facto devaluation of Southeast Asian
nations' currencies in the last two months, as weaker currencies
have made their export products more competitive in places like
the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
This is a good news for countries in the region after they
suffered a slump in recent years as costs rose, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
After being hit by the currency crisis, Southeast Asian
countries also adopted measures to promote their exports, such as
providing low interest loans to export sectors and establishing
export-oriented joint ventures with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
With the faster growth of exports this year, Southeast Asian
countries could be relieved of the pains of the on-going currency
crisis, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Half-Year Global Gold Demand Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Global gold demand hit a
record high of 1,493 tons in the first half of this year, up 14
percent from the corresponding period of last year, according to
statistics from the World Gold Council (WGC).
</P>
<P>
Gold demand since the start of the third quarter has stayed
strong and is expected to remain so throughout this year, an
official of the WGC's mission in Shanghai said.
</P>
<P>
He said that demand grew rapidly especially in developing Asian
countries, the Middle East, India, and Latin America, with total
gold consumption in these areas up 18 percent year-on-year between
January and June.
</P>
<P>
During the period, demand for gold rocketed 113 percent in
Turkey, 36 percent in India, 27 percent in Taiwan, compared with a
drop of five percent in the developed markets.
</P>
<P>
The WGC is a non-profit institution composed of major gold
mines worldwide. Its calculation of global gold demand accounts
for more than 80 percent of the actual need for gold.

<HEADLINE> Drama on Ancient Reformer Wins National Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A play recalling the history
of a reformer some 2,000 years ago won the "Wenhua Award" here
today.
</P>
<P>
The "Wenhua Award" is China's top honor for stage shows.
</P>
<P>
"Shang Yang," produced with a record investment of 800,000 yuan
(some 100,000 US dollars), is the true story of Shang Yang, an
official who promoted what are considered to be the earliest
efforts to unite and develop China.
</P>
<P>
Shang, a cabinet member of the Qin kingdom during the Warring
States period (475-221 B.C.), suggested that governance by strict
law would strengthen the country and add to its prosperity. He
also advocated the building of a powerful army and government, and
developing the economy.
</P>
<P>
His reform proved to be effective, as it laid a solid
foundation on which Emperor Qinshihuang built the Qin Dynasty and
united China for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The drama caused a sensation late last year when it was staged
in the Chinese capital city. Ordinary citizens, officials and even
central government leaders watched the performances.
</P>
<P>
Critics said that the drama, created by the Shanghai Youth
Drama Troupe, has expressed profound meanings through unique
artistic language.
</P>
<P>
Together with the drama, many other dramas, dances and operas
have won the award, which is presented by the Chinese Ministry of
Culture.
</P>
<P>
Many of them touch on the reform and opening up theme, as well
as the return of Hong Kong, ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said that all the works were created in 1996, a
significant period when all the artists firmly abided by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's instructions on cultural development.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 plays have been given the award since it was
established in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Slams Albright for not Making Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 4 (Xinhua) -- More and more Lebanese
officials and politicians slammed U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright for her failure to include Lebanon in her
itinerary to the Middle East, local media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Albright's tour, which is to start next Tuesday, will include
Israel, Palestinian-held territory, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese newspaper The Daily Star today quoted Lebanon's
senior Shiite cleric Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah as saying
that Albright's exclusion of Lebanon was irrelevant, because the
sole aim of her trip was to help bolster the Israeli government
led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"Our problem with America is that it always uses its power to
try to give Israel an internationally free hand through the
crimes committed against the Palestinian people and through
aggressions against Lebanon," he said during his weekly Koranic
lecture.
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the political spectrum, the opposition
National Coalition slammed Albright's decision and emphasized
that Lebanon is an independent country and should be treated as
such.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the U.S. secretary of state to include Lebanon in
her itinerary as an important leg on her tour and to open a new
page of close relations with Lebanon as an independent and
sovereign state," the party said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Member of Parliament Butros Harb insisted that Albright
should visit Lebanon as the south is the last front-line in the
Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the visit cannot be successful, practical and
fruitful if it does not include all the countries concerned in
the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
This will be Albright's first trip to the region since she
took office in January this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- "China Tourism News" reports
that rapid growth of the tourism sector has been accompanied by an
upsurge in educational endeavors.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, some 845 secondary middle schools and
schools of higher education offered at least one department
related to tourism, with a total enrollment of over 204,000 students.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 150 students across the country were involved
in tourism postgraduate studies.
</P>
<P>
Between 1980-1996, the China National Tourism Administration
sent over 300 students to the United States, Switzerland, Britain,
and Spain to study tourism. The students have returned and
are currenly serving as the backbone of the nation's tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
Tourism education has always stressed on-the-job training, with
a total of 298,849 tourism personnel across the country receiving
various forms of training in 1996 alone.
</P>
<P>
The annual national examination to certify the qualifications
of tourist guides was introduced in 1989, with a second
examination for assigning different levels adopted in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Arrives in Singapore on 1st Overseas Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, Tung Chee
Hwa, arrived here today on a three-day visit at the invitation of
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.
</P>
<P>
Tung flew in the Singapore Changi International Airport from
Malaysia, where he just concluded a two-day visit, his first
overseas trip since assuming office on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ow Chin Hock, Singapore minister of state for foreign
affairs, and Chinese ambassador to Singapore Chen Baoliu greeted
Tung upon his arrival at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Tung is accompanied by his wife Betty Tung and 13 senior HKSAR
government officials, including Miss Denise Yue, secretary for
trade and industry, and Dominic Wong, secretary for housing.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Tung will have meetings with Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Deputy
Prime Minister Tony Tan Keng Yam.
</P>
<P>
He will also be briefed on Singapore's education and public
housing policies. He will tour Toa Payoh housing estate in the
central part of Singapore and visit two families there. He will
also visit the Chinese High School.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Tung will address a distinguished audience of 400
government officials and business leaders on "Hong Kong After the
Transition" at a luncheon talk to give an update on developments
in Hong Kong since its return to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is one of Singapore's major trading partners. While
Singapore's total global trade grew by 5.1 percent in 1996, trade
with Hong Kong increased by a larger margin of 7.1 percent to
reach about 15 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Mao Zedong's Hometown in Modern Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Shaoshan, a small village in
central China's Hunan Province, has received more than 40 million
domestic and overseas visitors eager to see the hometown of the
late Chairman Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, the first group of journalists from the former
Soviet Union rode to the remote village on horseback. Now, easy
access is afforded by road or rail.
</P>
<P>
Mao's former residence has maintained the traditional style of
Chinese village houses of the last century. But opposite it is a
restaurant bustling with noise and excitement, which is named
"Mao Jia Restaurant."
</P>
<P>
In the dining area, an air conditioner blows beside a bronze
statue of the late Chairman, one of the founding fathers of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and New China.
</P>
<P>
Tang Ruiren, owner of the restaurant, said that she has opened
13 restaurants across the country since she built the first one
ten years ago. This restaurant, whose name has been registered
with local commercial administrative authorities, receives
hundreds of tourists every day.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 100 restaurants in Shaoshan, most of them
named after the late Chairman, said village official Mao Yushi,
who has been elected deputy to the forthcoming 15th National
Congress of the CPC and will soon leave for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 300 vendor's stalls hawking souvenirs and
small commodities in Shaoshan, which has only 400 households.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the tourists, there are also more than 700 people
from elsewhere in the country operating businesses in the
village.
</P>
<P>
The Memorial Park for Mao Zedong, which cost 46 million yuan
(about 5.5 million US dollars) and opened to visitors last year,
has to date brought in some 11 million yuan of returns, according
to the park's manager.
</P>
<P>
In today's Shaoshan, wide-screen color TV sets, air
conditioners, telephone sets and VCD players have become common
possessions of ordinary villagers.
</P>
<P>
"Each family in the village now has more money, and wants to
make their houses prettier and more comfortable," said Mao Qiman,
who has made a fortune through interior decoration. He bought a
car worth over 60,000 yuan just several months ago.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the per capita income in Shaoshan reached
5,200 yuan last year, making it one of the most prosperous
villages in central China.
</P>
<P>
A popular antithetic couplet in Shaoshan has reflected the
actual feeling of the villagers: Never forget Chairman Mao who
brought us liberation and thank Deng Xiaoping who gave us
prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Elaborates on Confidence in HK Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China Tung Chee
Hwa today spelled out the reasons for his confidence in the future
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Delivering an address on "Hong Kong After the Transition" at a
luncheon organized by Malaysia's Asian Strategy and leadership
Institute here, Tung said, "The first ground for our confidence is
in China: in the commitments that China has made to us, in the
prospects she holds out for us, and in the determination and
capabilities of her leaders to achieve their vision for a better
society in the next century."
</P>
<P>
Tung, accompanied by his wife Betty Tung, arrived here
Wednesday for a two-day visit to Malaysia, his first overseas trip
since assuming office on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the trust in China, "We have much else to base our
confidence on," Tung said, adding there is the solid foundation in
Hong Kong in the rule of law and that Hong Kong is blessed with a
superb civil service, has a very solid fiscal position, and
extremely strong financial reserves.
</P>
<P>
"But my greatest reason for confidence is the indomitable
spirit of the people of Hong Kong themselves," the chief executive
said.
</P>
<P>
Tung praised China's leaders for trusting Hong Kong people to
administrate Hong Kong and for pledging their full support.
</P>
<P>
"From my own experience over the last eight months, I can tell
you that the central government has given us a free hand in
dealing with our own affairs and has given us every encouragement
to succeed," he told some 500 attendants.
</P>
<P>
He said that time and again Chinese leaders have emphasized the
importance of maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity so
that Hong Kong can contribute to the modernization of the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
"Our economic interests have long been intertwined, and I
firmly believe that if Hong Kong succeeds, China will benefit. And
if China is prosperous, Hong Kong will benefit even more. This
complementary relationship provides a solid foundation on which
'one country, two systems' will work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the Basic Law, the constitutional framework for the
HKSAR, guarantees that Hong Kong will maintain its existing legal,
social and economic systems, and allows Hong Kong to keep the
existing freedoms and lifestyle of its people.
</P>
<P>
Today the leaders of China have a global outlook, they have a
clear vision of the future and have the ability and the
understanding needed to steer China successfully into the 21st
century, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Their ability and understanding make us confident in the
exercise of a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong under the 'one
country, two systems' concept," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He told the participants, "It is business as usual in Hong
Kong. Since July 1, our three branches of government -- the
Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary -- have all been
functioning normally. There have been no changes to the lifestyle
to which we have become accustomed. Our economy continues to forge
ahead. Hong Kong people are running Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's prosperity is built on the firm foundations
of a free market, free enterprise and free trade, maximum
competition and a level playing field. "None of these will change
under my administration," Tung pledged.
</P>
<P>
He said the HKSAR government's foremost task is to enhance Hong
Kong's economic vitality and sustain the economic growth that
provides the means to improve the livelihood of the people of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to create a business environment and provide an
educated, well-trained workforce, that will promote the services
sector and the development of value-added and high technology
industries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the HKSAR government will continue to provide a stable
economic environment, facilitating and not directing the market so
that the private sector can maximize its contribution and make the
best use of the opportunities available.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to encourage foreign investments and attract
multi-national corporations to come to Hong Kong. We will provide
a favorable investment climate and the necessary infrastructure to
support their operations in Hong Kong," Tung assured.
</P>
<P>
He said, "All of us in Hong Kong are confident that as we move
into the 21st century we can write wonderfully new and successful
chapters in the history of our city."
</P>
<P>
Tung is scheduled to leave here later today for Singapore, the
second leg of his overseas trip.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean MP Slams Growing Trend of Tribalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean member of
parliament Lazarus Nzarayebani has warned that tribalism in
Zimbabwe is now a "cancerous disease" which should be wiped out
completely to save the nation from disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
Contributing to debate on the president's speech in
parliament, Nzarayebani said yesterday that tribalism manifested
itself in the governance of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I am not a prophet of doom, but if there is a time
that we have reached doom it is now. It is tribalism that will
make us perish."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot build a nation when we look at ourselves from a
tribal angle. This is dangerous. Zimbabwe must begin to look at
itself as a nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said in employing anyone whether in public or private
sector, knowledge and expertise must be the yardstick.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "we must go for knowledge and expertise. If we go
for our tribal sentiments, we are killing Zimbabwe, and all of us
will lose in the process."
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "we must have a national perspective, in
particular us in government. The current situation, the current
behavwill leave Zimbabwe destitute and perpetually a third
world country."

<HEADLINE> Rebel Leader Blamed for Stalled Peace in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President General
Omar Hassan Al-Bashir has blamed the stalling of peace process in
his country on rebel leader John Garang, who was allegedly
shunning all peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia today said that the visiting Sudanese
leader appealed Wednesday to other African heads of state to help
persuade the Garang faction to step on the peace track in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Fresh efforts are underway in the war-torn country to try and
bring Garang to the roundtable, said Al-Bashir, but he did not
give details.
</P>
<P>
At the Lusaka International Airport, General Al-Bashir, who
concluded a two-day visit to Zambia, told reporters before his
departure for South Africa that "our conviction is that there is
no need for continued war in our country" following a peace
agreement drawn in Khartoum in April 1989.
</P>
<P>
Garang refused to sign the agreement, saying that it merely
served the purposes of the government, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese president added that his government had
previously reached agreements with other factions except the
Garang-led Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) which was "away"
from the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He explained that some of the causes leading to the conflicts
with those in the southern Sudan included complaints of
unbalanced development, uneven distribution of national wealth
and religious misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989 when Al-Bashir came into power, the Sudanese
government has been trying to make peace with all the
anti-government forces including the SPLA fighters, but no
progress has been made to date.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Cases Drastically Drop in Dar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Cholera cases in the
Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam have dropped drastically from
more than 100 patients per day in April to only 16 by Wednesday,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Cholera camps in Dar es Salaam are almost empty, some of them
have been closed and the rest have been left open to serve some
patients arriving from up-country.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Dar es Salaam City Commission Health Officer
Charles Kubenga as saying that the disease is disappearing in the
city as most of the recent cases were only imported.
</P>
<P>
Kubenga said that most people are now aware of the disease and
are observing hygienic rules such as boiling drinking water.
</P>
<P>
"This is a big city. We do not want to be caught unware,
because every day people, some of whom have already contracted
the disease, enter the city," Kubenga said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that the disease is still prevalent among the
population and there is a need to seriously adhere to hygienic
regulations so as to make its existence only a history.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Teachers to Go on Strike over Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- About 240,000 teachers around
Kenya will go on strike on October 1 if the government fails to
meet their salary hike demands within 28 days, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) sent the strike
threat to Minister for Labor and Manpower Development Philip
Masinde Wednesday following a crisis meeting of the KNUT national
executive council.
</P>
<P>
The union is demanding a salary increase ranging between 150
and 200 percent as recommended by the remunerations committee,
instead of 10-to-28 percent announced by Education Minister
Joseph Kamotho Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The teachers have resolved that they will not accept anything
sort of the full implementation of the recommendations" made by
the committee, said KNUT Secretary-General Ambrose Adongo
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the recommendations, the lowly paid teacher
should get a minimum of 5,640 Shillings a month, with a top bar
of 7,079 Shillings. The highest paid teacher (chief principal) is
to get a minimum of 42,240 Shillings, with a top bar of 52,246
Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Currently around 62 Shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The remunerations committee also recommended automatic house
allowance for all cadre of teachers, with the lowest being 4,700
Shillings a month up from 640 Shillings. A chief principal is to
get 35,200 Shillings a month, up from 8,700 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Others are motor vehicle, transfer, hardship, commuter and
accommodation allowances.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, under the Kamotho's announcement, the lowest paid
teacher will start at 2,405 Shillings a month, up from 1,880
Shillings. The highest starts at 21,000 up from 19,115 Shillings,
with a ceiling 25,840 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The KNUT has described Kamotho's package as an insult to the
teachers in charge of about seven million children in the
country's primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kamotho argued that the government is unable to
give the hefty pay rise and lucrative benefits the committee had
recommended because of inadequate budgetary allocations.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Chief Executive Ends Malaysian Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa left
here this afternoon for Singapore, the second leg of his first
overseas trip, after a two-day visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
During his visit here, Tung had separate meetings with
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim to brief the Malaysian leaders on the
smooth transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR chief executive also had talks with Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Transport Minister Ling Lion
Sik.
</P>
<P>
He attended a reception at the Chinese Embassy in Malaysia in
his honor during which he told foreign dignitaries and guests that
July 1, 1997, was a very special day for everyone in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"It was a day which filled our hearts with pride and
confidence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung delivered an address on "Hong Kong After the Transition"
at a luncheon here today organized by Malaysia's Asian Strategy
and Leadership Institute (ASLI) which was attended by some 500
people.
</P>
<P>
Tung told the attendants that since July 1, all branches of his
government in Hong Kong -- the executive, the legislature and the
judiciary -- have been functioning normally, there have been no
changes in lifestyle to which Hong Kong people have become
accustomed and economy continues to forge ahead.
</P>
<P>
This was the first overseas trip by Tung since assuming office
after China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen Strives to Become International Clean City (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The east China port city of
Xiamen has concentrated its efforts on becoming one of the world's
cleanest cities.
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to fulfill the goal, Xiamen will allocate
some three percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on
environmental protection during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The city, one of China's five special economic zones, has
achieved remarkable progress in pollution control, and has led the
nation's 13 pilot cities offering weekly air quality reports.
</P>
<P>
The city's forest coverage rate hit 34.3
percent in 1996, and its per-capita green area stands at
9.56 sq.m..
</P>
<P>
"I hardly recognize the city," said a tourist from Beijing who
first visited Xiamen in the early 1980s. He specifically cited the
foul odor from Yuandong Lake which previously permeated the
city.
</P>
<P>
This time, however, he expressed admiration for the park which
now surrounds the lake.
</P>
<P>
Tourists and local residents alike are highly satisfied with
the city's current environmental quality, with a recent random
sample survey indicating a satisfaction rate of 99.55 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We will never sacrifice the environment for the sake of
economic growth," said Mayor Hong Yongshi. The mayor's view is not
only the common view of the city's policymakers, but also that of
all residents.
</P>
<P>
Since the earliest periods of the city's opening to the
outside, the city has made it perfectly clear that no projects
creating heavy pollution will be allowed in Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
The city introduced its first local environmental regulation --
the "Xiamen Environmental Protection Regulation" -- shortly after
the National People's Congress granted local legislative
power.

<TEXT>
<P>
The city's generous environmental investments are rarely seen
in the country. Between 1991-1995 alone, Xianen's spending on
environmental protection accounted for 1.5 percent of its total GDP,
an amount far above the national average of around 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The city's rapid growth over the past few years is directly
related to good environment," according to the mayor, who
expressed his belief that a good environment represents wealth
which can be used to create even more wealth.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen's beautiful environment, fresh air and improved urban
infrastructure facilities have attracted a vast array of overseas
hi-tech projects. The city had approved the use of nearly 12.8
billion US dollars in foreign funds by the end of last June,
and had approved the establishment of more than 3,100
foreign-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
The influx of overseas investment has sparked the
steady growth of the city's economy, with an average annual growth
rate of 23.3 percent between 1994-1996.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen's per capita GDP hit 25,000 yuan (3,125 US dollars) last
year, a 33.3-fold rise on 1980. The city is currently listed as
one of the nation's top 10 cities in terms of overall
strength.
</P>
<P>
However, the city's environmental quality remains at
levels of the 1980s due to the pressures of rapid economic growth,
urban expansion and population growth. Nonetheless, the overall
environment has witnessed improvement rather than deterioration.
</P>
<P>
A recent assessment conducted by the National Environmental
Protection Agency indicates that the city leads the nation in
coordinating social, economic and environmental activities.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Xiamen is far from contented over its
achievements. Mayor Hong Yongshi vowed to transform Xiamen into a
modern international scenic port city with rapid and healthy
economic growth, a good environment and ecology, and healthy
residents.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Floats About Idea on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai was quoted today as saying that he is ready to
discuss a pullout from South Lebanon in order to end the bloody
confrontation there.
</P>
<P>
Israel was prepared to negotiate a withdrawal from Jezzine,
an enclave controlled by Israel in the west of South Lebanon,
and reach a peace agreement with the Lebanese in a matter of
days, the English daily The Jerusalem Post quoted Mordechai as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"We need to pursue every possible path that could lead to an
agreement, directly or indirectly, in which there will be
security and we will be outside (of Lebanon.)
</P>
<P>
"In the short or the long range we need to arrive at a
situation where we will end the conflict between ourselves and
the Syrians," said Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the remarks following the tragic death
of five Israeli soldiers, who were killed in South Lebanon last
Thursday in a brushfire caused by heavy fighting with
anti-Israeli guerrilla forces. There have been a total of 17
Israeli soldiers killed in South Lebanon's conflicts so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor party praised Mordechai's statements
about the pullout from South Lebanon, saying he had adopted
Labor leader Ehud Barak's plan for withdrawing from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been bogged down in a bloody guerrilla war with
anti-Israeli Muslim fighters in South Lebanon since the
establishment of the so-called South Lebanon Security Zone in
1985.
</P>
<P>
The heavy casualties of Israeli soldiers in South Lebanon
have led many Israelis to question the need of maintaining a
security zone, which has in fact failed to bring security to
Israel and continued increasing the death toll of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman met Wednesday with
representatives of two groups of parents of soldiers in Lebanon
who are demanding for a withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that he, too, had no patience for the ongoing
conflagration there, but that there was no alternative but to
remain in the security zone until a political solution was
found.

<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Construction of Laibin B Power
Plant of south China's Guangxi Province, the country's first
wholly foreign funded power project using the Build, Operate,
Transfer (BOT) investment practice, will begin tomorrow, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The consortium of Electricite de France (EDF) and GEC Alsthom,
which won the contract in an international bidding last year,
signed the final agreement here Wednesday with the government of
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, EDF Chairman Edmond Alphandery
and GEC Alsthom Managing Director Nick Salmon attended the signing
ceremony of the contract.
</P>
<P>
Construction on the project, which will be equipped with two
360-megawatt thermal generating units, is expected to be completed
in the year 2000. The plant will be transferred to the autonomous
regional government after 15 years of commercial operation by the
two firms.
</P>
<P>
Of the total investment which is estimated at more than 600
million US dollars, about 25 percent will be offered by the
consortium.
</P>
<P>
"The project will help satisfy the region's increasing demand
for power and reverse its excessive reliance on hydropower," said
Yuan Zhengzhong, vice-chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Proposes Further Redeployments During </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has promised further redeployments in the West
Bank on condition of the Palestinians' agreeing to an immediate
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in today's English newspaper The
Jerusalem Post, Netanyahu said that the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) should accept his proposal for the immediate start
of the final-status talks, instead of negotiating further interim
agreements.
</P>
<P>
But he added that he would not deal with the core issues, such
as Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and final borders, during the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, these issues should be settled through
the final-status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also stressed that there could be no additional
pullbacks unless the Palestinian side fulfills their commitment
to eliminate the terrorist infrastructure in their midst and
round up the alleged terrorists whose names were submitted to
them by the Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Note for Record attached to the Hebron
redeployment agreement signed in January, Israel should have
carried out the first phase of further redeployment in the West
Bank before March 7 and the final redeployment before mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
The first redeployment has been postponed because the PNA
rejected Israel's unilaterally decided scope of pullout, which
was set at 9 percent, much less than the 30 percent envisioned by
the PNA.
</P>
<P>
In response to the question about the possibility of
establishing a Palestinian state, Netanyahu said no sovereign
Palestinian state should be created because it could forge
military alliances with Israel's hostile powers such as Iran and
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the pending visit to the region by United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Netanyahu expressed the
hope that Albright's first Middle East trip would contribute to
improving the situation.
</P>
<P>
"The immediate thing we are looking for is Palestinian
fulfillment of the obligations to fight terrorism and dismantle
the terrorist infrastructure," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of peace talks with Syria, Netanyahu said he
was "encouraged" by the way Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
exercised crisis control and stopped the recent escalation of
warfare between Israeli troops and Hezbollah guerrilla forces in
South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, he dismissed as a non-starter Assad's demand that
Israel should evacuate the entire Golan Heights and withdraw to
the June 4, 1967 armistice lines.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also revealed that his most pressing concern was
Iran's rapid buildup of a ballistic missile capability, due to
what he called Russia's "unlimited and unrestricted" technological
assistance.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Reaches U.S. Open Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Martina Hingis of
Switzerland stormed into the semifinals of the U.S. Open tennis
championships in New York on Wednesday after defeating doubles
partner Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the 16-year-old two-time Grand Slam winner, will meet
American Lindsay Davenport, who fought off Jana Novotna of the
Czech Republic, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5) in an afternoon match.
</P>
<P>
Davenport upset Hingis in the semifinals of the Acura Classic
in California earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
After taking the first set in 28 minutes, Hingis won the first
four games of the second set as Sanchez Vicario, who had trouble
returning Hingis' deep ground strokes, committed 27 unforced
errors, including 15 in the first set.
</P>
<P>
Hingis and Sanchez Vicario, the second-seeded doubles team,
will be on the same side of the court Thursday when they meet
Davenport and Novotna, the third seeds, in a women's semifinal
match.
</P>
<P>
Davenport won a three-set battle with Novotna, taking the
decisive tiebreak to earn a semifinal berth opposite Hingis.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, 21, became the second American to make the
semifinals, joining 17-year-old Venus Williams, who will oppose
Irina Spirlea of Romania. Davenport had a stunning 25 break-point
opportunities and managed to capitalize only six times.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Executive Secretary of
the East African Cooperation (EAC) Francis Muthaura has urged
countries in the sub-region to start joint scientific research in
agriculture to improve farm yield.
</P>
<P>
The EAC boss made the appeal when he opened a two-day meeting
of the East African Coffee Cooperation in Arusha, northern
Tanzania Wednesday, according to a news dispatch reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura said that the future economies of Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda depend on the development and adoption of new technologies
to boost production and diversification.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "Competitiveness can only be sustained on the basis
of constant improvement and innovation of the existing capacities
and establishment of new ones as a result of research and
investment."
</P>
<P>
This is the challenge of the single market and investment area
which the EAC is committed to establish in the sub-region, said
Muthaura who maintained that joint research programs carried out
within the framework of regional integration will make research
cost-effective and for the control of animal diseases and pests
in particular.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting are from Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda.

WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Petr Korda of the Czech
Republic, who ousted world number one Pete Sampras two days ago,
was forced to quit amid his U.S. Open quarter-final against Swede
Jonas Bjorkman Wednesday because of head cold.

"One day you are up and the next really down," the 15th-seeded
Korda said of his wild swing of fortunes after walking off the
court trailing the unseeded Bjorkman 6-7 (3-7), 2-6, 0-1.

<P>
"I had a sore throat this morning. I stayed the whole day in
the bed sweating," said Korda.
</P>
<P>
The Czech player managed to put up a strong fight in the
53-minute opening set but quickly began to tire out.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman easily advanced to his first Grand Slam singles
semifinal and will meet hard-serving Briton Greg Rusedski.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents on Rise in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents have taken at
least 12,000 human lives in Russia so far this year, a National
Traffic Inspection Bureau official said.
</P>
<P>
The official told Russia's Itar-Tass news agency that traffic
violations had doubled since 1992 and among the injured were
13,000 teenagers.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase in traffic mishaps mainly to
overspeeding.
</P>
<P>
More than 4.7 million speed violations were reported in the
first half of this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Driving under the influence of alcohol is another cause for
the increase in accidents. This year 830,000 people have been
found driving after drinking, he said.
</P>
<P>
Traffic violations were pervasive even among the staff of the
National Traffic Inspection Bureau, he said. As many as 2,200
staff members have been punished for traffic violations, and among
them 377 have been dismissed and 55 are facing criminal charges.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China is making great efforts in
protecting the culture on Wudang Mountain, the most important
Taoist holy land in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the central government has allocated over 10
million yuan (1.2 million US dollars) to renovate temples on the
mountain and reinforce the buildings from flooding and storm
damage, sources said.
</P>
<P>
An archive has been formed to contain all the information about
tens of thousands of relics, which are overseen by 80 specialists.
</P>
<P>
There are now over 200 ancient temples and other buildings on
the mountain, with the oldest dating back the 7th century when the
first group of Taoists settled there.
</P>
<P>
The Ming Dynasty launched a massive renovation program in the
15th century to turn the place into an architectural showplace.
</P>
<P>
Taoism is China's only homegrown major religion, developed some
2,000 years ago by Lao Zi, who believed that "everything comes
from nothing."
</P>
<P>
The religion now has followers worldwide, and the Wudang
Mountain has been included on UNESCO's world cultural heritage
list.

<HEADLINE> PNA Requests Emergency Funds From Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has stated that it faces severe financial problem
and requests the Western donor countries to increase their aids to
the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post today quoted PNA Deputy Minister of Planning
and International Cooperation Anis Al-Qaq as saying that funding
cutbacks and delays from the donor nations will cause an
indefinite delay of salaries due for August in the whole PNA
territory.
</P>
<P>
The funding crisis has resulted in the current tour of
Planning and International Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath to
Western European nations to request emergency cash and reschedule
for pledged money to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The donor nations have been reducing their aid to the PNA. In
1995, the nations gave the PNA 400 million U.S. dollars but last
year they dispersed only 260 million U.S. dollars. The PNA had
received 60 million U.S. dollars out of 1.35 billion earmarked for
new and existing programs so far.
</P>
<P>
This cash crisis became acute after the July Jerusalem bombing
when Israel held back tax revenues meant for the PNA. The
following month, the U.S. congress held back aid as well.
</P>
<P>
Anis said the current financial crisis and the closure
imposed by Israel on PNA territories has led to severe
deterioration in the economic situation and standard of living,
and the most affected changes can be seen in hospitals and
schools.
</P>
<P>
It also has prompted a revision of the PNA's expected budget
deficit, set at 50 million U.S. dollars, he added.

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The overall performance of
China's listed companies improved in the first half of this year,
according to their published interim reports.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the calculated mean of the per share
earnings, net asset-profit ratio, and net asset value per share of
the 706 listed companies were 0.1504 yuan, 5.485 percent, and
2.602 yuan, respectively, for the first six months of the
year. All of the three indicators were a bit better than a year
ago, when there were only 433 listed companies.
</P>
<P>
The majority of companies on the top-ten board for the three
indices were listed within the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also show that the three indices for companies
listed in Shenzhen were marginally better than for firms on the
Shanghai market.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Changhong, a major electrical appliance manufacturer,
led all the listed firms in terms of core business income and net
profit. Shenzhen Development Bank topped the list of total assets,
while Jiangsu Chunlan secured the first place for per share
earnings.

<HEADLINE> China's Achievements Impressive: WB Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn today said that China's economic progress in recent
years is very impressive.
</P>
<P>
During a round-table conference with journalists from
Australia, China, India, Japan and the United States, Wolfensohn
said that the bank has carried out over 130 projects in China,
which are remarkable.
</P>
<P>
The bank has a terrific experience in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank chief dismissed Harry Wu's criticism on the
bank-supported projects in China.
</P>
<P>
"I sent out team over there and we covered every inch of where
it was we were, and Harry Wu, despite my request, has never come
to me with any evidence. He has never met with me about it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank's objective is to reduce poverty and sustain
stability and growth in the world. The bank will hold its 1997
annual meeting and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Hong
Kong, China, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that East and South Asia account for 60 percent of
the world's population while the poor in the region account for
over 70 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
But East Asia has demonstrated "tremendous growth over the last
years," close to 10 percent compounded growth, while South Asia
grew by some 4 or 5 percent during the period, Wolfensohn said,
adding that South Asia is catching up now, could reach around 7
percent in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
He noted that East Asia has now got 30 percent of the world's
total exports, becoming a major trading power in the world
today.

<HEADLINE> Indian Rupee Continues to Fall Despite Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee, pegged to
the U.S. dollar, continues to weaken despite interventions by the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Indian currency continues to be under pressure to further
depreciate because of sustained demand for the dollar from
companies and importers, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Though the RBI intervened in both the spot and forward markets,
the Indian currency was quoted at 36.51 rupees per dollar at the
end of trading on Wednesday against Tuesday's close of 36.45
rupees a dollar.
</P>
<P>
The RBI has pumped 400 million to 500 million dollars into the
foreign exchange market in the last fortnight in a bid to arrest
the volatility and keep the rupee from falling steeply against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Changing its strategy, the RBI, which had been a net buyer of
dollars, started selling dollars in mid-August when the rupee
plunged from 35.7 to 36.14 rupees per dollar overnight.
</P>
<P>
Despite the central bank intervention, however, the rupee has
been steadily going down since then.
</P>
<P>
Dealers believe that the downslide of the rupee will continue
for some time as the government decision to hike prices of
petroleum products earlier this week will have a negative impact
on the currency.

<HEADLINE> Large U.S. Bank Seeks Business Opportunities in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- First Union Corporation,
the sixth largest bank holding company in the United States, is
seeking business opportunities in China, a senior bank official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Steven J. Bash, senior vice-president and managing director of
the First Union National Bank, told Chinese reporters that a
high-ranking bank delegation will visit China later this month to
assess the possibilities there.
</P>
<P>
The bank holding company, with assets of 143 billion U.S.
dollars and loans of 95 billion dollars plus deposits of 93
billion dollars, intends to establish partnerships with China on
the basis of mutual benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will first provide services, the knowledge, the know-how
and even provide products to help them (Chinese banks) become more
efficient and more profitable," said Steven who is in charge of
the bank's International Financial Institutions.
</P>
<P>
The drive fell within the corporation's new strategy mapped out
late last year to expand its business scopes overseas. It has
opened offices in Hong Kong, Jakarta, Bombay, Johannesburg and
London and planned to set up more in Istanbul, Cairo and Sao
Paulo.
</P>
<P>
There have already been three or four U.S. banks operating in
China. Their success in establishing a foothold in fast growing
China may have prompted First Union to act more swiftly.
</P>
<P>
Steven detailed First Union's "China Strategy" as developing
joint programs with Chinese banks to increase common understanding
and to develop profitable business together, and providing
financial and advisory services to Chinese government ministries
as well as Chinese diplomatic missions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The projected joint efforts include joint calling programs on
U.S. importers and exporters for U.S.-China directed trade
activity, building capital markets and trading partnerships,
offering training programs on a full range of financial products
and services and becoming a top letter of credit bank for the
Chinese banks.
</P>
<P>
The senior vice-president said his corporation was ready to
take the possible risks, believing it is the right time to take
action. However, he almost ruled out the immediate opening of a
branch in China.
</P>
<P>
"When making investment, we know it's long-term benefit," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) signed an aid agreement here today to help Albania out of
the economic crisis caused by a bogus pyramid-savings scheme early
this year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after two weeks of examination of and
negotiation over Albania's economy recovery plan between an IMF
group and the Albanian government.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the IMF will ratify the emergency aid fund
to Albania by the end of October if the recovery plan goes well in
one month, said Juha Kahkonen, head of the IMF group.
</P>
<P>
If this aid plan works well, the IMF may possibly carry out a
three-year-aid program starting from 1998 in Albania, Juha added.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF imposed a series of conditions on the aid
package, including the privatization of the country's second-class
banks, a cut in budget deficits, an increase of value-added tax,
lowering of inflation rate and reduction of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Because of the financial crisis early this year, the inflation
rate of Albania has reached 50-60 percent and the budget deficit
accounted for 40 percent of the gross national product.
</P>
<P>
Now 1.2 million people of the 3.2 million population are living
under the poverty line, plus 300,000 unemployed.

But the White House had earlier suggested that Gujral advance
his New York trip by one week so that President Bill Clinton could
have a meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side decided to accommodate the U.S. proposal after
the White House accepted India's demand that only bilateral issues
can be discussed at the proposed summit.
</P>
<P>
The details of the summit, however, are yet to be finalized.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay to Ban Clone of Human Beings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Uruguayan government
will punish people who clone human beings by imposing two to six
years of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The bill, elaborated by the National Commission of Cloning and
adopted by the Uruguayan government on Wednesday, will be
submitted to the parliament soon.
</P>
<P>
Cloning human beings would "violate all our fundamental
principles and it is also contrary to the men's condition,"
Minister of Education and Culture Samuel Lichtensztejn said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted the bill does not mean that the Human
Bioethic Commission can not authorize studies on the generation of
human tissues and research on cancer through clone experiments.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls for Unity to Safeguard Asian Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar today called for unity
among Asian countries to safeguard the Asian interest.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial entitled "United Asia", official newspaper The
New Light of Myanmar said today that "more and more Asian nations
are becoming aware of the need for greater cohesion and
cooperation especially in the face of machinations on the part of
those who would like Asians to grow in a mould to their liking
which is not in the Asian interest."
</P>
<P>
"Those of us, who have suffered colonization under different
adventurers who exploited our natural resources and misguided the
people in line with their divide-and-rule, know all too well what
the former colonialists are up to by listening attentively to
their utterances," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
"Values and interpretations differ. What we do cannot be gauged
by a yardstick that is prescribed in the west. With the end of the
Cold War, geopolitics emerges to the fore in areas hitherto
unknown," it added.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that attempts to divide and destroy only
help Asians gain greater unity and cohesion for greater common
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The editorial came in the wake of western criticisms of ASEAN's
admission of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Laos became full members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in July, which also embraces
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Myanmar's embassy in London issued a press release,
refuting British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's recent remarks in
</P>
<P>
Singapore that Europe would oppose the participation of any
Myanmar representative in the second Asia-Europe Meeting scheduled
to be held in London next April for human rights and drug trade
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar said Cook's accusations were "unfounded,
uncharacteristic and discriminating."

<HEADLINE> China Successful With Giant Panda External Artificial Insemination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
successfully carried out the first external artificial
insemination experiment on a giant panda, taking a huge step
forward in the research on technological breeding of this
much-loved endangered species.
</P>
<P>
China has never before experimented with external fertilization
techniques on live giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
On August 4, researchers in Chengdu Panda Genetic and Embryo
Engineering Lab removed an ovary from a 17-year-old giant panda
who died from illness. Experts from two universities assisted.
</P>
<P>
They separated eggs from the ovary and fertilized them with
sperm after the maturation period.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also found many conjoined eggs in the panda ovary,
citing this as the reason for the high rate of panda twins.
</P>
<P>
The reproductive ability of the giant pandas is very low and
the area of their living space has reduced, and the number of
the giant pandas dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are only about 1,000 giant pandas remaining in
the wild in China.
</P>
<P>
Since 1953, Chinese and foreign zoos have raised a total of 132
female giant pandas. However, only 24 have given birth. Most of
female giant pandas remained childless their whole lives.
</P>
<P>
Experts here attributed the reason to cysts in the Fallopian
tubes which prevented regular ovulation.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Anju, a giant panda expert, said researchers will remove
ovum from the live pandas with the help of an abdominoscope. He
believed that in the near future, experts could use embryonal
biological engineering technology for the breeding of pandas.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Hold Emergency Economic Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
hold an emergency economic summit Friday to review its strategy on
the national economy following the current "economic storm"
stirred up by high interest rates and a volatile foreign exchange
market.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo revealed that the decision
to hold a summit was reached during the Legislative-Executive
Development Advisory Council meeting at the Presidential Palace
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was acknowledged during the meeting that "the wheels of
economic growth are slowing down," The Philippine Star today
quoted De Ocampo as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added the one-day economic summit, to be attended by
government economic managers and private sector business leaders,
was intended to "turn present difficulties into opportunities"
aside from setting policy directions.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo acknowledged that "the high interest regime may be
self-defeating," and must therefore be tackled. The economic
summit will also tackle a number of economic bills still pending
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said following a talk with Philippine Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson, there was an indication that the bank would
rethink its position on the higher interest rates, adding that the
economic summit should send a signal that the rates "should head
in the other direction."
</P>
<P>
As for the foreign exchange market volatility, De Ocampo
admitted that the government "must protect the exchange rate
against speculators, but at the same time must not unduly
interfere with the market."

<HEADLINE> Milosevic, Bosnian Serb Leaders Meet on Serb Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic met Bosnian Serb leaders here Wednesday on the current
crisis in the Bosnian Serb Republic and further implementation of
the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Serb member of the Bosnian Presidency Momcilo
Krajisnik, Bosnian Serb National Assembly Chairman Dragan Kalinic
and Bosnian Serb Government Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic,
Milosevic urged the Bosnian Serb members to actively participate
in the work of the federal government, the local newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb citizens and government should take an active part
in the coming local elections, which would help stablize the
current political situation, the Yugoslav president added.
</P>
<P>
The crisis among the Bosnian Serb leadership began in early
July, when Serb President Biljana Plavsic dissolved the parliament
despite strong opposition from it.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court ruled in August Plavsic's decision
unconstitutional, but met objection from Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic also called on Serbs to show their confidence in the
people and agencies which would effectively protect Serb
republic's interests.
</P>
<P>
He believed that it is for their own good that the Serb people
firmly implement the Dayton peace accords signed in 1995 that
ended the three-and-a-half year civil war in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> China's Auto Production Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Competition among domestic
automakers is intensifying as more assembly plants are striving
for economies of scale, today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the Changchun-based FAW-Volkswagen, a joint
venture between the First Automobile Corp (FAW) and Germany's
Volkswagen, passed State appraisal and evaluation for its 150,000
car project last month.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the 8.9-billion-yuan project initiated in 1991 has
turned out 100,000 Jetta cars. Currently, it is manufacturing
150,000 cars, 270,000 engines and 180,000 transmissions annually.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, parts and components produced auto
parts locally equally 84.2 percent of the complete "Jetta" car. In
the first seven months of this year, the sales reached 44.75
million yuan after paying off loans and interests.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the project signaled a new era for the First
Automobile Corp, which has turned into a carmaker from a previous
truck manufacturer," said the appraisal statement.
</P>
<P>
Another joint project between FAW and Audi of Volkswagen, at an
investment of 1.87 billion yuan, is expected to produce 30,000
Audi 200s by 1998. Audi 200, a model similar to Audi V6, is a type
of state-of-the-art luxury sedan. To date, 2,000 Audi 200s have
rolled off the assembly line.

<HEADLINE> Scotland to Change World Cup Qualifier to Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Scotland's World Cup qualifying
match against Belarus will be played on Sunday to prevent a clash
with the funeral of Princess Diana, the Scottish Football
Association suggested on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The match was scheduled originally on Saturday afternoon, hours
after the start of the funeral in London for princess Diana, who
was killed in a car crash in Paris last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
BBC Radio said the SFA had asked world soccer governing body
FIFA to allow the match to kick off at 1300 GMT on Sunday. And
both sides were reported to agree to the rescheduling.
</P>
<P>
Three key Scotland players, all from Glasgow Rangers, had said
they would not play if the match went ahead on Saturday while
politicians demanded action by the soccer authorities to change
the date.
</P>
<P>
Denis Law, a famous former player of Scotland, said playing the
match at the same time as the funeral could "tarnish Scotland's
image".
</P>
<P>
Scotland manager Craig Brown previously suggested a Friday
match because Belarus plays Austria next Wednesday and a Sunday
match would leave them too little time to recover.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Investment Has Great Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Japanese officials
agreed Wednesday in Dalian, a port city in northeast China, that
there is a great potential to be tapped for Japanese investment in
China, today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese figures show new Japanese investment in the first half
of this year plunged 60.42 percent to 1.21 billion US dollars
compared to the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
One reason for the decrease is China's decision to cancel
favorable tariffs on imported equipment for foreign-funded
companies. But a grace period is in place until the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors began slowing their investments in China in
1996, and this trend has not changed yet, said Ikeura Kisaburo,
Director of the Japan-China Investment Promotion Organization.
</P>
<P>
"But I believe the potential is there...and is yet to be fully
tapped," he told a conference held by his organization and its
Chinese counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Now Japan is the largest foreign investor in China. Only Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan, all part of China, have bigger investments
in the Chinese interior.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation,
indicated in her speech that a final cancellation of favorable
tariffs for foreign investors should not hinder foreign
investment.

COLOMBO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Illegal liquor claimed the
lives of 54 people by Tuesday and about 200 others seriously fell
ill after drinking the liquor in Batticaloa district of Eastern
province, Sri Lanka, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 54 died after drinking liquor purchased from a private
distillery and distributed through both legal and illegal liquor

local brew, in a distillery either in Batticaloa or in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Tamil rebels are suspected by Colombo police to have poisoned
the liquor, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said they suspected rebel involvement because on
an earlier occasion the rebels had removed several stocks from
these same liquor shops and issued contaminated Arrack.
</P>
<P>
Two persons have already been arrested in this connection and
204 bottles of the liquor were confiscated. All liquor shops in

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Serb member of the Bosnian
Presidency Momcilo Krajisnik said on Wednesday in Pale that
Bosnian Serb people will never shield any real war criminals, the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Elizabet Ren, special representative of the
United Nations Human Rights Issue, Krajisnik said the Bosnian Serb
people thought that the Hague International Tribunal has unfairly
put their national heros on the list of suspects.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik also hoped that Ren will act as an international
mediator and contact with former Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan
Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, which he said would pave the way to
break the deadlock.

BANGKOK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A no-confidence motion will be
filed Monday with Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh as the only
target, opposition leader Chuan Leekpai said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached Wednesday at a meeting of leaders of

The censure is expected to take place in the last week of this

<P>
By political etiquette of the country, if the prime minister
does not receive a vote of confidence, the administration chief
and his cabinet will resign. The prime minister can also choose to

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Stocks Gain Ground, Rupiah Stable on New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's stock prices
gained ground Wednesday and the rupiah stabilized following a
government announcement on plans to lift foreign portfolio
ownership limits and gradually decrease interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Stockbrokers said today share prices on the Jakarta Stock
Exchange rose 7 percent Wednesday, the first rise since August 27,
with the composite index jumping 33.57 points to close at 512.58.
</P>
<P>
The stock market lost 31 percent from its peak level on July 8
when the composite index reached 740.88 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said Wednesday's largest intra-day increase since July
8 was in response to the government's reform package announcement.
</P>
<P>
The government Wednesday announced a series of restructuring
measures aimed at enforcing economic stability following the
rupiah's depreciation against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said Wednesday the government
will revise its budget, liberalize foreign purchase of shares,
strengthen the banking industry and raise the luxury sales tax on
several goods.
</P>
<P>
Most securities analysts agreed the government's planned
measures would help enliven investors' confidence in the country's
capital market, but that would not be enough.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement also helped prevent the rupiah from
further falling against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah, which opened at 3,000/3,040 against the dollar,
dropped to a day low of 3,070 but soon recovered following the
announcement to close at 3,025/3,045.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said trading was slow and volume was thin throughout
the day, with the rupiah continuing to suffer from sustained
weakness in the region.
</P>
<P>
They said a strong recovery in the stock market might have
improved sentiment, but further falls in the Thai bath and the
Malaysian ringgit kept the rupiah below the 3,000 level.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's rupiah, like other regional currencies, has come
under fierce speculative attacks following de factor devaluation
of the Thai bath and the Philippine peso in July.

<HEADLINE> China Remains Ideal Place for Overseas Investment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China remains one of the
favorite places for overseas investment, in spite of the fact that
the influx of foreign funds has slowed down this year, economists
here said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China had approved more than 290,000
overseas-funded businesses by the end of June, which have actually
used a total of 197.9 billion US dollars. Nearly 140,000
of the firms are already in operation and doing well, employing
some 17 million workers.
</P>
<P>
For four years China has ranked second in the world for using
overseas investment, next to the United States. By now, more than
200 of the world's top 500 multinational corporations have opened
business in China.
</P>
<P>
China will expand the areas and scale for overseas investment,
following the principle of "using overseas investment actively,
rationally and effectively," said Shi Guangsheng, vice-minister of
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec).
</P>
<P>
Direct investment, loans, investment in securities, and other
forms of investment in China from the rest of the world have
added up to 300 billion US dollars. And China has become one of
the world's most attractive investment markets, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 years of reform and opening up have brought the
potential China market into a reality. The Asian-Pacific region is
the fastest-growing economy in the world, whereas China, a major
contributor to this phenomenon, has made itself a hot spot for
overseas investment in the process.
</P>
<P>
A recent World Bank report estimated that China would need 280
billion US dollars in the next five years for its infrastructure,
much of which would be foreign funds. This shows that China will
be the world's largest infrastructure investment market.
</P>
<P>
China is seeking overseas financing for its infrastructure
projects, such as the Three Gorges Dam and the Beijing-Shanghai
Expressway which alone will require more than 10 billion US
dollars, according to the State Planning Commission.

<P>
The 1.2 billion population itself offers a great consumer
market, while the improving living standards will further increase
people's purchasing power, thus opening more opportunities for
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
China this year began to shift to a quality vs. quantity
strategy in using overseas capital. As a result, the number of
newly approved solely foreign owned businesses exceeded that of
Sino-overseas joint ventures, and the number of large and key
projects approved by the State Council was on the rise.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, the amount of contractual
overseas investment went down on a year-on-year basis, but the
volume of overseas investment actually used still increased
by 1.49 percent.
</P>
<P>
China's readjustment on tax policies for overseas-funded
enterprises affected the flow of foreign capital. But most
importantly, China has been taking steps to boost the use of
overseas investment to a higher level to meet the needs of its
industrial improvement, at a time when the country is undergoing a
transition in the mode of economic growth from extensive to
intensive, explained Ma Xiuhong, a Moftec official.
</P>
<P>
China's macro-economic performance has entered the best period
of high increase and low inflation since the 1990s. Its exports
are reporting good records, with foreign currency reserves
topping 120 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that China's market advantages also lie in an improved
legal system which is to guarantee fair competition. More than
20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have adopted
policies and regulations to protect the rights and interests of
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Statistics Bureau, more than half the
world's multinational firms have listed China as their first
choice for investment.

<HEADLINE> Italian Prosecutors Seek Arrest of Former Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Anti-corruption investigators
from Milan today filed a request with the Justice Ministry for
authorization to arrest former defense minister Cesare Previti on
corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
Previti, a top Roma lawyer and close friend of media baron
Silvio Berlusconi, held the defense portfolio in Berlusconi's
government in May-December, 1994. He is the most senior serving
politician to face arrest since prosecutors moved on the then
Health Minister Francesco De Lorenzo in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The former defense minister said in a statement that he had
committed no crime and should not be arrested.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no justification for the request," said
Previti.
</P>
<P>
Under Italian law, magistrates must make a formal request to
parliament if they want to take a member into custody. "The
ministry's only role is to forward the authorization request to
the appropriate chamber immediately," a Justice Ministry official
said.
</P>
<P>
Ignazio La Russa, chairman of the parliamentary commission that
will initially examine the arrest request, said it would take
between seven and 10 days to study the matter.
</P>
<P>
The full lower house of parliament will then have to vote on
the commission's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said the Milanese magistrates are charging
Previti with the corruption of an ex-judge, 71-year-old Renato
Squillante, formerly head of the preliminary investigations
magistrates in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Squillante allegedly accepted bribes to fix sentences,
especially in the IMI-Rovelli case in which the Rovelli family
allegedly paid 42 million U.S. dollars to fix the outcome of a
marathon civil case in which the late oil magnate, Nino Rovelli,
was suing the investment bank IMI (Istitito Mobiliare Italiano).
</P>
<P>
The funds were allegedly paid over to Previti, a lawyer for
Berlusconi's Fininvest empire, another Fininvest lawyer, Giovanni
Acampora, and civil lawyer Attilio Pacfiico.
</P>
<P>
Magistrates were told by one of the sons, Felice Rovelli, that
he paid the three lawyers on the express death-bed wishes of his
father, who died in 1990. Milan's "Clean Hands" prosecutors,
however, are reportedly convinced the heir played an active role
in the episode of corruption and was not merely carrying out his
father's wishes.
</P>
<P>
On May 17 last year, Acampora was arrested under a warrant
issued by prosecutors investigating Squillante in another case in
which he is accused of taking bribes to fix sentences in favor of
Fininvest.
</P>
<P>
Squillante was arrested on March 12 last year on orders of
Milan Clean Hands prosecutors and charged with corruption after a
witness told investigators the judge had taken bribes to fix
sentences.
</P>
<P>
Those bribes were reportedly paid by the civil attorney,
Pacifico, who was arrested, released to house arrest and then hit
by another arrest warrant on May 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The case in question started in 1982 and had not been settled
when Nino Rovelli died in 1990. It went to the supreme Cassation
Court twice and to the Constitutional Court, and at a key moment
an important file disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The case was finally settled in favor of Nino Rovelli's wife
and children, who lived in Switzerland, for a total of 980.2
billion lire (now 587 million U.S. dollars), including interest on
the original sum and legal costs.

<HEADLINE> China to Dam Yangtze at Three Gorges in November (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China will lock the main
stream of the Yangtze River at the Three Gorges in early November,
announced Lu Youmei, general manager of China Yangtze Three Gorges
Project Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"Normally, the damming a river might be done in a dry season,
which falls between late January and late February each year, with
reduced water flow and drop that helps to alleviate the difficulty
of locking," said Lu, also deputy head of Three Gorges Project
Construction Committee under the State Council, the country's
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"But to lock the Yangtze at the Three Gorges, it is necessary
not only to take water flow and drop into account, but also to
remember that after the locking, there should be enough time to
build two cofferdams to required heights before next May, when the
flood season of 1998 begins," Lu stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, it would have catastrophic consequences on the
construction of the entire Three Gorges Dam Project," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges project, which began in December of 1994, is
situated on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and is a major
part of China's effort to develop its longest river.
</P>
<P>
It will help prevent flooding along the Yangtze, and its
annual power output will reach 84.7 billion kwh. The entire
Three Gorges water control dam project will take 17 years to
complete.

<HEADLINE> Mechanism Underlying "Mad Cow" Disease Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Researchers studying the human
form of the "mad cow" disease said they have found out how it
travels through the body and replicates before attacking the
brain, which could be the first step to give "mad cow" disease its
scientific name, ANSA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Italian researcher, Adriano Aguzzi, together with other
scientists in his team at Zurich University's Institute of
Neuropathology said the discovery could help find effective
treatment for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human disorder linked
to the BSE, or bovine spongiform encephalography.
</P>
<P>
"It's early to draw conclusions," Aguzzi said, "and we don't
know whether we'll find a cure for this disease, but we now have a
clear idea of what we are looking for."
</P>
<P>
His research was carried out on mice infected with scrapies,
the sheep's equivalent of the BSE or Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
</P>
<P>
Aguzzi and his team followed the anomalous prions (proteins)
believed to cause "mad cow" from the stomach to the spleen and the
lymphatic system. As a result, they found out that "mad cow"
replicate multiply with the help of normal prions once they reach
these two sites, building up sufficient numbers to attack the
brain in force through the peripheral nervous system.
</P>
<P>
Since the abnormal proteins called prions cause irreversible
damage when they hit the brain, so the treatment for "mad cow"
could involve stopping prions from multiplying in the peripheral
nervous system, according to Aguzzi.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of "mad cow" disease in Britain led to a major
crisis in EU relations over restrictions on exports of suspected
British beef, and the measures to be taken to curb the disease.
</P>
<P>
To halt the spread of the BSE, Britain has banned beef sales
and agreed to slaughter over 120,000 suspected heads of cattle.
</P>
<P>
The "mad cow" disease, which struck most heavily in England,
has appeared sporadically in the rest of the British Isles and
elsewhere in Europe.

<HEADLINE> China to Dam Yangtze at Three Gorges in November (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese engineers who initially set the time for damming the
Yangtze River in late November and early December also supported
the rescheduling of the work for early November, saying this will
give construction workers plenty of time to finish the required
building before the start of 1998's flood season.
</P>
<P>
The locking of the river will signal the end of the first stage
construction. The second stage can be described as building two
cofferdams to cut the flow of the main stream of the Yangtze and
make way for workers to construct the main dam and workshops for
generators in between the two cofferdams.
</P>
<P>
According to the design requirements for the second stage of
construction, the cofferdams must be 76 m high and use a total of
11.3 million cu m of earth, and an anti-leak embankment must be
built covering an area of 730,000 sq m before the flood season of
1998.
</P>
<P>
A number of conditions have made it possible to carry out the
locking ahead of the schedule, said Lu Youmei.
</P>
<P>
For the past ten years, Chinese experts who have studied daily
analysis of the water flow from October to December near the dam
site have concluded that water discharge in the area allow for an
earlier damming of the river.
</P>
<P>
The experts also have solved a range of difficult technical
problems related to locking through many years' research,
also making it possible for an earlier damming.
</P>
<P>
A canal designed for use after the damming has helped divert
water from the Yangtze since May and will be open for navigation
in October.

<HEADLINE> Mao's Fellow Villagers Better Off Under Market-Oriented Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- In a faded photograph taken
over 30 years ago, Tang Ruiren, barefooted and in shabby clothes,
smiled shyly beside China's late Chairman Mao, who was visiting
Shaoshan village, his hometown in central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The former poor woman of Chairman Mao's native place has now
become the owner of a successful restaurant, named "Mao's
Restaurant" in honor of the founder of new China, and donates over
500,000 yuan (60,000 US dollars) to public welfare services
each year.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to Chairman Mao, I was liberated. Thanks to Deng
Xiaoping, I have become rich," said 67-year-old Tang Ruiren,
wearing a fashionable silk dress and a gold locket bearing Mao's
likeness.
</P>
<P>
Tang is not the only villager from Mao's hometown to benefit
from the market-oriented policies.
</P>
<P>
"There were very few self-employed laborers in the late 1970s
but now more than half the villagers are doing business," said
Wang Zhisen, a peddler selling tourist souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
Wang, together with her husband, head of the village's
construction team, are earning over tens of thousands of yuan
every year.
</P>
<P>
The total income of Shaoshan village exceeded 100 million yuan
(12 million US dollars) last year, compared to only 6,000
yuan (731 US dollars) in the early 1980s, according to
present village head Mao Shiyu.
</P>
<P>
"Every family in the village will have access to cable TV
services in the next two years, and 95 percent of them will have
telephones in their houses," Mao Shiyu added.
</P>
<P>
According to a local economist, the economic boom in the small
village is just "a miniature view of the whole province."
</P>
<P>
He said that during the past five years, Hunan had made
unprecedented progress in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of last year, he said, Hunan's GDP has kept
increasing by more than 12 percent, about two to three percentage
points higher than the country's GDP growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the province also show their confidence in Hunan's
economic prospects in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"The belt region along the Beijing-Guangzhou railway, including
Mao's hometown, is now emerging as a growth standard for the
entire province's economic take-off," said Wang Maolin, the
Secretary of Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of
China. chief of Hunan.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Stabilization Force
(SFOR) led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
Bosnia will use deadly force if necessary against Serbs, a NATO
top general said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, U.S. Army General Wesley Clark,
who serves as supreme allied commander of NATO forces in Europe,
also called on former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to
surrender for trial.
</P>
<P>
"The incidents that we have seen recently give me great cause
for concern because they betray a pattern on the part of some
people to attempt to dissuade SFOR from accomplishing its
mission," Clark said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be deterred by mob violence or threats of mob
violence. We will use all means necessary, including lethal means,
to protect our forces and to continue our mission," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, angry Bosnian Serbs have confronted U.S.
troops in the Serb-controlled areas several times. Two U.S.
soldiers were injured by in one confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Clark declined to predict if a special military mission might
be launched to arrest Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
"He should be turned in. He should report to The Hague. In
fact, I call on him to submit himself voluntarily to justice,"
Clark said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Greg Rusedski
stormed past former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek of the
Netherlands in straight sets on Wednesday to reach the semifinals
at the U.S. Open tennis tourney in New York.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski, wearing a black ribbon in memory of Princess Diana,
won 7-5, 7-6, 7-6 in a fast-speed match. He became the first male
player from Britain to reach the U.S. Open semifinals since Mike
Sangster in 1961.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski had beaten Krajicek in four of five previous meetings
but had far less big match experience than the Dutchman.
</P>
<P>
"I'd never won a match here. All the hard work is finally
paying off," said Rusedski, who is ranked 20th in the world, two
places below Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals, Rusedski will face either unseeded Swede
Jonas Bjorkman, who has been playing the best tennis of his life,
or 15th-seeded Czech Petr Korda, who pulled off the biggest upset
of the tournament with his fourth-round shocker over four-time
champion Pete Sampras of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, sixth-seeded Lindsay Davenport of the United
States also claimed her first career Grand Slam semifinal berth,
beating her doubles partner, third seed Jana Novotna, 6-2, 4-6,

<HEADLINE> CIA Releases New Information About Missing Hondurans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) has released new information on 187
Hondurans missing during the last decade`s civil war in Honduras,
the National Commission for Human Rights said today.
</P>
<P>
The CIA presented a 300-page document unleaking names who were
responsible for the missing people and delivered some clues,
Commission President Leo Valladares said.
</P>
<P>
He said as soon as the document is analyzed, he will turn it
over to the corresponding authorities.
</P>
<P>
Valladares urged the 13 former Honduran military officers who
were involved in the case to confess their crimes to the
country`s courts.
</P>
<P>
"They have claimed innocence, but if they are actually
innocent, they must prove it," Valladares said.
</P>
<P>
Catholic Priest James Carney`s relatives have asked the
government to find out what really happened in the clergy`s
disappearance in the mountains of Olancho in the northeast
department in 1982, when he served as a chaplain for a rebel
group, Valladares added.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Observe First Fair Play Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- In a latest bid to boost the
flagging sportsmanship worldwide, the International Football
Federation (FIFA) has designated September 20-21 this year as the
first Fair Play Days.
</P>
<P>
FIFA Secretary General Joseph Blatter made the announcement at
a press conference here Wednesday on the eve of the 7th FIFA
Under-17 World Championship slated for Egypt from September 4-21.
</P>
<P>
The Fair Play Days will coincide with the final matches of the
U-17 event. A total of 16 teams from five continents will play 32
matches in four Egyptian cities during the competition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, FIFA's 192 members will stage a variety of
activities to attract the maximum attention to the theme of fair
play during these two days of September, the busiest month for
footballers all over the world, according to Blatter.
</P>
<P>
On September 21, the "fairest team" participating in the U-17
championship will receive a 10,000-Swiss franc award and can
donate it to Egypt's branch of SOS Children's Village, a
FIFA-funded program established in Austria 15 years ago, said the
secretary general.
</P>
<P>
Keith Cooper, FIFA communications director, on his part,
praised highly of the visits to the children's homes paid by the
Austrian U-17 team in Alexandria on Wednesday and to be made by
the German team in Cairo next week.
</P>
<P>
"It is not easy for the 16- or 17-year-old boys to show such
concern (for this cause), a gesture that should be recognized," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Cooper criticized the overwhelming tendency
to seek fame and fortune while neglecting moral integrity.
</P>
<P>
"Teams now prefer to win cups and medals while they consider
fair play only secondary. It is even more difficult to encourage
media to support the principle of fair play," he lamented.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the last World Youth Championship (U-21) held in
June-July, the FIFA director said the youngsters played well in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"It was characterized by exceptional level of fair play as
well," he added.
</P>
<P>
He was very proud of the fact that only three red cards were
handed out during the 52 matches. "This perfectly demonstrated
that fair football is better than hot football," he said.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA secretary general chipped in, adding that U-17 World
Championships has so far had no doping tests failure and therefore
is "very clean."

WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
today that it would consider more food aid to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) if the U.N. World Food Program

spokesman James Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Foley made the remarks after press reports indicated that the
World Food Program might make a new appeal as it was making
assessment of damage by last month's typhoon-fueled tidal wave
that has smashed dikes and flooded fields in DPRK, destroying an
estimated 700,000 metric tons of corn.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Lower 1997 Economic Growth Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
revising its economic target for this year in the light of the
poor economic performance during the first half of the year, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is unlikely to attain its 7 percent economic
growth target this year due to the currency crisis and the
resulting high interest rates, Economic Planning Secretary Cielito
Habito was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Habito's comments came after the peso fell to an all-time low
of 31.83 pesos to the US dollar in trading on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The high interest rates and the prevailing currency turmoil in
the Asian region have left the government no choice but to
reassess the country's growth target for the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Habito said the slowdown in economic growth in the first half
of 1997, which averaged 5.9 percent, left the economy the tough
act of expanding by at least 8.1 percent for the final half to
achieve the 7 percent target by the year's end.
</P>
<P>
He said while other sectors of the economy continued to grow,
important foreign exchange-based components, like withdrawals from
dollar reserves, the slowdown in the remittances from overseas
Filipino workers and lesser influx of foreign investments, have
contributed to a "slower performance" of the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the worsening currency crisis, President Ramos
has called a meeting among government economic managers and
private sector business leaders to assess the country's economic
situation.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Chechnya Bargain Over Oil Transit Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin today ruled out the possibility of a compromise in
the transportation of Caspian oil via Chechen territory,
describing it as "misplaced," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry, it offered
43 U.S. cents for transportation of one ton of oil via Chechen
territory, while the Chechen side proposed that it receive 2.2
U.S. dollars per ton, which includes expenses for management,
guards and so on.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said the figures on which the Russian side is
insisting at the talks on oil transit were not "somebody's
caprice." Russia has a broad experience in the transportation of
energy supplies both on Russian territory and abroad and therefore
the tariffs proposed by the Russian side were dictated in
accordance with the market, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin pointed out that if the issue of transportation of
Caspian oil via Chechnya is not resolved "we will search for
different ways, and they exist."
</P>
<P>
The joint Russian-Chechen commission held its meetings Tuesday
in the village of Dagomys near the Black Sea resort city of Sochi,
which involved Russian Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin and
Chechen First Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov. The talks were
also attended by president of the Chechen oil company Yunko
Khodzhakhmed Yarikhanov.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted Yarikhanov as saying that Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov has rejected the Russian proposal.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov does not agree with the technique of determining the
amount to be paid, Yarikhanov was cited.
</P>
<P>
"Russia must rebuild the (Chechen) oil industry anyway while
Chechnya wants to cash in on the transit of oil," the Chechen oil
company president said.
</P>
<P>
"By insisting on the tariff of 43 cents per ton of oil, the
Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry is trying to downgrade Chechnya
to a Russian region," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Yuri Lisin, vice president of the Russian
oil pumping company Transneft, arrived in Grozny Wednesday
afternoon to continue the discussion on oil transportation with
Yarikhanov later on the day.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The second test on a
urine sample from Diego Maradona confirms that the soccer star
took drugs before a league game 10 days ago, the Argentine
Football Association announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
AFA spokesman Albino Bemposta said that Maradona had tested
positive for a prohibited substance, which was forbidden by law to
be revealed.
</P>
<P>
With the second test being postive, the 36-year-old Maradona is
almost certain his career with a lengthy playing ban and also
faces a trial at a federal court for use of a banned substance.
</P>
<P>
The second test was requested by Maradona, whose agent claims
the former Argentine captain may have been given a drink spiked
with drugs prior to Boca Juniors' August 24 victory over
Argentinos Juniors.
</P>
<P>
Maradona admits to being a cocaine addict. He recently
underwent extensive drug rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, he was banned after failing a drug test while playing
for Napoli in Italy. He was arrested in Buenos Aires that same
year and charged with cocaine possession and distribution.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 he was kicked out of the World Cup finals in the United
States after testing positive for what FIFA called a "cocktail" of
stimulants, including ephedrine.

LONDON -- The Buckingham Palace announced here Wednesday that
the funeral procession route of Princess Diana would be extended
and begin from Diana's London home Kensington Palace.
</P>
<P>
The original procession route, which was from St James's Palace
to the Westminster Abbey, had been criticized as being too short.
</P>
<P>
A Buckingham Palace spokesman said that the procession plan was
changed because of safety considerations.
</P>
<P>
"We've always tried to consider a way of lengthening the route
in such a way that more people would be able to see the procession
in safety," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- U.S. mediator Dennis Ross held lengthy talks
Wednesday with an Israeli delegation ahead of Madeleine Albright's
first trip since she became the secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
Ross and State Department officials avoided any description of
Ross's four-hour meeting with Israeli Cabinet secretary Danny
Naveh and Uzi Arad, foreign policy advisor to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to take the Middle East trip next Tuesday
and will meet leaders of Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt,
Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia and possibly Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley, replying reporters'
questions, declined to list the issues Ross and then Albright
would discuss with the Palestinians and Israelis. However, he
noted the security situation had improved since a twin suicide
bomb killed 17 people at a Jerusalem market on July 30.
</P>
<P>
BANGKOK -- The baht plunged to an all-time low Wedensday on the
local market and selling prices at some leading commercial banks
on spot trading once exceeded 37 baht against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The selling price at Bangkok Bank today once hit 37.56 against
the dollar, while the baht was at one point sold at 37.65 to the
dollar at Krung Thai Bank.
</P>
<P>
Thai central bank governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi said that in
addition to the strong dollar, the psychological factor might also
 have fueled the baht slump.
</P>
<P>
He called on the public to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Two Jewish young men were shot dead Wednesday near
Jerusalem and the Israeli police forces are hunting the suspects,
Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
The police told the Israeli radio that the incident occurred
at about 3:00 pm (local time) on the road west of Givat Zeev,
which is about 10 kilometers northwest of Jerusalem. One of the
young men was shot dead inside the car and another was found
lying nearby.
</P>
<P>
The two were identified as young Jewish residents of Jerusalem
and the incident might be a criminal shooting because one of the
dead had criminal records in the past, police said.

<HEADLINE> Davenport Advances to U.S. Open Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Sixth seed Lindsay
Davenport of the United States advanced to the semifinals of the
U.S. Open tennis championships Wednesday by winning over her
doubles partner Jana Novotna of Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Davenport clinched the victory after she fired a forehand,
cross-court shot to complete the three-set battle resulting 6-2,
4-6, 7-6 (7-5) in her favor.
</P>
<P>
Each player failed to convert a match point in the
tension-filled third set before Davenport finally closed out the
two and a half hour struggle with the third-seeded Czech veteran
to reach her first career Grand Slam semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Davenport became the third player in the final four, joining
17-year-old compatriot Venus Williams and 11th-seeded Romanian
Irina Spirlea.
</P>
<P>
Davenport will take on the winner of Wednesday night's
quarter-final between top seed Martina Hingis and 10th seed
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the only player left in the tournament
who has won the Open before.
</P>
<P>
Davenport and Novotna both appeared to take control of the
match in the third set only to lose it. Davenport broke to go up
2-0 and built a 4-1 lead. But Novotna broke back to 4-3, held
serve and then broke again for a 5-4 advantage.
</P>
<P>
Novotna served for a spot in the semifinals, but wasted a match
point and fought off five break points before Davenport broke to
tie the match. They went to the tiebreak and once again both
players surged and faltered. Davenport went up, 3-1, only to have
Novotna rally with three consecutive points for a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
Novotna edged ahead, 5-4, but Davenport stormed back to take
the next three points and close out the match.
</P>
<P>
On the men's side, Greg Rusedski of Britain took on Dutchman
Richard Krajicek in a quarterfinal battle of hard servers.
Fifteenth seed Petr Korda of the Czech Republic, who ousted top
seed and two-time defending champion Pete Sampras of the United
States in a five-set thriller on Monday, had an evening match
against Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman.

<HEADLINE> Deep-Sea Robot Completes Pacific Exploration Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (xinhua) -- China's first remote deep-sea
robot, capable of exploring at depths of 6,000 meters, recently
completed a seabed survey for polymetallic nodules in the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The successful application of the intelligent robot moves China
into the ranks of the world's few world countries with the
capability to produce advanced seabed survey instruments.
</P>
<P>
Feng Xisheng, director of the deep-sea robot project and a
researcher with the Shenyang Institute of Automation under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, said Wednesday that the 39-day survey
proved that the robot is capable of completing designed survey
tasks.
</P>
<P>
He said the survey collected some 100 megabits of data and
videotapes of 10.8 sq.km. of ocean floor, and took 240
photographs.
</P>
<P>
The new remote robots, a cooperative Sino-Russian design,
provide more precise data and photo imaging than older robots
attached to cables. Feng noted that the remote robot has worked
for six successive hours at a depth of 5,217 meters.
</P>
<P>
The atmospheric pressure of 600 at a depth of 6,000 meters
create difficulty in spreading electromagnetic waves, the research
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Feng, the robot's capabilities include
videotaping, photography. geodetic surveying, polymetallic nodules
sampling, tracking of submerged targets and automatic recording
of data.
</P>
<P>
The robot is also capable of making automatic ascents when
encountering difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Feng said Chinese scientists are currently engaged in research
to enable the robot to conduct round-the-clock operations, and
will equip the robot mechanical appendages to for seabed
sampling.
</P>
<P>
Jia Peifa, director of the intelligent robot experts research
group, noted that seven units are conducting the deep-sea robot
project -- the CAS Shenyang Institute of Automation, CAS Institute
of Acoustics, the China Ship Research Center, Harbin Engineering
University, Shanghai Jiaotong University and two research
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The intelligent robot research program, one of the nation's
major high-tech projects, is being carried out at a cost of over
200 million yuan (24 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Report: Performance Improves in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Due to strict macroeconomic
adjustment measures by Latin American nations in the past several
years, a firmer foundation for continued economic expansion has
been established in the region, a professional study shows.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have resulted in a reduction of the region's risk
profile and increasing investor confidence in many countries that
could lead to similar performance next year, the Miami-based Price
Waterhouse LLP Latin American Business Center said today.
</P>
<P>
However, the center said in its mid-year report on the economic
outlook for Latin America and the Caribbean that faster economic
growth continues to be hindered by macroeconomic imbalances as
well as inconsistent application of economic and fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
Changing global economic and financial conditions over the
coming year could also impact the region's medium and long-term
prospects, said the report, adding that possible interest rate
increases in the industrialized countries may have an adverse
effect on the presently strong capital inflows into the region.
</P>
<P>
The center is part of a worldwide Price Waterhouse network of
economic services and information.

<HEADLINE> German Industrial Output Jumps 3.5 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Germany's industrial output rose
sharply by 3.5 percent in July from the previous month, the German
Economics Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry today also revised its account of industrial
output growth in June from the previous 1.4 percent to 2.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Against the same month a year earlier, Germany's industrial
output in July advanced by 5.9 percent after a rise of 3.0 percent
in June.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the stronger-than-expected figures indicated that
the country's economic recovery was well underway.
</P>
<P>
However, there were doubts as to whether the current pace of
growth could be sustained. The Economics Ministry itself also
noted that the latest data may be distorted slightly because this
year's summer holidays fell relatively late, thus reducing the
impact on industrial production in June and July.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Accused of Breaching ECOWAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today accused Sierra Leone's
military junta of violating a sub-regional resolution on the country
by planning to launch attack against the west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
According to a statement of the defense headquarters, the junta
leader Major Johnny Koroma today met information and unit commanders
in the capital Freetown to "work out strategies to launch an offensive
attack on ECOMOG troops".
</P>
<P>
"The planned attack on ECOMOG positions will be carried out
within 24 hours," said the statement, quoted by a Nigerian
television authority report.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG troops have remained on the defensive in compliance
with the summit of the Economic Community of West African Countries
which ended last week in the Nigerian capital of Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The 20th ECOWAS summit of heads of state and government resolved
that economic sanctions would be adopted, instead of war, against the
junta which overthrew Sierra Leone's legitimate government in a coup
on May 25.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of the rebels to attack ECOMOG troops is a violation
of the summit resolution," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops were sent to Freetown in the wake of the coup.
Repeated clashes have been reported between the ECOMOG troops and soldiers
loyal to the junta.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force still holds in Lungi international airport
near Freetown.

volunteers of the Technical Aids Corps (TAC).
</P>
<P>
The seven medical personnel are the first set for a Francophone

<HEADLINE> US Sending Mediator to Cyprus for Peace Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator Thomas Miller
is planning a two-week trip to Cyprus and Europe in search of a
settlement formula for the divided Mediterranean island, the State
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"I think the dates are September 7 through September 20.... He
will be taking the temperature in the various capitals, then
reporting back," spokesman James Foley said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the United States was meshing its diplomacy with
that of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
U.N. envoy Diego Cordovez presided over talks between Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash in Switzerland in August. But the talks ended in failure
in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
Miller plans to begin his two-week trip Sunday and make stops
in Ankara, Athens, Nicosia and a number of European countries to
consult with leaders of the visited countries for a peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops invaded the Mediterranean island country in
1974, and the Turkish Cypriot minority declared a separate
republic that has been recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Miller will report to Richard Holbrooke, the retired American
diplomat who agreed to return to diplomacy part-time to try to
resolve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"He (Holbrooke) is keeping a close eye on the situation. He's
going to meet with Miller on his return and then they're going
to decide what steps the U.S. government may take," Foley said.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian Leader Calls on Africans for Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Vice-President John Atta
Mills has called on Africans, who seemed to have entered a new foreign
tutelage, to strive for full freedom and independence from colonialism.
</P>
<P>
"Even our course as political entities and social beings seems to
be taken over by others," he said at a colloquium opening in Cape
Coast, Ghana Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We seem to be marooned in a frozen frame of history where the very
people who enslaved us, colonized us and exploited us are telling us
what to do in every sphere of our lives," he was quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the people in the continent have been fighting for
freedom and independence for over 40 years, Mills asked: "How long
more are we to wait to transform that freedom into social advancement?
into real independence?"
</P>
<P>
"If we continue to expect others to think and plan our fate, and
influence the direction in which we must go, then we will wait through
the next millennium and more," the vice-president warned.
</P>
<P>
He called on Africans to defy those who sought to marginalize them
and keep them under tutelage in any shape or form, saying that Africa
of the diaspora must be fully reunited with the Africa at home.
</P>
<P>
He also urged African leaders to work hard at uniting the continent
for the benefit of all.
</P>
<P>
The colloquium is part of the 10-day Third Pan-African Historical
Theater Festival, or PANAFEST '97, which opened in Cape Coast last
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Governor Convicted of Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Governor Fife Symington of
Arizona of the United States, was convicted today of fraudulently
obtaining millions in loans when he was a real estate developer.
</P>
<P>
The verdict forces the two-term Republican to leave office.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old Symington faces a long prison term and millions
of dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
The jury in Phoenix found Symington guilty on seven counts
alleging he filed false financial statements to banks. He was
acquitted of three counts, including one of the most explosive
charges: that he tried to use his political muscle as governor
against a pension fund he owed 10 million dollars, according to
news reports.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Roger Strand declared a mistrial on the
remainder of the 21 counts because the jury was unable to reach a
verdict.
</P>
<P>
Under the state constitution, a governor is automatically
removed upon conviction of a felony. He will be replaced by the
secretary of state, fellow Republican Jane Hull. But Symington
hasn't said if he would resign immediately or wait until the
conviction is made official at his sentencing on November 10.
</P>
<P>
Symington was indicted last year on federal charges alleging
that he repeatedly lied about the health of his troubled real
estate businesses when applying for loans in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Symington's verdict came after a total of 17 days of
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
Symington still faces a separate federal bankruptcy trial on
charges he gave false financial information to a group of union
pension funds to get a 10 million dollar loan for a downtown
retail and office complex that was foreclosed upon.
