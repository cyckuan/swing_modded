<HEADLINE> Dollar Exchange Rate Against Ruble Rising in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The exchange rate is ranging
between 8.8 and 9.57 rubles for one U.S. dollar on Wednesday
despite the invalidation of dollar trading at the Moscow Interbank
Currency Exchange (MICEX), the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some exchange offices change the rate five times on Wednesday
morning, saying demand exceeds supply greatly.
</P>
<P>
However, the growing dollar selling rate has not changed
Russia's financial situation since most of the offices have no
U.S. currency in cash.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, quotations of gas giant Gazprom shares drop
by 14 percent at noon time at the Moscow Stock Exchange with one
unit fetching 1.05 rubles.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Stock Exchange index drops by 9.17 percent as
compared with that of Tuesday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There was a sharp increase in interest in Gazprom share in the
previous two days as Viktor Chernomyrdin, president of Gazprom,
was appointed acting prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In the first two days of the week prices of Gazprom shares
rose from 0.8 to 1.22 rubles, which was linked by the business
circles to the shareholders' speculation for a rise.
</P>
<P>
Quotations of Gazprom shares began falling as the dollar rate
soared and considerable part of the ruble supply was transferred
from the Moscow Stock Exchange to foreign currency auctions at the
MICEX.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Cherepanov, chief of the foreign operations department
of the Russian Central Bank, said the Central Bank has decided not to
spend large sums of currency reserves and not to prohibit
commercial banks to trade in foreign currencies among themselves.
</P>
<P>
MICEX Wednesday for the first time cancels its trading
session on the dollar, Cherepanov said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore beat Malaysia 2-0 in
the opening match at the 1998 Tiger Cup Southeast Asian Football
Tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's other game, the Vietnamese national eleven
overwhelmed Laos 4-1 after an opening ceremony which featured
30-minute music and dance show.
</P>
<P>
Teams from Malaysia, Singapore, Laos, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Thailand, Myanmar and host Vietnam are competing in
two groups in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
They will play a total number of 16 matches at the Hanoi
Stadium and Ho Chi Minh City's Thong Nhat (Unification) Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Group B teams Malaysia, Singapore, Laos and Vietnam will play
at Hanoi Stadium, while Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and
Myanmar of Group A will clash with each other at Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
The final is scheduled to be held at Hanoi Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The bi-annual Tiger Cup is Southeast Asia's biggest football
tournament of the ten Southeast Asian countries and this year's
event is the largest international soccer tournament ever hosted
by Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The Tiger Cup is sponsored by Tiger Beer Company of Singapore,
where the inaugural tournament was held in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This year's Tiger Cup tournament was originally slated in
Indonesia but social turmoil and economic crisis in that country
forced organizers to look elsewhere for a host.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which had originally offered to stand in as late
replacement for Indonesia, decided against hosting it because it
was too busy preparing for next month's Commonwealth Games there.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam had been chosen on June 19, just 10 weeks before the
Cup was due to start.
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Asian Football Tournament will conclude on
September 5.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders for Durable Goods Pick Up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to surging demand for
semiconductors and other electronical equipments, the U.S. orders
for durable goods shot up in July, the Commerce Department
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods rose 2.4 percent to
a seasonally adjusted 187.5 billion U.S. dollars, which is
expected to last at least three year, said the the department.
</P>
<P>
July's increase, the largest since November last year, followed
a 0.2 percent rise in June, which previously had been reported as
a 0.1 percent dip, and a 3.3 percent drop in May, the worst in
five months.
</P>
<P>
In July, orders growth was led by a 12 percent surge in
electrical and electronic equipment. A big increase in electronic
components more than offset a drop in communication equipment.
The category also includes radios, telephones, televisions, VCRs,
lamps, cooking equipment and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
Orders for industrial machinery and equipment, which includes
computers, rose 2 percent. Transportation orders rose 0.3 percent,
which was the first increase since April. A gain in aircraft and
parts offset declines in shipbuilding and auto manufacturing,
which was held back by the General Motors strikes, settled on July
25.
</P>
<P>
However, there was a 0.2 percent decline, the third in a row,
in orders for primary metals such as steel and aluminum.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of durable goods fell 0.2 percent in July, to a
seasonally adjusted 186.2 billion
dollars. It was the third drop in four months.
</P>
<P>
Because orders rose and shipments fell, the backlog of unfilled
orders rose 0.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted 506.2 billion
dollars, the first rise since April.

<HEADLINE> More Female Become Doctors in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- More women are filling
doctor's offices in Canada's hospitals and medical clinics,
statistics indicated Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 55,243 physicians practicing medicine in Canada last
year, a record 27.2 percent were women, up from 26.6 percent in
1996, statistics released by the Canadian Institute for Health
Information said.
</P>
<P>
Of doctors under 30 last year, 52.7 percent were women, while
female physicians only accounted for 40.6 percent of physicians in
their 30s.
</P>
<P>
The proportion was only 9.5 percent among the 6,721 Canadian
physicians for those in their 60s still practicing.
</P>
<P>
While women are flocking to what has been the male preserve of
medicine, they are tending to go into branches of the profession
involving careers in family practice, pediatrics, obstetrics and
gynecology, and psychiatry.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Media Inundated With Flood Stories By Zhou Fang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Water, water, everywhere, and
not a drop to drink: China's television, radio, newspaper, and
magazine reporters have been engulfed by stories of the flooding
that has devastated parts of the country in the past two months,
the worst since 1954.
</P>
<P>
Water levels, evacuations, floodwaters, diversion, bursting
dikes, plugging dikes, and sandbags may have been unfamiliar to
younger readers, but they're everyday terms in these stories.
</P>
<P>
Stories about soldiers, police, and fighters, heros, and
victims of the flood have become daily fare across the
country. These instant legends told by the media day and night
have reduced some readers to tears with their heart-touching
descriptions.
</P>
<P>
China's floods and rescue work have drawn the attention of
people nationwide and even worldwide, and as a consequence, caused
a general mobilization of local media to cover everything
concerned, no matter how remote.
</P>
<P>
The major news media like Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua), People's
Daily, China Central Television (CCTV), and People's Liberation
Army Daily, as well as many other local media have gone all out in
their effort to keep readers informed about the flood situation,
the rescue efforts, the donations, and the daily lives of the
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua's Department of Domestic News for Overseas Service,
together with CCTV's English Report, China Daily, China News
Service, Beijing Weekly Review, and other foreign-language
reporters in China have been doing a lot to cover the news from
every angle.
</P>
<P>
While millions of civilians and soldiers have been trying to
hold back floodwaters round-the-clock in northeastern, central and
eastern parts of the country, hundreds or even thousands of local
reporters have also kept their own round-the-clock watch on
water-logged dikes, inundated and crumbling residences, makeshift
shelters for victims, and of course the army of people fighting
the floods.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, some 200 reporters from Xinhua,
37 from People's Daily, nearly 400 from CCTV, 14 from Radio
Beijing, 37 from the PLA Daily, 25 from Economic Daily, and 32
from China Youth News have been sent to flooded areas. And
these are China's major players, the number of correspondents from
other media is simply too large to assess at this time.
</P>
<P>
Since July 24, Xinhua has released 2,859 flood-related stories
in six languages, with 750 photos, and the other media have had
their version of the same thing. But, television reports have the
most immediate appeal in the deluge of media coverage.
</P>
<P>
Live broadcasts of moving stories and performances for charity
benefits have been successful in getting people at home and abroad
to do their part in helping the relatives of the 3,004 people who
died in the floods, to share the woes of the flood's 22 million
victims, and to join the 230,000 soldiers who braved the raging
waters and in some cases even gave their lives to the largest
movement of military forces in China since 1949.

<HEADLINE> EU Tests Find Austrian Beef Hormone Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Wednesday that it had found no trace of illegal hormones in
samples of Austrian beef.
</P>
<P>
The European Union Reference Laboratory at Bilthoven,
Netherlands, carried out tests on samples acquired from the
seizure by Italian authorities of a consignment of Austrian meat
last month.
</P>
<P>
The analysis of 17 of the 18 samples of Austrian beef proved to
be free of hormones diethylstilbestrol and dienestrol, said
commission officials.
</P>
<P>
One of the samples was rejected for technical reasons and tests
had to be repeated.
</P>
<P>
The Italian authorities said that the Austrian consignment of
beef had contained a banned hormone and alerted the European
Commission which thereafter conducted its own analysis.
</P>
<P>
Commission spokesperson Martine Reicherts said that the Italian
authorities had already lifted the ban on Austrian beef.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian farmers association said the health scare caused
by the Italian allegation had cost the country's beef industry
some 8 million U.S.dollars.

LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- British cyclist Gary Edwards has
been banned from England's Commonwealth Games team after failing a
drugs test, the British Cycling Federation (BCF) announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sprint cyclist from Ilford, is reported to have breached
regulations governing testosterone levels in tests carried out by
the UK Sports Council.
</P>
<P>
Edwards returned testosterone/epitestosterone (t/e) ratios
above 6-1, requiring further analysis. Under dopping regulations,
a 1-1 ratio is regarded as normal, while above 6-1, an offence may
have occurred.
</P>
<P>
The second or 'B' sample is being tested at King's College,
London, the only laboratory in Britain accredited by the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the BCF read: "In accordance with Commonwealth
Games Council regulations English sprint cyclist Gary Edwards has
been suspended from the English Commonwealth Games team.
</P>
<P>
"The suspension follows a finding which warrants further
investigation not possible in the short period involved before the
Games commence."
</P>
<P>
Edwards, 32, returned to racing in Britain last year after a
spell in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Two other competitors, Paul Supple of England and Andrew
Goswell of Wales, are also reported to have produced "adverse
findings" in their tests and their participation in the

<HEADLINE> UK's Trade Outlook Bleak Despite Narrowing Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's global trade deficit is
feared to worsen despite a narrowing in the trade gap in June and
July.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Office of National Statistics (ONS)
today show a narrowing of the global goods deficit in June to 1.44
billion pounds (about 2.3 billion U.S. dollars), down from a
revised 1.9 billion pounds in May.
</P>
<P>
The July deficit on goods trade with non-European countries
also narrowed slightly to 949 million pounds from 972 million
pounds in June.
</P>
<P>
Global trade in both goods and services was also in deficit for
June to the tune of 764 million pounds, but down from 1.2 billion
pounds the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Despite the narrowing, economists say the monthly figures are
erratic and further deterioration in the UK's trade performance in
coming months is expected.
</P>
<P>
The bleak picture for exports remains, with core export volumes
to non-EU countries now having fallen by 2 percent over the last
three months.
</P>
<P>
Further falls in exports are expected, matched by only marginal
falls in imports as the economy slows, a Commonwealth Bank analyst
said.
</P>
<P>
Neil Parker, economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, pointed
to a narrowing in the surplus on services in July as a warning of
the deteriorating conditions for service exporters.
</P>
<P>
"That implies increasing competition from foreign providers,
who are selling relatively cheaper goods. It certainly doesn't
paint such a good picture for the UK trade balance," a BBC report
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Analysts broadly agreed that while there are signs of lower
import figures they do not provide clear evidence of demand
slowing enough to make for an easier interest rate climate.

and claimed Mago was responsible for the blast, saying it was "a
job well done".
</P>
<P>
Achmad said anyone could call a radio station and claim
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"They will try everything to discredit us... This bombing is a
way of stirring things up," Achmad said, without specifying whom
"they" were.
</P>
<P>
However, Achmad blamed the United States for the tragedy at
the Planet Hollywood restaurant at the Victoria and Alfred
Waterfront.
</P>
<P>
At grassroots level, he said, the situation was volatile
because U.S. President Bill Clinton had declared war on Muslims.
"He showed his arrogance by U.S. attacks in Afghanistan and
Sudan... Clinton must take full responsibility for what is
happening," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces launched missile attacks last week at alleged
terrorist camps in Afghanistan and Sudan. Clinton said the move
was not in retaliation for the deadly U.S. embassy bombings in
east Africa on August 7.
</P>
<P>
The Mago group, which vows to fight against "the Zionists and
their allies in the West", staged protests and burnt American
flags during Clinton's visit to South Africa in March this year.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Envoy Visits Libya Over Lockerbie Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President's envoy left
for Libya Wednesday for talks with Libyan leader Muammer Gaddafi
on a U.S.-British agreement over the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
The trip of Osama el-Baz, President Hosni Mubarak's political
adviser, came after the U.S. and Britain announced on Monday their
proposal to allow two Libyans accused of involvement in the
Lockerbie bombing to be tried in a third country.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak held a telephone conversation Tuesday with Gaddafi over
the U.S.-British deal, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But the agency did not give details of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced Monday
that the U.S. and Britain have agreed to allow the two Libyans,
who were charged with bombing a Pan Am flight in 1988 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, to be tried in The Hague, the Netherlands,
before Scottish judges under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie incident killed 259 people aboard and 11 on the
ground at Lockerbie. Among the dead, 189 were Americans.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have long urged Libya to hand over the two
suspects to stand trial in either of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But Libya refused to turn over the suspects, contending that
trial should be held to ensure its justness, which incurred the
U.N. air and arms embargo as well as certain financial and travel
restrictions in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan government has so far not commented on the
U.S.-British offer.
</P>
<P>
British officials said it is too early to expect a detailed
response from Libya to the proposal, but Albright has put the
proposal as non-negotiable by saying it was a "take it or leave it
proposition."
</P>
<P>
Egypt has described the deal as a "definite improvement,"
saying the issue is now in Libya's hands.

Politicians and parties across the political spectrum reacted
strongly to the bombing and called for speedy and tough crackdown
on violence.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela was "shocked and angry" at the news
of the blast, a presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"He was angry at the disregard for human life," the spokesman
said. "It was aimed at people who come to visit our country. It
was not only an attack against us, but against the whole
international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
A man was killed and 27 people, including international
tourists#,were injured when the bomb exploded at the Planet
Hollywood restaurant at the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront at
7.20 p.m. local time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the wounded were five members of a British family of
six, including two children, at two and eight respectively. The
family arrived in Cape Town Tuesday for a holiday trip.
</P>
<P>
A man telephoned a Cape Town radio station Tuesday night,
claiming a group named Muslims Against Global Oppression (Mago)
was responsible for the blast.
</P>
<P>
The caller said the move was in retaliation for U.S. missile
attacks on suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan and Sudan
last week.
</P>
<P>
But the Muslim group's coordinator Moain Achmad reportedly
denied the allegation Wednesday, saying someone was trying to
discredit his group.
</P>
<P>
However, he said U.S. President Bill Clinton must "take full
responsibility for what is happening," as the situation has
become volatile after Clinton declared war on Muslims `}@=IIR95RD+V$WVV-R$X:tack
s.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP), the biggest black opposition party in the
country, condemned the bombing Wednesday, saying it was
terroristic and cowardly attack on innocent victims.
</P>
<P>
The ANC said the bombing and other recent pipe bomb attacks
in Cape Town, which had claimed a number of lives, should be
attended to expeditiously by the law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Rasool, ANC's provincial leader in Western Cape,
where Cape Town is located, visited the bomb scene Wednesday.
"It's not a time for cheap politics, but a time for cooperation
from national level to provincial level along with
non-governmental people, in fact, everyone," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IFP said: "whatever objective anyone had is sullied by
this cowardly attack on civilians who did not deserve to have
their lives destroyed."
</P>
<P>
The United Democratic Movement (UDM) and the Freedom Front
(FF), two other opposition parties, urged the government to take
tougher action against criminals.
</P>
<P>
The UDM said the government needed to adopt a zero-tolerance
attitude toward crime and violence, while the FF called for
reintroduction of the death penalty to deter murderers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. embassy in Pretoria recommended that
American citizens take special precautions to ensure their
personal safety.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident the South African Police Service will move
quickly to identify and apprehend those responsible for this
disgusting act," the embassy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sidney Mufamadi, who visited the
scene, linked the bomb to the August 7 blasts at U.S.
installations in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a strong likelihood "local operatives" had
been used in the interests of international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) team was en route to
Cape Town Wednesday to help investigate the blast. The FBI agents
would probe whether the bombing was related to the attacks in
Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner George Fivaz said that with the aid of
U.S. explosive experts, he expects arrests soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, worries were expressed over the bombing's impact
on tourism in the country. A Cape Town metropolitan official
said the incident would have "serious long term repercussions"
for Cape Town's thriving tourist market.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that Cape Town has been made a target for
what would appear to be anti-U.S. terrorism," he said. He called
on all Capetonians to make efforts to protect their most valuable
industry - tourism - by ensuring all visitors feel safe in the
city.

ATHENS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis said Wednesday that Greece and Bulgaria were getting
nearer to attaining their common objective - excellent
communication.
</P>
<P>
After meeting his visiting Bulgarian counterpart, Ivan Kostov,
Simitis told reporters that relations between the two countries
were "at a good level," and any problems which did rise were
effectively dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Both men discussed the planned Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil
pipeline, the nuclear plant at Kozloduy in Bulgaria, road
connections along the Greek-Bulgarian border, cooperation in the
customs sector, the avoidance of double taxation and matters
regarding visa requirements.
</P>
<P>
As for the oil pipeline, Simitis said that both sides agreed
that Bulgaria must put certain questions to the Russian side about
matters requiring some clarification and then they would examine
any problems which there might be.
</P>
<P>
On the Kozloduy nuclear plant, he said that Kostov had supplied
a series of data, on the basis of which the Greek atomic energy
commission would examine any problems which might exist.

<P>
He expressed satisfaction over the progress in the construction
of road connections along the Greek-Bulgarian border and added

<HEADLINE> Libya Asks U.N. for More Time to Study Lockerbie Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Libya has asked the U.N.
Security Council to delay its decision on a draft resolution
introduced by the United States and Britain, so that Tripoli can
have more time to study the U.S.-UK proposal on the trial of the
two Lockerbie suspects in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, told reporters on Wednesday
that the Libyan request was contained in a letter, which was made
public here Wednesday. The letter, dated August 25, represented
the first official response from the Libyan Government on the
Lockerbie trial offer.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that "a decision on the draft resolution
presented to the Security Council be postponed until Libya's
judicial authorities have completed their study."
</P>
<P>
Such a postponement would ensure that "the two suspects appear
in a court in a neutral third country as soon as possible," the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
"Libya is anxious to arrive at a settlement of this dispute and
to turn over a new page in its relations with the states
concerned," said the letter, which was sent to Security Council
members late on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The letter said Tripoli was "very surprised" to see the draft
resolution on the Lockerbie issue even though it had only received
papers on Monday from Washington and London detailing their offer
on holding a Scottishh court trial of the two Libyan suspects in
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council would consider the letter, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Washington and London offered to try the two
suspects by a panel of three Scottish judges under Scottish law in
the Netherlands. Before the compromise, the United States and
Britain had long insisted the trial be held on either of their
territories.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects were accused of planting a bomb aboard the an
American airliner, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
December 1988, killing about 270 lives.

7.20 p.m. local time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the wounded were five members of a British family of
six, including two children, at two and eight respectively. The
family arrived in Cape Town Tuesday for a holiday trip.
</P>
<P>
A man telephoned a Cape Town radio station Tuesday night,
claiming a group named Muslims Against Global Oppression (Mago)
was responsible for the blast.
</P>
<P>
The caller said the move was in retaliation for U.S. missile
attacks on suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan and Sudan
last week.
</P>
<P>
But the Muslim group's coordinator Moain Achmad reportedly
denied the allegation Wednesday, saying someone was trying to
discredit his group.
</P>
<P>
However, he said U.S. President Bill Clinton must "take full
responsibility for what is happening," as the situation has
become volatile after Clinton declared war on Muslims by ordering
last week's attacks.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP), the biggest black opposition party in the
country, condemned the bombing Wednesday, saying it was
terroristic and cowardly attack on innocent victims.
</P>
<P>
The ANC said the bombing and other recent pipe bomb attacks
in Cape Town, which had claimed a number of lives, should be
attended to expeditiously by the law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Rasool, ANC's provincial leader in Western Cape,
where Cape Town is located, visited the bomb scene Wednesday.
"It's not a time for cheap politics, but a time for cooperation
from national level to provincial level along with
non-governmental people, in fact, everyone," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IFP said: "whatever objective anyone had is sullied by
this cowardly attack on civilians who did not deserve to have
their lives destroyed."
</P>
<P>
The United Democratic Movement (UDM) and the Freedom Front
(FF), two other opposition parties, urged the government to take
tougher action against criminals.
</P>
<P>
The UDM said the government needed to adopt a zero-tolerance
attitude toward crime and violence, while the FF called for
reintroduction of the death penalty to deter murderers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. embassy in Pretoria recommended that
American citizens take special precautions to ensure their
personal safety.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident the South African Police Service will move
quickly to identify and apprehend those responsible for this
disgusting act," the embassy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sidney Mufamadi, who visited the
scene, linked the bomb to the August 7 blasts at U.S.
installations in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a strong likelihood "local operatives" had
been used in the interests of international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) team was en route to
Cape Town Wednesday to help investigate the blast. The FBI agents
would probe whether the bombing was related to the attacks in
Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner George Fivaz said that with the aid of
U.S. explosive experts, he expects arrests soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, worries were expressed over the bombing's impact
on tourism in the country. A Cape Town metropolitan official
said the incident would have "serious long term repercussions"
for Cape Town's thriving tourist market.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that Cape Town has been made a target for
what would appear to be anti-U.S. terrorism," he said. He called
on all Capetonians to make efforts to protect their most valuable
industry - tourism - by ensuring all visitors feel safe in the
city.

<HEADLINE> Israel Vows to Protect Northern Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel's inner cabinet vowed
Wednesday to defend its residents in northern areas following the
most serious rocket attacks on Israeli northern towns by Lebanon's
Hezbollah guerillas in months.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after its meeting, the Israeli inner
cabinet said that it viewed the rocket attacks on Tuesday night as
a "grave violation" of the understandings reached in 1996 which
banned both sides from hitting civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel will continue to strike terrorist organizations and act
to defend its residents in the north and restore security to the
northern border, the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Life returned to normal Wednesday in the northern Israeli town
of Kiryat Shmona and parts of Western Galilee, where at least 14
people were lightly wounded or suffered from shock after the
Hezbollah guerillas fired dozens of Katyusha rockets there Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the northern areas Wednesday, Israeli
President Ezer Weizman reiterated that the problem Israel faces
in south Lebanon would not be resolved without a role of Syria,
calling for the resumption of the Israeli-Syrian talks, which
broke off in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah attacks were apparently in response to the
missile strike by an Israeli military airplane earlier Tuesday
that killed Husam Amin, regional chief of Amal operations, the
second largest military organization which fights to oust Israeli
troops out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak expressed his support
Wednesday for the decision to attack Amin, but stressed that the
only solution to the conflict in the north is to revive direct
talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
However, Uzi Landau, chairman of the Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee in Israel's parliament, said Israel should
strike Syrian forces in Lebanon which he accused of using the
means of terrorism to try to force Israel to withdraw from the
Golan Heights, seized by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's shelling came at a time when tension flared up in the
so-called security zone in south Lebanon, set up by Israel in 1985
with an aim to protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli soldiers and one civilian employed by the army,
were killed by roadside bombs last week, bringing to 12 the
number of the Israelis who were killed in the 15-kilometer-deep
security zone since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Under heavy pressure from the Israeli public, the Israeli
government adopted in April the 20-year-old United Nations
Resolution 425 calling on Israel to withdraw its troops from
south Lebanon, but linked the pullout to security arrangements
from the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its main ally Syria have rejected the proposal on
the ground that the resolution calls for an "immediate and
unconditional" Israeli troop withdrawal.

UNITED NATIONS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Wednesday that the incidence of
malnourished children appeared to be declining in certain parts of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said in a statement the situation had improved in
accessible areas. According to the United Nations Agency, its
staff reported seeing declining numbers of malnourished children
during field visits this year.
</P>
<P>
The agency also reported improvement in the health sector,
saying hospital records made available to it generally indicated
reductions in fatality and improvement in the rehabilitation of
patients.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said it continued its activities to assist those
affected by food shortages and to rebuild essential health, water,
food security and education system in the country.
</P>
<P>
It added that it was currently delivering drugs, medical
equipment and water and sanitation supplies to an estimated 4.6
million people, including 500,000 children under the age of five
years, which was aimed at both immediate and long-term needs in
the country.

that it has collected 61.5 million Birr (8.6 million U.S.
Dollars) from various sections of the society for rehabilitating
displaced Ethiopians by the Ethiopian-Eritrean war.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The committee once again urged Ethiopians to carry on with the
fund-raising for the rehabilitation of the war displaced and for the

<HEADLINE> Cyprus: Delay in Russian Missiles' Delivery Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said Wednesday that no decisions have been taken
regarding a possible postponement of the arrival of Russian
anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Larnaca Airport before his departure to Athens for
talks with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, Clerides said
"even if such a decision is taken, it will be taken in Cyprus by
the National Council."
</P>
<P>
The National Council, the top advisory body to the president on
the handling of the Cyprus problem, has insisted on the deployment
of the missiles unless there is sufficient progress toward a
resolution of the Cyprus problem or the situation moves leading to
the demilitarization of the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government ordered the surface-to-air S-300
missiles from Russia in January 1997 in a bid to boost the
country's air defense as against a possible Turkish offensive. The
missiles are scheduled to be delivered and deployed in November
this year.
</P>
<P>
The deal has sparked strong protests from Turkey, which vowed
to block the arrival of the missiles and threatened to launch
preemptive strikes if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
There have been wide speculations here that during the Athens
meeting, the Cypriot and Greek leaders will discuss the
possibility of postponing the deployment of the missiles in light
of political pressure from some foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that during Thursday's meeting in Athens, there
will be "an exchange of views on the current position of the
Cyprus problem, future handling, the island's European Union
accession course, the joint defense pact between Cyprus and
Greece, armaments and the Russian S-300 missiles."
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be attended by Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides and Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed the joint defense pact in November
1993, under which Greece will provide military assistance in case
Cyprus is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and seized the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
From Athens, Clerides will fly to Durban, South Africa, to
attend the Non-Aligned Movement summit.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Crisis Program Ready in Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 70 percent of a new
anti-crisis program was agreed upon by the trilateral commission
of Federal Council, State Duma and government representatives,
Russian acting Economics Minister Yakov Urinson said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the program will be discussed Thursday, while
two or three versions will be presented for each provision of the
anti-crisis program concept, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted
Urinson as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the acting minister, the representatives managed
to agree on a number of important provisions, including the main
guidlines for the social and economic policy, financial and credit
policy, industrial and social policy.
</P>
<P>
The commission also plans to determine the strategic objectives
for the State Duma, the Federation Council and the government, as
well as concrete measures to be taken by the government and both
houses of parliament shortly and by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Urinson said that both general policies and specific steps to
be taken by the government, State Duma and Federal Council in the
coming days and during the year have been worked out in all the
four parts of the anti-crisis program.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Oleg Morozovm leader of the Russian
Regions group and the Duma's coordinator in the commission said
that this document is based on a political consensus of all
parliamentary factions and groups and is permeated by the idea of
mutual consultations among all branches of government on various
issues.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Fishermen Convicted in Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Seven Syrian fishermen were
sentenced to one-month in prison by the Turkish Cypriot regime
after they were caught fishing off the Cyprus' eastern coast.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen, captured last Friday, were convicted Tuesday,
Turkish Cypriot press and radio reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the jail term was granted, instead of a
fine, in a bid to prevent more Syrian fishermen from entering the
waters that the Turkish Cypriot regime claims under its control.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian embassy in Nicosia said Wednesday that it is working
to get the details about the incident.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time that the Turkish Cypriot regime has
caught Syrian fishermen.
</P>
<P>
One fisherman was shot dead and three others captured by
Turkish Cypriot armymen in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is recognized

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Vow to Pursue Lawsuits against European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers for Holocaust survivors
Wednesday said they would pursue the class-action lawsuits against
European insurance companies despite a compromise deal reached
Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
Leading European insurance companies signed an agreement
Tuesday in New York in a bid to resolve the dispute over unpaid
Nazi-era insurance policies of Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum of understanding, negotiated by the World Jewish
Congress, the U.S. insurance regulators and European insurance
companies, establishes an international commission that would
examine the insurance companies' achives, set up a process to
resolve claims and determine a company's liability.
</P>
<P>
However, Michael Witti, a Munich lawyer who represents
thousands of Holocaust survivors, sharply criticized the deal on
Wednesday, saying that the insurance companies wanted to get off
more lightly and cheaply by excluding Holocaust survivors from
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Even the Jewish organizations do not have the right to make
the decision for the claimants," Witti said.
</P>
<P>
Some other lawyers have also expressed objection to the
agreement, noting that it was not legally-binding and did not
guarantee quick payment of policies.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to pursue our class-action lawsuit
vigorously," said Witti in reference to a billions-of-dollar legal
action launched by Holocaust survivors against 16 European
insurers last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile he also indicated that a out-of-court deal with the
insurance companies was still possible, but with the involvement
of Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
Allianz AG, Germany's largest insurance company which signed
the New York accord, on Wednesday dismissed the accusations made
by the lawyers. It also expressed the hope that the New York
agreement would make the legal action unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
Other major European insurance companies which signed the
agreement include the French company AXA Group, the Swiss
companies Winterthur and Baseler, and Der Anker of Austria.

<HEADLINE> UK's Manufacturing Hits 5-Year Low to Herald Growth Halt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- With Britain's manufacturing
hitting a five-year low, the Confederation of British Industry
(CBI) has predicted the UK economy will "grind to a halt" by
mid-1999 and called for a quick cut in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In its latest monthly Industrial Trends survey showing
manufacturing orders at a five-and-a-half-year low, the CBI
downgraded its forecasts for overall economic growth but said it
still expected a "soft landing".
</P>
<P>
"We now expect economic growth over the next three quarters
will almost grind to a halt, so we believe an early cut in
interest rates is vital to prevent the economy slipping further
than necessary," CBI's chief economic adviser, Kate Barker, said,
adding that it would still be possible for the Government's
inflation target to be met after an interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
The CBI predicted Gross Domestic Product, the main measure of
economic growth, to fall to 1.5 percent by the end of the year and
0.9 percent by mid-1999 before climbing back to 1.5 percent by the
end of next year. That is supposed to broadly describe the "soft
landing" for the economy the government and the Bank of England
have predicted.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said it expected official interest rates to fall 0.25
percent to 7.25 percent by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
It said while a hard landing is not expected, there are more
risks of the economy stalling than last May with the problems
facing the export sector having a knock-on effect in the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
Total orders for British manufacturers hit their lowest level
in more than five years with 41 percent of firms reporting order
books below normal while only 10 percent said orders were above
normal.
</P>
<P>
This gives an overall negative balance of minus 31 percent,
unchanged from July and worse than June's minus 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey showed export orders slipping back to
their levels of May, which were the lowest since 1983. The export
orders balance was at minus 51 percent, slightly worse than
previous months while the output expectations balance stood at
minus 15 percent this month compared to minus 8 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
There is no sign of the recessionary pressure easing on UK
manufacturers, the CBI said.
</P>
<P>
The latest economic statistics showing record mortgage lending
on one hand and five-year lows in manufacturing orders on the
other confirm widely differing conditions across the British
economy, economists said.
</P>
<P>
The UK home lending market remains buoyant with mortgage
lending jumping to a record 5.7 billion pounds (about 9.1 billion
U.S. dollars) in July, according to figures released by the
British Bankers' Association (BBA). That was 14 percent higher
than June lending, confirming the housing sector as one area of
the economy maintaining strong growth.
</P>
<P>
The two sets of figures provide more evidence of the so-called
"two-speed" British economy with some areas, like housing and
services, experiencing continuing growth while others, like
manufacturing, slip into recession.
</P>
<P>
This varied performance makes it harder for the Bank of England
to judge the appropriate level of interest rates as it attempts to
engineer a "soft landing" for the economy.

<HEADLINE> Trilateral Commission Works Out Economic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Russian trilateral
commission, which consists of representatives of the government
and both houses of parliament, has drafted the statement on
economic policy, according to the news reports of Itar-Tass news
agency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Vladimir Ryzhkov said
the members had drafted the final text of the statement on
Wednesday by midnight.
</P>
<P>
The commission agreed that economic approaches should be
largely altered, particularly with a vigorous customs policy to
protect the domestic market, Ryzhkov said.
</P>
<P>
The need for new approaches to the regulation of the banking
system was emphasized, according to the first deputy speaker.
</P>
<P>
He said the property of those banks that fail to meet
obligations to depositors may be siezed by the state.
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov noted that if the statement passed, it would be fully
worked out by the end of the day and referred to the president,
acting prime minister and speakers of the Federation Council and
the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
According to the coordinator, the commission will submit on
Friday a Duma version of the document with a protocol to a meeting
of the State Duma Council. The protocol records differences
between factions on this document.
</P>
<P>
However, another report said, the president's office
responded negatively to the document drafted by the tripartite
commission.
</P>
<P>
Oleg Morozov, the commission's coordinator from the State Duma
and leader of the parliamentary group Russian Region, said
Thursday that in response, the president's staff sent its own
version of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The version consists of a preamble and one item, listing laws
which should be adopted, in the opinion of the president's office,
Morozov said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "this completely changes the philosophy of
the political agreement".
</P>
<P>
The commission continued simultaneously working with the
president's office and the Federation Council (upper house),
Morozov said.
</P>
<P>
The statement on social and economic policy drafted by the
trilateral commission is one of the two important documents that
are to be worked out by the trilateral commission. The other one
is the political statement on the interaction of branches of
power, which is being drafted.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma would not confirm the nomination of Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister before the two documents were
passed, some opposition leaders said in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Urges Withdrawal From South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel must make quick
decisions both on its withdrawal from south Lebanon and on the
redeployment in the West Bank, Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Kahalani said an Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon should be the "number one strategic
priority" for the government.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani's remarks on south Lebanon came as tensions
intensified recently in south Lebanon with stepped-up clashes
between Israeli troops and Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer "security zone" in
south Lebanon in 1985 to protect northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
But there has been a strong call in Israel for withdrawal from
the zone due to the heavy human losses in fightings with the
resistance.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani also noted both Lebanon and Syria should be involved
if a solution is to be found.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman and other senior officials have
stressed recently that a solution to the south Lebanon problem can
be found without the involvement of Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria, who has great influence on Lebanon, opposes an Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon without an agreement on the return
of the Golan Heights, which was captured by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israel offered to pull back from south Lebanon in
exchange of Lebanese security guarantee of its northern areas. But
Lebanon and Syria firmly rejected the offer, saying that Israel
should withdraw from south Lebanon unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the redeployment in the West Bank, the
minister said he believed that an agreement would be reached
around the beginning of a series of Jewish holidays late next
month, urging both Israel and the Palestinians to show
flexibility in their talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel resumed direct talks on July 19 to
discuss a U.S. proposal, which calls for a 13 percent Israeli
troops withdrawal from the West Bank. There are reports indicating
certain progress could have been achieved.

<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Millions of civilians and
soldiers are keeping watch as the floods peaks move on the Yangtze
River in central China and Songhua River in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
The most recent, the seventh flood crest on the Yangtze has not
caused any major problems even though water levels remain high
from Shishou in Hubei Province to Jiujiang in eastern Jiangxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Water levels on Dongting and Poyang lakes in those two
provinces are also receding.
</P>
<P>
The major flood peak on the Songhua has been passing through
Jiamusi city, in the northeastern part of Heilongjiang Province. On
Thursday at 2:00 p.m., the water level there was 80.34 meters, and
the flow rate, 16,200 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang, has
continued subsiding, to 120.47 meters on Thursday at 2:00 p.m.,
but was still above the all-time high by 0.42 meters.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leauge Hails Libya's Flexibility on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Esmat Abdel Meguid said Thursday that the Libyan consent to the
U.S.-British proposal on settling the Lockerbie issue is an
"important step along the road to end this problem for good."
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid, who is now in Lebanon, told Egypt's Middle East
News Agency that Libya's acceptance of the proposal was "expected"
as the proposal was in line with Libya's stance and an idea
presented by the AL three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Libya Wednesday accepted a joint U.S.-British proposal that the
two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of an American plane be
tried by a panel of three Scottish judges under Scottish law in
the Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have long urged Libya to hand over the two
suspects to stand trial in either of the two countries. But Libya
refused to turn over the suspects, contending that the trial
should be held in a third country to ensure justice.
</P>
<P>
"Libya's stand is flexible," Abdel Meguid said, urging the
United Nations to remove the six-year-old sanctions imposed on
Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
The air embargo and arms sales, certain financial and travel
restrictions were imposed in 1992 after Libya refused to hand over
the two suspects, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah. The bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
"I expect that the Security Council will take a step towards
lifting the international sanctions imposed against Libya
immediately after the two suspects are handed over," said Abdel
Meguid.
</P>
<P>
But he added that this issue has not yet been settled and will
be crystalized through negotiations in the coming period.
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive day, the Security Council Thursday
met to consider a draft resolution sponsored by the U.S. and
Britain to suspend U.N. sanctions on Libya when the suspects
arrive in the Netherlands for trial.
</P>
<P>
"There will be intensive and hard work for guaranteeing a fair
trial of the two suspects. And this will be our mission in the
coming stage," said the AL chief, who noted that the Cairo-based
Arab forum is willing to play any role to settle the issue.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Bank Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada's central bank raised
interest rates by a full point to six percent Thursday in a
desperate move to prop up its currency.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Canadian dollar made a new record
Wednesday, dropping for the first time in its 140-year history
below 64 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
During the past six months, the Canadian dollar lost about 10
percent of its value against the strong U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
With the rate hike, the bank's operating band for the overnight
rate was similarly adjusted to a range of five to six percent.
</P>
<P>
"Today's increase in interest rates is aimed at providing
support for the Canadian dollar in order to bolster confidence,
while preserving monetary conditions that will help to sustain the
present non-inflationary expansion of the economy," the bank said
in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Wholesale Trade Index Declines in 2nd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's overall domestic
and foreign wholesale trade indices declined by 10.5 and 13.5
percent respectively in the second quarter 1998 over the same
period of 1997, according to a survey released Thursday by the
Singapore Department of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Excluding petroleum, the above-said domestic and foreign
indices fell by 10.9 and 13.9 percent respectively, the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly figures in comparison between 1998 and 1997
showed that the sharp decline in the domestic wholesale index was
partly attributed to the 31.1 percent fall in the wholesaling of
textiles, wearing apparel and personal effects, and a slump of
21.4 percent in the wholesaling of timber, paints and construction
materials.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, wholesale turnover of electronic and electrical
components and industrial machinery reduced by 20.0 percent while
that of petroleum and petroleum products slid by 9.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures also indicated that all the foreign wholesale
activities, except for the sales of food, beverages and tobacco
which grew by 25.4 percent, reported slowdown in business. The
hardest hit in the foreign wholesale trade was the wholesaling of
timber, paints and construction materials whose turnover dived by
44.8 percent compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Also in the foreign wholesale trade, turnover of petroleum and
petroleum products declined by 12.9 percent and other wholesale
activities that reported negative growth were general wholesale
trade (-13.0 percent), electronic and electrical components and
industrial machinery (-7.5 percent), and household equipment and
furniture (-3.6 percent).
</P>
<P>
The wholesale trade index measures the sales transactions of
wholesale establishment in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The survey noted that data for the compilation of the wholesale
trade indices are sourced from some 750 wholesale establishments
covered in the quarterly survey of wholesale trade and business
expectations surveys.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin on Wednesday called for a new cabinet formed
by professionals regardless of their party affiliations.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Chernomyrdin aired the idea on television in
the wake of a Crimean summit Wednesday with Ukraine President
Leonid Kuchma and Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said the cabinet members should be well aware of
their responsibility at a critical moment, Interfax-Ukraine news
agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was reinstated by Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on August 23 after the sudden dismissal of the entire cabinet
headed by 35-year-old Sergei Kiriyenko amid financial and economic
turmoil in the country.
</P>
<P>
The crisis came to a head last week when Moscow declared it was
defaulting on some of the international debts and made a de facto
devaluation on the ruble.
</P>
<P>
The most important task was to make united efforts nationwide
in seeking way to come through the financial crisis, Chernomyrdin
said.
</P>
<P>
The first priority was to deal with shortage of funds and keep
the banking system in order, he said.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the crisis needed close cooperation with
neighboring countries, Chernomyrdin added.

NEW DELHI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Union government
Thursday announced a sharp increase of up to 150 percent of postal
charges with effect from the end of this month.

<P>
This is the second hike in postal services this year. The

BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a
meeting with Imai Takashi, honorary president of the Japan-China
Economic Association here today, said the the courage of millions
of Chinese in fighting the battle against flooding exhibits once
again the cohesiveness of the Chinese in difficult situations and
proves that the Chinese nation is indomitable.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed appreciation for the efforts of the Japan-China
Economic Association to increase mutual understanding and economic
and trade cooperation between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Although the Asian financial crisis has affected China's
economic growth, Jiang said, the Chinese government has adopted a
responsible attitude and, as a result, has paid the price for
keeping the Chinese currency stable.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that Japan will make its own effort to help
stabilize the region's economy by using its economic strength.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 20th anniversary of the Sino-Japanese peace
and friendship treaty, he said, and it is worth
commemorating. Since bilateral relations are at an important stage
between past and future, China and Japan should develop friendly
and cooperative relations geared for the 21st century, based on
the principles of the Sino-Japanese joint statement and
Sino-Japanese peace and friendship treaty, promoting friendship
for future generations.
</P>
<P>
Takashi expressed his admiration for China's flood control and
disaster relief work and its contribution to mitigating the
effects of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also discussed proposals of the Japan-China Economic
Association on reciprocal cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Takashi told Jiang that the Japanese government and people hope
for jiang to pay a visit to Japan at his convenience.

In the last two months, the floods have pushed water levels of
the Yarlung Zangbo and Lhasa rivers up to record levels. Of more
than 70 counties in the autonomous region, 40 have been affected.
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters have affected more than 80,000 local people, killed
over 4,000 head of livestock, inundated 13,333 ha. of farmland,
and destroyed over 2,000 houses.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 civilians and soldiers have been working to

<HEADLINE> Singapore Says FPDA Exercise To Be Abandoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Ministry of Defense
Thursday confirmed that a major maritime and air exercise
scheduled for later this year by allies of the Five-Power Defense
Arrangements (FPDA) will be abandoned because Malaysia has decided
to pull out from it.
</P>
<P>
In a press release to respond press queries, the ministry said,
"as a consequence of Malaysia's decision, Exercise Stardex, a
major maritime and air exercise scheduled for September/October
1998 will not be able to proceed."
</P>
<P>
"As ships of the Australian, New Zealand and the United Kingdom
forces have already commenced deployment to this region for
Exercise Stardex, Singapore will do its best to accommodate
requests for ad hoc training activities and professional exchanges
with these forces in order to help them derive the most value from
their deployment to this region," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
But it reaffirmed that Singapore stands firm on its belief that
 the FPDA is of strategic importance to regional stability and
regular FPDA exercises are useful.
</P>
<P>
"This view remains unchanged," the ministry emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to continue with the full range of FPDA
activities when Malaysia is able to do so," the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported that Malaysian Defense Minister Syed
Hamid Albar announced earlier in an interview with the Far East
Economic Review that Malaysia has decided to pull out from FPDA
exercises slated for this year because of its economic woes and
intense relations with Singapore. The defense minister was also
quoted as saying that Malaysia has informed other FPDA members of
its decision.
</P>
<P>
The FPDA has existed for 27 years as a military alliance
between Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and the United
Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Orders 13 Banks to Improve Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
Thursday ordered 13 banks to improve their capital standings
despite their capital adequacy ratios exceeding the international
level of eight percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Supervisory Commission Thursday said the 13 banks
considered financially stable have showed financial inadequacy
when their standings were evaluated in accordance with tougher
standards of the Office of Bank Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The 13 banks' capital ratio went beyond the eight percent level
set by the Bank for International Settlements and some even hit 13
percent in previous evaluations of the Office of Bank Supervision.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the 13 banks fell below the required standard
of eight percent in revised evaluations by the Office of Bank
Supervision and some even registered negative standings under new
international criteria, said the commission.
</P>
<P>
Recent evaluations showed that the 13 banks, with big
investments in overseas and trust accounts and leasing affiliates,
suffered the greatest falls in the ratio of the Bank of
International Settlement.
</P>
<P>
In order to survive and develop under tougher local and
international evaluation standards, the banks have to reduce
outlets and staff, to undergo major restructuring by seeking
mergers and foreign investments, said the commission.
</P>
<P>
The government's financial watchdog said it will start
evaluation on the 13 banks this month to check whether their June
BIS ratio exceeds eight percent and will issue improvement orders
on those who fail.
</P>
<P>
The 13 South Korean banks are Housing and Commercial, Kookmin,
Shinhan, KorAm, Hana, Boram, Daegu, Pusan, Kwangju, Cheju,
Jeonbuk, Kyungnam and Korea Long-Term Credit Bank.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has ordered closure of 14 ailing commercial and
merchant banks since the country was hit by a financial crisis
caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial
institutions late last year.

<HEADLINE> Taylor Admits Failure in 1st Year in Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles Taylor
has admitted that he has failed to deliver on election promises
during his first year in office, a report by the Inter Press
Service said.
</P>
<P>
"I have failed my first year. I have not been able to do what
I should have done in my first year in office. Many of the high
expectations... have not been met. Our agriculture is ravaged,
our infrastructure is ruined and our people are devastated and
disappointed," Taylor said on his first anniversary in office.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to his country's 2.8 million people to give him
another chance.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who started the Liberian civil war in 1989, began his
six-year term of office on August 2, 1997, when he won 75 percent
of the vote in an election organized by the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) to end more than seven years of
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said then that Liberians voted for Taylor for fear
that if he lost, the most powerful warlords in the bloody civil
war might choose not to give peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
"The man who spoiled it should fix it," the voters sang during
last year's elections campaign, referring to Taylor. "He killed
my ma, he killed my pah, I will vote for him."
</P>
<P>
Taylor promised to restore everything Liberians had lost
during the war. He promised a true national reconciliation,
restoring electricity and running water and even a computer for
every Liberian child.
</P>
<P>
He attributed his failure to "unexplainable delays and global
empty promises" on the part of the international community in
helping Liberia in its post-war reconstruction efforts.
</P>
<P>
A major donor conference held in Paris in April pledged 220
million U.S. Dollars for Liberia's reconstruction program. But
only a few countries have made small financial packages since
then.
</P>
<P>
One of them, the United States, has provided 55 million
Dollars, but to the chagrin of the Liberian government, the
packages are being channeled through non-governmental
organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
Now one year after Taylor took office, Liberians have remained
without clean running water, electricity, adequate security,
regular decent meals and houses.
</P>
<P>
"The sweat-drenched euphoria (generated shortly before and
after last year's polls) has given way to tougher times... with
almost everybody, if not all, feeling the pinch and wearing grim
and melancholic faces," said Liberia's independent newspaper,
Heritage.
</P>
<P>
Prices of basic commodities, too, have hit the sky in a
country where salaries range between 80 Liberia Dollars (two U.S.
Dollars) to 850 Liberia Dollars (21 U.S. Dollars) a month, while
a gallon of gasoline now sells for 65 Liberia Dollars (about 1.6
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Both the agriculture sector, which feeds 75 percent of the
population, and the iron ore mining industry, which accounted for
70 percent of Liberia's hard currency earnings before the war,
have been slow in recovery.
</P>
<P>
Security, too, has remained a major issue of concern.
"Security agents are harassing us day and night," complained
Chief Elijah Nagbe, at a recent conference in neighboring Cote
d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The murder of one of Taylor's rivals, Samuel Dokie, last year,
has cast a shadow over the so called true reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Dokie, together with his wife, sister, cousin and driver were
arrested by government security agents and subsequently found
burnt to death in the car they were traveling in. Suspects were
freed by a court for lack of evidence.

<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Accusing the United States and United Nations of
surrendering to Iraqi defiance, a leader of the U.N. special

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi FM on Border Clash With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad on Thursday described as a "serious matter" the border
clash between Bangladesh and India on Tuesday that left at least
one Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) personnel dead.
</P>
<P>
"There was a firing incident at the border on August 25
resulting in the death of a BDR personnel. This is a serious
matter and is being taken up bilaterally through normal channel
with the concerned Indian authorities," Azad said at a regular
weekly press briefing.
</P>
<P>
But he parried a question if the government had formally lodged
any protest with the Indian government in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Azad gave the reaction two days after the Indian Border
Security Force (BSF) and the BDR clashed in Dinajpur district,
northwest Bangladesh, over rebuilding a frontier wall at the "zero
point" by the BSF. In the clash, one BDR soldier was reportedly
killed and many others wounded.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between the border security forces of the two
countries was held Wednesday, he said, adding, "We are waiting for
the details."
</P>
<P>
"Problems, even serious problems, if and when they arise, can
and should be addressed and resolved through discussion and
dialogue," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
On the existing relations between Dhaka and New Delhi, he said
that "we attach great importance to the friendly and good
relations with India and nothing should be allowed to detract from
this objective."

<HEADLINE> Canadian Fishermen Threaten Blockade of Cruise Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Canadian salmon fishermen have
threatened to blockade the West Coast cruise-ship route, the Globe
and Mail newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The West Coast salmon fleet has caught barely 50 percent of
what was predicted before the season opened this year, and
conservation measures have effectively brought it to a premature
close.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall means a loss of tens of millions of dollars and
makes this season the worst in the history of the province of
British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
The plan to conserve a resource endangered by past overfishing
and habitat destruction, plus unusual climate conditions will
produce a catch of barely 4.5 million salmon this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 fishing boats staged a noisy two-hour symbolic
blockade Wednesday, although no cruise ships were stopped. But
fishermen involved said they would make it permanent if the
government rejected all their demands.
</P>
<P>
The protesters have issued a list of demands, including a
face-to-face meeting with federal Fisheries Minister David
Anderson and cash compensation for fish lost through what they
claim is departmental mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Nine Alaska-bound cruise ships are scheduled to sail through
the passage by Monday. Cruise ships will make 300 Alaska-bound
trips from Vancouver this summer, carrying 800,000 passengers in
an industry that brings 200 million Canadian dollars (128 million
U.S. dollars) to the British Columbia economy.
</P>
<P>
A blockade would require cruise ships to make a 450-kilometer
diversion around Vancouver Island.

<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) - The athletics World Cup will be
renamed the Nelson Mandela Trophy for future editions of the
four-yearly continental team event, the International Amateur
Athletic Federation (IAAF) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The eighth World Cup will be staged in Johannesburg from
September 11-13.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the IAAF on Thursday, IAAF
president Primo Nebiolo said Mandela was an "inspirational
figure".
</P>
<P>
"We are honored that the World Cup trophies will now be named
after him," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The IAAF World Cup is a special athletics competition because
the team is more important than the individual. The event
represents unity and friendship between different parts of the
world and no individual personifies the quest for unity better
than Nelson Mandela," said the president.
</P>
<P>
In an attached letter to the statement, Mandela said, "I
accept this extraordinary gesture not as a tribute to me but to
all athletes and especially to those in Africa who have inspired
the world with their legendary achievements despite their
underprivileged beginnings," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF will offer cash awards to athletes for the first time
at the World Cup -- 50,000 U.S. dollars for first place (60,000
U.S. dollars for relays), 20,000 for second and 10,000 for
third.

<HEADLINE> Cheung Kong, Hutchison Whampoa Report Lower Interim Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Cheung Kong (Holdings) and
Hutchison Whampoa, the listed flagships of Li Ka-shing, reported
significantly lower first-half results Thursday, reflecting the
adverse impact of the regional financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Both groups made heavy provisions against the fall in the value
of properties and listed securities.
</P>
<P>
After exceptional provisions of 3.435 billion HK dollars (440
million U.S. dollars), Cheung Kong (Holdings) saw its profit
attributable to shareholders plunge by 78 percent to 3.023 billion
HK dollars (388 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hutchison Whampoa's net profit amounted to 4.310 billion HK
dollars (553 million U.S. dollars) in the first half, down 45
percent from last year. The diversified and increasingly
international group made exceptional provisions of 3.450 billion
HK dollars (442 million U.S. dollars) for certain property
developments and its portfolio of listed investments.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of both groups Li Ka-shing told a press conference
Thursday afternoon that the interim results have been achieved
during a period of continued turmoil in the Asian financial
market, which has adversely affected Hong Kong property market and
 economy.
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the 1998 will continue to be difficult and
challenging and under the circumstances provisions are necessary,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The businessman predicted that "the possibility of a further
plunge in property prices is limited" following successive
adjustments in the market and government measures to bolster the
economy and stabilize the property market.
</P>
<P>
Supported by strong demand for property, the long-term
prospects for the property sector remain optimistic, provided that
confidence is restored, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the long-term prospects of Hong Kong economy, he was
fully optimistic. On the back of steady economic progress in the
Chinese mainland, Hong Kong is well positioned to consolidate its
role as a financial, trade and service center in the region, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li added that his companies will continue to be based in Hong
Kong and pursue suitable investments in Hong Kong, the Chinese
mainland and overseas in a prudent manner.

<HEADLINE> Big Loan Earmarked for S. Korean Small Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government is to
provide six trillion won (4.19 billion U.S. dollars) for small
businesses this year in bid to bolster the flagging economy.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance and Economy Lee Kyu-sung told company
managers at a meeting Thursday that the government will disburse
all of the remaining six trillion won out of the 12.5 trillion-won
earmarked for small businesses this year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
"The government will do its best to prevent the aggravation of
recession and restore financial systems," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry would take strong pump-priming measures, such as
rolling over short-term debt, rescheduling other debts and writing
off the remaining liabilities, for small-sized firms, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 17,000 small firms have been bankrupt since the
country was gripped by a financial crisis triggered by corporate
failures and bad loans by financial institutions late last year.
</P>
<P>
The minister also disclosed that the government would increase
money supply as flexibly as possible in the second half of this
year under an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
To help ease debt burden on businesses, he said, the ministry
would also try to further lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will embark on large public works and
social infrastructure projects as planned to create more jobs
right after the National Assembly approves its second revised
supplementary budget next month, he added.
</P>
<P>
In June this year, unemployment in South Korea soared to seven
percent or 1.57 million people since the country was hit by the
financial crisis. The jobless rate is expected to grow as
restructuring in the finance, industry, labor markets and the
public sector will continue until next year.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed with the IMF for a rescue loan of 58
billion U.S. dollars, South Korea has to restructure its economy
and open its markets this year.

<HEADLINE> EU Inactive But Watchful As Ruble Falls Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Thursday that it will wait until next Thursday before considering
action on Russia's worsening financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The executive body of the 15-nation European Union admitted it
was doing nothing more than just watch on a "daily basis" or "as
closely as possible" for the time being over developments in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Commission spokesperson Martine Reicherts said that the
commission was scheduled to resume after the summer recess its
weekly meetings next Thursday, one day later than usual, as some
commissioners including President Jacques Santer would be away in
Lisbon for European Day.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the commission was concerned by the pressure
of the freefall of the Russian currency, the spokesperson said
that it was as concerned as the European Central Bank which is now
in operation in Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
But commission officials said earlier this week that the
commission had no plans yet for extra financial assistance to
Russia except for the existing TACIS technical aid program.
</P>
<P>
The commission said time and again that the financial crisis
was a problem for the Russians who had to do what they could to
bail themselves out and that outside assistance would only help
with action by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
Losses by foreign investors in Russian bonds reportedly
amounted to 33 billion U.S. dollars by Thursday.

ANKARA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Thursday called for all
kinds of efforts to solve the conflict in the separatist Yugoslav
province of Kosovo so to prevent a wave of refugees.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Turkish Foreign Ministry expressed
Ankara' concern about the Kosovo crisis, which it said has reached
a serious dimension threatening the peace and stability in the
Balkans and the Europe as a whole.

crisis by use of force rather than negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem has sent letters to his
counterparts of the southern European countries, underlining the
importance of providing assistance to Kosovo refugees whose number
has reached 200,000.
</P>

Turkey has deep-rooted historical, humanitarian and cultural
ties with Kosovo, where a considerable number of Turks are still
living.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Economy Declines 6.8 PCT in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economic growth
declined by 6.8 percent in the second quarter of 1998, Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was the second consecutive quarter for Malaysia's economy
to record a negative growth in the past 10 years. In the first
quarter this year, Malaysia's gross domestic product (GDP)
declined by 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank Negara Malaysia, the state bank, announced
Thursday afternoon that the GDP of the country in the second
quarter this year declined by 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy was badly affected by the regional financial
and economic crisis prompted by what was called speculative
attacks on the regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the country's GDP declined to the level of
40 billion U.S. dollars compared to that of 100 billion dollars
before the onset of the economic crisis in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income also declined from 5,000 dollars to 2,000
dollars now, Mahathir said at a meet-the-people gathering in
Kuching, capital of Sarawak, East Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"Even though the rogue speculators only get between 5 billion
U.S. dollars and 10 billion U.S. dollars, we lost 60 billion U.S.
dollars just like that," he was quoted by the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia must make preparations from now to avoid
a catastrophe from which it would be most difficult to recover.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has worked out plans to revive the
economy and they have shown some results because the country has
not bowed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as expected by
the foreign media.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia would try to revive banks and companies which
could help reactivate the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy grew rapidly during the past decade with an
average growth rate of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the last quarter of 1997, Malaysia's economy expanded by 6.9
percent.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Coast Has Potential Diamond Reserves: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- There may be "rich reserves" of
diamonds in the coastal areas of Angola, an official with the
South African company De Bees disclosed at a seminar here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ian Corbett, head of the resources department of De Beers, the
largest diamond explorer in Africa, noted that these potential
diamonds have been washed down to the coastal areas by the many
rivers and deposited there.
</P>
<P>
Given that there are rich reserves of precious stones in the
hinterland of the southern African country, it is worthwhile
investing in the exploration of the potential reserves, said
Corbett.
</P>
<P>
He believed that greatest prospects are seen around the outlet
of Kwanza River in mid-northern coast.
</P>
<P>
Angola is one of the biggest diamond producers in Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the Angolan Ministry
of Geology and Mines, in 1997 the state-run mining companies
produced 43,170,000 karats of precious stones worth 120 million
U.S. Dollars while the informal explorers dug out 88,200,000
karats worth 239 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Angola has its major mining areas in northeastern
provinces of Lunda-Noret and Lunda-Sul.
</P>
<P>
De Beers invested 50 million U.S. Dollars in the exploration
and production of various diamonds in Lunda-Noret in 1996.

signed between them, such as the ceasefire agreement signed on
July 18, 1997 in Cagayan de Oro City and other supplement
agreements.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that there will be lasting peace in Mindanao
when there is mutual trust, justice, freedom, and tolerance for
the identity, culture, way of life and aspirations of all peoples
of Mindanao.

BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,500 types of China's
transferable technology can now be seen on the Internet, on the
website the Online Technology Export Fair of China.
</P>
<P>
The items include machinery, chemicals, electronics, building
materials, aviation and space technology, bioengineering, and some
of the country's most advanced carrier rocket and agricultural
cloning technology.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, the minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), said at the opening ceremony today that this
was the first time for China to use E-business to show technology
for exports.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC began to release commodity information in early July on
"Chinamarket" on the Internet, and in a month it had attracted
more than 10 million visits.
</P>
<P>
Shi said he hopes to increase technology exports in this way.
</P>
<P>
The nation's technology business grew in the 1990's more than
40 percent per year on average, far greater than the growth of
general trade.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sets up Dengue Express Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government health
facilities have set up dengue fever express centers in some hot
spot areas to properly screen patients for early treatment and
management, the Department of Health said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The department has declared Manila, Caloocan City, Quezon City
and Valenzuela in Metro Manila and San Pablo City in Laguna, San
Antonio in Nueva Ecija and Quezon province as hot spots for dengue
fever.
</P>
<P>
It said dengue express lanes are strategically located in
health centers, hospitals and other government health facilities
for prompt diagnosis and screening of the danger signs in
patients.
</P>
<P>
Strict monitoring of dengue patients should be done, especially
when the fever subsides after three days, it said.
</P>
<P>
Dengue needs no extraordinary treatment and mild cases can be
treated at home. A patient usually recovers within three to five
days.
</P>
<P>
Death in dengue occurs, however, if treatment is delayed and
there is inappropriate administration of intravenous fluids, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with dengue fever yet to peak from September to
October, the department records show that from January to July
this year, 7,754 dengue fever cases were reported nationwide, with
a 2-percent death rate.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 and 1997, the country recorded 14,648 and 12,811 dengue
fever cases respectively.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Call for Serious Review of This Year's Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers have viewed
the ongoing national combat against floods with mixed feelings,
and have called for a serious review of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
In examining a report of the State Council on flood-control
operations at the fourth meeting of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress here today, the lawmakers expressed
appreciation for the national endeavor, especially the Chinese
Communist Party's leadership and the army's contribution.
</P>
<P>
However, they also expressed concerns about the deteriorating
environment, which is believed to be the major cause for this
year's flooding.
</P>
<P>
Luo Di'an said the raging floods were caused by widespread
deforestation resulting in serious soil erosion and inadequate
water conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuan said that flood-fighting is just like a battle which
tests officials at all levels. However, some officials who went to
the flood-stricken areas sought special comforts and asked to be
housed in air-conditioned rooms and eat soft-shelled turtles,
considered highly nutritious in Chinese cuisine.
</P>
<P>
"We should not tolerate such officials," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Yao Zhengyan, former vice minister of Water Resources, said the
flooding has sounded an alarm to the nation, and he worries that
more serious floods could hit China in the future unless the
central government increases investment to build modern water
conservancy projects and step up efforts to protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
His ideas were echoed by An Zhendong, vice chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's
Congress. An pointed out that the root cause of the flooding on
the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers in northeast China is excessive
tree cutting in the upper reaches of the two rivers.
</P>
<P>
According to An, the Lesser Xinggan Mountains on the upper
reaches of the Nenjiang River is now treeless and the Greater
Xinggan Mountains is facing the same fate.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,
said the central government will shut down timber factories along
the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to ban the indiscriminate
felling of trees there.
</P>
<P>
The same measure will also be adopted in northeast China,
Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Southern African States to Hold Summit In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) will hold its summit in Mauritius
from September 13 to 14, according to a report reaching here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
SADC Secretary-General Kaire Mbuende said in Zimbabwean
capital Harare Tuesday that the summit will review the political
situation in the southern African region. In Angola, one of the
SADC's 14 member states, the faltering peace process has been
stranded because of the violent operations by the opposition
movement Nation Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Mbuende noted that the unfolding conflicts in the Democratic
Republic of Congo will also be addressed at the summit.
</P>
<P>
There has been positive economic growth in the region though
it is not as good as that of last year, said the SADC
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Mauritian summit will also discuss about the
food situation in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
As shown in the latest SADC food security bulletin available
here, the community now has some 1.2 million tons of maize
surplus largely from huge carry-over stocks in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It said that the region has an overall cereal deficit of
510,000 tons, a shortfall of 1,35 million tons of wheat, 107,000
tons of rice and 2.42 million tons of millet.
</P>
<P>
The community was putting together protocols which include
tourism and the setting up of a tribunal to solve internal
differences.
</P>
<P>
The protocols on energy, transport, communications and
education had been ratified by member states, Mbuende said.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, Tanzania, Mauritius and Zimbabwe had indicated they
would ratify the protocol on trade, he said, adding that there
was a 24 percent increase in intra-regional trade.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the draft declarations on refugees and free movement
of people within SADC and another one on anti-corruption will
also be considered at the coming summit.

<HEADLINE> UN Subcommission Calls for Lifting of Embargo on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Subcommission
on the Prevention of Discrimination and the Protection of
Minorities has approved a resolution calling on the international
community and the U.N. Security Council to lift economic sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution adopted here Wednesday afternoon, the
subcommission of the UN Commission on Human Rights cited
"unacceptable" declines in the levels of health, nutrition, health
care, employment and agriculture, and a rise in infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
The resolution titled "The Humanitarian Situation in Iraq" said
an embargo that condemned an innocent people to hunger, disease,
ignorance and even death without attaining the objectives for
which it was declared was a flagrant violation of economic, social
and cultural rights and of international law.
</P>
<P>
The Subcommission on the Prevention of Discrimination and the
Protection of Minorities, the Commission on Human Rights'
principal body of experts, began its fiftieth session at the
Palais des Nations in Geneva on August 3 and will end on August 28.
</P>
<P>
Created by the Commission on Human Rights in 1947, the
subcommission is made up of 26 independent experts representing
countries from the five regional groups. According to their
mandate, the experts undertake studies and make recommendations to
the Commission on Human Rights concerning the prevention of
discrimination, the protection of the rights of minorities and the
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Collectors Fancy Food Coupons (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 26 (Xinhua)-- Abolished food coupons, which
used to be called "the lubricating oil of the currency" by Chinese
economists, have set off a new trend in the Chinese collection
market.
</P>
<P>
In a collectors center in Hangzhou, the capital of east China's
Zhejiang Province, food coupons of various designs are carefully
classified and displayed, and sellers and collectors bargain for
the colorful certificates.
</P>
<P>
Food coupons were used for about forty years in China until
their withdrawal from the country's grain circulation system in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
For decades, each Chinese urban resident was allocated food
coupons with a fixed monthly quota of 13 kilograms due to the food
shortage, and one could not buy foodstuffs in stores without them.
</P>
<P>
But all this is now a thing of the past. Today, food coupons are
becoming collectors' items for some people all over the country.
</P>
<P>
One Hangzhou coupon seller, Xie Liejun, aged 42, said that
food coupons issued in the early 1960s are the most valuable,
because many Chinese people couldn't get enough food to eat at
that time. In his stall display, one food coupon issued in 1960
with a face value of 0.5 kilograms was priced at 300 yuan
(about 36 U.S. dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
Yu Jiazheng, secretary-general of the Zhejiang Collection
Association, said that over the past forty years about 2,000
food-coupon in 10,000 editions were issued by the central
government and governments at the provincial and municipal levels.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Zhu Lianke, 74, a retired PLA officer in Hangzhou,
held an exhibition of his private collection of more than 10,000
food coupons issued by 30 provinces and autonomous regions at
different periods. His fascinating collection is the fruit of
searches made by him and his friends all over the country.
</P>
<P>
The food coupons issued during the Cultural Revolution
(1966-1976) are the Zhu's favorites, some of which are printed
with Mao Zedong's quotations and pictures of the Red Guards.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that one entrepreneur offered two million yuan (about
240,000 U.S. dollars) to buy his collection, but he
declined. Instead, he plans to open a coupon museum to display the
marked imprint of past times.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Hangzhou Food Bureau, who used to be in
charge of distributing these coupons, said the first coupon in
Hangzhou was issued in 1955, and that besides food coupons, there
were 22 other kinds needed by residents to buy necessities like
clothing, matches, salt, cigarettes, soaps, wine and pork.
</P>
<P>
Mao Zhaoxi, a history professor at Hangzhou University, said
that these abolished coupons are witnesses to China's development
since the economic reforms and opening up began in 1978.

<HEADLINE> India's Agriculture Exports Decline in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- India's agriculture exports in
1997-98 are estimated to have declined mainly due to a drop in
food grain exports from 37,840 million rupees (995.79 million U.S.
dollars) to 24,800 million rupees (652.63 million dollars) in
value terms, official sources said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Though "Basmati" rice exports rose to 1.674 million tons as
against 1.247 million tons during the previous year, on the whole
there was a decline in exports of many of the farm products. One
of the areas which witnessed a drastic fall in exports was wheat
which fell from 700,000 tons to very negligible levels.
</P>
<P>
Oil meals exports fell from 3.495 million tons to 3.403 million
tons. Processed vegetables fell from 116,000 tons to 109,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
As a percentage of the total exports, the share of farm product
exports fell to 15.87 percent in 1997-98 from previous year's
17.96 percent.

<HEADLINE> HK External trade Registers Sharper Decrease in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's
re-exports, domestic exports and imports in July this year all
registered sharper year-on-year decreases than in the preceding
months.
</P>
<P>
This is revealed in the external trade figures for July
released Thursday by the Census and Statistics Department of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports (comprising re-exports and domestic
exports) decreased by 13 percent in July 1998 over a year earlier
to 119.1 billion HK dollars (15.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the total, the value of re-exports decreased by 13
percent to 100.9 billion HK dollars (12.9 billion U.S. dollars),
while that of domestic exports fell by 10 percent to 18.2
billion HK dollars (2.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of imports decreased even more substantially in July,
by 18 percent over a year earlier to 123.1 billion HK dollars
(15.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade deficit of 4.0 billion HK dollars (0.51 billion
U.S. dollars), equivalent to 3.3 percent of the value of imports,
was recorded in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
On these latest trade figures, a Government Secretariat
spokesman noted that the marked decline in exports was due in
part to the disruption in air cargo handling services at the new
airport during the month.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the spokesman said, the serious flooding in
Central China could have disrupted Hong Kong's exports by rail to
the Chinese mainland. Apart from the influence of these disruption
factors, the setback in exports in July also occurred as a
continuation of the weak export performance caused by the plunge
in import demand from Japan, South Korea and the ASEAN economies.

<HEADLINE> Drive Responsible For Bus Accident Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The driver responsible for the
bus accident that killed seven people, including six from Taiwan,
in Gansu Province last Saturday has been arrested, according to
local sources.
</P>
<P>
Wei Guiguo was found to be the driver of the truck which
crossed the median strip and collided head-on with a tour bus
carrying 17 people, 14 of them tourists from Taiwan, on August
22. The tour bus driver and five Taiwan tourists were killed
instantly and another Taiwan resident died later.
</P>
<P>
The high speed of the two vehicles is believed to have been a
factor, sources said, adding that it will take at least 40 days
before a verdict is decided.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the local police returned the belongings
recovered at the accident scene to the victims' relatives who
expressed appreciation for the efforts the government has made in
handling the accident.

<HEADLINE> Two Bodies Spotted at Plane Crash Site in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers spotted the bodies of
two females as they approached the crash site of a passenger plane
in mountains in western Nepal, an officer said.
</P>
<P>
"It is very confirmed," said Surash Acharya, who is in charge
of information dissemination at the Rescue and Coordination Center
at the capital's Tribhuvan International Airport.
</P>
<P>
He said no other bodies could be seen, adding that the rescue
team saw the bodies 15 meters away from the crash site at an
altitude of 12,000 feet (some 4,000 meters) about 13 kilometers
southwest of Mt. Annapurna I.
</P>
<P>
He said the path towards the crash site is very tough and
steep, and the rescue team had returned to its base camp, about
700 meters away from the crash site, for food.
</P>
<P>
The police were trying to reach the crash site with the help of
helicopter and rope, but it was getting more and more foggy there,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Twin Otter aircraft lost contact five minutes after taking
off last Friday in Jomsom, western Nepal. It was found crashed
into pieces Tuesday morning at the crash site. Those 18 on board
include three crew members and three Indians.
</P>
<P>
Rain and thick fog hampered the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
Armymen managed Wednesday to build a helipad near the crash
site and 12 persons were dropped there, the local radio and
television reported.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated aircraft was leased by the private-owned Lumbini
Airways.

<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China's procuratorial offices
intend to intensify their efforts against the misappropriation of
donations in order to maintain stable social order in the
country's flood-ravaged areas.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhubin, procurator-general of the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, made this remark at a recent national working
conference.
</P>
<P>
While calling on procuratorial organs at all levels to make
greater contributions to the ongoing flood-fighting campaign, Han
ordered his subordinates to focus their attention on such illicit
activities as robbery, theft, disruption of disaster-relief
facilities, embezzlement of donations, and hoarding and
profiteering.
</P>
<P>
According to China's Criminal Law, the above
activities receive heavier punishments since they have
a serious negative impact on disaster-relief work and on the
society.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't Denies Rift Between Defense Chief, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Thursday denied there is a rift between Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado and some military officers.
</P>
<P>
In his regular press briefing, Presidential Spokesman Jerry
Barican said that top military officers led by Armed Forces Chief
of Staff Joselin Nazareno have reiterated their allegiance to the
Constitution as well as to President Joseph Estrada and Mercado.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mercado, who is on a six-day official trip to
Indonesia, Brunei and Thailand, declared Thursday that he is ready
to quit his post if Estrada would side with some military
generals.
</P>
<P>
Mercado made the statement in an interview with Radio Station
DZXL to air his stance after the Association of Generals and Flag
Officers (AGFO), a group composed of retired generals, accused him
of publicly berating a ranking general before other ranking
officers.
</P>
<P>
The word war erupted when 650 retired generals reacted to the
alleged arrogance of Mercado and his statement that generals are
incompetent and corrupt as he ordered an investigation of the
military-run financial institution, the Retirement Service Benefit
System, of reported irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Catalino Villanueva, AGFO president, said in a statement that
many of the generals are competent. He asked Mercado to stop
making sweeping accusation "that generals are incompetent and
corrupt."
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Mercado said that if the president has no
more confidence in him, he is ready to quit.
</P>
<P>
Barican stressed that Mercado has the president's full support,
trust and confidence.
</P>
<P>
He said that aside from reaffirming their unswerving loyalty to
the president and Mercado, the military top brass also supported
the president's order for an investigation of fund anomalies in
the Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada has said that the Department of National
Defense should push through with such an investigation in line
with his administration's campaign against graft and corruption.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: South Africa Vows to Hunt down Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The South African
authorities have vowed to hunt down the bombers behind Tuesday's
deadly blast in a Cape Town restaurant, which is possibly "the
first incident of international terror" on South African soil.
</P>
<P>
"The government is of firm resolve that whoever perpetrated
this deed of utter callousness must be assured that we will hunt
them down until justice takes its full course," said a statement
issued Wednesday after a special meeting of all ministers.
</P>
<P>
One man was killed and 27 other people, including
international tourists and children, were injured in Tuesday
night's blast in the U.S.-franchised Planet Hollywood restaurant,
which is located at the heart of a busy leisure complex in Cape
Town.
</P>
<P>
The bombing is suspected to be linked to recent U.S. missile
strikes against the alleged Muslim terrorist bases in Sudan and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The blast has drawn condemnation from around the globe,
including from U.S. President Bill Clinton and South African
President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The statement said: "No one should and will be allowed to use
South African soil to play out their fantasies, whatever their
vile motivation."
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, while inspecting
the scene, reaffirmed that South Africa refused to become the
theater of acts of international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi, fully backed by Justice Minister Dullah Omar, said
there were "firm leads" in the investigation into the case and
arrests were expected soon. But the security minister declined
to give further details.
</P>
<P>
Video footage taken by surveillance cameras mounted behind the
bombed restaurant bar may provide an early breakthrough for
detectives working around the clock to probe the case.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the suspect apparently has links with a
local extremist grouping.
</P>
<P>
Police said that a home-made device, probably a pipe bomb or
variation of such one, caused the explosion. It was not known
how the bomb was detonated.
</P>
<P>
Police have offered a 250,000-Rand (40,000 U.S. Dollars)
reward for information leading to the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a team of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) agents, who had been actively involved in investigating the
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier this
month, have arrived in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South African police are also looking into possible links
between the restaurant bombing and other blasts in recent months
on the Cape Flats, arguably the most volatile area in the
country.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela expressed his confidence in early arrests
following a detailed briefing by National Police Commissioner
George Fivaz.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said that the police are hot on the heels of the
perpetrators. "They (the police) have an idea of who committed
the crime. I am confident they will be arrested soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly was due to hold a special debate on the
bombing Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Condemns Tel Aviv Bombing Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday strongly condemned the bombing attack
in Tel Aviv, which injured a dozen people.
</P>
<P>
"This attack is another sign that we need to fight terror,"
said Netanyahu in his Jerusalem office before meeting former
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the latest attack showed the terrorists were
acting against Israeli civilians not only in the West Bank city
of Hebron but anywhere.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 people were injured Thursday morning when a bomb
put inside a garbage can exploded at an intersection of the
bustling Allenby Street and Rothschild Boulevard. A pregnant woman
and two children were among the injured, one of which is in
serious condition.
</P>
<P>
The others suffered from minor burns to only shock. Tel Aviv
police sealed off the area to conduct investigation immediately
after the blast. They found that the bomb, weighing about one to
two pounds, was packed with nails.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the
police suspected it to be a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv has been a frequent target for Palestinian militants,
led by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), who have been
launching a terror campaign through bombing buses and public
places in order to wreck the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been put on high alert in the past
days following the U.S. missile attacks against suspected Islamic
terrorist bases in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Anti-U.S. Islamic activists have warned to launch retaliatory
attacks against American and Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ahmed Tibi, senior advisor to Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat, also condemned the Tel
Aviv bombing after his meeting with Arafat in the West Bank city
of Ramallah Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bombing should be condemned no matter who
carried it out, because it was aimed at innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Denny Naveh said this
condemnation was far from enough. He demanded the PNA publicly
condemns all the terror attacks against settlers.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Jewish settler was stabbed to death by a
Palestinian in Hebron. Israel has complained that Arafat did not
issue condemnation of it.
</P>
<P>
The latest attack is expected to help Israel increase its
pressure on the PNA to crack down tougher on militants. David Bar
Illan, Netanyahu's media adviser, said Thursday that the peace
process cannot continue unless Israeli security is secured.

GENEVA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Agreement should be possible
within the Conference on Disarmament to negotiate a ban on
transfers of anti-personnel landmines, a special coordinator on
anti-personnel landmine of the conference said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As a result of consultations among regional group coordinators,
three of the regional groups -- China, the Eastern Group and the
Western Group -- had reached a consensus on supporting the
proposals made by special coordinator John B. Campbell, who is
also Australia's disarmament ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said that one group, the Group of 21, still required
further time to consider his proposals. But "I have been advised
of a large measure of support" even within the group where
discussions are continuing, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I remain confident that with some further work in the year
ahead, we shall be able to reach a resolution of the issue and
undertake the work which I believe the majority of members wish
the conference to undertake," Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that a consensus necessary for the
conference to take an early decision to establish an ad hoc
committee would be achieved next year.

LAGOS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar said he will retire from the military after
handing over to an elected civilian government in May next year.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement Wednesday in Pretoria before ending his
three-day official visit to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I have put in at least 35 years in the military and whether I
was going to become the president or not (taking over from late
leader General Sani Abacha), I was going to retire quietly to my
village and that is what I intend to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader asked journalists to judge the sincerity
of his government to hand over power to a civilian administration
by its deeds and not just by its promises.
</P>
<P>
"We have released political prisoners, we have dropped some
charges, and we have set up an independent electoral commission,
which has already been put in place, and have also released the
transition program," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between Nigeria and South Africa, Abubakar
said the problem that made it frosty had been ironed out during
his discussions with President Nelson Mandela and other senior
South African officials in the past few days.

<HEADLINE> Sub-Contract For Australian Military Communications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States' company
Boeing in Australia Thursday signed the first major sub-contract
for a project designed to provide a common communications network
for the Australian Defense Force (ADF) by 2002, linking command
centers with deployed aircraft, ships and land forces.
</P>
<P>
The contract with Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd, worth about 16
million U.S. dollars, is for construction work involved in the
High Frequency Modernization Project.
</P>
<P>
"Thiess will carry out the construction work or modification to
buildings and the civil infrastructure required in support of the
Modernized High Frequency Communications System," said Project
General Manager Tony Swansson after the signing ceremony in
Brisbane, capital city of the state of Queensland, Australia.
</P>
<P>
The project was designed to provide a common network for the
ADF, Australia's armed forces, with telephone-like simplicity.
</P>
<P>
The new system will involve the establishment of transmitter
and receiver stations at North West Cape in the state of Western
Australia, near Darwin city in the Northern Territory, in the
Riverina region of the state of New South Wales and Townsville in
Queensland.
</P>
<P>
Boeing engineers expect to finalize the building and civil
works design of the system during this year and early 1999, with
construction due to be completed during 2000.
</P>
<P>
The ADF force will begin using the system in 2002.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's GDP Down 6.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's gross domestic
product (GDP) fell by 6.6 percent in real terms in the second
quarter of this year, the Bank of Korea said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The GDP fall followed a 3.9-percent contraction registered in
the first quarter, pushing the country's economy into a deeper
recession.
</P>
<P>
The second-quarter contraction was the biggest quarterly drop
since the fourth quarter of 1980 when South Korea suffered a
second "oil shock" and registered a minus 7.8 percent in GDP.
</P>
<P>
Record declines in consumption and investment, coupled with
slower export growth, are blamed for the GDP plunge, said the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that the South Korean economy is expected to
suffer another sharp contraction in the second half of the year
since there are no signs of improvement in consumption, investment
and export.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the South Korean government predicted a 4 percent GDP
contraction for this year. But senior officials, including
Minister of Finance and Economy Lee Kyu-sung, said that a
contraction of five-six percent was almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Some economists here are even more pessimistic, forecasting a
seven-percent contraction in 1998.

SOFIA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov
on Thursday left here for Moscow to begin a three-day visit which
he hopes will help lay a new foundation for the Bulgarian-Russian
relations.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov had said that his Russia trip was aimed at "getting
rid of old prejudice" and laying a new foundation for the future
development of the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The visit, originally scheduled for December 1997 but twice
postponed because of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's health
problem and the natural gas row between the two countries, came
after the ruling and opposition parties reached a wide-ranging
consensus on how to deal with the relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
On August 24-25, Stoyanov held comprehensive and detailed
consultations with Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, former President
Zheliu Zhelev and opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
After these discussions, Stoyanov said that he and the
government had found a common and responsible position on the
Bulgaria-Russia relations.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov said that Bulgaria's bid to join the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the European Union is not directed at
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia was the largest trade partner of Bulgaria in 1997. It is
also crucial for Bulgaria to have Russia's support in its bid to
become the Balkan energy distribution center.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria wants Russia to supply crude oil and natural gas and
take part in laying international pipelines that will run through
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Bulgaria and Russia will discuss this
issue during Stoyanov's Russia tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar crashed

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Down on Yen Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A combination of a weak local
currency, falls in overseas markets and futures selling drove the
Australian sharemarket lower Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index slumped 47.4 points, or 1.82
percent, to 2560.6, off a low of 2553.7.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed in local trade at 56.43.
</P>
<P>
Intersuisse equities manager Andrew Sekely said that the
combination of the weaker Australian dollar, declines in overseas
bourses, particularly in Tokyo and New York, and the futures
contract at a discount forced the local market down.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index closed down 26.8 points, or 2.72
percent, at 958.0 and the all industrials index closed down 74.7
points, or 1.62 percent, at 4538.4.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 285.66 million valued at 1.059 billion
Australian dollars (598.33 million U.S. dollars), with falls
easily outweighing rises 816 to 344 respectively and 406 stocks
were steady.
</P>
<P>
Topping volume was Telstra Corp with a turnover of 16.138
million shares, with its instalment receipts losing five cents, or
1.12 percent.
</P>
<P>
BHP led the market lower, plunging 53.9 cents, or 4.03 percent,
as weaker commodity prices and concerns over less Japanese demand
for exports spooked investors, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
Other resource stocks also lost ground, with WMC falling 12 and
Rio Tinto dropping 29.4.
</P>
<P>
ANZ Banking Group, which has significant overseas operations
and has had trouble in the volatile Russian market, was the big
loser among the banks, plunging 42, or 4.29 percent, National
Australia Bank fell 37.5, Westpac Banking Corp fell 16 and
Commonwealth Bank of Australia fell 20.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts Insurance Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Participants at an insurance
seminar held here today urged the insurance industry to draw
lessons from the Asia financial crisis and work out
countermeasures to offset the negative impact of the crisis on
China's insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 experts and scholars from the Chinese mainland
and Taiwan are participating in the seminar, sponsored
by the China Insurance Society.
</P>
<P>
The participants discussed such topics as the development of
the insurance industry in the mainland and Taiwan, the impact of
the Asian financial crisis on the insurance industry and possible
countermeasures, motor vehicle insurance, life insurance, capital
management and insurance supervision.
</P>
<P>
The speakers generally agreed that, although the Asian
crisis did not have a direct impact on the insurance industry of
the mainland and Taiwan, the indirect negative impact should not
be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
Wu Min from the Reinsurance Company of the People's Insurance
Company of China said that to offset the negative consequences of
the financial crisis, China's insurance industry should give full
support to the government's economic reforms and restructure
business operations in accordance with the law of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that supervision of the insurance industry should
be reinforced, and related laws and regulations be further
improved so that China's insurance market can develop in a healthy
fashion.
</P>
<P>
Hu Xinmin, managing deputy manager of Hua An Property Insurance
Co. Ltd., said that China's insurance industry should pay close
attention to the Asian financial crisis and adopt effective measures
as early as possible to avoid risks.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that stricter supervision should be made over the
development of life insurance products; capital management should
be regulated to prevent non-performing assets; a scientific
supervision index system should be established to focus on payment
ability; and insurance companies' internal control should be
improved.
</P>
<P>
According to World Bank estimates, by the year 2000 insurance
premiums in the Chinese mainland will total some 200 billion
yuan, while at present it is only about 100 billion yuan,
indicating great potential for the Chinese insurance market.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Northern Warlord Seeking Turkish Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Afghan northern warlord Abdul
Rashid Dostum is seeking support from Turkey in order to form a
front against the Taliban militia, local newspaper Turkiye
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dostum, a former general of the Uzbek militia, arrived here two
days ago for a visit. He told Turkiye in an exclusive interview
that he hoped that Turkey would exert efforts to contain the
Taliban militia in Afghanistan, which has contolled most of the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Dostum held talks on Wednesday with high-ranking officials of
the General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces, the Foreign
Ministry and the Organization of the National Intelligence on the
latest developments in Afghanistan, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has urged the Pakistan, Taliban's strong supporter, to
prevent the Taliban militia from harming the civilians and
innocent people in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that permanent peace could only be established
in Afghanistan through peaceful means and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Dostum told the paper that he did not escape from Afghanistan
and would stay in Turkey for another two days before returning to
his country for the fighting to "liberate Afghanistan".
</P>
<P>
He said that new attacks would be launched against the Taliban
forces, which have recently conquered Mazari Sharif, a major
northern stronghold for the Northern Alliance led by the ousted
President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Dostum turned to support Rabbani after the Taliban forces drove
his government out of the capital Kabul in September 1996.

<HEADLINE> Another Assassin of Former Chief Prosecutor Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Another assassin of the former
Iranian chief prosecutor Assadollah Lajevardi has been arrested,
the officials Iranian News Agency IRNA reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The assassin, whose name was not revealed, was arrested while
attempting to cross the border into Iraq, the IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
He also came from the outlawed Mujaheddin Khalq Organization
(MKO), which has claimed responsibility for the last Sunday's
shooting of Lajevardi, former head of the Prisons Organization.
</P>
<P>
The MKO member escaped the scene after shooting dead Lajevardi
at his shop in Tehran grand bazaar, but his accomplice Ali Akbar
Akbar Dehbalai was arrested by the police after being
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Dehbalai late died of his wounds Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The MKO is one of the major political groups which toppled the
former Iranian Shah regime in 1979, but it was outlawed in 1981
due to sharp differences with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, the MKO launched a series of attacks on
Iranian interests inside and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, the Iranian air force has carried out several
air raids on the MKO bases inside Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Ruling Party Asks Opposition to Stop Hostilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Cambodian People's
Party (CPP) Thursday called on all political parties to stop
hostilities and expressed its determination to resolutely oppose
any attempt to form an interim government.
</P>
<P>
The CPP, led by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, made a
three-point statement Thursday accusing some party leaders of
making provocative speeches on the CPP and its leaders.
</P>
<P>
It asked the opposition parties led by Sam Rainsy and Prince
Norodom Ranariddh to stop illegal demonstrations and other
activities against the CPP, saying that they do not serve the
interests of the country, people and political parties.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the CPP made an official public response
to opposition's sit-in demonstrations beginning from Monday and to
Ranariddh's call for the formation of an interim government led by
King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the CPP believes that any attempt to form an
interim government will violate the country's Constitution and
sabotage the spirit of the Paris peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It is especially against the will of the Cambodian people and
the results of the July 26 elections which were held freely and
fairly under the observation of the international community," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on those parties who had won the seats in
the new parliament to respect country's laws and the will of the
voters to maintain the order of the society.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CPP said it plans to hold a meeting with
Funcinpec party at any time to resolve the problems the country
now faces with.
</P>
<P>
The two major opposition political parties had rejected the
election results and vowed to block the formation of a new
government until their complaints are satisfied. Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy even demanded Hun Sen to step down, saying they will not
join the government led by him.

<HEADLINE> More Companies Producing Biological Pharmaceuticals in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- More and more Chinese investors
are trying their luck by investing in applied biological
engineering technology for the production of pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 200 biological pharmaceutical companies
across the country, of which 24 are listed on the stock markets,
according to a recent symposium on the industrial use of genetic
technology.
</P>
<P>
Last year, only two of these companies had sales exceeding 100
million yuan (12 million US dollars), and most of them did a
limited business, with sales ranging from a couple of million yuan
to several tens of millions.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the combined sales of all Chinese
bio-pharmaceutical producers in the past year was less than the
annual output value generated by one similar medium-size company
in the United States or Japan.
</P>
<P>
Ke Chuankui, general manager of the Jiuyuan Genetic Engineering
Co. Ltd. based in Hangzhou, the capital of east China's Zhejiang
Province, said, "this shows China, as a country with large genetic
resources, has great potential for the production and marketing of
genetic-engineering pharmaceuticals."
</P>
<P>
The industrial use of bio-engineering technology is widely
valued in different localities around the country. All of China's
existing 52 state-level high-tech industrial development zones
have listed the industrial use of bio-engineering technology as a
major project for accelerated development.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese government provides preferential policies to
encourage the industrial use of bio-engineering technology, a
large number of traditional chemical pharmaceutical makers have
increased investment in the research, clinical testings and
processing of genetic medicines.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Japanese government
officials, experts, scholars and entrepreneurs have expressed their
desire to further enhance bilateral cooperation in environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
They made this clear earlier today at a Sino-Japanese
environmental protection forum jointly sponsored by the China
Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the
Japan-China Association on Economy and Trade.
</P>
<P>
During the forum, about 200 representatives from the two
countries discussed issues such as environmental protection
policies and their mutual experience and bilateral cooperation in
this field.
</P>
<P>
Qu Geping, chairman of the Environment and Resources Protection
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, said that
China has a positive attitude toward international and regional
cooperation for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
With the support and joint efforts of the governments and
peoples of the two countries, he said, China and Japan have
enjoyed good cooperative relations in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral cooperation at various levels for environmental
policies, technologies and industries has exerted an important
influence in upgrading China's technologies, effectively
implementing the country's plans, and improving the environment of
China and the Asian-Pacific region, noted Qu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Sino-Japanese exchanges and cooperation in
environmental protection is not only conducive to the
consolidation and development of bilateral economic and trade
relations, but also conducive to global cooperation on the
environment and the settlement of related problems.
</P>
<P>
There is great potential for bilateral exchanges and
cooperation in this field, Qu said, adding he hopes that China and
Japan can continue efforts for furthering bilateral cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Fourth Bus Blast in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Another bus explosion took
place in Uganda Wednesday, at least one woman was injured.
</P>
<P>
The Kampala-bound bus was carrying 60 passengers on Kabale
road, some 22 kilometers from Mbarara town. The blast occurred at
about 5:30 p.m. local time, said a report reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fire caused by the blast engulfed the lower section of the bus
and crushed the driving shaft. The panic-stricken passengers
scrambled out of the flaming bus in time to escape the sizzling
inferno.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the explosion is under investigation, police said.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth bus in less than two days to be involved in
an explosion incident.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, bomb explosions occurred on three buses going to
different destinations, killing 30 people and injuring many
others.
</P>
<P>
The bombs are suspected to have been planted in Kampala
because all the three ill-fated buses allegedly traveled out of
the Baganda bus station in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Wednesday, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni strongly condemned the terrorist attacks and vowed to
use every means to bring the perpetrators to book.

TOKYO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices continued tumbling in
Tokyo Thursday with the key Nikkei index temporarily dropping to
its lowest level in three years.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First

for the year.
</P>
<P>
The index temporarily fell as low as 14,378.67, its lowest
level since July 3, 1995 when it marked 14,295.90.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, also slumped to a new closing low for the

shares from Wednesday's 412.26 million Wednesday.

</P>
<P>

<P>
LOS ANGELSE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Internet economy of the
United States will grow to 518 billion U.S. dollars in 2002, the
research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) forecast this
week.
</P>
<P>
IDC defines the Internet economy, which will come to 124
billion dollars in 1998, as the combination of spending to build
Web businesses and applications and the revenue from products and
services sold over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
While technology deployment is the lion's share of the economy,
IDC said, significant spending is also occurring in marketing and
branding activities, professional services, content creation and
education and training.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of hard goods are leading the spending in 1998,
with an estimated 23 billion dollars being invested by the
industry segment in Web applications for extranet, intranets and
commerce Web sites. Next among the top five industries are
communications/media and banking, each with 15 billion dollars to
be spent this year.
</P>
<P>
IDC said that it will announce its findings for the size and
future growth of the worldwide Internet economy at an Internet
executive forum to be held in September in San Jose, California.
</P>
<P>
The conference will examine the business models driving the
Internet economy and the barriers that must be overcome to fulfill
its potential.
</P>
<P>
IDC's research on the Internet economy is based on an analysis
of information technology (IT) budgets across major industries, as
well as non-IT budget technology spending. In addition, IDC
conducted a survey of 600 architects of the Internet economy.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency, the
state news agency of China, and Bernama, the national news agency
of Malaysia, signed here Thursday an agreement on cooperation in
marketing Xinhua news services in both English and Chinese in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
With the signing of the agreement, Xinhua news services will be
made directly available to subscribers in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Zhang Guoliang, director of Asia
Pacific Region of Xinhua News Agency, and Syed Jamil Syed Jaafar,
acting general manager of Bernama on behalf of their respective
news agencies.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks on the occasion, Syed Jamil said that
the cooperation would see newspapers and publications especially

benefiting from Xinhua's in-depth and comprehensive coverage of
China's mainland, Hong Kong, the surrounding regions and also the
world from an Asian perspective.
</P>
<P>
Syed Jamil said local companies with investments in China would
find Xinhua a reliable source of government, business and general
information which could be useful for making prudent investment
and business decisions.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guoliang introduced Xinhua News Agency on the occasion
and said "The people and organizations of countries and regions
are watching closely what happens in China and to meet their
needs, Xinhua, as the official news agency of China, can provide
comprehensive, accurate and authoritative news about China."
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that there is a big market in the Asia-Pacific
region for Xinhua news services as countries in the region have
maintained age-old friendly relations, close economic links and
frequent contacts with China.

words or characters in seven languages and 100 news photos daily

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar hit a
12-year low Thursday as shock waves from the plunging Russian
ruble rocked financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The TV New Zealand reported this evening that the New Zealand
dollar fell to 48.11 cents of the U.S. dollar in Thursday's early
trading before bouncing back to 48.59 cents of the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The NZ dollar sell-off was bad news for the Reserve Bank, the
central bank of the country, which on Wednesday warned markets
that interest rates and the NZ dollar had fallen "too much". Local
financial markets responded by pushing the monetary conditions
index from negative 100 to negative 80.
</P>
<P>
The index measures the NZ dollar and interest rates. However,
the index of negative 80 was still outside the bank's desired
level, set a week ago of zero with a 50 point comfort zone either
side.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale interest rates rose Thursday to compensate for the
fall of the NZ dollar, with 90-day bank bills at 6.7 percent from
6.3 percent late last week.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project May Have Saved Flood Victims, Experts Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Three Gorges Dam Project
would have greatly ameliorated the damage done by the current
Yangtze River flooding at the mid and lower reaches of the river
if it were now in operation, according to experts quoted today in
the Beijing Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The project, located near Yichang in central China's Hubei
Province, is a key state project for harnessing the Yangtze River
in a comprehensive way. With the cost of construction estimated at
50.09 billion yuan (6.05 billion U.S. dollars), the dam will have
many functions including flood control, power generation and the
facilitation of shipping on the river.
</P>
<P>
In July, the dam saw 12.16 billion cubic meters of water
flowing from the upper reaches, the largest amount in 121 years,
with an average flow rate of 45,400 cubic meters per second. Most
of the floodwater also came from the upper reaches in August.
</P>
<P>
This makes prominent the project's intended role in storing
water, which can prevent and control the crest from the upper
reaches from converging with those at the middle reaches, and
thereby protect 15 million people and 1.53 million hectares of
arable land in the lower reaches, according to experts with the
State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The massive reservoir will have a storage capacity of 22.15
billion cubic meters of water, four times that of the storage
capacity of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area.
</P>
<P>
"The operation of the reservoir will make the water diversion
project in the Jingjiang section almost unnecessary," said one
expert.
</P>
<P>
At the Jingjiang section of the Yangtze River, floods should
be diverted when the water flow rates reach 60,000 cubic meters
per second. And the situation becomes precarious when the flow
rate rises above 80,000 cubic meter per second.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Dam Project, scheduled for completion in the
year 2009, has a designed capacity to handle water flows rates as
high as 122,000 cubic meters per second, greatly enhancing its
flood-fighting capability.
</P>
<P>
The dam will be able to reduce the water flow rate from 87,100
cubic meter per second to 56,700 cubic meter per second, enabling
the water to go downstreams safely without the need for resorting
to diversions, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Zoologists Discover "Twin Oocytes" in Giant Pandas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists working in
the Research Center for Giant Panda Breeding in Chengdu, capital
of southwest China's Sichuan Province, recently discovered "twin
oocytes" in the ovaries of two dead giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
Their discovery will provide new clues to explain why giant
pandas have such a high birth rate for twins.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Meijia, a zoologist at the center, said that first twin
oocytes were removed from the ovaries of a giant panda which died
of cirrhosis in August last year.
</P>
<P>
Researchers removed the eggs for external fertilization and
during the process found two small oocytes closely surrounded by
cumulus cells.
</P>
<P>
"The phenomenon, which we named "twin oocytes", has never been
reported in other animals", said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, researchers found another pair of "twin
oocytes" in a giant panda which died of senility. The discovery
led researchers to infer that "twin oocytes" commonly exist in the
ovaries of giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
The population of the endangered species currently stands at
around 1,000 pandas. While giant pandas are known to have a low
fertility,
</P>
<P>
statistics show that some 52 percent of giant pandas living in
captivity worldwide give birth to twins. However, extensive
experiments have determined the nonexistence of identical twins.
</P>
<P>
This has led some zoologists to conjecture that this has
resulted from repeated artificial fertilization which releases ova
at different times.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang and his colleagues at the research base contend
the birth rate for giant panda twins is the result of "twin
oocytes".
</P>
<P>
"We plan to conduct further studies to determine how 'twin
oocytes' are formed and grow," said Zhang.

<HEADLINE> Procrastination Adversely Impacts Cross-Straits Relations. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The most urgent task facing both
sides of the Taiwan Straits is to hold preparatory talks
concerning the timing, venue and topics for political
negotiations, according to one noted Chinese researcher.
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that the procrastination and evasive
tactics adopted by the Taiwan side have adversely impacted
cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zaixi, a senior researcher with the China International
Strategic Studies, made the remarks in his signed article
published here today.
</P>
<P>
The 13th Session on National Reunification held in Taiwan in
late July ended with Taiwan authorities adopting a negative
attitude on the subject. They went so far as to table a proposal
for "ending hostilities by signing a cross-Straits peace agreement
based on the separate jurisdiction of parties on either side of
the Taiwan Straits", said Wang. He added the situation has thus
been the subject of great concern.
</P>
<P>
On May 20, 1996, the Taiwan authorities expressed their desire
to open negotiations free of any preconditions, and thereafter
reiterated the proposal on several occassions. Now, however, they
insist that the Chinese mainland recognize separate jurisdiction
prior to opening negotiations. "Does this represent a complete
reversal in previous position Taiwan authorities held concerning
negotiations?" questioned Wang.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan side sincerely adheres to the "reunification
goal" then there is no reason to oppose the mainland proposal for
"opening negotiations under the one China principle", according to
Wang. He added that it would be meaningless to hold negotiations
without adhering to the one China principle and China's
reunification goal.
</P>
<P>
The most recent poll conducted by the Taiwan authorities
indicate that some 52 percent of the common people in the island
province approve of opening negotiations across the straits.

The explosion went off in a trash can at about 0850 local time
(0550 GMT) at a corner of the Allenby Street, which is one of the
busiest in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
A bus carrying passengers just left the scene before the
exposion, otherwise, the explosion could have caused more injuries
or damage, the police added.
</P>
<P>
A pregnant woman and two children were among the injured, and
two of the injured were in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the bombing, Israeli police sealed off the
scene to conduct investigation into the incident.
</P>
<P>
No one has yet claimed responsibility for the explosion, but
the police suspected that it could be a terror attack.

CHANGSHA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Law enforcement departments in
central China's Hunan Province recently cracked a case of fraud
involving use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
In June this year, Liu Zheng and five co-conspirators listed
false information via the Internet in the name of Xing Yuan
Corp.. The conspirators defrauded a company in Shenzhen, south
China's Guangdong Province, of 150,000 fabric bags valued at
200,000 yuan (24,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The conspirators sold the bags to neighboring counties and
cities in need of flood relief materials, and have since
squandered over 90,000 yuan received as a result of the fraudulent
Internet transaction.
</P>
<P>
The Hunan Public Security Bureau investigated the case for some
20 days and arrested the six co-conspirators in early August.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Needs 1.673 Bln Dollars to Stimulate Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will raise funds
to inject an additional 7.03 billion ringgit (about 1.673 billion
U.S. dollars) in order to stimulate the economy, Special Functions
Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This additional allocation will be used to increase the demand
for goods and services, and implement projects to increase the
country's competitiveness while instituting a social safety net
for vulnerable groups in the society, he said in his keynote
address at the Round Table Discussion on the National Economic
Recovery Plan organized by the Oxford and Cambridge Society.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government will not hesitate to borrow from
abroad to finance its recovery plan, Daim said.
</P>
<P>
"The banking sector too has to contribute by shaking off its
over cautiousness towards lending, which if continued will further
choke the economy to death," he said, adding "by all means, be
prudent, but do not deny credit to profitable ventures. It is good
to remember that if all activities come to a halt, the banks
themselves will grind to a halt."
</P>
<P>
Daim said that Malaysia always welcomes foreign investment but
it is concerned about speculative "hot money" which creates
instability.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government is still open to productive ideas on
what else needs to be done to strengthen the financial and
corporate sectors or the capital market, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "it might also be timely for Malaysia to explore new
avenues, other than banks and the stock market, to source the
capital, and to meet our investment requirements."
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, the government is committed towards the
further development of the private debt securities market," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that contrary to prescriptions suggested by the
International Monetary Fund, an easier monetary policy and fiscal
expansion will be Malaysia's strategy to avert any possibility of
a depression.
</P>
<P>
"We at this stage should be concerned about deflation rather
than inflation since a deflationary situation will put further
pressure on our banking system and erode the efforts taken so far
to strengthen the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Daim admitted that there was a crisis of confidence in the
country and that the private sector had lost total confidence.
</P>
<P>
He urged the private sector to come forward and tell the
government the real problems they are facing now, saying "We are
not interested in bailing them out but make policies to help them
out."

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce Blood Tests in Cycling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China has joined the
anti-doping campaign launched by the Union Cycliste
Internationale (UCI)by carrying out blood tests in cycling for
the first time in the country's sporting history.
</P>
<P>
Blood testing will make its debut in China's National Track
Championships slated for September 9-13 in the eastern Chinese
city Nanjing, chairman of Chinese Cycling Union (CCU) Cai Jiadong
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move was a response to UCI's announcement two weeks ago
which outlined a campaign to rid the cycling sport of the doping
scandals plaguing the Tour de France last month, Cai said.
</P>
<P>
All the Chinese cyclists participating in national events are
subject to blood tests conducted by CCU, which will act in
accordance with the testing rules of UCI and the International
Olympic Committee (IOC), a statement issued by CCU said.
</P>
<P>
Blood tests are designed to check erythropoietin (EPO), a
banned substance to increase red blood cells in the body which
cannot be reliably detected. In general, doctors measure
packed-cell volume, a measure of red-blood-cell concentrations to
determine whether EPO has been taken.
</P>
<P>
The UCI set a cut-off of 0.5 and above that level EPO is
assumed to be used. The CCU adopted a lower 0.47 for the women
cyclists.

<HEADLINE> Industrialization of Genetic Engineering Projects Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese genetic engineers,
businessmen and securities market officials have called for more
rapid industrialization of genetic engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
Participants at a recent natinal symposium on
genetic-engineering industrialization held here urged the early
establishment of risk investment an innovation systems for such
projects.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists believe that if they can abandon low-level
and repetitive research, the country's genetic engineering will
surely catch up to world standards.
</P>
<P>
Wong Yannian, head of the China Society of Biological
Engineering, said China has bred dozens of trans-genetic animal
and plant species.
</P>
<P>
He said that trans-genetic rice, wheat, rape, rubber tree and
cane seeds developed by Chinese scientists have been applied to
field production.
</P>
<P>
Wong added that scientists have developed trans-genetic cotton
seeds which can kill at least 80 percent of the cotton boll
weevil, and that 15 varieties of trans-genetic cotton seeds are
now in trial production.
</P>
<P>
China has also begun factory production of grape, apple, and
banana tube tree seedlings.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that China has taken the lead in the development of
trans-genetic fish, having developed over 10,000 trans-genetic
fish species.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have also developed gene-engineered
lean-meat pigs and trans-genetic sheep, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Lindsay Davenport
of the United States saved her strength with a walk-over victory
while third seed Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain was upset by
an unseeded player today at the Pilot Pen tennis tournament in
New Haven, Connecticut, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, the defending champion, is seeking her fourth
straight title this year, walked over Spain's Virginia
Ruano-Pascual. But Sanchez-Vicario was surprisingly beaten by
Julie Halard-Decugis of France 6-7 (6-8), 2-6 in a bizarre match
postponed hours by rain.
</P>
<P>
Halard-Decugis, who missed most of 1997 due to knee, shoulder
an wrist injuries, said she was making some mistakes in the
beginning. "I just tired to focus more. There was so many going
to the eyes and mouth and everywhere, and it was difficult to
play." By the middle of the second set, both had to contend with
the unsettling cloud of gnats.
</P>
<P>
"I make too many unforced errors. She played much more
consistent than myself," Sanchez-Vicario said.
</P>
<P>
Seeded second at next week's U.S. Open, Davenport could
overtake Martina Hingis of Switzerland as the world's top-ranked
player if she wins the final Grand Slam event of the year. She
has won 12 straight matches, including a three-set triumph over
Hingis in the Acura Classic final two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, who won Wimbledon this year and ranked third in the
world, beat American Chanda Rubin today 6-1, 7-5. Novotna has won
four titles this year while compiling a 42-9 season record.
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Germany's Anke Huber knocked off sixth seed
Patty Schnyder of Switzerland 7-5, 7-6 (7-2). Schnyder leads the
WTA Tour with five singles titles this year. Huber will meet
Davenport in the next round.
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Amanda Coetzer of South Africa ousted Russian teenager
Anna Kournikova 1-6, 6-4, 7-5, to set up a quarterfinal meeting
with fourth seed Steffi Graf of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Graf, tuning up for her long-awaited return to the U.S. Open,
accepted a wild-card entry into this event, which she won three
times. Despite being ranked 38th in the world, Graf will be an
eighth seed at next week's Open in New York. She missed last
year's Grand Slam event after undergoing season-ending knee
surgery.

The biannual Tiger Cup is southeast Asia's biggest soccer

The Tiger Cup was originally scheduled to be held in Indonesia
before social and economic upheavals in that country forced

Malaysia, which had originally offered to stand in as late
replacement for Indonesia, decided not to host it because it was

<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- An Egypt Air flight took off early
Thursday for Khartoum carrying 40 tonnes of medicines, food and
other relief aid to help relieve the suffering of the people in
the famine-stricken Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The aid was ordered by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and was
aimed at expressing Cairo's solidarity with its neighboring Sudan,
the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another planeload of relief supplies is scheduled
to sent to Kenya on Friday, which suffered a terror bombing attack
against the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi on August 7.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak had already dispatched to Kenya a medical team, led by
Minister of Health Ismail Sallam, to help treat the victims of the
blast of the American Embassy in Nairobi, which killed over 200
people and wounded thousands of others.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's 15-year civil war, combined with famine, has left 2.5
million people suffering from lack of food.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the U.S. missile strike destroyed a
pharmaceutical factory near Khartoum, which provided the country
with 50 percent of its needs of medicines
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched the attacks in what it claimed retaliation
against the twin bombings against its embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on August 7.
</P>
<P>
Washington, which has been accusing Sudan of sponsoring
international terrorism, claimed the factory was manufacturing
chemical weapons agents that could be used by Islamic militants to
launch new attacks against U.S. targets.

<P>
BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-year-old female giant
panda, Jiajia, and male giant panda, An'an, 12, winners of a
so-called "beauty contest" for the endangered species will be
moved to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) by
early next year.
</P>
<P>
The giant pandas will be moved upon completion of their new
enclosure in the Hong Kong Park.
</P>
<P>
Jiajia and An'an, the central government's special gifts to
Hong Kong, were selected from over 100 giant pandas housed in
inland zoos or giant panda breeding centers.
</P>
<P>
An official from China's Giant Panda Protection Project office
said that health, appearance, age and character were the main
criteria in selecting China's "Miss and Mister Giant Panda
Contest."
</P>
<P>
The two giant pandas are currently enjoying meals constisting
of milk, vitamins, eggs and various special nutritious food items,
in addition to their staple food bamboo.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists note that their initial diets in Hong Kong will
consist of food shipped from inland areas. However, they will be
introduced to local food once acclimated to the new surroundings.
</P>
<P>
The zoologists are confident the pair will accept bamboo grown
in Hong Kong since giant pandas housed in zoos in southern China
readily adapt to local bamboo.
</P>
<P>
Jiajia currently weighs over 80 kg and An'an tips the scales at
90 kilograms. Both of the orphaned animals were in poor health
when found.
</P>
<P>
Jiajia has been housed in the Wolong Giant Panda Protection
Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province, with An'an housed in
the city of Shenzhen which neighbors the HKSAR..
</P>
<P>
Zoologists point out that the fertility of giant pandas is
generally quite low. Nonetheless, Jiajia birthed six cubs between
1992-1996, with five of her offspring thriving as of this report.

(about 270,000 U.S. dollars). Some 100 apartments, four public
buildings and 10 vehicles were hit, and damage was also caused to
farmland.

Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Both Israeli and Palestinian officials tried to lower
expectations on progress in the peace talks on Wednesday. Nabil
Abu Rudeina, Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat's advisor, said that the gaps between two sides remained
wide. And sources in Israeli Prime Minister's Office said that
the optimism about the negotiations was exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Most ministers of Israeli Cabinet supported the idea to
attack the infrastructure in Lebanon after Hezbollah fired rockets
at the northern towns of Israel Tuesday night. They said that
the attack would be aimed at forcing the Lebanese government
to restrain anti-Israel guerrillas in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Sihanouk: Constitutional Change Possible Only With Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom
Sihanouk said Wednesday that the three major elected parties need
to reach an agreement on Constitutional amendment in order to make
it easier to form a new government, Cambodia Daily reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The King said in an interview that "an amendment to our
Constitution will be possible if the presidents of the three big
parties, elected by our respected and beloved people in the July
26 elections, all agree to have such an amendment."
</P>
<P>
The King, meanwhile, thanked the confidence Surin Pitsuwan,
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Thailand, placed in him. Surin
Pitsuwan suggested the King intervene in order to calm the
passions and to put the current political crisis in Phnom Penh to
an end.
</P>
<P>
"At the present time, an action or initiative of King Norodom
Sihanouk is conceivable and possible only if Hun Sen, Prince
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy request me together to enter into action
to try to carry out this or that amendment, with their
examinations, in the supreme interests of our nation," the King
said.
</P>
<P>
The faxed interview from the King's cabinet came a day after
news broke out that the ruling Cambodia People's Party is working
to convene members of the outgoing parliament to try to change the
Constitution and break the political deadlock that has intensified
this week.
</P>
<P>
But opposition leaders and many analysts doubt that the CPP
could rally enough Funcinpec and Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party
(BLDP) lawmakers in the outgoing parliament and make the change
before the current assembly's mandate ends at September 24. It
needs 70 percent of the 120 members present to convene an assembly
meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that King Sihanouk's statement carries weight,
as he is one of the three people, besides the prime minister and
the chairman of the National Assembly, allowed to initiate a
change in the Constitution under Article 123.

of stability of underground mines, working through micro-seismic
techniques, hydro-fracturing for stress measurement and
characterization and processing of gold and diamond.
</P>
<P>
A protocol in this regard was signed during the visit of Indian
Steel and Mines Minister Naveen Patnaik to South Africa recently.

experts called for greater public awareness to reduce heart
disease as they concluded a five-day cardiology conference here on

The experts warned myocardial infarction and cardiovascular
disorders are still the "top killers" in Western countries, and
while considerable progress has been made in the last two decades,
harmful side-effects remain a serious problem.

They urged governments to increase financial support for
cardiological research and to give more publicity to the issue,
stressing that without public health awareness and active
prevention, even the most remarkable medical achievements would be
to no avail.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the 20th European Cardiology Conference
reported their latest efforts to combat the disease, including a
new cure based on gene technology and new medicines such as
Mivazerel, which will be on the market soon.

<HEADLINE> Boeing's Delta III Rocket Explodes After Blast-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Boeing's newest rocket,
the Delta III rocket, exploded during its inaugural flight at Cape
Canaveral, Florida, Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The 12-story rocket was blasted off at 9:17 p.m. local time and
exploded a little over a minute with the 225-million-U.S.-dollar
Galaxy communication satellite on board.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in two weeks that an unmaned U.S.
rocket exploded.
</P>
<P>
Boeing officials said they didn't know what had happeded to the
rocket and would launch an immediate investigation into the
accident.
</P>
<P>
The Delta III, powered by nine strap-on boosters, a usual core
engine and an extra large upper-stage engine, is designed to lift
more than 8,400 pounds of payload into a 22,300-mile-high orbit,
two times the payload of the Delta II.
</P>
<P>
The 8,500-plus-pound Galaxy satellite aboard the rocket was to
provide television and data services to the U.S. and the Caribbean
by the end of September.

<HEADLINE> Russian Crisis Has No Direct Effect on Bulgaria: Dealer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said there might be more tangible adverse effects caused by
the crisis in a longer perspective because of the sharp decline in
the rates of loans and/or securities in transition.
</P>
<P>
Tension on the German foreign currency market (Germany is
Russia's largest creditor) and on the US dollar markets in South
America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentine) may result in fluctuations in
the exchange rate between the German mark and the U.S. dollar,
which will also affect the exchange rate between German mark and
the Bulgarian lev.
</P>
<P>
According to Popov, the exchange rates have stood firm for over
a month in the ranges of 995.0 - 995.20 leva against 1 German mark
and 1,793.0 to 1,795.1 against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Former Vice Governor of the Central Bank Mileti Mladenov said
that Bulgaria's economy and its foreign exchange market will not
collapse under the consequences of the Russian crisis.
</P>
<P>
He added that the country's negative trade balance with Russia,
its large foreign debt in the depreciation of the loan
instruments, and the increased pressure on the German mark are the
factors that may have a more radical effect on Bulgaria.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia' Population Doubles in 36 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary results of
Cambodia's first census in 36 years shows that the country's
population hit 11.42 million as of March 3, 1998, doubling the 5.7
million figure in 1962.
</P>
<P>
According to data released on Tuesday by the Ministry of
Planning and the National Institute of Statistics, 5.59 million of
those counted are male and 5.97 million are female. The annual
growth rate is 2.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
The most populous province is Kampong Cham with 1.6 million
people, while Pailin is the least populated with only 23,000. The
average population density is 65 people per square kilometer.
</P>
<P>
The initial results also show that Cambodia's population could
reach 13 million by 2005 and 15 million by 2010.
</P>
<P>
It will present a challenge for the government to pursue a
policy that strikes a balance between population and economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The final results of the census are due to be published in July
1999; it will provide some special data about health and education
issues as well as immigration patterns and living conditions.

<HEADLINE> Peshawar-Based Afghan Universities Ordered to Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The government of Pakistan's
North West Frontier Province has ordered the closing of half a
dozen unauthorized educational institutions in the provincial
capital of Peshawar being run by some Afghan nationals.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government issued the order late Wednesday to
wind up those unauthorized universities, medical colleges and
computer training centers which have been established by some
Afghan refugees over the years and issue degrees and certificates
to Afghan nationals as well as Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
According to independent estimates, each of the illegal
educational institutions being run by the Afghan nationals in
Peshawar has enrolled more than 200 students, making a total of
more than 2,000 regular students both Afghan and Pakistani at the
institutions in Peshawar alone.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that there are more than 100 educational
institutions including religious schools run by the Afghan
refugees in the province while almost the same number exists in
other parts of Pakistan including Balochistan province and the
Federal Administered Tribal Areas.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman of the government of North West
Frontier Province, the decision to close those educational
institutions has been made at the request of the Taliban militia,
who want Afghan students to seek admission in authorized Afghan
universities.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Wali Naeemi, a senior Taliban official based in
Peshawar, when asked to comment on the development, said, "We are
trying to find a solution to the problem related to Afghan
students in Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He maintained that none of the educational institutions being
run by Afghan refugees in Pakistan was affiliated with Pakistani
institutions nor the universities and schools were recognized by
the Taliban authorities.
</P>
<P>
"Our government neither recognizes these institutions being run
(by Afghan refugees) in Pakistan nor accepts their degrees,"
Naeemi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban authorities have offered a comprehensive
package to Afghan students and asked those studying in the
educational institutions being run by Afghan refugees in Pakistan
to seek admission for studies in Afghanistan's universities.

<HEADLINE> Indian Opposition Party Prepares Economic Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- India's biggest opposition
party the Congress has prepared a 30-page report on the economic
agenda in a bid to improve the country's present bad economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
The report will be the basis of discussions at the forthcoming
three-day party session in Madhya Pradesh early next month,
Congress sources said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the combination of the fallout of the nuclear
explosion in May this year and a "confused, directionless" budget
for 1998-99 of the government has made the "sentiment on India
negative amongst all investors."
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Current Economic Challenges," said that
even a planning commission has not been constituted and the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1998-2002) is in "abeyance."
</P>
<P>
Both the revenue and fiscal deficits in the country are at
unsustainable levels and it is imperative that a three- to
five-year program for reducing the fiscal deficit to less than 5
percent of the GDP and bringing the revenue deficit to close to
zero without affecting growth and social welfare is put into
place, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Congress' economic agenda revolves around "one fundamental
objective, namely, the abolition, within our own generation, of
poverty" and the creation of "adequate employment opportunities"
so that the Indian people can have a decent standard of living.
</P>
<P>
The party will also try to ensure "a minimum standard of
education and skills for all Indians, particularly those belonging
to the weaker section, the report further said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Libya to Surrender Lockerbie Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States said that
Libya should quickly handover two suspects accused of blowing up a
Pan Am airliner if it takes seriously the U.S.-British proposal.
</P>
<P>
"If the Libyans are serious, we would expect the next step to
be the (U.N.) secretary general's notification that the suspects
have been transported to the Hague and are in Dutch custody," an
administration official said Wednesday from Martha's Vineyard,
where U.S. President Bill Clinton is vacationing.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remark following a Libyan foreign
ministry statement, which said Libya would deal "positively" with
the U.S.-British proposal to try the two Libyan suspects in the
Hague, Netherlands, with Scottish judges applying Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
The official said the United States had received reports that
the Libya had accepted the proposal.
</P>
<P>
"If this means that Libya intends to surrender the two suspects
to Dutch custody we would consider this a positive development,"
he said. "However, if the Libyan statement signifies an attempt to
negotiate the terms of the trial, we would remind the Libyan
government that the terms are nonnegotiable."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Department said the Libyan statement was
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
It "does not specifically state that Libya is prepared -- as
called for in the U.N. Security Council resolutions -- to promptly
turn the suspects over for trial," State Department spokesman
James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"The Libyan statement falls short of what U.N. Security Council
resolutions require," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Libya asked the U.N. Security Council to
delay endorsing the U.S.-British proposal, saying it would need
time to study it.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Libyan request, White House spokesman Barry
Toiv said the United States did not see any reason for the delay
on Libya's part as "the proposal accords with what they said they
would agree to in the past."

<HEADLINE> Romanian Financial Market in Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Romania's stock market
experienced its worst turmoil Thursday partly because of the
impacts of the Russian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Share prices plummeted by more than 9 percentage points, the
biggest drop since the founding of Romania's stock market in the
early 1990s, the press here said.
</P>
<P>
The BET index, which is representative of Romania's 10 major
first-rate stocks, slipped to a record low of 348.41 points for
the first time to lose 9.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
The BET composite index slid to 487.86 points, a loss of 9.3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The index at the RASDAQ exchange, which is engaged in the sale
of medium and small enterprise stocks, finished 4.22 percent lower
at 809.87.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Romania's foreign exchange market fluctuated,
with the national currency, the leu, continuing to weaken. The
leu fell to below 9,000 to 1 against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Romanian economists say the bleak stock market is in part a
result of Russia's financial crisis and the ruble's devaluation.
However, the main cause is the country's unsatisfactory economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
Only after the government takes strong measures to stimulate
the economy and reform its macro-economic policies can the stock
and exchange markets reverse their decline, experts said.

<HEADLINE>   Hurricane Bonnie Lashes U.S. East Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Bonnie lashed the
East Coast of the United States Wednesday afternoon with stinging
rain and powerful winds that forced nearly 500,000 residents and
tourists to evacuate the coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
The storm swamped roads, knocked out power to at least 240,000
residents and peeled a roof from a hospital in the Wilmington
area, a southern coast town of North Carolina. There were no
immediate reports of deaths or serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the storm also created new inlets that cut two
small barrier islands in half.
</P>
<P>
The storm struck the coastal area from the Atlantic early in
the afternoon at Cape Fear, near the South Carolina state line. It
slowed from 20 to 13 kilometers per hour (kph) as it came ashore.
</P>
<P>
As of 7:30 p.m. EDT (2330 GMT), Bonnie was centered near Wrightsville
Beach, about 32 kilometers north of Cape Fear.
</P>
<P>
Wind along the coast reached sustained speeds of 120 kph at
Southport, with occasional gusts elsewhere hitting 160 kph in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sea water three-meters above normal tide level was reported in
some areas Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The storm was expected eventually to veer to the northeast and
move out to sea near the North Carolina-Virginia line.
</P>
<P>
National Hurricane Center officials warned that the
650-kilometer-wide storm would take 30 hours to move out of the
centrally hit area.
</P>
<P>
More than 330,000 people were ordered to evacuate North
Carolina's coastal islands and about 200,000 more, including
120,000 tourists, were urged to leave South Carolina's two
northernmost coastal counties in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
A state of emergency was declared in Virginia and hurricane
warnings were in effect across a 800-kilometer stretch of
coastline, from Chincoteague, Virginia, to Edisto Beach, South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The Navy sent about 40 ships at the Norfolk Naval Base out to
sea to weather the storm, including the aircraft carriers USS
Enterprise and the USS Roosevelt. Commercial ships were barred
from entering Virginia's Hampton Roads port.
</P>
<P>
The last hurricane, Hurricane Fran, struck the Wilmington area
in September 1996, causing 24 deaths and 5.2 billion U.S. dollars
in damage.

<HEADLINE> Austria Mulling Indemnity from Italy over Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 26 (Xinhua)-- Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima
held a cabinet meeting Wednesday night, discussing losses caused
by Italy's misreporting over Austrian beef, and possible indemnity.
</P>
<P>
In late July, the relevant authorities in Italy reported to the
Commission of the European Union that they found beef imported
from Austria was contaminated with a cancer-producing hormone and
announced a halt to beef imports from Austria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Austria authorities began to investigate the
incident and warned the public off beef products. But the test by
Austria itself showed that the exported beef didn't contain any
harmful hormones.
</P>
<P>
On August 25, the Dutch laboratory appointed by the European
Commission confirmed the test results of Austria. Italy thus
canceled the beef ban.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Agriculture Ministry suggested that the beef row
invoked by Italy cost Austria 16.8 million U.S. dollars. Besides,
another 4.8 million dollars are needed to publicize at home and
abroad to restore the reputation of Austrian beef.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Klima said Wednesday that he had written to the
prime minister of Italy, seeking his assistance to solve problems
resulting from the beef row.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Seeks Foreign Assistance for Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has appealed to its
donor countries and agencies for 508.39 million U.S. dollars and
1.38 million tons of food for emergency relief and post-flood
rehabilitation programs, press reports here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to representatives of the donors on Wednesday, Finance
Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria said the devastating flood had caused
an economic disaster in the country, as "it has caused disruption
in all sorts of economic activities."
</P>
<P>
"This has become an emergency now and our government has
decided to seek foreign assistance to combat the situation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kibria noted that nothing was spared in the affected areas
because of the unprecedented lengthy flood. "At the initial stage,
it was a natural flood like other years and we had the capability
to cope with it. But right now, it is just not possible," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He urged the donors to respond quickly to the government's
requests, as the agricultural activities would start immediately
as soon as the waters recede.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, food, communications, fisheries, livestock and
water resources are among as the worst affected sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has committed 200,000 tons of food grain
while Denmark has pledged 14 million dollars for repair and
rehabilitation of the Dhaka-Aricha highway, a Finance Ministry
release said.
</P>
<P>
Other donors such as Britain, Canada, Japan, and Germany have
also provided or agreed to provide assistance to the country.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister asked the donors to make the delivery of
assistance quickly as "we want to start rehabilitation work as
soon as the flood waters recede."
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, the floods have so far left
more than 400 people dead and nearly 30 million homeless and
caused damage worth 222.5 million dollars to agriculture,
infrastructure and other sectors in 55 out of the country's 64
districts.

<P>
MOSCOW, Aguest 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin held talks with Presidents of Ukraine and
Belarus, Leonid Kuchma and Alexander Lukashenko, on Russian
financial crisis Wednesday in Crimea.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin briefed the presidents of the Russian financial
crisis and the measures taken by the government and the central
bank to stabilize the situation, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the talks he stressed that the three countries had to
coordinate actions to reduce the impact of the crisis on their
economies and trade because of their close economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said after a meeting with Kuchma, "it wasn't about
trying to reach decisions or agreements, but we simply had to
discuss and exchange advice," the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma was quoted by the report as saying, "In Ukraine, we are
not any less worried than Russians about the situation on the
financial market, and we understand that sooner or later there
will be repercussions in Ukraine."
</P>
<P>
In Crimea, Chernomydin also met with IMF Managing Director
Michel Camdessus, discussing the financial situation worldwide and
in Russia. The measures Russia has taken to deal with the crisis
were also discussed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A 22.6- billion-U.S.-dollar IMF-led bailout package approved in
July has so far failed to calm the country's economic maelstrom.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin arrived in Crimea Wednesday afternoon and was to
fly back to Moscow in the evening.

ROME, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Italy's exports to Russia increased
by 32 percent in the first quarter despite ruble's steep
devaluation and worries that the Russian economy might be out of
control.
</P>
<P>
The exports were valued at 1.7 trillion lire (1 billion
U.S. dollars), according to trade sources. Imports in the same
period fell by 4.8 percent to 1.842 trillion lire (1.04 billion
dollars), trimming Italy's trade deficit with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Energy products, oil, natural gas and other raw materials
accounted for 60 percent of the Italian exports, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a total of 768 joint ventures between the two
countries had been established by the end of last year. Italian
groups with interest in Russia include Fiat, Telecom Italia, Fata,
Breda, Merloni and Parmalat, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries stood at 6.2 billion
dollars in 1997, up 20 percent over 1996, making Italy Russia's

BANGKOK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Transport and
Communications Ministry will pick a private party to operate 26
airports which come under the jurisdiction of the Aviation
Department, Deputy Minister Pradit Pattaraprasit said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A winning bidder will have a concession to run all the airports
but their ownership will still belong to the department, Pradit

</P>
<P>
The contractor will pay a concession fee to the state and
employ the staff of the department, who are working at the
airports, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The private participation will improve the airport service and
help cut state budget currently spent on these airports
nationwide," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will not let private parties pick only profitable
airports because loss-ridden airports would otherwise be left with
the state, Pradit said.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, loss-ridden airports could make profits under
private management," he added.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Czech Republic Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment in the
Czech Republic reached 589 million U.S. dollars in the first half
of this year, a 25 percent increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics from the Czech National Bank,
approximately 55 percent of the investment went into the financial
and insurance sectors. Britain, America and Germany were the main
investors, contributing 48.3 percent, 20.8 percent and 11.8
percent of the total investment respectively.
</P>
<P>
Since the country adopted the policy of reform toward a market
economy in 1990, the Czech Republic has taken 7.6 billion
U.S. dollars in direct foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
However, over recent years, the annual investment in the Czech
Republic has obviously declined, to 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in
1996 and 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 separately, roughly half
of the size in 1995.
</P>
<P>
As a stimulus package, the Czech government formulated a set of
preferential policies to encourage foreign investment in April,
including a five-year tax exemption on earnings for investors each
investing more than 25 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The preferential policies also cover the exemption of tax on
the import of high-tech equipment, the establishment of free
tariff zones and the extension of interest free loans to those who
expropriate land for use.

<HEADLINE> China's Oldest Irrigation System Being Phased Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Turpan Prefecture of
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are phasing out the
1,700-year-old karez, an irrigation system of wells connected by
underground channels, and replacing it with the more efficient
electric pumps.
</P>
<P>
Some of the karez have been turned into scenic spots or can be
seen in museums. They are usually three to four kilometers long
and the underground channel brings water from the nearby Tianshan
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The system was invented the Uygur ethnic group as something
suited to the dry climate and has played an important role in the
oasis in this land of unbearable heat.
</P>
<P>
But, the old irrigation system is only geared to small
production and was doomed by growing agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang had more than 1,500 karez in the 1950s, over 1,100 of
which were in Turpan. But the figure in the prefecture is now
about 600, and there are fewer karez builders around.
</P>
<P>
To make the most of its limited water resources, Turpan
introduced a water coupon system for irrigation in 1995, and other
methods like sprinklers to make farmers more aware of the need to
save water.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has built 14 reservoirs and more than 4,000
kilometers of channels that can irrigate three times the amount of
farmland that they did in the past.
</P>
<P>
However, local people still like the karez and have set up a
karez research society and exhibition hall. The local government
has also ruled that no well can be dug within 400 meters of an
existing karez.

KIEV, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian government suggested
Wednesday that holders of short-term national debt bonds exchange
them for long-term liabilities to help relieve the financial
difficulties it is facing.
</P>
<P>
People who hold bonds with a maturity date of less than one
year were "asked" to extend the term "voluntarily" to 1.5 to 5.5
years, payable every half a year.
</P>
<P>
Yields, guaranteed to be independent of the exchange rate of
hryvina to the dollar, will be 40 percent per year in hryvina
for the first two lots of bonds and will float for the rest.
</P>
<P>
Domestic bonds the Ukrainian government issued have accumulated
to 14 billion hryvinas (about 7 billion U.S. dollars). It has
also borrowed more than 12 billion U.S. dollars from abroad.
</P>
<P>
It needs annually more than 2 billion dollars, which is a heavy
burden to finance, to pay debts at maturity.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of 10 banks, the biggest holders of short-term bonds,
signed agreements immediately following the recommendation to
exchange them for long-term bonds.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank to Be Restructured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand will be
restructured to ensure maximum efficiency while maintaining
independence in setting monetary policies, according to its
governor Chatumongol Sonakul.
</P>
<P>
A committee of international experts and former central bankers
was helping draft a study on restructuring, Chatumongol was quoted
Thursday by The Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The central bank would maintain independence from the Finance
Ministry and the government in setting monetary policies, as well
as supervision and examination of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
To improve staff effectiveness, central bank officials would be
encouraged to meet regularly with local financiers to exchange
ideas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another program to upgrade the ability of auditors and
examiners has also been established.
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, the Bank of Thailand will redirect its
responsibility toward managing price stability, to allow the
private sector to operate in a supportive environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economic crisis could be attributed to the central
bank's failure in the past to independently perform its duties, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The term of the governor should be fixed, he suggested, to
further ensure independence. But the authority of the governor
would also be counterbalanced by the Senate and members of the
Court of Directors appointed by the government.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the governor's authority would be well
counterbalanced by the political authorities. The governor should
make a general statement on policy to the Senate each year," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate was politically neutral when compared with the Lower
House or the government, he added.

<HEADLINE>   American U.N. Weapons Inspector Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Scott Ritter, an
American U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq resigned his U.N. post on
Wednesday, the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
chief Richard Butler said.
</P>
<P>
Ritter's resignation comes at a time when U.N. weapons
inspection in Iraq has been blocked by Iraq's August 5
announcement to suspend its cooperation with UNSCOM in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Ritter's departure had been accepted and took effect
immediately, said Richard Butler, Executive Chairman of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
In his letter of resignation, Ritter, an expert on methods of
concealment and missiles, expressed his dissatisfaction that the
Security Council of the United Nations was so soft that it had
failed to take a tougher stand on the latest Iraqi impasse over
arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Council for no longer willing or capable of
the implementation of its own law.
</P>
<P>
Ritter also accused U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan of
allowing his office to become a "sounding board for Iraqi
grievances, real or imagined."
</P>
<P>
Ritter has been with UNSCOM for six years and has been accused
by Iraq of being a U.S. spy. He was in Baghdad early this month

GUANGZHOU, August 27 (Xinhua) -- All villages in rural
Guangdong province in southern China are expected to govern
themselves as a way of improving the rural grass-roots
administration.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has decided to replace the current

instead of appointed and the committee will have several villager
groups to oversee affairs in communities.
</P>
<P>
The practice will be tried out in several places in the second
half of this year, and be accompanied by a publicity campaign,
sources say. All villages will be electing their village committee
by the end of June next year.
</P>
<P>
Special emphasis will be put on keeping the elections open,
fair and democratic, in accordance with the law, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has said that the villages should
make sure that rural economic relations remain unchanged and that
farmers' rights and interests are not violated.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Panama will invest 44
million U.S. dollars in agriculture for technological
improvements, Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares said
in his weekly report published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This support is in response to the challenge imposed by
globalization of the economy and the elimination of government
patronage," said Balladares.
</P>
<P>
The new challenge calls for better quality merchandise that can
compete in the international market, Balladares added.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort, tomato and corn fields will be changed
to fields for watermelons, melons, and black beans, which are more
profitable in the markets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Tomato producers will receive a grant worth 2 million dollars,
and financial aid in the form of loans worth 4.8 million dollars,
so they can transform 700 hectares in three years," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, corn producers will receive 2.16 million dollars and
a direct investment, which will have to be reimbursed, of 6.77
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Supporting the producers now is guaranteeing them a prosperous
future and reliable food supplies and sources for the rest of the
country," Balladares said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Still Strong in Northern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Even though China's Hebei
province has been affected to a certain degree by the Southeast
Asian Financial Crisis, foreign trade of 21 development zones is
still good, according to a provincial government official.
</P>
<P>
Imports and exports of the zones amounted to 300 million
U.S. dollars during the first half of the year, up 16.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official says that Hebei has been tried to ensure an
economic growth rate of 11 percent, and increasing exports is one
of the means.
</P>
<P>
In the January-June period, Hebei's development zones were
involved in more than 1,150 overseas-funded projects, and used 2
billion U.S. dollars, a third of the province's total amount of
foreign investment. Twenty-one of the companies in these zones
have invested over 3 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To increase foreign trade, the provincial government has
expanded to markets beyond East Asia, resulting in a 13 percent
increase in exports to the United States during the first six
months.

<HEADLINE> Former Jakarta Commander Investigated Over May Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Jakarta Military
Commander Major General Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin has testified before
members of the Joint Fact-Finding Team investigating the riots
that racked the capital in May, the Indonesian Observer reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting was merely to seek the general's clarification and
to consult him. We wanted to hear the security authorities'
version of what they did during the unrest," team member Bambang
Widjojanto was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sjafrie was questioned for nearly three hours on Wednesday,
Bambang said.
</P>
<P>
"Our questions centered around the methods used by the Direct
and Indirect Security Task Forces in dealing with the unrest. We
wanted to know what those methods were in concrete terms, how the
lines of command functioned, the strength of the security forces
deployed and why forces in the field had at one time asked for
reinforcements," he said.
</P>
<P>
The questions were addressed to Sjafrie because he was then the
Jakarta military commander, Bambang said, adding that Sjafrie was
not a suspect in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The team was established by the government last month to
investigate reports that the May riots, in which more than 1,200
people were killed, were masterminded.
</P>
<P>
Sjafrie was replaced in early July and moved to the post of
territorial assistant to the Armed Forces chief of general staff.
</P>
<P>
Bambang said the team would summon several other officials in
connection with the incidents.
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet been able to draw any conclusions from the
meeting with Sjafrie as we still need information from others," he
said, adding that Sjafrie might be summoned again if more
information was needed from him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of public figures, including the country's
largest Muslim organization Nahdlatul Ulama leader Abdurrahman
Wahid, intend to form an independent "Commission to Establish
Truth and National Reconciliation" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The commission in which foreign personalities would also be
invited to take part, aims to find out the truth about the human
rights abuses that allegedly occurred during the May riots and
attempt to bring about national reconciliation among Indonesians,
Wahid told reporters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bambang said the political, moral, social and economic damage
caused to the nation by the riots was enormous and the image of
Indonesian society as a tolerant one was now in question at home
and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Panama to Build Traffic Tunnel Under Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 26 (xinhua) -- Panama is studying the
possibility of building a tunnel beneath the Panama Canal at a
cost of some 300 million dollars to reduce traffic pressure on the
Americas Bridge, a senior official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Public Works Minister Luis Blanco said his ministry has already
finished feasibility studies on the work. They expect to start
construction on the downstream tunnel in the near future in order
to have it in operation by 2003.
</P>
<P>
According to studies, it will take 2-3 years to complete the
project. The tunnel will connect the Capital city with the west
Sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that at the moment they are thinking about
ways to finance the project; they have not ruled out the
possibility of a government grant.
</P>
<P>
Blanco said that as soon as the financing is settled there
will be a bid offering, so different experienced construction
companies will be able to participate in the project.
</P>
<P>
The Minister pointed out that enlargement of the Americas
Bridge is not a viable or permanent solution against the
increasing traffic. He said it is essential to build an alternate
route.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 vehicles cross the Americas Bridge everyday
because Arraijan and Chorrera cities have developed many housing
projects.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Import Raised to 4.1 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to boost the volume of its planned rice imports from 3.1
million tons to 4.1 million tons, Antara News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to increase rice imports was made in connection
with Agriculture Ministry projections that rice production during
the rainy season would still not be sufficient to cover expected
rice supply gaps, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic rice production during the past rainy season would
fail to meet expected levels because of a combination of factors
including delays in distribution of subsidized fertilizers and
insufficiency of credits for rice farmers, the report quoted
National Logistics Agency Chief Beddu Amang as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the Agriculture Ministry, this year's rice
production would be about 46 million tons, or 86.9 percent of the
targeted 53 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Amang said some of the imported rice would be granted by
several countries and the rest would be borrowed while the
additional 1 million tons which had just been decided would be
bought under commercial terms through international tenders.
</P>
<P>
"The rice will be bought from a number of neighboring
countries, including Thailand, Vietnam, China, India and
Pakistan," he said.

<HEADLINE> More Shanghai People Visit Websites for Leisure and Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 27 (Xinhua)-- "Shanghai Hotline," one of the
most popular websites in China, has been visited more than 10
million times since it was set up on November 22, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The website, according to Zhang Linde, general manager of
Shanghai Information Industry Co., Ltd., linked with six others in
China, have more than 40,000 subscribers and about 180,000 regular
visitors.
</P>
<P>
The number of daily average visitors has increased to 40,000
from several hundred only two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of cyberspace has also led more people
do their shopping on-line.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua Bookstore on East Nanjing Road launched its site on
the hotline last May, the first on-line bookstore in the city.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jinhua, manager of the on-line bookstore, said that sales
volume has reached about 200,000 yuan from on-line sales, and the
monthly average is approaching 20,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
On-line flower shops, drugstores and booking offices are also
very active on the hotline website.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that department-store customers in Shanghai are
expected to decline by 20 to 30 percent by the end of this century
due to the growth of on-line shopping and electronic businesses.
</P>
<P>
The "Shanghai Hotline" will soon enlarge its capacity for the
third time, in an effort to boost the number of visitors to one
million daily.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Welcomes New IMF Disbursement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
welcomed a decision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
disburse to the country another 1 billion U.S. dollars in rescue
funds and praised the new aid as another boost to the national
currency.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita said here Wednesday that the IMF aid,
combined with returning confidence in the economy following the
government's action against ailing banks last week, had
contributed greatly to the strengthening of the rupiah against the
U.S. dollar over the last three days.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah rose to about 11,100 per dollar early this week, its
highest level since May when the currency fell to as low as 17,000
per dollar.
</P>
<P>
"More encouraging is that the rupiah has been strengthening
without any government market intervention," local leading
newspapers Thursday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, the rupiah has lost more than 80 percent
of its value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>

The Indonesian government has projected that the rupiah will
average 10,600 to the dollar during the current fiscal year which
ends next March.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, the rupiah will gradually appreciate to 10,000 (per
dollar) later this year. But we prefer a gradual strengthening to
sharp, but volatile rise, because sharp fluctuations may spark
speculation," Ginandjar said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF Executive Board approved Tuesday the next
1-billion-dollar loan tranche to Indonesia as part of a 46 billion
U.S. dollar bailout package and praised the nation's efforts to
combat the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
As part of its economic and financial reform agreed by the IMF,
the Indonesian government launched major banking restructuring
moves on August 21 by merging four state banks, freezing the
operations of three ailing private banks and nationalizing four
other private banks.

RIO DE JANEIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazil exported 7,350

percent because of drops in pork prices on the international

In the first seven months this year, the country's pork exports
increased by 19.84 percent in earnings and 42.52 percent in volume
in comparison with the same period in 1997, the association said.

Commonwealth secretary-general, which becomes vacant in November
next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Foreign Minister
Andrei Plesu Wednesday condemned the bombing in a South African
restaurant aiming at the United States, saying that Bucharest is
firmly opposed to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Plesu stressed that Romania is opposed to all acts of
terrorism, saying that his country is worried about the spate of
terrorist bombings which have been occurring one after the other
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
A man was killed and 27 people were injured when a bomb
exploded at the "Planet Hollywood" restaurant in Cape Town Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Among the wounded were five members of a British family of six,
including two children. The family arrived in Cape Town that day
on a holiday trip.
</P>
<P>
A man telephoned a Cape Town radio station the same night,
claiming a group named Muslims Against Global Oppression was
responsible for the blast.
</P>
<P>
The caller said the move was in retaliation for the
U.S. missile attacks on suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan
and Sudan last week.
</P>
<P>
But a coordinator of the Muslim group Moain Achmad reportedly
denied the allegation Wednesday, saying someone was trying to
discredit his group.

TIANJIN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Three carved white marble pieces
have been identified as bases for steles commemorating martyrs in
a Sino-Japanese sea battle a century ago.
</P>
<P>
The steles, set up in a temple to honor the martyrs of the Jia
Wu Sea Battle in 1894, was ruined along with the temple by the
Japanese invaders in 1937.
</P>

The bases, the only remains of the temple, are each 130 cm
long, 80 cm wide and 60 cm high, and are decorated with reliefs of
dragons, waves, fish, shrimp, frogs and shells.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts say that the bases will contribute to the
study of the navy of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), as well as
remind people of the history of Japanese invasions of China.

<HEADLINE> Gullit Set to Manage Newcastle United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Dutch international Ruud
Gullit will fly in to Newcastle on Thursday to take over from
Kenny Dalglish as manager of Newcastle United.
</P>
<P>
According to the Daily Mirror which publishes Thursday, the
former Chelsea manager has been offered a
one-million-pound-a-season deal which would make him the
highest-paid club manager in the English Premiership.
</P>
<P>
The tabloid paper said that Newcastle directors traveled to
Amsterdam on Monday for secret talks with Gullit and they wanted
him to seal his move to St James' Park on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gullit was sacked by Chelsea earlier this year and Newcastle
have struggled to maintain the standards set under former manager
Kevin Keegan.
</P>
<P>
Dalglish's reign as Newcastle manager effectively ended after
the 1-1 draw at Chelsea on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the Premiership season is only two games
old, Dalglish has become the first managerial casualty of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another tabloid paper the Sun reported that Gullit
had been offered the job of manager of crisis Tottenham Hotspur,
taking over the job from Swiss coach Christian Gross.

LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Two-time European Cup champions
Benfica advanced into the group stages of the European Champions
league on Wednesday despite losing their second qualifying round,
second leg match 4-2 away to Beitar Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Benfica's crushing 6-0 first leg victory in Lisbon secured
them a place in the league with a 8-4 win on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Nuno Gomes scored a 17th minute penalty and Joao Pinto scored
in the last minute for the 1961 and 1962 winners.
</P>
<P>
There were also goals galore for Spartak Moscow, who beat
Bulgarian side FC Liteks 6-2 at home for an 11-2 aggregate win.
Liteks' Veselin Ignatov was sent off in the 35th minute.
</P>
<P>
Two goals each from Andrei Tikhonov and Brazilian striker
Robson and further goals from Yegor Titov and Ilya Tsymbalar put
the Russians through.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Eindhoven, PSV Eindhoven escaped an early fright
to reach the Champions league against Maribor Teatanic with a 4-1
second leg win after extra time.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenians scored after only five minutes when PSV's
Brazilian center back Marcos slipped trying to clear the ball,
leaving Dalibor Filipovic clear to run through and add to their
2-1 home leg advantage.
</P>
<P>
PSV replied within three minutes when Ruud van Nistelrooy
headed home.
</P>
<P>
Maribor's Damjan Gajser could have made the tie safe for the
Slovenians but struck the post in the 62nd minute.
</P>
<P>
His miss enabled Arnold Bruggink to put the aggregate score
level at 3-3 in the 69th minute.
</P>
<P>
The draw finally turned in PSV's favour in the first phase of
extra time when a Dennis Rommedahl shot was fumbled by the
goalkeeper in the 100th minute and two minutes later Gilles de
Bilde struck in a fine effort from the edge of the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
In Lodz, Poland, Manchester United was managed to a 0-0 draw
against LKS Lodz in a dull game. With two goal advantage from
the first leg, Manchester United team secured a place in the
champions league.
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, veteran Lothar Mattaeus scored with a
perfectly-judged curving free kick a minute before time to give
Bayern Munich a 1-1 draw with Yugoslavia's Obilic.
</P>
<P>
Bayern cruised through 5-1 on aggregate after winning the
first leg 4-0 in Munich.
</P>
<P>
Winners from the qualifying round will join pre-qualifiers
Lens, Juventus, Kaiserslautern, Barcelona, Ajax, Arsenal, Porto
and holders Real Madrid in Thursday's draw in Monaco.
</P>
<P>

WASHINGTON -- The United States stated on Wednesday that the
indictment of seven Cuban Americans for allegedly plotting to kill
Cuban leader Fidel Castro does not mean a softening policy towards
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question during a regular briefing, State
Department Deputy Spokesman James Foley said the idea that the
indictment shows U.S. changed its Cuba policies is "really
ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Justice Department announced the seven Cuban
Americans were indicted in Puerto Rico for planning to kill Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
Some Cuban exiles in Miami are accusing the U.S. government is
trying to defend Castro himself, not his government.
</P>
<P>
"The indictments... were the outcome of an independent federal
law-enforcement investigation. Any change in our policy towards
Cuba would... be wholly dependent on fundamental systemic
democratic change in Cuba of a kind we certainly have not seen,"
said Foley. (US-Cuba)

CAIRO -- Libya Wednesday accepted a U.S.-British proposal for a
trial of two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing of a
Pan Am flight in the Hague, the Netherlands, before Scottish
Judges under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
This raises the hope that the six-year-old U.N. air and arms
embargo against Libya could be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the acceptance of the offer, a Libyan Foreign
Ministry statement carried by the Libyan news agency JANA said the
ministry "stresses the need to lift the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The embargo as well as certain financial and travel
restrictions were imposed in 1992 after Libya refused to hand over
the two Libyan suspects in the bombing, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have long urged Libya to hand over the two
suspects to stand trial in eighther of the two countries. But
Libya refused to turn over the suspects, contending that the trial
should be held to ensure its justness.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London announced on Monday their proposal to
allow the two Libyans to be tried in a third country.

MOSCOW -- The exchange rate is ranging between 8.8 and 9.57
rubles for one U.S. dollar on Wednesday despite the invalidation
of dollar trading at the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange
(MICEX), the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some exchange offices change the rate five times on Wednesday
morning, saying demand exceeds supply greatly.
</P>
<P>
However, the growing dollar selling rate has not changed
Russia's financial situation since most of the offices have no
U.S. currency in cash.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, quotations of gas giant Gazprom shares drop
by 14 percent at noon time at the Moscow Stock Exchange with one
unit fetching 1.05 rubles.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Stock Exchange index drops by 9.17 percent as
compared with that of Tuesday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There was a sharp increase in interest in Gazprom share in the
previous two days as Viktor Chernomyrdin, president of Gazprom,
was appointed acting prime minister. (Russia-Ruble)

<HEADLINE> Man United Advance into Champions League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United advanced to
the first round proper of the European Champions league after
holding LKS Lodz to a 0-0 draw in their second qualifying round
second leg match on Wednesday, preserving their two goal
advantage from the first leg at home.
</P>
<P>
The match was dull and neither side showed a great deal of
invention or penetration in Poland.
</P>
<P>
As expected Lodz attacked from the first whistle and after 30
seconds Rafal Niznik turned Denis Irwin before unleashing a 25-ya
rd shot which whizzed just past Peter Schmeichel's far post.
</P>
<P>
The lively Niznik then knocked the ball past United skipper
Roy Keane but the alert Ronny Johnsen read the situation to clear
the danger.
</P>
<P>
United came more into the game and David Beckham sent a
free-kick wide of the goal from 25 yards out.
</P>
<P>
After 17 minutes, David Beckham tried to test Lodz's defence
with another free kick, but he hit his effort against the wall
and goalkeeper Boguslaw Wyparlo easily caught the ball.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later Teddy Sheringham should have done better with a
header from a Ryan Giggs corner, but the England striker headed
weakly past the post.
</P>
<P>
Peter Schmeichel, who was playing his 25th Champions' League
game to climb to third in United's all-time appearance list, pr
oduced a fine interception to cut out Niznik's ball with Tomasz
Wieszczycki waiting to pounce.
</P>
<P>
United carved out another opening when Roy Keane found Beckham
in space on the right and Sheringham just failed to connect with
his inviting cross as he closed in on goal.
</P>
<P>
United re-jigged their attack when they brought on Tottenham
and Everton target Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for Giggs after 64
minutes. But his appearance did nothing to liven a dull game.
</P>
<P>
The game dribbled to its inevitable conclusion with United
having nothing to gain from a goal and Lodz producing little
invention.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Fire Head Coach Chris Ford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Milwaukee Bucks today
fired coach Chris Ford, eight days after the Sacramento Kings
dismissed coach Eddie Jordon.
</P>
<P>
"We just decided to go in a different direction," said Bucks
general manager Bob Weinhauer at a news conference today. "We
felt that we needed to make greater improvement and we believe
that a change will accelerate that process."
</P>
<P>
Ford scored a 69-95 record in two years as Bucks coach. But
despite his lack of success, it appeared that Ford would serve
out the final year of his three-year contract when the Bucks
opted not to make a change before the July 1 lockout was
instituted.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the timing, there is no good time to make a
change,"said Weinhauer. "But those candidates that were there in
June are still there today. I believe only one job was filled in
Seattle."
</P>
<P>
However, Weinhauer did not specify any possible candidates for
the position so far. "We have identified a small group of
outstanding candidates for the head coaching position and intend
to make a decision in the very near future," Weinhauer added.
</P>
<P>
The Bucks also fired assistant coach Dick Versace, but have
made no decision on the status of assistants Jim Todd and Mike
Woodson.
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old Ford was hired in 1996 by Bucks. He previously
served as coach of the Boston Celtics for five years and led the
team to four playoff appearances before coming to Milwaukee. In
his first year, the Celtics finished 56-26, but lost in six games
in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Ford has a career coaching
record of 291-283.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Begins Bid for Record Against Goellner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Pete Sampras of the
United States will begin his quest for a record-tying 12th Grand
Slam tournament singles title next week when he opposes Marc
Goellner of Germany in opening round at the U.S. Open tennis cha
mpionships in New York.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who has won five Wimbledon and two Australian Open
titles, will attempt to win the U.S. Open for the fifth time and
join former Australian star Roy Emerson with a record 12 career
Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
But standing between Sampras and history could be long-time
rival Andre Agassi of the United States, the eighth seed. The two
could meet in the quarterfinals. Agassi has beaten Sampras twice
in their three meetings this season.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who won Wimbledon crown this year, won the U.S. Open
in 1990, 1993, 1994 and 1996, was upset by Petr Korda of the
Czech Republic in the fourth round last year. The 27-year-old
Sampras is the seventh consecutive American to be seeded first at
the Open.
</P>
<P>
Play begins Monday at the National Tennis Center in New York
and the schedule of first round play will be announced during the
weekend following the completion of qualifying competition, which
started yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Marcelo Rios of Chile will open against Daniel
Vacek of the Czech Republic and number three Patrick Rafter of
Australia begins defense of his title against Hicham Arazi of
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Among the women, top seed Martina Hingis of Switzerland will
defend her title but she has to face the most difficult second
round match of any seeded player.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old would face the winner of an opening-round
match between 1997 French Open champion Iva Majoli of Croatia and
Germany's Anke Huber, both former world top 10 players. Majoli
and Huber were seeded fourth and eighth, respectively, at last
year's U.S. Open but have dropped to 20th and 21st in the latest
rankings.
</P>
<P>
Number two Lindsay Davenport of the United States, a
pre-tournament favorite to claim her first Grand Slam singles
title, opens against Catalina Cristea of Romania.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic, coming off her
victory at Wimbledon two months ago, meets wildcard Jennifer
Capriati of the United States.
</P>
<P>
No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain, the reigning French
Open champion, takes on wildcard Kristina Brandi of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Also, fifth seed Venus Williams of the United States, the
losing finalist to Hingis last year, starts play against Elena
Wagner of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Monica Seles of the United States, a two-time
winner at the Open, Conchita Martinez of Spain, and Steffi Graf
of Germany, a five-time champion, are all expected to win their
first round matches without difficulties. But Seles stands to
meet Hingis while Graf might face Novotna in the quarterfinals.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Name Jim Wooldridge Assistant Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- New Chicago Bulls director
of Basketball operations and impending coach Tim Floyd hired his
former teammate Louisiana Tech coach Jim Wooldridge as an
assistant today.
</P>
<P>
Wooldridge announced his resignation from Louisiana Tech this
morning after compiling a 52-59 record over four years at the
school. His team Bulldogs went 12-15 in 1996-97 season, losing in
the first round of the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
Floyd, who has no NBA experience, played together with
Wooldridge in 1975-76 for the Bulldogs. They both graduated from
Louisiana Tech in 1977. Floyd was a student assistant coach the
following year when Wooldridge started 25 of 26 games and
finished third on the team in assists.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Wooldridge began his head coaching career at
Central Missouri, where he compiled a 131-48 mark in six seasons.
He coached at Southwest Texas from 1991-94 before taking over the
Bulldogs in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Jim is an excellent coach," said Floyd. "He has experience
coaching the triple-post offense and brings values and ideas that
will be important to our staff and organization."
</P>
<P>
Floyd assumed his position with the Bulls on July 23rd and
will likely be named head coach after the lockout. He was
appointed director of basketball operations to leave the window
open for Phil Jackson to return for another season, although
Jackson has said he will not be back.
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud to be able to join the Bulls organization," said
Wooldridge. "It has stood for winning, teaching and class. I'm
looking forward to learning the professional game from the
returning members of the Bull's staff."
