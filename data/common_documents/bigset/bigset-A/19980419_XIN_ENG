<HEADLINE> Unionist Party Wins Support for N.Irish Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionist
Party (UUP), the major Protestant party, voted on Saturday to give
their backing for a "yes" vote in next month's referendum on the
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the 800-strong ruling council of the UUP held
in Belfast, 540 voted for and 210 voted against the accord which
was struck last weekend by the main Protestant and Roman Catholic
parties in the province.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, UUP leader David Trimble said his party
still had concerns over parts of the agreement, but it opened the
path to a new era.
</P>
<P>
"We too are making compromises for the greater good...The door
is open for the rest of the community to come through it with us."
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be put to a referendum in both Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic on May 22.
</P>
<P>
Trimble acknowledged fears expressed by many Protestant
Unionists that the peace deal will allow Sinn Fein leaders to hold
political office while its IRA guerrilla wing holds on to its
guns.
</P>
<P>
"I now ask the IRA and Sinn Fein: Are they prepared to finally
and irrevocably renounce violence?" Trimble said after the vote.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams told a meeting of
his party in Dublin, the Irish Republic, that a final assessment
on the peace agreement would be given at a special Sinn Fein
conference to be held within a month.
</P>
<P>
But he added that last week's accord "has the potential to
redefine the relationships between these two islands".
</P>
<P>
Adams also congratulated UUP leader Trimble for winning the
vote within his party in Belfast.

<HEADLINE> British PM in Saudi Arabia on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair arrived in Jeddah, the Red Sea port city of Saudi Arabia,
on Saturday on the second leg of his first Middle East tour aimed
at "kicking start" the stalled Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Press Agency monitored here reported that during his
stopover in Jeddah, Blair will discuss with Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz means of
reviving the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will also cover the situation in the Gulf region,
the developments of ties between Gulf Arab states and Iran, and
the Israeli-proposed conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat from the British Embassy in Saudi Arabia said Blair
is keen to know the Saudi viewpoint over ways to reinvigorate the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister, who flew in from Egypt, is also
scheduled to travel on to Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak agreed Friday that
additional efforts should be made to build confidence among
parties concerned in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Britain is reportedly deeply worried about the freezing of the
peace process and calls on Israel to abide by the agreements it
signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Saudi newspapers commented Saturday that Blair's visit to the
kingdom is of vital importance because it will provide a good
opportunity for both sides to exchange views on issues of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
Blair's talks with Saudi leaders are also expected to focus on
means to increase bilateral trade and the case of two British
nurses held in Saudi jail since December 1996 for murdering an
Australian colleague, a spokesman for Blair said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> OAU Urges Angolan Parties to Move on Toward Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- an OAU delegation to Angola
calls for continued vigilance on the part of all the peace-loving
forces to avoid the recurrence of the 1992 events that led to the
reversal of the peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) here Saturday said the OAU mission to Angola led by
Assistant Secretary General in charge of political affairs
Ambassador Daniel Antonio has made the call in a statement after
its five-day visit to Angola.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, the OAU delegation had "productive, frank"
meetings will all parties to the Lusaka peace process, which have
enabled it "to fully appreciate the concerns of the government
and the United Nations regarding the attainment of the few
remaining tasks contained in the implementation program.''
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, ''the remaining talks have to do
with the extension of state administration to the remaining
areas, particularly the five sensitive regions of Sautar, Andulo,
Bailundo, Nharea and Mungo and also the demilitarization of the
remaining residual forces of UNITA (National Union for Total
Independence of Angola).''
</P>
<P>
The statement said the OAU delegation while welcoming the
progress that has been achieved to date in the implementation of
the peace process, is optimistic that the remaining tasks will be
implemented by the new agreed deadline of april 25, 1998.
</P>
<P>
''Realizing that the continued violation of the sanctions
regime imposed by the U.N. Security Council on UNITA by some
states could jeopardize the entire peace process, the OAU
delegation appeals to the international community to scrupulously
abide by the terms of the sanctions regime,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU mission also appeals to UNITA to move without any
further delay or hindrance to meet the remaining tasks, so that
the people of Angola can at long last be allowed to have peace,
and stability and exert all their energies toward the social and
economic development of their country.
</P>
<P>
''The OAU delegation further observes the need for the
international community to continue to demonstrate its solidarity
with the people of Angola as they move into the more difficult
phase of national reconstruction, rehabilitation and
development,'' the statement said, adding that ''in that regard,
it calls for more resources to be directed toward de-mining
activities, the rehabilitation and assistance of mine victims.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe: Tobacco Sales Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco sales in Zimbabwe has
dropped by about 58 percent in the first 12 days of the marketing
season as against last year, the Zimbabwean Tobacco Association
(ZTA) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Over 7.3 million kilograms of tobacco at an average price of
1.33 U.S. Dollars per kilogram have been sold by end of the week,
10 million kilograms less than the same period last year, ZTA
Market Information Director Pat Davis told the Zimbabwean News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason for such a drop in sales is because a lot of
growers have canceled bookings or rejecting some of the prices,"
said Davis.
</P>
<P>
During the first 12 sale days of last year, prices averaged
2.07 U.S. Dollars per kilogram, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the devaluation of the local currency
this year, prices of tobacco have remained low and farmers have
been withholding their crop until prices turn firm later in the
season.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the beginning of the marketing season on
March 31, there has not been much improvement and competition is
still on the weak side with offerings tending to be on the lower
quality.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is the country's biggest foreign currency earner. A
total of about 220 million kilograms was expected to be sold this
year, earning the country over 500 million U.S. Dollars.

BAGHDAD, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Saturday attended an over-six-hour-long volunteers' military
parade held at the Grand Festivities' Square in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
More than 120,000 out of 3 million volunteers including men
and women from Baghdad and other Iraqi provinces took part in the
parade, according to the official Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Iraq started military training of volunteers from early
February this year amid the Iraq-U.N. weapons inspection crisis,
during which the United States and Britain threatened to launch
military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
With the signing of the memorandum of understanding February 23
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraq on opening Iraqi
presidential sites to U.N. inspections, the crisis was defused
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States and Britain still maintain a
formidable force in the Gulf region on the ground that they want
to ensure smooth implementation of the Iraq-U.N. accord.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's military parade, dubbed Gallantry Day, was also
attended by officials of the ruling Baath Party and the
government, and heads of Arab and foreign diplomatic missions in

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Popularize Use of Mosquito-nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Health of
Ethiopia says Saturday that it has drawn up a strategy to
popularize the use of mosquito-nets in an effort to prevent the
effects of malaria.
</P>
<P>
Tarekegne Abosse, team leader of malaria and other
vector-borne diseases of the ministry told local journalists here
that preparations are underway to give orientations on the proper
use of mosquito-nets to groups of societies residing in areas
prone to malaria epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Tarekegne noted that his ministry has plans to distribute
about 33,000 mosquito-nets to people in selected areas free and
offer technical trainings about the proper utilization of the
items, saying that his ministry has also devised strategies
through which the public could buy mosquito-nets at reasonable
prices.
</P>
<P>
He urged the private sector to engage in the production of
mosquito-nets so that the public could get the items at fair
prices.
</P>
<P>
Tarekegne said the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) has
drafted plans enabling children under the age of five in malaria
ridden parts of Africa to develop the culture of using
mosquito-nets until the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) has donated 15,000
mosquito-nets to the ministry, according to Tarekegne.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent of Ethiopia's total land is said to be ideal
places for breeding mosquitos.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Raps UNSCOM for Leaking Information to Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 18 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi spokesman on Saturday
criticised the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq
for leaking information and releasing statements about the
commission's activities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The commission's "conduct contradicts its commitments to the
U.N. which forbids its employees to release any statement to the
media while they are on the job unless permitted to do so," said
the spokesman of the Iraqi Ministry of Information and Culture.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who was not named, was referring to statements of
UNSCOM Deputy Chairman Charles Duelfer published in the New York
Times newspaper Wednesday concerning Iraqi presidential sites,
which were suspected of hiding secretive weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer had leaked part of a report on the outcome of UNSCOM
team's inspections to these sites, which should be submitted to the
U.N. chief, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He leveled the same charge against UNSCOM Chairman Richard
Butler, who he said also had leaked to the same newspaper on April
17 part of his half-yearly report to be submitted to the U.N.
chief even before the Security Council has a chance to read it.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the inspections of presidential sites proved
that both British and U.S. administrations as well as UNSCOM
leaders were not telling the truth, because the arms inspectors
found no banned weapons or materials in the sites.
</P>
<P>
The eight sites, previously declared "off-limits," were
inspected by a special group of senior U.N. diplomats and arms
experts from March 26 to April 2, in accordance with a deal
stricken by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan with Iraq government
on February 23.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of inspections "has disappointed the liers who
ordered their representatives in the Special Commission to launch
a propaganda campaign against Iraq and the diplomatic efforts
exerted by the U.N. to implement Security Council resolutions,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The anti-Iraq U.S. and British campaign only aims at
diverting attention from Iraq's demand to implement paragraph 22
of resolution 687 which provides for the lifting of the embargo
now that Iraq has complied with all its obligations toward
Security Council resolutions," he added.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. sanctions against Iraq imposed since its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 can be lifted only after UNSCOM
certifies that Iraq has eliminated all prohibited weapons.

<HEADLINE> Chilean President Urges for Joint Efforts for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- While opening the Second Summit
of Americas here Saturday, Chilean President Eduardo Frei
Ruiz-Tagle called on the other 33 nations of the west hemisphere
to join hands in fighting against social diseases and for social
development.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the opening meeting of the 2-day summit,
President Frei said, individual nations "can no longer formulate
their policies without taking into account of their place in a
regional and global framework. The era of autarkies has ended."
</P>
<P>
Standing alone, the Chilean leader added, it is very difficult
to "grapple with challenges such as drug trafficking, organized
crime or the spread of infectious diseases." "Even issues which
have traditionally been considered domestic in scope, such as
social injustice, education, the modernization of the State and
the fight against corruption, have taken on international
dimensions. Global problems cannoted be solved with unilateral
policies," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The 34 leaders of the west hemisphere has set forth a broad and
busy agenda for the meeting. However, on the top of the agenda is
the topic of education.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot hope to break down the barriers that divide social
groups nor achieve sustainable economic growth as a region without
effectively educating our people," Frei noted.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot participate in a competitive and globalized world
if our people are not capable of applying the spectacular
scientific and technical advances of our era. Education, in farms
and factories as well as in schools and universities, is the best
means of providing all of our citizens with the chance to improve
their own lives," the President explained.
</P>
<P>
Frei also called on the participating countries to develop
active science and technology policies, to support the educational
reform processes and to strengthen cooperation in the field of
education.
</P>
<P>
Talking about pushing forward the integration and liberalization
of trade and investment, the Chilean leader said, Chile has "an
enormous interest" in establishing clear and stable rules for its
commerce with the rest of the countries of the Americas. In a
globalized world, the well-being of the countries is linked to the
liberalization of commerce, and thus "we must continue to resist
protectionism. In so doing, we must ensure that the rhetoric of
free trade is translated into concrete action," he underlined.

<HEADLINE> Somalia: Tension Mounts As Pressure for Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Tension has mounted up along
the former green line dividing the capital Mogadishu as
militiamen are seen being positioned there Saturday morning, the
first since late January this year.
</P>
<P>
A number of armed militiamen have been deployed by the faction
led by Ali Mahdi Mohamed along every section of the cross line
leading to south Mogadishu, a line which has been dismantled
after the Cairo agreement was endorsed by factional leaders early
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the militia officials along the
green line, the deployment has something to do with the
continuous abductions of 10 International Commission of Red Cross
(ICRC) staff members in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
It is suspected that the militiamen holding the ICRC members
might try to cross the line into southern Mogadishu if the
pressure on them further increases, the militia sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, serious negotiations are going on for the fourth day
Saturday between representatives from the abductors and those of
the Abgal clan led by its leader Imam Mohamud Imam Omar, and
other religious leaders, who are trying to secure the release of
the Red Cross aid workers.
</P>
<P>
It was thought that it wouldn't take Ali Mahdi more than 24
hours to secure the release of the hostages, but now it seems
that it will take much longer.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi and his close associates are working hard to secure
the release, but the abductors are still stucking to their
demands of having huge ransom exceeding nine million U.S. Dollars
paid to them before the release, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said the abduction has also got something to do
with politics.
</P>
<P>
They said that elements opposing Ali Mahdi are playing a
political card by holding the hostages so as to prove that Ali
Mahdi's position is weak.
</P>
<P>
A bus driver dropped his passengers at the green line, saying
passengers are afraid that armed gangs has started looting.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Ten Palestinian protesters were
injured and 20 others arrested Saturday in East Jerusalem during
clashes with Israeli soldiers while marking the Palestinian
Prisoners Day.
</P>
<P>
The injured include Hatem Abdel Qader and Ahmad Batsh, two
members of the Palestinian Council, according to the Palestinian
police.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Palestinians staged a protest Saturday in
Salah A-Deen Street of the Old City in East Jerusalem, calling on
Israel to release all Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The
demonstration led to clashes with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers and security forces closed off the street to
prevent the situation there from further worsening and put East
Jerusalem under tight security control for fear of unrest.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations organized by the Palestinian Prisoners Society
were also held Saturday in the West Bank cities of Jenin,
Tulkarem, and Qalqilya. There were no reports of clash from these
cities so far.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side estimated that a total of 3,000
Palestinians are being held in Israeli jails either under
administrative detention without charges or under criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Israeli Defense Force released Ahmed
Katamesh, 45, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine. Katamesh was arrested on September 1, 1992 and
transferred to administrative detention in october 1993.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's protest was the first held this year by Palestinians
in East Jerusalem, which Israel claimed as part of its sole
capital while Palestinians want as capital of their future state.

ANKARA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A total of 60 protesters have been
taken into custody in a protest against the government's ban on
scarf-wearing in Turkey's southeastern province of Bingol, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chanting anti-secular slogans, hundreds of Muslims held a
rally in Solhan county late Friday after their prayers in mosque,
demanding the government remove the ban on scarf-wearing of female
civil workers and girl students.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, armed with sticks and stones, tried to break
into the government building and clashed with riot police sent to
disperse the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Several demonstrators and policemen suffered injuries in the
clash and were rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Bingol Governor Suleyman Kamci was quoted as saying that the
anti-government protest is illegal because it did not get the
approval of the provincial government beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Turkish government and local authorities have issued
regulations banning female civil workers and girl students from
wearing scarf in the offices and on the campus.
</P>
<P>
Conservative Muslims have voiced strong opposition to the
regulations, accusing them of constituting a violation of
citizen's religious freedom.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief on Asian Financial Crisis at ECOSOC's High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The interchange on global
financial integration and development between the diplomatic,
financial and developmental cooperation communities from the more
than twenty countries will enrich the whole world, UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the special high-level meeting on global financial
integration and development initiated by the UN Social and
Economic Council(ECOSOC), the Secretary-General said the meeting
would help breaking the more strait-jacketed ways of thinking and
move the international community forward in the search of common
good, in the eradication of poverty and the creation of conditions
of stability and predictability.
</P>
<P>
Annan said finance was central to the development process, but
development finance was also an area where, in recent years, the
thinking had changed fundamentally; and where, at the same time,
dramatic development had taken place. There was now universal
recognition of the developmental role of private international
capital flows, which had brought with them tremendous benefits.
</P>
<P>
There were three main areas of concern in the implementation of
the recent crisis in Asia, he said. First and foremost, was the
situation of the crisis countries themselves.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are all preoccupied by the harsh toll these crises
impose in an entire citizenry", he said. Those hardest hit were
usually the most vulnerable Job seekers who had migrated during
the good times; the poor who could no longer pay for the higher
priced basic necessities; those groups which were employed in the
least organized sectors of the economy. Beyond that was the
continuing threat of social strife, breakdown of law and order and
loss of self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
Another major area fo concern, he said, was that the precise
impact of the Asian crisis could not be separated from all other
independent development affecting the world economy. Yet it was
becoming increasingly apparent that other developing and
transition countries would be affected more severely by the crisis
than their developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, the collateral damage is greater in developing
countries than elsewhere," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Pledges to Win "Fast Track" to Push FTAA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- While addressing the opening
session of the Second Summit of Americas here Saturday, U.S.
President Bill Clinton vowed to win the "fast track" legislation
to push forward the process for the Free Trade Area of Americas
(FTAA).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. leader reassured the U.S. government's commitment to
the free trade area of Americas which will be "in the fast lane of
our concerns."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also outlined some remarkable achievements in the last
three and a half years since the Miami Summit in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The economy of the region has grown 15 percent. Last year,
average growth was five percent, and inflation was the lowest in
50 years. Chile and Uruguay have set the standard for poverty
reduction and fiscal responsibility. Brazil and Argentina have
slowed inflation to a crawl. Mexico has overcome adversity,
transformed its economy, broadened its democracy, Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bolivia has attracted new foreign investments and
Venezuela's Apertura program is drawing investment to develop its
energy resources. Peru and Ecuador, with a little help from their
friends, are working toward a peaceful end to their protracted
border disputes. After some years of strife, Central America is
well on the way to achieving its long-held vision of democracy and
integration and growth. Caribbean nations are joining forces to
expand their economies and to defend their shores against drugs
and crime, as the President noted.
</P>
<P>
"The Miami Summit was a watershed in the history of our
hemisphere as the leaders of free people embraced a common vision
of the future and a common strategy for achieving it. The journey
from Miami to Santiago has been filled with progress toward our
goals," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Four years ago at Miami, we planted the seed of a new
partnership for a new century. Now we can and must do what is
necessary for that seed to grow -- to grow in freedom and
opportunity and cooperation," the U.S President concluded.
</P>
<P>
In order to review progress since the Miami Summit, a 193-page
report entitled "Words into Deeds" was released here today, which
is focused on implementation of the decisions reached at the 1994
Miami Summit of the Americas.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The discussion on the
global financial integration and development have demonstrated
that international institutions and national governments still
have a lot to learn about responding to the forces of global
financial integration, the Vice-President of the UN Economic and
Social Council Francesco Paolo Fulci said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ending session of the high-level discussion
held this morning, Fulci said all the participants have reached
the common view: there is a need to strengthen the global
architecture; prevention is better than cure; actions are required
at both the international and national levels.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said from a technical point of view, there
seems to be universal agreement that more information, greater
transparency and improved monitoring are indispensable in reducing
the possibility of financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the reason, version, motivation and inspiration behind
the free discussion all focus on a single goal: to make the world
a better place in which to live for all the people of the planet,
by giving the developing countries, especially the least developed
countries, a better chance to improve their sort.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Nigerian Party Adopts Abacha as Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Party of Nigeria
(DPN) Saturday adopted head of the military government General
Sani Abacha as its sole candidate for the August 1 presidential
election. It is the second of Nigeria's five political parties to
do so.
</P>
<P>
Before DPN, Nigeria's largest party, the United Nigeria
Congress Party (UNCP) has at its national convention in Kaduna
Thursday adopted General Abacha as its sole flagbearer in the
coming election.
</P>
<P>
The motion to adopt Abacha as the DPN's candidate was moved by
the party's national chairman Alhaji Saleh Hassan, at a national
convention held in Nigeria's oil industry center Port Harcourt in
the south.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the British Broadcasting Corporation
(BBC), the motion was put to voice vote and the delegates
responded with a roar of "yes." There was no dissident voice.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the nomination, the party amended its
constitution to allow Abacha to contest on the party's platform.
The constitution formerly restricted candidacy to only
card-carrying members.
</P>
<P>
By tomorrow, when their national conventions end, the three
other parties, the National Center Party of Nigeria, the
Grass-roots Democratic Movement (GDM) and the Congress for
National Consensus Party are also expected to adopt Abacha as
their presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
The only problem will probably come from the GMD, as both
Mohammed Yusurf and Tunji Braithweaite, the only two persons that
have declared their interest to contest for the presidency have
expressed their wish to do so on the platform of the GMD.
</P>
<P>
Should General Abacha become the sole presidential candidate,
the next question arising will be whether there is need for a
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In fact, there has been a suggestion from some quarter of the
politicians that if the five parties adopt Abacha as their
consensus candidate, there will be no need for the presidential
election, which will then be replaced by a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled presidential election in August was part of
General Sani Abacha transition to civil rule program announced in
1995, by which he promised to give power to an elected civilian
government in October this year.
</P>
<P>
He has been so far silent on the issue of whether he will run
or not.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Wants No War on Neighbors: Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba said
Saturday that Zambia doesn't want to wage war against its
neighbors, the Zambian National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The country is too "preoccupied" with economic reforms that it
doesn't want to wage war against its neighbors, ZNBC quoted
Chiluba as saying here.
</P>
<P>
While briefing Daniel Antonio, visiting Assistant
Secretary-General for political affairs of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), Chiluba further explained that Zambia has no
capacity or the means to start antagonizing its neighbors in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president said that his country is committed to
peace "although we may be provoked, we shall not retaliate
because we want peace."
</P>
<P>
He further pointed out that Zambia wants peace with Angola
"not out of fear."
</P>
<P>
These remarks follow Luanda's accusations that Zambia has
been involved in supplying arms to Angola's former rebel
movement, the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
And the Angolan ambassador to Zambia gave a strong warning at
a news briefing here in March that Zambia may face a military
intervention if its territory continues to be used for airlifting
arms supplies to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
In response to the earlier accusations which have been denied
by the Zambian side, Chiluba told the OAU envoy that his
government has imposed a ban on all airports in the country when
it started hearing that suspected planes were landing and taking
off from the country's unknown airports.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba reiterated that Zambia is committed to the Lusaka
Peace Protocol signed in 1994 between UNITA and the Angolan
government.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Zambia wants peace with its neighbors
including Angola, because if any country in Africa is
destabilized it is the whole Africa which is destabilized.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba noted that there is a possibility for the two
countries to be friendly and live as brothers as it has been in
the past.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Antonio thanked Zambia for its efforts to
host and take care of 32,000 refugees from surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
The OAU envoy arrived in Lusaka Thursday on a mission to
acquaint himself with the political and economic development in
the member countries and, as for Angola, to monitor the
implementation of the Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Antonio visited the Zambian-Angolan border areas.
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Lusaka, Antonio has been to Namibia and
Angola.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to Plant More Clove Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar will embark on a
massive campaign to plant clove trees next week, reports reaching
here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The planting of new clove trees is part of an afforestation
campaign of the isles in the Indian Ocean, the reports quoted
Brigadier General Adam Mwakanjuki, the Zanzibar Minister for
Agriculture, Livestock and Natural Resources, as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 trees are expected to be planted on the twin
islands of Zanzibar, with half on on the Unguja island and the
other half on the Pemba island to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the campaign will be formerly
launched by Chairman of the National Environmental Management
Council Reginald Mengi.
</P>
<P>
Mwakanjuki said that the campaign is part of the isles'
environmental conservation program, as felling of trees to obtain
firewood and building materials has been rampant.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the problem, the reports said, the government
will also launch a massive education and publicity campaign to
make the public aware of the importance of environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
Clove exports, which used to be the isles' principal foreign
exchange earner, have been in decline for more than a decade
following the fall of prices in the world market. In recent
years, tourism has become the major foreign exchange earner.

BEIRUT, April 18 (Xinhua) -- When Sofi Said was pulled out from

she and other villagers were hiding two years ago today, she was
thought to be dead.
</P>
<P>
Shrapnels of the Israeli bomb that had killed her husband,
Ahmad Ibrahim, and her 22-year-old daughter, Irham, and more than
100 others instantly in Gana village in south Lebanon, had ripped

"I was unconscious and full of blood. After dragging me out,
the rescuers touched my pulse and were surprised to find I was
still alive," said Sofi, who was 55 at the time.
</P>

She was immediately taken to a hospital in Sidon, Lebanon's

Her injuries were so severe that she had two operations and was
confined in the hospital for two months. But 107 people, including
her husband and daughter, died their tragic deaths in the
notorious Gana massacre that day - April 18, 1996.
</P>
<P>
It has always been full of pain and fear when Sofi forced her
memory to the day. "Life for me is meaningless since I lost my
husband and my dear daughter," she cried, "How can I live without
them?
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of villagers of Gana and neighboring villages were
seeking shelter in the conference hall of the Fijian contingent of
the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNFIL), to escape
Israeli air raids and artillery bombardment.
</P>
<P>
"We had thought the U.N. forces' camps should be safe and
Israelis would never attack them. But they did," Sofi said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops launched military offensive dubbed Grapes of
Wrath on April 13, 1996 in retaliation for Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks, and air-raided on April 18 the Fijian
contingent compound in Qana, just north of the Israeli self-styled
security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,200-square-kilometer border enclave in
south Lebanon in 1985 after two invasions, with the claimed aim of
protecting its northern settlements from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 107 Lebanese civilians killed in the raid,
more than 200 others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
"My daughter was only 22 when she died. She had just finished
her study in the high school and prepared to go to university.
But ...," she couldn't continue, tears running down her face.
</P>
<P>
Sofi is now living with her only son to accompany her beloved
husband and daughter, who were buried on the slope leading to the
massacre site. Two years on, she has difficulty to sleep, feels
weak and depressed, and takes a variety of medicines to help fight
the daily nightmare of the bloody killing.
</P>
<P>
She was extremely skeptical about a possible Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon. "Following the massacre, they (Israelis)
announced they wanted to pull out. But until now, nothing
happened," she said.
</P>
<P>
"How can you believe in the words of the killers?" she asked.

ANKARA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police seized a total of
86 kilograms of heroin Saturday in a raid in Baskale town in
eastern Van province, according to the semi-official Anatolia News

</P>
<P>
Police stormed a civilian house in the town of Guroluk village

The drugs came from Iran and were destined for the European

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ends Military Training of Volunteers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq signaled the conclusion of
its over-two-month-long military training of volunteers with a
parade that lasted more than six hours Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to reporters after the parade, dubbed Gallantry
Day, Iraqi Minister of Culture and Information Hammam Abdul-Khaliq
described the it as a "coronation" to the training sessions in
response to President Saddam Hussein's call for taking up arms
against a possible foreign invasion.
</P>
<P>
More than 120,000 out of 3 million volunteers including men and
women from Baghdad and other provinces took part in the parade,
which was also attended by Saddam and officials of the ruling
Baath Party.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister said "the parade is a message sent by the
great Iraqi people to the U.S. and British troops and armed forces
in the Gulf region to show that the Iraqis are ready, at any time,
to defend their country and to stand against any evil attempt to
jeopardize Iraq's integrity and sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Iraq started military training of volunteers from early
February this year amid the Iraq-U.N. weapons inspection crisis,
during which the United States and Britain threatened to launch
air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After the crisis was defused with the signing of an accord by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraq late February, the
United States and Britain keep their formidable forces in the
region to "ensure smooth execution of the accord."
</P>
<P>
On the relationship between Iraq and the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, the minister said that Iraq is awaiting the
results of the Security Council's meetings at the end of this
month, which will review the sanctions imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait can not be lifted unless UNSCOM verifies that Iraq is free
of weapons of mass destruction.

<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang Haishi shocked its
star-studded opponents Vanguard Huandao with a 2-1 victory in the
sixth round of the Chinese soccer league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Haishi, savoring its first sweet victory of the season, surged
ahead with two goals netted in the first half through its Korean
import Se Min Chol in the eighth minute and Qu Nannan in the 23rd
minute with a precise header.
</P>
<P>
Huandao, that boasted of several members of the national squad,
failed to convert any opportunity into goal until the 67th minute
when substitute Xu Xin found the target eventually.
</P>
<P>
In other games, Shandong Luneng also anchored its first win of
2-0 over Shenzhen Pingan on its home turf, which forced Pingan to
settle for its fourth consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
Deng Lejun, who inked a record transfer of 2.01 million RMB
from Beijing Guo'an to Luneng, scored in the 36th and 58th minutes
through a header and a penalty pick.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Dalian Wanda extended its lead by trouncing
visiting Qingdao Hainiu 4-0 with ease, retaining its top spot in
the overall standings with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
Hainiu's head coach Li Yingfa, a native from Dalian, said that
Wanda remained as the favorites to clinch the league title as
seldom a Chinese club could hold back its powerful attacks.

<HEADLINE> Bartoli Wins World Cup Cycling Race in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Michele
Bartoli took on Sunday the title of the 84th Liege-Bastogne-Liege
cycling race that was also a World Cup event, the fourth on this
year's circuit.
</P>
<P>
The Italian rider clocked six hours 38 minutes 31 seconds over
the 265.5-kilometer race. Second place went to Laurent Jalabert
of France, followed by Rodolfo Massi also from Italy.
</P>
<P>
Jalabert was 1:06 adrift from the winner.
</P>
<P>
Bartoli launched his final attack with some 14 kilometers left
by overtaking early leader and 1994 Liege World Cup winner Evgeni
Berzin of Russia.
</P>
<P>
He then led the remaining race in front of the immediate
chasing pack of six which was soon joined by Berzin who simply
faded in the end of the one-day race.
</P>
<P>
Bartoli, fifth place finisher of last Wednesday's non-classic
cycling race from Charleroi to Huy also in Belgium, plucked out
all in him in the final climb of a 15-percent ascent toward the
finish.
</P>
<P>
He pounded his fist forward for a triumphant gesture after he
looked back to make sure that no one was within real challenging
distance.
</P>
<P>
Home favorite Frank Vandenbroucke could not hold on to the
final kick only to finish outside the top five. The Belgian won
the Paris-Nice and Gent-Wevelgem cycling races earlier this season
and was ranked third by the International Cycling Union.

<HEADLINE> China Begins New Round Of Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- To stimulate demand and keep its
economy on track, China is starting a massive infrastructure
project estimated to cost 750 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts here have pointed out that the investment,
approximately 2 trillion yuan each year for the next three years,
will have a profound effect on economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The central government has increased this year's spending on
railways to 45 billion yuan from 38.9 billion yuan and work on 9
new railways is expected to begin this year. Railway Ministry
sources say that total spending could run as high as 250 billion
yuan from now to the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
China has also increased spending on other infrastructure like
expressways, water conservation facilities, urban utilities, and
environmental protection, according to a State Development
Planning Commission official, who predicts that total spending
will exceeds one trillion yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
To boost domestic spending, the central government has a series
of measures to encourage people to buy their own residences. As
part of this, China Construction Bank has 15 billion yuan for
mortgages this year.
</P>
<P>
Hu Angang, a Chinese Academy of Sciences economist, says that
massive spending on infrastructure has been proven to be one of
the most effective ways to stimulate the economy, and, to maintain
annual growth of 8 percent through the year 2000, China needs to
increase infrastructure spending to prevent possible recessions
while creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
State Development Planning Commission officials say that China
is looking for ways to raise money for these capital construction
projects, like raising the cost of public utilities, encouraging
project managers to get funds directly from the capital market, or
attracting more foreign investment and using more low-interest
foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments will also use stocks,
convertible bonds, and industrial funds to finance key capital
projects, the officials say.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Help Save Peace Process in Dual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Prime Minister
Tony Blair said here Sunday that his country will make efforts in
"dual capacity" to help save the long-stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Britain, in the capacity of the government itself as well as
the rotating presidency of the European Union (EU), will do
"whatever we can to find a solution for the peace process," said
Blair at a joint press conference with King Hussein of Jordan
after their meeting at the Royal Palace.
</P>
<P>
Blair admitted that the situation is difficult for the region
as well as for the whole world, but Britain is confident that the
problem can be settled through regional and international efforts.
</P>
<P>
The EU can contribute to a fine turn-out of the process as the
representative of regional countries in Europe, said Blair who
arrived here Sunday on the third leg of his first Middle East tour
since his Labor Party took power in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
"There can be some solutions," but needing goodwill by all the
concerned parties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the situation between the Arabs and Israel to that in
Northern Ireland, Blair said that there is one common lesson,
which is that "these situations - difficult as they are over many,
many years - can only be resolved if goodwill exists to resolve
them."
</P>
<P>
Blair recently helped broker an agreement between the
Protestants and the Catholics of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"That is why I am here. We will help make progress in the
future," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians were
stalled over a year ago due to Israel's construction of a Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain will not upstage the United States to play a
leading mediator's role in the Mideast peace process. "We have
remained engaged in the region and act complimentarily to the
U.S. efforts," he added.
</P>
<P>
On his part, King Hussein said "we hope that the current visit
of the prime minister to the area at a very, very critical time
will help us move ahead."
</P>
<P>
Blair later left Jordan for Israel. He has visited Egypt and
Saudi Arabia. Still on his agenda is a visit to the Palestinian
self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Leader Meets Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Leader of Israeli opposition
party of Meretz Yossi Sarid met Sunday with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in the Gaza Strip to discuss ways of breaking the
deadlock in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, also attended by Jordanian Parliament
Deputy Speaker Hamad Tarani, they discussed the idea of forming a
joint delegation to visit the U.S. and Europe, calling for greater
role by the U.S. and the European Union (EU) in reviving the
long-stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sarid said they would not ask the U.S. and EU to press Israel
because that would produce adverse effects.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the U.S. and EU would do as they did in
mediating the Northern Ireland peace process. He was referring to
the peace agreement signed early April by the British and Irish
governments and eight political parties in Northern Ireland to end
the deep-running conflict there.
</P>
<P>
Sarid's meeting with Arafat was held a day before a visit by
British Prime Minister Tony Blair here, who had said the Northern
Ireland peace agreement should have an impact on the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Blair, on his first Middle East tour since he took office last
year, is arriving in Israel late Sunday for talks with Israeli
leaders. He said he would inject new impetus into the peace
process with the spirit of conciliation that helped clinch the
Northern Ireland peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister has visited Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
Jordan in his trip which will also take him to the Palestinian
self-rule areas.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Two South African cabinet
ministers held talks with Hamas, the spiritual leader of the
Islamic Resistance Movement, during their recent visit to Saudi
Arabia, local daily the Sunday Independent revealed.
</P>
<P>
South African Justice Minister Dullah Omar and Constitutional
Affairs Minister Mohammed Valli Mossa met the paralysed Hamas
leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin, while they were in Saudi Arabia as
guests of the Saudi royal family to attend the annual pilgrimage
in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
Omar confirmed the meeting had taken place, but declined to
make further comment.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, who was freed by the Israeli government last year
following a botched attempt to assassinate a Hamas official,
Khaled Meshaal, in Amman, Jordan, enjoys high prestige among
Palestinians and is revered by Islamists throughout the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
According to Iqbal Jhazbay, the director of University of
South Africa's Centre for Arabic and Islamic Studies, Omar and
Moosa met Yassin on April 7, in a royal guest house in Mina, a
town just outside Mecca. Jhazbay acted as interpreter at the
meeting,
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Yassin was well-briefed on South African
President Nelson Mandela's recent press conference with American
President Bill Clinton, in which Mandela defended South Africa's
ties with countries such as Libya and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Yassin expressed appreciation for Mandela's support for the
Palestinian cause, Jhazbay said.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Independent quoted unidentified government
officials as saying that the half-hour meeting is of particular
significance because it suggests South Africa could play a role
in creating trust between Palestinians and Israelis.

<P>
SOFIA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Poul-Erik Hoyer
led Denmark's record-breaking team to its second successive 5-0
victory without dropping a game at the European Championships.
</P>
<P>
The Danes, who followed their 5-0 win over the Netherlands,
defeated the Ukrainians by the same score on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Denmark broke the ground last time two years ago in the home
town of Herning, when it became the first nation to win all six
European gold medals, and is still the favourite to repeat the
achievement.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Hoyer, who replaced world number two Peter Gade
for the men's singles, was as effective as ever in beating
Ukraine's Michael Mizin by losing only seven points.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, seeded to meet Denmark in Monday's final, beat Scotland
comfortably 4-1, while England suffered a hiccup in beating
Germany 4-1.
</P>
<P>
Darren Hall, the former European men's singles champion, missed
a game point at 14-12 and was beaten 17-14, 15-9 by the German
number one Oliver Pongratz.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The copyright to the music score
"Happiness", a popular Chinese melody, went for 580,000 yuan
(70,000 US dollars) at auction here today.
</P>
<P>
The music was written by Liu Mingyuan, a Chinese musician, in
1958. The tune has been used thousands of times over the past 40
years for holiday programs, ballroom parties, or various
celebration activities because of the excitement and enjoyment
that it causes.
</P>
<P>
The melody was created out of a local song from Shanxi
Province, and became popular in China from its very first
performance.
</P>
<P>
Also auctioned off were several valuable Erhus, the
two-stringed Chinese instrument that Liu Mingyuan used.
</P>
<P>
Wu Lianzhong, of the Beijing Auction Company, the auctioneers,
says that the proceeds from the auction will be given to a
foundation in Liu's name that promotes the use of traditional
Chinese music.

ROTTERDAM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Tegla Loroupe ran a solo
race for the world women's best time to win the Rotterdam marathon
in 2 hours, 20 minutes and 47 seconds on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Fabian Roncero failed to become the fastest-ever man
but still won the men's race in 2:07:27.
</P>
<P>
After 10 kilometers, Loroupe already clocked 20 seconds in
short of the women's previous best of 2:21:06 set by Norwegian
Ingrid Kristiansen in London on April 21, 1985.
</P>
<P>
Loroupe, winner of the race last year, coasted home in the
final kilometers with confident strides as the only woman among
the men in the leading field.
</P>
<P>
The men runners, including Portuguese Domingos Castro and
Kenyan Eric Kimayo, ran the first half of the race more than a
minute under the pace of Ethiopian Belayneh Dinsamo's previous
world best of 2:06:50.
</P>
<P>
But Roncero made a sudden break around the 25-kilometer mark
for a spurt of five kilometers before suffering injuries to his
hamstring around the 39-km mark.
</P>
<P>
However, Roncero still managed a final desperate acceleration
to hold off South Korean Bong Ju-Lee who finished second in
2:07.44, ahead of Italy's Danilo Goffi who was third in 2:08.33.

<P>
URUMQI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A dozen people were reported
missing after strong winds hit the northern and eastern parts of
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The gale-force winds were accompanied by a duststorm in some
areas as they swept through 10 cities and prefectures, cutting
electricity and water supplies, and causing damage to houses and
destruction of property.
</P>
<P>
By noontime, it had hit northwestern Xinjiang, uprooting or
destroying trees. In the city of Tacheng, rocks picked up by the
wind shattered window glass and caused power and water shortages
for more than ten hours.
</P>
<P>
The regional capital, Urumqi, was hit by more moderate winds
around 11:00 a.m., but they still destroyed large billboards,
trees and power lines, causing blackouts in some
neighborhoods. The yellowish dust that blanketed the city had
still not disappeared at press time.
</P>
<P>
Hami Prefecture in eastern Xinjiang reported 11 people missing
and flocks of sheep and cattle in Altay Prefecture in the north
were scattered.
</P>
<P>
The strong wind also caused forest fires and fires in
residential areas and the regional government and various
departments are involved in emergency operations.
</P>
<P>
According to regional meteorologists, the winds were caused by
a cold air mass from Siberia that hit a warm front from the
Caspian Sea.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Two South African cabinet
ministers held talks with Hamas, the spiritual leader of the
Islamic Resistance Movement, during their recent visit to Saudi
Arabia, local daily the Sunday Independent revealed.
</P>
<P>
South African Justice Minister Dullah Omar and Constitutional
Affairs Minister Mohammed Valli Mossa met the paralysed Hamas
leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin, while they were in Saudi Arabia as
guests of the Saudi royal family to attend the annual pilgrimage
in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
Omar confirmed the meeting had taken place, but declined to
make further comment.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, who was freed by the Israeli government last year
following a botched attempt to assassinate a Hamas official,
Khaled Meshaal, in Amman, Jordan, enjoys high prestige among
Palestinians and is revered by Islamists throughout the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
According to Iqbal Jhazbay, the director of University of
South Africa's Centre for Arabic and Islamic Studies, Omar and
Moosa met Yassin on April 7, in a royal guest house in Mina, a
town just outside Mecca. Jhazbay acted as interpreter at the
meeting,
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Yassin was well-briefed on South African
President Nelson Mandela's recent press conference with American
President Bill Clinton, in which Mandela defended South Africa's
ties with countries such as Libya and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Yassin expressed appreciation for Mandela's support for the
Palestinian cause, Jhazbay said.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Independent quoted unidentified government
officials as saying that the half-hour meeting is of particular
significance because it suggests South Africa could play a role
in creating trust between Palestinians and Israelis.

<HEADLINE> Israeli MPs Oppose Pullout From South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli Knesset
(parliament) members announced here Sunday that they have formed a
movement to oppose suggested unilateral Israeli troop withdrawal
from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Knesset member Uzi Landau of the ruling Likud group and Labor's
Knesset member Ephraim Sneh said that they have formed a political
movement named "Security for the North," to carry out activities
for this end.
</P>
<P>
The security in the north is vital to Israel and a unilateral
pullout from South Lebanon would damage the country's interests,
they said. It is feared that unilateral Israeli actions would
enable Lebanese guerrillas to launch cross-border attacks, thus
endangering the northern settlements.
</P>
<P>
The two also said that they oppose the activities conducted by
Labor's Knesset member Yossi Beilin and that of the "Four
Mothers," which call on Israel to quit south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Four Mothers" is a group in Israel formed by four mothers
whose sons were killed in south Lebanon while in service. The name
remains the same even after more people joint the group, which has
been lobbying hard for Israeli troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Landau and Sneh are the first politicians in Israel to openly
oppose unilateral Israeli pullout from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During the past several months, the pullout issue has become a
hot topic in Israel again as more and more people support the idea
of pulling out the Israel Defense Force from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet decided on April 1 to accept the U.N.
resolution 425, two decades after it was adopted by the Security
Council, and expressed willingness to pull out troops from south
Lebanon provided security arrangements be worked out with Lebanese
government.
</P>
<P>
Both Syria and Lebanon reportedly rejected the Israeli idea of
conditional withdrawal and asked Israel to exit from south Lebanon
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops are operating inside a 1,200-square-kilometer
security zone in south Lebanon set up in 1985 after two invasions
to provide so-called security to northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Military confrontations have been intensified inside the
security zone since the beginning of 1998 between the Israeli
troops and Lebanese resistance groups such as Hezbollah, forcing
Israel to consider an early pullout.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- After concluding a three-day
visit to Zambia, a delegation of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) pledged to consolidate their relations as the region
moves from an era of conflict to channeling its energies and
resources towards socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
An OAU press statement issued here Sunday said the OAU
delegation to Zambia led by Assistant Secretary General in charge
of political affairs Ambassador Daniel Antonio also spoke highly
of the outstanding role played by Zambia in the peace process in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the OAU delegation held meetings
with Zambian President F. Chiluba and other ministers on issues
of the socio-economic and political developments in the country
over the last year and the progress and difficulties encountered
thereto.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation recalled the role played by Zambia in the
liberation of Africa and its role within the OAU, especially
within the OAU Liberation Committee, the OAU Commission of
Refugees, the OAU Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution
activities and the restructuring exercise currently underway
within the organization," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU delegation which had just visited Angola also
discussed the progress attained in the implementation of the
Lusaka Peace Accord and the difficulties remained, noted the
report.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also observed the need for the international
community to assist in accelerating the peace process, especially
the neighbouring countries that had played a vital role in the
entire process.
</P>
<P>
The OAU delegation also visited Maheba refugee camp and the
Airport of Zambezi City in the northern province, the statement
added.

<HEADLINE> Blair Ends Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair ended a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia on Sunday and left for
Jordan to continue his Middle East tour, Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Blair left Saudi Arabia with a strong belief on the joint
desire by both countries to push forward the peace march between
Arabs and Israel and his keenness on avoiding further
disappointment for peace," a British diplomat said, quoted by the
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Blair arrived in Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah Saturday on the
second leg of his Mideast tour after wrapping up a visit to
Egypt. He held talks with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown
Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified British diplomat said that Blair is satisfied
with the talks, during which the he voiced hope that Saudi Arabia
will play a better role in maintaining stability and security in
the Middle East and the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Blair's tour is aimed at helping revive the stalled peace
process and bolstering ties between Britain and the countries he
planned to visit, the diplomat said. Blair will also travel to
Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said Blair "came to the region with a
responsibility and ideas to activate the peace process," although
he is not carrying any European peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Britain is holding the rotating presidency of the European
Union (EU). The EU is keen on pushing the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, the diplomat said that Blair's
talks with the Saudi leaders were "excellent" and covered efforts
to further cement the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Saudi Arabia have signed a number of economic
accords and defense cooperation agreements.
</P>
<P>
Under the defense agreements, Britain will sell 21 billion
U.S. dollars worth of military equipment and weapons to Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Trade exchange between the two countries reached 6.7 billion
dollars in 1997, with about 5 billion dollars in favor of
Britain.

LUANDA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations special envoy in
Angola Blondin Beye has revealed that some new developments will
appear in the Angolan peace process regarding certain key issues,
the Angola News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>

<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on the prospects of Angolan
peace process and the way in which U.N. will appear in Angola in
the future.

<HEADLINE> China Breaks Foreign Domination of Mobile Telecoms Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China has recently connected its
first home-made digital mobile telecommunications equipment with
the local network in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Information Industry officials say China now has
managed to halt the foreign domination of its mobile
telecommunications equipment business and the achievement means
that China is one of the few countries capable of producing this
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The officials say the country will use both Chinese-made and
imported equipment to expand the telecommunications network with a
very flexible mix.
</P>
<P>
The GSM1800 digital mobile telecommunications system was
developed by the No.1 Research Institute of the ministry's
Telecommunications Science and Technology Institute and will be
used to improve the increasingly crowded GSM900 system that is
widely used in China at present.
</P>
<P>
The state-of-the-art equipment marks a major step forward in
China's move to commercialize its scientific and technological
achievements. Until last year, almost all the equipment was
imported or produced by Sino-foreign joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The new Chinese-mde equipment did well during tests in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Inner Cabinet Discusses Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Ahead of the visit to the
region by the U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, Israeli
inner cabinet on Sunday discussed the second redeployment in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Israel Radio, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu convened National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon
and Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky to discuss the
deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But it was still not clear whether the inner cabinet has
reached a consensus on the extent of the further withdrawal,
which has stalled the peace process for months.
</P>
<P>
Ross failed last month to make Israeli leaders accept a U.S.
peace proposal, which reportedly calls on Israel to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians during the second
pullback.
</P>
<P>
Israel insisted that the U.S. proposal is unacceptable, arguing
that any further redeployment from more than 9 percent of the West
Bank will damage its national interests.
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to bring a modification of the U.S. proposal
when he returns to the region at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Tony Blair is due to visit
Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas on Sunday and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Blair evidently will focus his attention on clinching an
interim agreement between Israel and the Palestinians on the
opening of a joint industrial zone at the Gaza Strip's eastern
edge and of the projected Dahaniya airport at its southern
end.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Researchers Find New Strain Of Hepatitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers say that a
virus they found in serum samples from hepatitis patients recently
may be a new type of hepatitis virus.
</P>
<P>
The new virus was compared with a virus named TTV that Japanese
scientists discovered last December, and was found to be the same
in 95 percent of the studies, and so is considered to be the
seventh type of hepatitis virus, according to Prof. Wang Haitao,
who led the research at the Chinese Military Academy of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Five types of viruses were known to cause hepatitis: Hepatitis
A, B, C, D and E, but scientists suspected that there were viruses
that were still unknown because evidence of the five viruses could
not be found in 8 to 15 percent of hepatitis patients, so they
were referred to as Non A-E viruses.
</P>
<P>
The sixth type was discovered by American scientists in 1996,
but was found to cause less than 20 percent of Non A-E hepatitis
cases, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
TTV was found in a hepatitis patient in Japan and was given its
name from the patient's initials. Chinese researchers believed
that TTV could be transmitted through blood transfusions and
possibly other ways, Wang said, so further research is being done
to see how it causes hepatitis and how harmful it is.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine call
the finding very important for treatment and prevention of
hepatitis in China, where 158 out of every 100,000 people become
hepatitis victims and two million new cases are reported each year.
</P>
<P>
"More studies should be made in this field since we're still
unaware of the real causes of eight to twelve percent of hepatitis
cases," says the Academy's Zhan Meiyun.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang said here on Sunday that he was quite confident about Hong
Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks when answering a question on Hong Kong's
employment after attending a function organized by the Social
Welfare Department here.
</P>
<P>
Noting the rise in unemployment rate in the last two quarters
from 2.5 to 2.9 percent, Tsang said that the unemployment rate is
likely to rise further. But, "we are all well prepared for this."
</P>
<P>
He said the Secretary for Education and Manpower has already
worked exceedingly hard to produce training, revamp re-training
and re-training scheme, and the labor department has helped people
find new employment.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said now it is a golden opportunity for Hong Kong
businessmen to go out and find new business opportunities which
still are found in Hong Kong and in the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
He said although Hong Kong is more fortunate than other parts
of the region, both in terms of a much less impact of
economic turmoil, as well as a much more satisfactory social
security system, which is in the report of International Labor
Organization, we must not be complacent in this.
</P>
<P>
"We must help as much as possible those who are looking for
employment in the coming months," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure with the vitality in our economy, with the
youthfulness in our economy, and also the work ethic of the
people, I'm quite confident the economy will turn around much
faster than our neighbors in this respect," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hunan Province Dredges Rivers to Prevent Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province,
the nation's major rice producer, is intensifying efforts to
dredge rivers and lakes in an attempt to reduce the possibility of
flooding.
</P>
<P>
The province's 5,300 rivers, with a total length of over 90,000
km., present real threats of flooding and make harnessing efforts
extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
However, abundant water resources do not represen the root of
the problem. Instead, experts attribute the vulnerability of
flooding to a number of reasons, including increased silting
resulting from man-made obstructions blocking river channels,
random reclamation and the construction of dams in the upper
reaches of rivers.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that the depth of riverbeds has decreased by as
much as two meters compared to the early 1950s, with some 150
million tons of silt accumulating on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Hunan launched a campaign to harness the mainstreams of its
rivers in 1994. The province has since dredged 440 kilometers of
river channels and removed 3,300 obstacles.

JOHANNESBURG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Three British-born
chimpanzees were imported by the former South African Defense
Force (SADF) as the seedbed of a project to reduce the fertility
of black women, The Sunday Independent newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Daniel Goosen, 47, a respected veterinarian and
pathologist, was the first managing director of Roodeplaats
Research Laboratories (RRL), an SADF front company. He headed the
biological program, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The chimps were a cover for developing an anti-fertility
vaccine," the paper quoted Goosen as saying this week.
</P>
<P>
The only surviving chimp, Daisy, now lives at Johannesburg
zoo.
</P>
<P>
He said the development of an anti-fertility vaccine was the
most important project of the early stages of South Africa's
secret biological warfare programs.
</P>
<P>
"I was told the growing black population, and of course
communism were the overwhelming threats to white South Africa.
The anti-fertility project was approved by the SADF at the
highest levels."
</P>
<P>
"We would have done important research on an inter-species
breeding program, transferring chimpanzee embryos to baboons. If
we had succeeded it would have been a scientific breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
"In transferring the embryo, the recipient baboon may reject
it and in the rejection process the immune system becomes
involved and immunology leads to vaccinology.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, had we produced it, could have been used
clandestinely on black people."
</P>
<P>
Goosen said he joined the project for patriotic reasons.
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were involved in a war for our survival. We
believed, at the time, this was legitimate. If we developed an
anti-fertility vaccine, we would have curbed the birth rate,
there would be less starving kids. We believed a new government
would also need it."
</P>
<P>
He said he regretted the wrong motivation led to the loss of
opportunities for research.
</P>
<P>
"What we wanted to do then has happened now. There is an
anti-fertility vaccine for cats, for example, and it's useful.
Inter-species embryo transfers are now a fact of life.
</P>
<P>
"We would have been ahead. But we were motivated by the belief
we could decide what was good for others. That was wrong."
</P>
<P>
Goosen has told his colleagues in the scientific world about
his involvement in the secret project that ultimately developed
products to poison anti-apartheid activists, induce heart attacks
and cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
Wouter Basson, head of the project, has been accused of using
the chemical and biological warfare project as a cover for
personal enrichment at an unprecedented cost of the South African
taxpayer. He appeared in court Friday in connection with the
fraud allegations.
</P>
<P>
General Niel Knobel, surgeon-general of the RRL, confirmed
that there was a program investigating fertility but denied it
was aimed at reducing fertility in black women.

<HEADLINE> Four Nigerian Parties Adopt Abacha as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Three more Nigerian political
parties Saturday adopted the head of the military government,
General Sani Abacha, as its sole candidate for the August 1
presidential election, following the example of the largest
party, the United Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP).
</P>
<P>
The Congress for National Consensus (CNC) adopted Abacha at
its national convention in Makurdi, Benue State, where a motion
to the effect was moved by its national secretary Mohammed Kola
Balogun and passed by a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party of Nigeria (DPN) and the National Center
Party of Nigeria (NCPN) did the same at their national
conventions in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, and Owerri, Imo
State, Respectively.
</P>
<P>
Both the DPN and CNC amended their constitutions Saturday to
accommodate the candidacy of General Abacha. For example, the DPN
amended the item that restricted candidacy to card-carrying
members only.
</P>
<P>
The UNCP, which saw overwhelming victories in all previous
elections under the military government's transition to civil
rule program, was the first of Nigeria's five registered
political parties to choose Abacha as its flag-bearer.
</P>
<P>
It approved Abacha's candidacy Thursday in Kaduna, at a
special national convention.
</P>
<P>
The fifth party, the Grassroots Democratic Movement (GDM), is
expected to adopt a candidate at its national convention Sunday
in Maiduguri, capital of Borno State.
</P>
<P>
GDM is the only party that has got two aspirants, Mohammed
Yusurf and Tunji Braithweaite.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the suggestion that GDM may also adopt Abacha's
candidacy, former police head Yusurf reportedly said before
leaving Lagos for Maiduguri Saturday that "I do not reckon that
they can be induced or coerced into taking steps damaging to the
nation state as a whole".
</P>
<P>
Though there will be debates at the convention, analysts,
however, believe that the possibility of GDM's choice of Abacha
is high.
</P>
<P>
Should General Abacha become the consensus presidential
candidate of all the five parties, which has been much talked
about hitherto, the next question arising will be whether there
is need for a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
It had been suggested by some quarter of the politicians that
in the above said case, there will be no need for the
presidential election, which will then be replaced by a national
referendum.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled presidential election in August was part of
General Sani Abacha transition to civil rule program announced in
1995, by which he promised to give power to an elected civilian
government in October this year.
</P>
<P>
He has been so far silent on the issue of whether he will run
or not.

<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Party and government leaders
along with people from all walks of life came to pay their last
respects today to Xin Fengxia, a renowned Chinese artist, at the
Babaoshan revolutionary cemetery here.
</P>
<P>
The well-known performer of Pingju, a local opera of north

Pingju masterpieces and became famous across China.
</P>
<P>
She was also politically active and was elected a member of the
Sixth, Seventh and Eighth National Committees of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Although she had been confined to a wheelchair since 1975
because of illness, her love of art and of the people never
dwindled and she continued to write, producing literary pieces
with over four million characters during her last years.

<HEADLINE> Iran Steel Exports Up 85 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran's steel exports increased 85
percent in the past Iranian calendar year (ending March 21, 1998)
over the previous year to reach 830,000 tonnes, the official news
agency IRNA reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Mines and Metals Eshaq Jahangiri said Saturday in
Ahwaz in the southwest province of Khuzestan that the increase
brought the share of steel in non-oil exports to 5.87 percent in
1997 from 3.26 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Iran's steel output was believed to be around 7 million tonnes
in 1997, and the minister said it would achieve an annual target
of 12 million tonnes within three years.
</P>
<P>
Iran's steel industry enjoyed a boom during the past eight
years, with the output rising to 6 million tonnes in 1996. The
government expects a output of 10.5 million tonnes in 1999
following huge investments in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rapid growth in steel industry, Iran's non-oil
exports dropped by 3.1 percent in 1997 to merely 3 billion
U.S. dollars. This fell far short of the target of 5.5 billion
dollars set for the second five-year development period from 1995
to 2000.

SHANGHAI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of Shanghai
residents have gained an appreciation of vegetarian diets in
recent years, according to He Yizhao, deputy director of the
Shanghai Hotel Association.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is currently home to more than 2.3 million elderly
residents aged 60 and over, or 18.2 percent of the municipality's
population. The said residents also account for the majority of
vegetarians in the city, according to He.
</P>
<P>
A recent medical survey indicates an increasing number of liver
problems resulting from the changing diets of Shanghainese.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has a population of over 13 million, but a mere
10 vegetarian restaurants.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Pledges Continuous Military Aid to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said Sunday that U.S. military aid to Cairo and
joint military exercises with Egypt will continue.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a 150-minute meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Cohen made the pledge at a press briefing with
Egyptian Minister of Defense and Military Production Field Marshal
Hussein Tantawi.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will continue to support Egypt's program to
modernize its military," he told reporters. "This year we are
going to provide Egypt 1.3 billion dollars in grants and our
troops are going to continue exercises and training together."
</P>
<P>
That program of U.S.-Egyptian military cooperation will include
15 adventure vehicles with Stinger missiles, two frigates and
torpedos, anti-ship missiles, and co-production of tank-recovery
vehicles, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say if the U.S. might increase military aid to
Egypt to make up for the proposed economic aid cut. He said his
detailed discussion with Tantawi later Sunday will take up this
and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has been receiving American military and economic aid
since 1979 when it signed peace with Israel. It recently asked the
American administration to reduce the annual 815 million dollar
economic aid it gets from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Washington's allocations in 1998 for Egypt totaled 2.1 billion
U.S. dollars, including some 800 million dollars in economic aid
and nearly 1.3 billion in military aid.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he and Mubarak had a very good meeting and discussed
how to improve bilateral relations and U.S. contributions to the
security of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt and the U.S. have strong strategic partnership in
their shared commitment to stability and peace in the region - "We
both agreed that progress toward a comprehensive Mideast peace
agreement is fundamental to maintaining stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Cohen reaffirmed the U.S. support to the Mideast peace-making,
saying that U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross will soon return to the
region for talks with the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here earlier Sunday. His visit coincided with
"Eagle Salute 98'," the annual Egyptian-American joint naval and
airborne drillings that are going on in the Red Sea, American
Embassy Press Attache Rick Roberts told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The two countries conducted military exercises each year since
1979 when Egypt signed a U.S.-brokered peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Cohen has visited Turkey and Jordan and will also travel to
Israel and Greece before he returns home on Tuesday.

TUNIS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Libya's Secretary (minister) for
Justice Affairs, Mohammed Belqassem Zewai met Saturday night with
a British delegation of representatives of victims of Lockerbie
incident.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan minister discussed proposals put forward by the
British delegation, headed by Dr Jim Swayer, spokesman for
families of the British victims of the Lockerbie incident, on
solving the crisis between Libya and the united states and
Britain, according to a report released by the Jamahiriya News
Agency (JANA) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London has been insisting on trying the two
Libyan suspects in bombing a Pan AM passenger plane over the
Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988, in courts of the States and
Britain. But Libya has been opposing the idea saying that its
nationals would not receive a fair trial in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Jamahiriya News Agency (JANA) said that during the meeting
the two sides discussed some ideas and proposals offered by Jim
Swayer and Professor Robert Black, another leader of the
delegation, on providing a fair trial in a neutral country for the
two Libyan suspects in the bombing which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the families of the British victims of the
Lockerbie incident had arrived in Tripoli on April 16 for talks
with Libyan officials on how to provide a fair trial in a neutral
country for the two Libyan suspects.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Troika Optimistic About Cambodian Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 19 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN troika, composed of the
foreign ministers of the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand, said
Sunday that they are optimistic about a "free, fair and credible
election" in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after talks between the three foreign
ministers and representatives from countries of the "friends of
Cambodia," Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said both the
troika and the "friends" welcomed the positive development in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the safe return of former Cambodian First Prime
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh to home from March 30 to April 3
and King Norodom Sihanouk's involvement.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the press conference, the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) troika said that they hoped "a
permanent ceasefire would soon be in force in Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
King Sihanouk made a proposal on March 30 on the ceasefire and
the arrangement by which forces loyal to Prince Ranariddh will
give back the area under their control and reintegrate themselves
into the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
On April 17, Prince Ranariddh issued a statement on
disassociating himself and his forces from the Khmere Rouge and
supporting his father's proposal.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN troika welcomed both the proposal and the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Foreign Minister especially mentioned the displaced
Cambodians sheltered in about 65 refugee camps in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said his government will soon embark technical discussions
on the refugees' return as part of the efforts to ensure that
every Cambodian could participate in the election, scheduled on
July 26.
</P>
<P>
The troika also discussed the urgent need for international
electoral assistance to Cambodia, including the sending of
observers.
</P>
<P>
"The ASEAN governments have expressed their readiness to send
observers," the troika statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "friends of Cambodia" also issued a communique,
welcoming the recent positive development in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The "friends" urged the Cambodian government to ensure that all
parties have the opportunity to freely participate.
</P>
<P>
They also called the government to ensure free access to the
media by all parties and to protect human rights of all
Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
The "friends" also welcomed the United Nations' decision to act
as coordinator of the international observation of the elections
in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Right after the press conference, the three foreign ministers
left Bangkok for Siam Reap, Cambodia, for a one-hour talks on the
country's situation with king Sihanouk.

<HEADLINE> Blair Aims to Inject Impetus into Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of his visit to
Israel and the Palestinian lands, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair expressed hope that his visit would inject new impetus into
the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an article carried by the Jerusalem Post Sunday, Blair urged
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) not to lose
patience or give up efforts in their pursuit of peace despite all
the difficulties facing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Blair is scheduled to arrive here from Saudi Arabia late Sunday
to hold talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before
traveling on to the Gaza Strip Monday for talks with PNA President
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, whose country now holds the rotating
presidency of the European Union (EU), had already met with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on advancing the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
In his article, Blair said "helping to achieve progress is a
key priority for our presidency." "Injecting a new impetus into
the process," he said, "will be central to my visit, and the focus
of my discussions in the region," including with Netanyahu and
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the British and EU policy on the peace
process "is based on our conviction that a lasting resolution
must protect Israel's security and provide a just exchange of
land for peace."
</P>
<P>
Blair hoped the visit would spark new momentum for the peace
process in the spirit of conciliation that culminated in the
recent Northern Ireland peace treaty, which aims to end the
deep-running conflict between Protestants and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
"My experience has taught me that the search for peace is
never easy and that there will be many disappointments along the
way. But we must all keep trying. The present peace process still
offers the best chance for a better future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that improving the economic situation in the
Palestinian areas will be a major boost to the peace process. He
said the EU, the leading aid provider to the PNA, promised to
expand the aid package in 1998 under the British presidency.
</P>
<P>
At the practical level, Blair is eager to clinch a long-pending
agreement with the PNA on launching a joint industrial zone at
Karni on the Gaza Strip's east edge and the projected Dahaniya's
airport at its southern end.
</P>
<P>
Noting the leading role played by the United States in
mediating the peace process, Blair said the EU would complement
the U.S. role rather than cut across it.
</P>
<P>
To help rebuild the destroyed trust between Israelis and the
Palestinians, Blair said he would follow up on the plans for an
EU-Palestinian Security Committee discussed during British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's visit to Gaza last month.
</P>
<P>
Blair's first stop in Israel will be at Yad Vashem, the
Holocaust Memorial, to lay a wreath. He will then talk with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and hold a joint news
conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Blair's itinerary is apparently aimed at soothing Israel's
anger with Cook, who kept Yad Vashem off his agenda and visited
instead a disputed Jewish construction site in east Jerusalem to
show British and EU displeasure with Israel's settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
An infuriated Netanyahu canceled his planned official dinner in
honor of Cook and even refused a handshake before the camera to
register his protest.
</P>
<P>
Israel is the third stop of Blair's Mideast tour, which
includes Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Palestinian self-rule
areas and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> 85 Percent of Tap Water Contaminated in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-five percent of the tap
water in Bangladesh's capital of Dhaka has been contaminated, an
English daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The samples, collected recently by the Dhaka Water Supply and
Sewerage Authority (DWSSA) from different city areas, have been
found contaminated with disease-causing coliform micro-organism,
The Daily Star quoted a DWSSA source as saying.
</P>
<P>
"In some areas (in Dhaka), the coliform count was found as high
as 130 per 100 milliliter of water, and the normal reading should
be absolutely zero," he said.
</P>
<P>
Only 15 percent of the samples were found to be containing zero
level coliform count, and coliform count indicates possible
presence of disease-causing micro-organism, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Of the daily water supply of 870 million liter by the DWSSA, 94
percent comes from its 227 deep tubewells while the rest flows
from the existing three surface water treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
Water contamination in distribution lines may be attributed to
leaks in the old pipes, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Cellphone Giant Invests in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- MTN, one of the major
cellular phone companies in South Africa, has launched Uganda's
second licensed telecommunications group with an investment of 30
million U.S. Dollars, local daily Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
This is MTN's second telecom licence in the area. Two weeks
ago it invested 15 million U.S. Dollars for a 26 percent stake in
Rwanda's telecom network.
</P>
<P>
MTN's Ross Macdonald, who drives the group's African
expansion, was quoted as saying that the group was also looking
at opportunities in Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Swaziland, Eritrea and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the licence conditions, MTN Uganda will have to
provide 89,000 phone connections over five years.
</P>
<P>
Macdonald said he was confident that the group will be
cash-flow positive after three years and offer an investment
return on share-holders' initial 60 million U.S. Dollars after
seven years.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has one of the lowest teledensities in Africa, with
phone wires reaching only 0.23 percent of the population. In
1970, the country had 100,000 telephone lines, but the turmoil of
the Idi Amin years reduced the figure to a mere 37,000.
</P>
<P>
"We see a potential market of 250,000 subscribers," said
Macdonald, adding that the company would be pushing wireless
technology as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
"In most of Africa, wireless technology makes a lot more
sense, as we have witnessed in rural South Africa, where
previously unserviced areas took to cellphones at a vast rate
when they were introduced," he said.
</P>
<P>
MTN will be relying heavily on its prepaid card system and
will establish its own outlets.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has won global investor appraisal for following
free-market economic policies which have seen average economic
growth rates of six percent this decade. This growth has
attracted other South African investors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, South African Breweries bought a 40 percent
stake in Uganda's Nile Breweries for 29 million U.S. Dollars,
while Stocks &AMP; Stocks invested an initial six million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola, through its bottler in South Africa, Sabco,
ploughed 35 million Dollars into two bottling facilities in the
country late last year.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Present Shopping List of Arms to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel is expected to present
United States Defense Secretary William Cohen a list of weapons it
intends to buy for the armed forces during his forthcoming visit,
the Jerusalem Post daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cohen will pay his first visit to Israel as defense minister on
Monday and hold talks on military cooperation with Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on Israel's long-term modernization plans
of the armed forces and high on the agenda will be Israel's demand
that the U.S. fund its acquisition of a third Arrow anti-ballistic
missile battery, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen promised in principle to meet the Israeli demand during
Mordechai's visit to Washington last month. Israel will be trying
to translate the U.S. commitment into action, according to the
daily.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow missile system is a joint project of Israel and the
U.S.. It has yet to be put into operation.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai is also expected to push for U.S. commitment to
widen bilateral strategic cooperation, including a continued U.S.
commitment to maintaining Israel's qualitative edge in weaponry,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the weaponry Israel has sought from the United States
is for the air force. The U.S. has recently approved the sale to
Israel of a Longbow upgrade for its fleet of Apache helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is currently on a regional tour, which has taken him to
Turkey, Jordan and Egypt. He will leave Israel for Greece on
Tuesday morning.

<HEADLINE> One Israeli Settler Killed in West Bank Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli settler was shot
dead and another wounded Sunday in a violent clash near the West
Bank city Hebron due to a land dispute, Israeli Army said.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Israeli Army Spokesman's Office said
a group of Palestinians ambushed several settlers in the hills
in Maom near Hebron. One of the Palestinians took over a gun
from the settlers and opened fire at them.
</P>
<P>
One settler was shot dead and another wounded in the shooting,
the statement added. The wounded was evacuated to hospital by a
military helicopter.
</P>
<P>
A large number of security forces were dispatched to the area
to conduct investigation into the incident and Army Central
Command head Uzi Dayan also visited the site.
</P>
<P>
The incident renewed the tension in the area near the
flashpoint town of Hebron. In the past month, widespread violent
clashes were sparked by a incident in which Israeli soldiers at a
checkpoint near Hebron shot dead three Palestinians on their way
home from working in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident also cast cloud on the visit Sunday here by
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is planning to create
favorable conditions for advancing the stalled Israeli-Palestinian
peace process by helping rebuild trust between Israelis and
Palestinians destroyed by repeated violence.

<HEADLINE> German Opposition Leader to Visit Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice president of the Social
Democratic Party (SDP) in the German parliament Gunger Verhugen is
to pay a two-day visit to Tehran Monday to repair bilateral
relations between Iran and Germany, the pro-government daily
newspaper Iran news reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Verhugen's visit is the first trip by the highest German
socialist official to Iran since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
It is considered as important particularly after the political
row between the two countries triggered by a Berlin court rule
which accused Iranian leaders of supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the high chances of winning the upcoming October
elections by the Socialists in Germany, the daily noted,
Verhugen's visit will be of great significance from the political
point of view and will have important impact on Tehran-Bonn
relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran News said that Verhugen would meet with Iranian parliament
members and other officials to discuss bilateral ties and the case
of the German citizen Helmut Hoffer who was sentenced to death in
Iran for having illegal sexual relations with an Iranian woman.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries cooled down since April
last year after the Berlin local court ruled that Iranian leaders
were behind the assassination of four Iranian Kurdish rebel
leaders in the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The rule provoked members of the European Union (EU) to
withdraw their ambassadors from Tehran, who returned last November
after the EU reached a deal with Iran over the Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the detente between the EU and Iran, the Bonn-Tehran
rapprochement was retarded by Hoffer's case and German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel warned that Bonn-Tehran ties would be
damaged if Iran carried out the death sentence on Hoffer.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Verhugen would try to convince the Iranian
government to release Hoffer, a German merchant, who was arrested
last September with his Iranian fiancee on charges of having
sexual relations with a Muslim woman. The Iranian laws ban
relations between a non-Muslim man and a Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
However, Hoffer claimed that he has converted to Islam before
having a case with the Iranian woman. Reports said that the
Iranian judiciary was reconsidering his case according to his
latest claim.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Mayor to Boycott State Dinner for Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert
will not attend the state dinner for British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, who will arrive here Sunday afternoon, The Jerusalem Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that Olmert conveyed this message to Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Saturday night, saying that he
took this action because Blair said he would not meet with Olmert
during his visit in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Olmert charged that this was " a deviation from protocol and
in sharp contrast with the pattern set by his predecessor, John
Major."
</P>
<P>
"The Foreign Ministry's efforts ended in failure and I am
astounded at this outcome, " Olmert said. The mayor accused the
government of "giving in."
</P>
<P>
But political sources said that the British leader's staff
indicated that a meeting with Olmert would necessitate a
concomitant session with the representative in Jerusalem of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Faisal Husseini.
</P>
<P>
This evidently promoted British and Israeli officials to
conclude that it would be best to leave the Jerusalem
municipality off the itinerary.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is a sensitive issue in
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which is due to be solved in
the final settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that Jerusalem is its indivisible capital,
while Palestinians wanted to establish an independent state with
the East Jerusalem as its future capital.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was snubbed last
month during his visit in Israel, due to his meeting with a
Palestinian Legislative Council member at a controversial Jewish
settlement in the East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Blair, also representing the European Union, began a five-day
trip to the Middle East on Friday. He will hold talks with
Netanyahu on Sunday and meet PNA President Yasser Arafat in
Gaza City Monday.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Russia Agree to Sign a Broader Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto have agreed to work
toward signing a wider treaty that will cover not only peace but
also friendship and cooperation into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
This came Sunday as a result of a two-day official summit
between the two leaders in Kawana, about 130 kilometers southwest
of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin proposed the idea of making the new treaty broader than
a peace treaty in his first round of talks with Hashimoto Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference Sunday, he said he had not changed
his stance since the 1993 Tokyo Declaration under which the two
countries agreed to conclude a peace treaty after solving the
territorial dispute based on the principle of "law and justice."
</P>
<P>
The status of the four Russian-held islands off Japan's
northernmost main island of Hokkaido has long prevented the two
countries from concluding a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin vowed to speed up efforts toward a peace treaty on the
Russian side.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he agreed with Yeltsin to soon hold a new round
of bilateral talks between vice foreign ministers on the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Turning to bilateral economic cooperation, Hashimoto said they
agreed that the two countries will jointly set up a company to
promote Japanese investment in Russia.
</P>
<P>
A team of officials from Japan's Foreign Ministry, Finance
Ministry and Ministry of International Trade and Industry
will visit Russia early May to discuss the issue, Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin arrived in Japan Saturday for his second informal
summit with Hashimoto following their previous unofficial talks
last November in Krasnoyarsk, eastern Siberia.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Arrives for Talks With Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen arrived here Sunday morning for talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on the third stop of his Mideast tour.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who flew in from Amman for a two-day official visit, is
expected to meet later with Egyptian Minister of Defense and
Military Production Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi to discuss
cooperation in the field of defense.
</P>
<P>
His talks with Mubarak Sunday morning are expected to focus on
bilateral relations, the Mideast peace process and other issues of
mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
Cohen has visited Turkey and Jordan and will also travel to
Israel and Greece before he returns home on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on
the eve of Cohen's visit here, American Ambassador to Egypt Dan
Kurtzer expressed his country's belief that its new peace
initiative is a "balanced proposal" that the Palestinians and
Israelis can work through.
</P>
<P>
Yet he declined to say whether the initiative would achieve the
wanted progress or not. Washington will send its Mideast Peace
Envoy Dennis Ross by the end of this week in a new bid to reach a
conciliatory approach by Palestinians and Israelis on the
U.S. proposals, he told reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has been receiving American military and economic aid
since 1979. But it has offered recently to the Clinton
administration to reduce the annual 815 million dollar economic
aid it gets from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Washington's allocations in 1998 for Egypt totaled 2.1 billion
U.S. dollars, including 800 million dollars in economic aid and 1.3
billion in military aid.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Headman Calls for Intensified Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian traditional leader has
urged the government to intensify the crop diversification
instead of distributing relief food, which he said makes people
lazy.
</P>
<P>
Headman Benson Shikubomba in Southern Province criticized in
Choma Saturday the food relief program, charging that the program
is making villagers lazy, the Zambia Daily Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Sunday quoted him as saying that the
government should give out agriculture inputs like fertilizer to
farmers other than distributing relief food because the trend is
killing hard work among villagers.
</P>
<P>
The government should ensure that only the needy benefits from
the program and not every villager, he said.
</P>
<P>
The headman made the appeal at a seeds distribution and
multiplication field day in Choma.
</P>
<P>
Southern Province agricultural coordinator Darius Hakayobe
urged the farmers to work hard to achieve household food
security.
</P>
<P>
Hakayobe said crop diversification is the only means to
achieving food security and avert hunger at household levels.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has granted 12 million Swedish Kroner (about 1.6
million US Dollars) to the multiplication and distribution of
improved seed project.
</P>
<P>
Project coordinator Harry Ngoma said the projects operating in
northern, northwestern, western and southern provinces have
already trained small-scale farmers as seed growers who will this
season produce seeds for their communities on sale.
</P>
<P>
Ngoma said the project is meant to develop a seed bank within
the locality of the farmers who can not be accessed by the
commercial sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to exercise
tight control over the scale and structure of external borrowing,
according to an official from the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange (SAFE).
</P>
<P>
The official from the foreign capital and debt management
department of the administration was quoted as saying by today's
Business Weekly of China Daily that SAFE's supervision over
financial institutions will be tightened and measures will be
taken to stem disguised foreign borrowing.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that SAFE encourages borrowers to take steps
to disperse risks relating to changes in exchange rates and
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In principle, the official said, foreign debt can only be used
to finance infrastructure, the high and new technology sectors and
equipment refurbishment by State enterprises, and to boost
companies' export capacity.
</P>
<P>
Foreign borrowing for use in real estate is restricted, and may
not be used to fund duplicate projects.
</P>
<P>
A number of State firms will be allowed to raise foreign funds
directly in overseas capital markets, with the aim of easing the
burden of foreign debt repayments on financial institutions and
expanding capital sources for enterprises.
</P>
<P>
SAFE has already given approval to several large State firms,
such as Baoshan Iron and Steel Corp, the China National
Aero-technology Import and Export Corp, China Technology Import
and Export Corp and China National Offshore Oil Corporation.

KUWAIT CITY, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti business community
leaders and government officials are to work out a coordinated
economic strategy for the Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Wahab Al-Wassan, a board member of the Kuwait Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, was quoted by English daily Arab Times
Sunday as saying that a conference entitled "The role of the
Private Sector in Correcting the Economic Course" will be held on
April 20 to 21.
</P>

He said at the meeting the government will be represented by
five ministers, six parliamentary members, the Chairman of
Parliament's Financial and Economic Committee, the Chairman of
Parliament's Legislative Committee and the Governor of the Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The business community will be represented by the Kuwait
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as well as a number of
independent specialists and experts.
</P>
<P>
Al-Wassan said the meeting will provide an opportunity for
Kuwait to address the incoherence surrounding its economic
strategy.
</P>

He said the meeting aims at helping the government in deciding
what strategies and plans to implement. Kuwait business community
believes that the Gulf state which depends mainly on oil for its
economy lacks a coherent economic strategy. Al-Wassan said "each
ministry has its own strategy, but there is no coordination."

The conference will be held at a time when Kuwait has adopted a
budget with the highest deficit since 1991, Kuwait's employment
policy is still under discussion and the implementation of a
privatization law has been pending for years.

Cambodian politician Sam Rainsy earlier required the elections
to be postponed till late this year, citing the unpreparedness in
legal institutions and instruments necessary for a free and fair
political contest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Surin, in apparent reference to Rainsy's remark, said all sides
consulted by the troika "leaned toward" the idea of holding the
elections on July 26 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
They also felt that the question of pardon for military
commanders loyal to ousted co-premier Norodom Ranariddh should not
become a "condition" that would obstruct this event, he added.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) appointed

<HEADLINE> Foreign-Invested Firms to Enjoy Better Arbitration Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-invested companies in
China will soon be able to receive arbitration service from the
China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission
(CIETAC), today's Business Weekly of China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The Weekly said that the revised CIETAC Arbitration Rules,
which expand CIETAC's arbitration scope to include disputes
between foreign-funded firms and legal and natural entities in
China, are expected to go into effect soon after the draft is
ratified by relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
CIETAC at present accepts foreign-related disputes but seldom
handles disputes involving foreign-invested firms and other
Chinese entities since foreign-funded firms are registered and
operate in China and therefore are considered legal entities of
China.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised rules, the period for the respondent to
submit his written defence and for CIETAC to make awards will be
shorter than those for foreign-related disputes. At present,
arbitration awards are made within nine months of the formation of
the panel of arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
The fees charged for arbitration of disputes between
foreign-invested firms and other legal or natural entities of
China will also be lower than those charged for arbitration of
foreign-related disputes, and will be decided in accordance with
relevant regulations relating to fees charged for arbitration of
domestic disputes.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Privatize T &AMP; T Board in Two Phases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
privatize its Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB) in
two phases under a plan, the Associated Press of Bangladesh (APB)
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The phase one of the restructuring plan will be a
corporatisation process of the state-owned BTTB, according to the
National Telecommunications Policy 1998, approved by the cabinet
late last month and expected to be placed in parliament shortly
for endorsement.
</P>
<P>
During the process, the BTTB will be made a limited entity,
called Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Ltd., instead of
being a government department.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, the government will continue to own 51-100
percent of its shares. However, the new company will have full
responsibility of managing assets and operations, and will also be
fully accountable for its own profitability.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, the BTTB will be fully privatized, with
the government selling out all its shares to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of engaging an internationally-reputed foreign
telephone firm as a strategic and managing partner of the BTTB
will also be explored, the policy anticipates.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has not set any timeframe for
completing the whole process, the reported noted, adding that the
policy had recommended opening up of all telecom services
including basic lines for the private sector by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
In order to make the BTTB function effectively and commercially
in competition with other private operators in a liberalized
environment, the requisite administrative and adequate financial
and commercial authority will be delegated to it.
</P>
<P>
The non-core function within the BTTB will be gradually
divested and could be contracted out to qualified private parties.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the corporate restructuring period, the BTTB, with
the government's approval, will be authorized to raise necessary
capital for the expansion of its existing and introduction of new
services.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government will also consider privatizing
two state-owned telecom equipment manufacturers.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The peace process in Tajikistan

"irreversible," said Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek in
Dushambe, capital of Tajikistan, Saturday.
</P>

Geremek said that it is an important stage to implement the
agreements on incorporating rebel forces into government power
agencies, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
He added "the peace precess was delayed for some time," but he
hoped the task could be finished by the middle of this year, so as
to create favorable conditions for parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Geremek said both Tajik President Emomali Sharipovich Rakhmonov
and he believed that the OSCE should do more within its power to
help the country achieve peace.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE is willing to help it reform its constitution,
election laws and carry out parliamentary elections, he added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Geremek held talks with Rakhmonov, Primer
Minister Yakhya Azimov, Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov and United
Tajik Opposition leader A. Nuri.

<HEADLINE> Russian Communist Leader Confirms Support for Kiriyenko </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A top leader of the Russian
Communist Party said Saturday that he believed his party would
suggest voting for President Boris Yeltsin's choice for premier at
the party's April 23 plenum.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznev, speaker of the State Duma (the lower house),
said in a televised interview that he would urge his follow
communists to support Sergei Kiriyenko as premier in the hope of
saving the Duma.
</P>
<P>
The Russian people "will not forgive us" if the Duma rejects
Kiriyenko a third time, causing Yeltsin to dissolve the
parliament, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has threatened to dissolve the Duma if it fails to
approve his nominee in the third voting, scheduled for April 24.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev believed the price was too high if the Duma was
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the Duma had the right to supervise the
government's work and raise a no-confidence bill.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev had called on his fellow communists to support
Kiriyenko during the Duma's second vote on his nomination last
week, but was widely ignored. He vowed to vote for Kiriyenko in
the third round.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian Constitution, Yeltsin is empowered to
dissolve the Duma if it rejects his premier nominee after three
votings.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Jobless Rate to Rise Sharply: ILO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) predicted that unemployment outlook in Thailand
is dimmer than the government estimation this year due to negative
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The number of layoffs would surpass the official projection of
under two million and the unemployment rate would reach 5.6
percent by the end of this year, the ILO said in its latest report
received here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the rise to the government's revision of
the economic growth target from zero to minus 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The entry of 500,000 new Thai job seekers this year would
worsen the unemployment situation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the job seekers, it said, comprise people who
have completed their lower secondary schools and beyond.
</P>
<P>
"This group is probably most at risk of failing to find work
and of adding to the number of recorded unemployed," the report
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the problem are Thai construction workers in
Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea whose jobs have become
uncertain as a result of the slowdown in the sector, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Out of 60,000 Thais working in Singapore, 85 percent are
construction workers, and out of the 110,000 in Malaysia, 20,000
are at construction sites, according to the ILO.
</P>
<P>
The report, which concentrates on situations in Thailand,
Indonesia and South Korea, would serve as a guideline for a
three-day international meeting between government officials,
employers and workers beginning in Bangkok next Wednesday.

JAKARTA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government had
only approved foreign investment projects worth 5.3 billion U.S.
dollars up till last week, and the total foreign investments in
1998 may decline by more than 44 percent compared with those of
last year, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"If this trend become a reality, the foreign investments which

than 20 billion dollars, while the normal figure in the last five
years was averaged at 30 billion dollars," Investment Minister
Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo said here Saturday, Antara News Agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the government approved foreign investments totaling
29.9 billion dollars, and in 1997, despite the monetary crisis
since mid-July, approved foreign investments still amounted to
33.8 billion dollars, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of this year, he said, the flow of
foreign investment into the country was still steady, but then
sharply declined in the third and fourth months.
</P>
<P>
Most foreigners invested in gas and electricity, housing and
industrial estates, agriculture, chemical and metal industries,
added the minister.

VIENNA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Incumbent President Thomas Klestil
looks certain to be re-elected in Sunday's election.
</P>

His four challengers are Gertraud Knoll, 39, a female
Protestant bishop, Heide Schmidt, 49, chairwoman of the small
Liberal Forum, Construction tycoon Richard Lugner, 65, and Karl
Walter Nowak, a publicist and environmentalist.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazil paid 1.487 billion
U.S. dollars for foreign debt servicing for the first quarter of
this year, the Central Bank of Brazil said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The figure means a 53 percent rise from the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bank ascribed the rise mainly to the growth in the
country's foreign debt and the international interest rate.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Foreign debt has reportedly surpassed 200 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Farmers Urged to Use Irrigation Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Tin Oo urged the
country's farmers to systematically use irrigation water for
successful cultivation of the four pillar crops -- paddy, beans
and pulses, cotton and sugarcane.
</P>
<P>
Tin Oo, second secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council (SPDC), made the remarks at inauguration
ceremony for a reservoir -- Saddan -- in Magway division Saturday,
attended by Than Shwe, SPDC chairman, The New Light of Myanmar
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tin Oo said the reservoir, which can irrigate over 4,050
hectares, would help develop the arid region and boost
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the greening projects are being extended to
13 districts from nine in arid regions in central Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
He urged the farmers to use irrigation water systematically.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 86 reservoirs and
dams have been built in Myanmar since 1988, irrigating 535,400
hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the mainstay of Myanmar's economy and paddy is
one of the country's four pillar crops. Its rice export, which
maintained an average annual figure of 463,750 tons in the last
four-year plan period (1992-93 to 1995-96), fetched 88 million
U.S. dollars annually, 40 percent of the country's foreign
exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
The country's paddy production in the 1996-97 season was 17.08
million tons with 93,000 tons of rice exported.

<HEADLINE> Infrastructure Funding Gap Requires Rapid Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A concrete fund-raising scheme
for China's massive infrastructure program is urgently needed to
give the economy real impetus, according to today's Business
Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The importance has been underlined by China's sluggish economic
indices for the first three months of 1998, which reflect weak
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials said early this year China would rely heavily
on new infrastructure projects to stimulate domestic demand in
pursuit of economic growth of eight percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Industrial enterprises are waiting impatiently for the
infrastructure building spree, which will help them cut stockpiles
and create opportunities for new production, the Weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Bureau reports that the retail price index
fell 1.5 percent on a year-on-year basis during the January-March
period, compared to a rise of 2.6 percent in the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Falling prices, rising promotional spending and unchanged
management costs have greatly squeezed industrial firms' profits,
which slumped more than 83 percent compared to the first quarter
of last year, an official source said. Added-value output of the
industrial sector grew 8.2 percent during the January-March
period, representing a fall of 2.8 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Economists say it is a common scenario in China for economic
growth to proceed slowly in the first three months but accelerate
in the remaining three quarters. Moreover, new economic policies
always need five or six months before their effects are felt.
</P>
<P>
However, without a clear financing scheme for the core part of
the new economic kick-start program, worries persist.
</P>
<P>
Fixed-asset investment in the central government budget fell in
1998, meaning funding for the infrastructure projects must come
from elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Soybean Exports Diminish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazil, second biggest
producer and exporter of soybeans in the world, registered a 2.3
percent reduction in its exports of the product in the first
quarter of this year against the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country exported 751,700 tons of soybeans in the first
quarter of this year against the 769,400 tons sold abroad in the
same period of 1997, according to data released Saturday by the
Brazilian Organization of Statistics of Soy Grain, Meal and Oil.
</P>
<P>
The export of soybean meal in the same period reached 1.145
million tons, a drop of 10.8 percent from the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country exported more than 103,000 tons of soybean oil in
the first quarter of this year, against the 145,200 tons in the
same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the export of soybeans and byproducts is attributed
by Brazilian observers to the reduction of the price in the
international market. Brazil had last year a total income of more
than 5.5 billion U.S. dollars from the export of soybeans and
byproducts.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan antidrug police Friday
seized at least 1,600 kilograms of cocaine on a beach on the
Pacific coast 100 kilometers south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Police caught four Colombians, one Guatemalan and one
Nicaraguan, who were allegedly involved in the case, newspapers
here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police also captured a Cigarreta-type speedboat, a Toyota land
cruiser pickup truck, and a large number of autoparts and arms,
including handguns, and M-16 and AK-47 rifles.
</P>
<P>
Mechanical failure of the speedboat since April 15 forced the
drug traffickers to unload the cocaine, packed in 73 bags, and
buried it in the beach near the Tola municipality in the Province
of Rivas, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities speculate that the cocaine was probably from
Colombia and bound for the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rivas police chief Ernesto Zamora said police would continue
investigating the possible transit routes of drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
In Penas Blancas of the Province of Rivas last February, police
confiscated a tank truck with more than 500 kilograms of cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Crudes Basket Price Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The price of the Venezuelan
basket of crudes and byproducts for export rose one U.S. dollar
between Wednesday and Friday this week, going up from 11.70
dollars to 12.70 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
According to data released Saturday by the Energy and Mines
Ministry, the figure on Friday meant a gain of 1.37 dollars from a
week ago, when the price was 11.33 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) basket
of crudes closed last Friday at 13.49 dollars per barrel, a gain
of 1.21 dollars over the past week.
</P>
<P>
The quotations of the different crudes sold in the
international market strengthened over the past days because of
the possibility that Iraq will export only 3 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil, instead of 5.2 billion dollars, under the Oil for
Food program brokered by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
This changed the outlook for the participants in the market,
because the Iraqi crude supply will not surpass 1.6 million
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela initiated between
independent oil producers and OPEC an agreement on the reduction
of oil supply in Riyadh March 21.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Opposes Sanctions Against Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian Foreign Minister Blagoj
Hanziaki opposed economic sanctions against Belgrade despite
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's promise that the
sanctions would not harm neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Winding up a brief visit to Macedonian capital Skopje on
Saturday, Talbott told a press conference there that any sanction
directed against Belgrade for its failure to meet international
demands should not harm its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States and other members of the six-nation
International Contact Group for Former Yugoslavia would work for
this goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Macedonian foreign minister insisted that
sanctions against Belgrade were "unacceptable to Macedonia and
other neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
Such measures would severely harm Macedonia's reforms and its
efforts to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and
the European integrity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the Kosovo crisis, Macedonia had
repeatedly voiced opposition to sanctions against Belgrade, noting
it would bring about harmful consequences.
</P>
<P>
The 1992-1995 Western sanctions against Belgrade had caused
great economic losses to Macedonia, Bulgaria and other neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Talbott also had talks with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
and Prime Minister Branko Cvenkovski during his several hours of
stay in Skopje.

<HEADLINE> Global Oil Price Falls Force Cuts in Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China's petroleum sector is
suffering serious oversupply and financial losses as a result of
falls of crude oil prices on the international market, today's
Business Weekly of China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Weekly, China National Petroleum Corporation
(CNPC), the largest oil producer in the country, has already told
its oilfields to cut output, reduce investment and enlarge sales
to reach a balance of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) has also decided to
process less crude oil and manufacture fewer oil products to
reduce losses, it said.
</P>
<P>
The average price for crude oil on the international market has
plunged from 22 US dollars per barrel last September to 13 US
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The average domestic crude oil price in China is around 15 US
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Cheaper crude oil and oil products from abroad therefore pose a
major threat to domestic oil producers and refineries.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Weekly pointed out, the Chinese Government
approved the importation of 1.8 million tons of oil products --
mainly diesel -- in the first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, rampant smuggling is bringing in more cheap oil
products from abroad.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a vast glut of diesel fuel has forced domestic
refineries to reduce or even halt production. Consequently, they
have been ordering less crude from the oilfields.
</P>
<P>
China's major oilfields have had to close wells because their
storage tanks were full. In the first quarter, the country's eight
leading oilfields shut 2,607 wells.
</P>
<P>
CNPC's oilfields reduced crude oil output by 590,000 tons in
the first three months.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Shut Down Nearly Half Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government has worked
out a plan to shut down nearly half of the nation's coal mines in
a restructuring effort to revive the ailing coal industry.
</P>
<P>
The government will shut down 12 loss-making mines this year
and close another 24 major loss-makers in the next three years,
reducing the number of coal mines from the current 65 to 32 or 36
by the year 2002, the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 24 major loss-makers suffered a loss of nearly 300 million
U.S. dollars last year, accounting for 60 percent of the year's
total loss of the debt-ridden industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the restructuring program, the government will lay off
120,000 workers, sell some mines to private businesses and relax
its control on coal prices. The government also plans to pump some
20 billion dollars of new investment into the industry to make it
profitable by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Berlusconi Elected Head of Forza Italia Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's media
tycoon and one-time prime minister, on Saturday formalized his
position as the head of the conservative Forza Italia party he
founded four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi was elected party president overwhelmingly by some
3,000 delegates attending a three-day national congress held in
Milan. He was the only candidate for the party presidency.
</P>
<P>
A rally by about 50,000 supporters through the streets of
downtown Milan capped the congress, the first ever by the party
since it was formed in 1993 after corruption scandals swept away
long-ruling Christian Democrats and Socialists.
</P>
<P>
Once hailed as a breath of fresh air to Italy's decades of
political sleaze until he was charged with corruption himself,
Berlusconi wanted to make Forza Italia the main opposition to the
center-left government of Premier Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
He told his supporters that their party might sweep 33 percent
of votes in the next elections.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi led the Freedom Alliance to victory in 1994
parliamentary elections. But squabbling within his coalition
ended his premiership later that year and has ever since
challenged his leadership of the alliance, which includes his own
party, the right-wing National Alliance, and tiny groupings of
ex-Christian Democrats.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Hosts Belgium came from match
down to draw visitors France to one-all in their Federation Cup
World Group One tie on Saturday in the Belgian city of Gent.
</P>
<P>
Sabine Appelmans was the first up for the hosts but could not
hold on to Sandrine Testud's speed and force, only to drop the
first of the opening singles 6-3, 6-2 in a little over one hour.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Monami van Roost almost followed suit in losing the
second of the day's match after she fought 50 minutes before
allowing Sarah Pitkowski to take the first set 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Van Roost, ranked 14th on the WTA tour, recollected her
confidence in front of a supporting home crowd and built up her
play via placement shots in the ensuing set which she took 6-4 in
43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The tie-breaking third turned out too much for fatigued
Pitkowski who was ranked 44th on the WTA tour and the Frenchwoman
could not find the deep lobs that she had used to move van Roost
from side to side along the baseline in previous sets.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian player took the set 6-2 and the match in 29 minutes
to put the hosts back on equal footing with the French side for
Sunday's reverse singles.
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Belgian-French tie will meet the winner of
the Czech-Swiss tie in mid July.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Jamaica's Prime Minister, P.J.
Patterson told the participants of the Second Summit of the
Americas opened here Saturday to help increase investment in
education in small and less developed nations of the Caribbean
region.
</P>
<P>
"Unless significant impetus is given to education now, in the
less developed economies, the Free Trade Area of the Americas
(FTAA) will result in entrenching the disparities which now exist
between the developed and under-developed states," Patterson said.
This would not achieve the FTAA's goal of a more prosperous, more
democratic, and more peaceful hemisphere, he added.
</P>
<P>
"From the perspective of the Caribbean and other small states,
the two issues of trade and education, in terms of the long-term
sustainability of our economies and the quality of the life of our
peoples, are inextricably linked," the Prime Minister emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The stronger economies are strong because of scale,
diversification, skills and significantly to an earlier and
sustained investment in education and training, he said. "Growth
and diversification of smaller economies will depend on the
ability of the people to benefit from knowledge-based industries,
and the use and export of intellectual capital, the application of
research to development, the creative use of the aesthetic
intelligences, as well as the application of science and
technology in ways, yet to be discovered," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican leader called for increased multilateral support
for education and hemispheric funding which is aimed to provide
assistance with setting of hemispheric standards, establishing
mechanisms of accreditation and equivalences and providing current
statistical data for governments and businesses within the
hemisphere.

to make the OAS a useful and efficient instrument to carry out the
new tasks, "we are thinking of the Organization of tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
"We have a vision of the Organization carrying out its
theatrical role in the creation of inter-American law and as a
trustee of treaties and agreements; as a prime forum of
hemispheric political dialogue; as a center for exchanging
experiences and of designing communal or collective policies; as
responsible for building and maintaining hemispheric information
systems; as a tool of continental solidarity through its
cooperative projects," the OAS chief noted.
</P>
<P>
Forty months ago in Miami, where the First Summit of the
Americas was held, leaders of the 34 countries in the west
hemisphere ended a decades of isolationism, confrontation, and
distrust, abandoning the hostile language and a certain atavistic
pessionism that characterized the political and economic manner of
speaking, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted, there will be still a long way to go to
make the institution "a useful and efficient instrument" to carry
out the new tasks ahead.

BONN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany has granted Albania about 37

Bonn believed that Albania would be able to implement the
necessary reforms and to realize its self-imposed stabilization
goals, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S., Jordan Partners for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said here Saturday that Jordan and the U.S. are
partners for peace and stability in the Mideast region and the
U.S. appreciates Jordan's role in helping solving regional issues.
</P>
<P>
"This visit is an opportunity for our countries to reaffirm
our shared goals for the future," said Cohen at a joint news
conference with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali
following his talks with King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-U.S. partnership is based on the pursuit of peace
among Israel and Arab countries, said Cohen, who arrived here
Saturday from Turkey on a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's current tour will also take him to Egypt, Israel and
Greece before he returns home on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We both agree that the key for stability in the Middle East is
a just and lasting peace agreement between Israel and its
neighbors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense secretary said the second important role of
the Jordanian-U.S. partnership is to contain Iraq from developing
into a regional power that will be a threat to the peace and
stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We also both agree it is important to prevent Iraq from
attacking its neighbors again and from continuing to work on its
program to build deadly chemical and biological weapons," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As a sign of its appreciation of Jordan's fidelity to the
partnership, the U.S. "worked very hard to provide Jordan with its
defense requirements," said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to be completely responsive to Jordan's
security needs ... and the cooperation between Jordan and the
U.S. is very strong and productive," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also indicated that the U.S. will grant the kingdom
aircraft in the future, and that a thorough evaluation of its
security needs will be conducted soon.
</P>
<P>
Majali on his part confirmed the partnership between Jordan and
the U.S., saying the long-stalled Middle East peace process can
not be resumed without Washington's basic and pivotal role in its
capacity as one of the key sponsors of the process.
</P>
<P>
The role of Jordanian-U.S. partnership in saving the peace
process, particularly in the field of military cooperation, is
"great," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Majali, the U.S. granted Jordan 75 million
U.S. dollars in military aid out of a 225-million-dollar overall
aid package to the kingdom in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration is to maintain its aid at the same
level as in 1997. From 1990 to 1997, the U.S. provided Jordan a
total of 1.552 billion dollars worth of economic and military aid.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's visit to Jordan had been scheduled for the last quarter
of 1997, but was postponed due to Iraq's standoff with the United
Nations over weapons inspection.
