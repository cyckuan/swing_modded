<HEADLINE> French Kinshasa Mission to Discuss Security of Expatriates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- France has sent a government
delegation to Kinshasa to discuss with the new authorities of the
newly established Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as
Zaire, the protection of French expatriates living there.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for French Foreign Ministry, Jacques Rummelhardt,
said today the delegation is headed by Jean-Pierre Lafon,
director of the Foreign Ministry in charge of affairs of French
nationals abroad and foreigners in France.
</P>
<P>
The decision to send the delegation was made by President
Jacques Chirac, after two French businessmen were assassinated
Tuesday evening in Kinshasa by gunmen wearing uniforms.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette had asked Lafon to
meet "as many as possible of our compatriots to show them all the
attention the French government pays to their situation," said
Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
Rummelhardt, for the first time, called the leader of the
Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL),
Laurent Kabila, "President Kabila".
</P>
<P>
The ADFL army captured the capital Kinshasa on May 17, ending a
seven-month war to topple the now exiled President Mobutu Sese
Seko.
</P>
<P>
Declaring himself head of state and changing the country's name
of Zaire, Kabila entered the capital Tuesday from his military
base in Lubumbasi, with the mission to form a "broad-based unity
government".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the French Defense Ministry said
today that the 300 French troops would remain in the Congolese
capital Brazzaville, but there was no plan now to evacuate the
French nationals living in the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The French troops stationed in Brazzaville, a city a stone's
throw from Kinshasa across the Congo River, are backed by two
Transall military transport planes and three transport helicopters.
</P>
<P>
France also has thousands of soldiers stationed in the
neighboring Central African Republic and Gabon, who can
immediately respond to calls for support.

Awahan couldn't say how much she had spent on her girl. By last
year, her family would have paid back all the debts except for
1,200 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Awahan's first husband died when Abigul was three years old,
and mother and daughter lived by themselves for three years. "At
first, I had no intention to remarry for fear that Abigul would
suffer," said Awahan.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, when a farmer from southern Xinjiang sent a neighbor
to propose, Awahan had only one request to her suitor: to be kind
to her girl. "I have no reason to complain after so many years,"
Awahan said of her second husband, smiling. "He is even gentler
with Abigul than I am, and of all the family, she loves him the
most."
</P>
<P>
And there is her 105-year-old mother, who has stayed with them
to help take care of Abigul for the past 15 years. Awahan said,
"each day, when my husband and I go to till the land, it is my
mother who keeps Abigul company, combing her hair, massaging her
legs, and telling her stories."
</P>
<P>
Awahan feels quite guilty each time she thinks of her mother's
stomach ailment. With the small amount of fine rice and flour all
given to Abigul, Granny had to eat dry "rang" (Uygur-style
pancakes) as other family members did. Her aging teeth was hardly
able to cope with the hard rang, the elder woman finally developed
a gastric disease.
</P>
<P>
The villagers have also rendered a helping hand over the
years. "People who pass along our house often come in to stay a
while with Abigul, and leave some money upon leaving. There are
also people who send us a sack of rice or flour now and then, and
Han women who make dresses for Abigul," said Awahan. "And for many
times, things are left at the door without my knowing who have
sent them."
</P>
<P>
To her relief, the family fares much better nowadays, with an
annual income between 2,000 to 3,000 yuan (240 to 360 US dollars)
and more in good harvest years.
</P>
<P>
"I have never regretted having Abigul all these years," she
emphasized, adding that the happiest day in her entire life was
the one a few years back, when her girl learned to say mommy and
daddy.

<HEADLINE> More PKK Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two rebels of the illegal
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed today in the operations
staged by the Turkish security forces in southeastern Turkey,
according to an official statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the office of the Emergency
Regional Rule said that the security forces attacked "Duap
Yaylasi" where a group of PKK militants sheltered themselves in
northwest of Bitlis province and also launched raids against
Akkay mountain in the same region.
</P>
<P>
The security forces also captured two young PKK members
during the operations, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, F-16 and F-4 jets and Super Cobra helicopters of
the Turkish Air Force are still conducting air raids on PKK
camps in Pirbela, Avagoze, Haftanin, Hakurk, Sivi, Sinat, Zap,
Zeli, Kani and Masi in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The cross-border military operation, which was launched on
May 14, has been focusing on destroying the camps of the PKK
guerrillas, who have reportedly spent the winter making
preparations to infiltrate into Turkey and attack military and
civilian targets in eastern and southeastern Turkey during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
At least 1,300 PKK rebels have been killed in the
continuing cross-border military campaign in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
More than 23,000 people, including PKK rebels, civilians and
government troops, have been killed in conflicts since August
1984 when the PKK started a separate war against the government in
the region.

<HEADLINE> Western German Business Confidence Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The outlook for business in Western
Germany surged in April despite a temporary drop in March, the
German Ifo economic research institute reported today.
</P>
<P>
The monthly Ifo Business Confidence index rose to 94.7 points
in April, the highest level in a year, from 92.6 in March.
</P>
<P>
The index is set with the 1991 level of business confidence at
100 and is regarded as a major indicator of business expectations
and corporate investment.
</P>
<P>
Business confidence in the five eastern German states, which
account for 10 percent of the whole nation's economy, dipped to
103.6 in April from 104.1 a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
This result corresponded with a survey published Thursday by
another independent economic research institute in Cologne which
reported on the economic outlook in Eastern German enterprises .
</P>
<P>
Rolf Kroker, an economist with the institute said the Eastern
German economy was still too dependent on the construction
industry which had been plagued by widespread speculation about
further job cuts.
</P>
<P>
The construction industry, thanks to lavish government
subsidies, employs about 17 percent of all workers in the eastern
half of the country.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Economic Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 22, (Xinhua) -- The South Korean economy grew by 5.4
percent in the first quarter of this year, marking a four-year low
for quarterly growth, the Bank of Korea said today.
</P>
<P>
The growth, down from the 7.8 percent a year earlier and the
7.2 percent of the previous quarter, is just above the level of
the second quarter in 1993, which stood at 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slow-down mainly resulted from sluggish private consumption
and declining investments in facilities and construction, Paeng
Dong-joon, a research economist of the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
However, Paeng said, the economy would meet its 1997 target of
5.5 to six percent GDP growth, as the country's exports were
showing signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
The 4.4 percent increase of private consumption in the first
three months of 1997 was two percentage points down from its 6.5
percent growth a year before.
</P>
<P>
Construction fell by 1.9 percent and fixed investments dropped
two percent in the same period compared with a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Receives Phone Call From Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Hosni Mubarak today
discussed over the telephone with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu the Mideast peace crisis, the Egyptian MENA news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak had sent a message to Netanyahu expressing sorrow over
the frozen peace process and emphasizing the importance of finding
a way out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier told Mubarak during the call that he agrees
with him on the necessity to present and exchange ideas for the
sake of propelling the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In a rare gesture to solicit Egypt's mediating role, Netanyahu
urged Mubarak to continue his "positive political peace efforts"
in a message he entrusted with Egyptian Ambassador to Israel
Mohamed Bassyouni Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel reportedly has received reports from European sources on
Egypt's intention to forward a new political initiative to realize
a breakthrough on the Palestinian and Syrian peace tracks.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian President is expected to visit Jordan and meet
with Israeli President Ezer Weizman in the coming days, in his
intensified efforts to break two months of stalemate in the
Mideast peace process that started with the Israeli construction
of a new Jewish settlement in Arab Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The information came as Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat wound up his two-day visist here, lamenting that the
Mideast is heading for "the abyss" if Netanyahu's policies were
not blocked.
</P>
<P>
In stepped-up Egyptian endeavors to kick start the talks,
Mubarak also urged Israel to give up its settlement policy and
come back to the right track in telephone conversations with
Weizaman Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cable News Network, the Mubarak-Weizman summit
will take place here in the coming two days. Israel Radio quoted
Director General of Weizman's office Arieh Shomar as saying that a
date is yet to be set through further contacts.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said his prospective visit to Egypt in the coming few
days would be a new attempt to defrost the Mideast peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
"I want to benefit from my personal relationship with Mubarak
that started nearly 20 years ago in putting the peace talks back
on the move," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, after a meeting with Arafat this morning, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that he has no idea of
such an immediate summit between the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
"Any advancement in the peace process should begin with the
settlement issue," Moussa stressed, adding that the Palestinians
can make no move unless the issue is resolved first.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today that
Mubarak will pay a few-hour visit to Jordanian city of Aqaba on
Saturday for a meeting with King Hussein on the latest development
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The president had exchanged views on the phone Wednesday with
the Jordanian monarch on the Middle East peace process, the
situation in East Jerusalem and the ideas that emerged during the
meetings here with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israel refuses to budge on its settlement building in Jerusalem
which it wants to have as future capital while the Palestinians
insist on stopping the project before resuming the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has recently proposed a six-month freeze on the
construction of settlements until negotiations open on the future
of Jerusalem, an idea designed to "set a moratorium on the
building in order to pave the way for meaningful negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been deeply involved in the Mideast peace process
since it signed a peace deal with Israel in 1979.

<P>
On the general situation in Africa, Salim said there is no
doubt that Africa is moving on the right path.
</P>
<P>
He listed the facts that the seven years civil war in Liberia
has been brought to an end and is to have democratic elections on
July 19, 1997. In Sierra Leone, despite the recent setbacks
relating to the implementation of the Abidjan accord, the process
itself is basically on course. There are some encouraging signs
even in the complex conflcits in Burundi and Somalia. Most of
African countries are seriously involved in political, economic
and social reforms aimed at releasing the energies of their
peoples and harnessing them towards socio-economic development
and progress. Positive results are gradually being witnessed in
many African countries.
</P>
<P>
In the process of consolidating achievements so far gained,
Africa should stand united with a common vision and sense of
purpose to build a continent capable of providing the basic needs
of its peoples in a sustained manner, he added.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Launches Job Plan for Eastern Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl launched
today in Berlin a pact aimed at creating 100,000 additional jobs a
year in eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting unveiling the Joint Initiative for More Jobs in
Eastern Germany, Kohl called the plan "a good and important signal
for the buildup of the East and a good sign for Germany as a
industrial base."
</P>
<P>
Defying widespread doubts from the business community, Kohl
said he was still sticking to the goal to cut unemployment in
eastern Germany by half by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact unveiled today, the German government, employers
and trade unions agreed to make common efforts to boost the
eastern German economy, and in particular to secure current jobs
and create more new jobs in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Priority goals set by the pact include stabilization of eastern
Germany's employment in 1997 at least at the level of 1996, which
was about 6.4 million, and creation of 100,000 new jobs annually
in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Employers and trade unions agreed to seek common solutions to
boost productivity in eastern Germany and to reform the current
pay system there to bring more flexibilities.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders agreed under the pact to maintain capital
investment in eastern Germany's processing sectors at a level
which will enable above-average growth. They also promised to
increase purchases from the five eastern states by 50 percent by
the year 2000 from the level of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The trade sector set a goal to double their orders from eastern
Germany up to the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government also said it would continue its financial
support to the East at high levels in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The pact to create jobs in eastern Germany came against a
backdrop of over 1.3 million jobless, or a rate of 17.5 percent in
April, much higher than that in the western half of the country,
which was 9.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Mubarak To Meet Weizman, King Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Hosni Mubarak is expected to
meet with Israeli President Ezer Weizman and to visit Jordan to
meet with Jordan King Hussein in the coming days, in his
intensified efforts to break two months of stalemate in the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The information came as Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat wound up his two-day visist here today,
lamenting that the Mideast is heading for "the abyss" if Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's policies are not blocked.
</P>
<P>
In stepped-up Egyptian endeavors to kick-start the talks between
Palestinians and Israel, Mubarak urged Israel to give up its
settlement policy and come back to the right track in telephone
conversations with Weizman Wednesday night and Netanyahu today.
</P>
<P>
In a rare gesture to solicit Egypt's mediating role, Netanyahu
urged Mubarak to continue his "positive political peace efforts"
in a message he entrusted with Egyptian Ambassador to Israel
Mohamed Bassyouni Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel reportedly has received reports from European sources on
Egypt's intention to forward a new political initiative to realize
a breakthrough on the Palestinian-Syrian peace tracks.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cable News Network (CNN) of the United States,
the Mubarak-Weizman summit will take place here in the coming two
days, while Israel Radio quoted Director General of Weizman's
office Arieh Shomar as saying that the date is yet to be set
through further contacts.
</P>
<P>
However, after a meeting with Arafat this morning, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that Egypt has no idea
of such an immediate summit between the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today that
Mubarak will pay a few-hour visit to Jordanian city of Aqaba on
Saturday for a meeting with King Hussein on the latest development
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The president had exchanged views on the phone Wednesday with
the Jordanian King on the Middle East peace process, the situation
in East Jerusalem and the ideas that emerged during the meetings
here with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israel refuses to budge on its settlement building in Jerusalem
which it wants to have as future capital while the Palestinians
insist on stopping the project before resuming the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has recently proposed a six-month freeze on the
construction of settlements until negotiations open on the future
of Jerusalem, an idea designed to "set a moratorium on the
building in order to pave the way for meaningful negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been deeply involved in the Mideast peace process
since it signed a peace deal with Israel in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Undecided on Ivory Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has not made a decision yet
on what position it will adopt with regard to the proposal by its
neighbours to have the ban on the ivory trade lifted at the
DPA284PAB167I22TEQL00:3000:312792
forthcoming Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
Zambian president Frederick Chiluba interviewed by the
Zimbabwe News Agency ZIANA in Harare today said his country was
having a problem which had to be reconciled before a firm stand
could be taken.
</P>
<P>
"For now we still have to think and think a little harder in
terms of what we earlier decided," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was in Harare for the 1997 southern Africa economic
summit which brought together political and business leaders to
discuss ways of attracting investment to the region.
</P>
<P>
Zambia announced last week that it would not support the lobby
to have the elephant down-listed from appendix one to appendix
two.
</P>
<P>
The down-listing would enable the countries to trade in ivory
as controls are less stricter than on appendix one.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, with an elephant population of at least 22,000 said it
feared resumption of ivory trade would result in senseless slaughter
of the animals.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique and Namibia want the elephant
down-listed to enable trade which they argue would benefit rural
populations whose lives and crops are constantly under danger
from the elephants.
</P>
<P>
The 134-member CITES meets in Harare next month where the
issue of the elephants is expected to dominate deliberations.

<HEADLINE> Zaire-Congo Border Remains Closed Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The river border between the
Democratic Republic of Congo (Zaire) with neighboring Congo
remained closed today despite the restoration of order in
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa, the former capital of Zaire "liberated" by the
Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberaiton of Congo-Zaire
(ADFL) on May 17, is separated from Brazzaville, capital of Congo
only by a narrow strip of water of the Congo river.
</P>
<P>
ADFL leader Laurent Kabila declared himself president of the
Democratic Republic of Congo on the same day when he toppled the
government of exiled Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Earlier yesterday, president Kabila's officers said the ports
on their side of the river would be opened this morning. But
passengers could not get through on their way to cross the river
back to the capital of Congo.
</P>
<P>
"Come back tomorrow to see if it is open," said an officer.
</P>
<P>
Though most passengers don't believe what they are told, they
will try their luck tomorrow because presently there is no other
quick way of getting out of the central African country despite
the cooling down of the "hot spot" torn by seven months of civil
war.

<HEADLINE> Cyclone-hit Areas in Bangladesh Back to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The post-cyclonic situation in
cyclone-hit coastal areas of Bangladesh is gradually improving as
massive relief and rehabilitation work has been geared up in the
ravaged areas, a government press release said here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official death toll rose to 105 in the
devastating cyclonic storm, which struck the coastal belt of
Bangladesh Monday, tearing and twisting everything that came in
its way.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications between the biggest port city Chittagong
and other damaged coastal districts have been restored, and power
supply in most areas has been restored, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
Cargo handling and other activities at Chittagong Port resumed
 Tuesday noon. Meanwhile, the road, rail and sea communications
between Chittagong and the rest of the country and other offshore
islands have already been restored.
</P>
<P>
Adequate relief goods with medical facilities have reached the
affected people and more relief materials have been despatched to
remote areas by different agencies through naval ships and
helicopters today, the press release added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad informed the
heads of diplomatic missions here of the steps taken by the
government to meet the natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the government is capable of
meeting the immediate requirements for post-cyclone relief. He,
however, said the government would accept any contributions made
to the efforts by friendly countries voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Azad also provided a list of materials that the Bangladeshi
side would accept voluntarily such as tents, sheets and high
protein biscuits in the short term and the construction of more
cyclone shelters, embankments and roads in the long term.

<HEADLINE> Political Bargain Hot on Making of New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Heated behind-the-door political
bargain continued today in Kinshasa, capital of the new-born
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
President Laurent Kabila, who had failed to announce his new
cabinet on Wednesday as scheduled, continued to meet chief
political figures in the country today.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said the cabinet posts to be occupied by
Kabila's ruling Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation
of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) have already been decided.
</P>
<P>
"The problem now is with the former opposition parties," said
a foreign diplomat in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Especially with Etienne Tshisekedi, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Tshisekedi has been aligned himself closely to Kabila's ADFL
when the ADFL troops were waging war against the Mobutu
administration, calling on Mobutu's soldiers to lay down their
weapons and allow rebels to enter Kinshasa peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Twice prime minister, many times political detainee, and most
of the time radical opposition leader during the Mobutu Sese
Seko's 32 years of rule, Tshisekedi now demands to serve as prime
minister for the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Some unsourced reports carried by local newspapers are even
saying that six cabinet posts have been offered to Tshisekedi's
opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
One can never rely on these reports because these newspapers
are controlled by various political organizations, said a
political observer in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
But one thing is for sure, that Kabila and his ADFL team are
busy in negotiating with politicians while his new government is
still on the making.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's spokesman repeatedly stressed that a "broad-based,
democratic, collective leadership" will be formed to spearhead
new Congo's national reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The ADFL leader announced himself to be president of the
Democratic of Congo on May 17, the same day his troops captured
capital Kinshasa on May 17. Since he came to the capital on
Tuesday, Kabila has been keeping a low profile, being restricted
to only closed-door talks and meetings.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Countries Urge Cancelling Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries have
again appealed to the international commmunity to consider
cancelling debts inherited from former colonial governments as
its contribution to the region's economic reform process.
</P>
<P>
Delegates attending the on-going southern Africa economic
summit in Harare said huge debts inherited from former rulers and
a historical dependence on foreign aid continued to push most
countries deeper into a debt trap as the debt servicing becomes
unbearable.
</P>
<P>
South African finance minister Trevor Manuel, who is also
responbile for finance and investments in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) today said it was important for
countries like Malawi and Mozambique, which are reeling under the
weight of the debts, to be afforded the first priority for debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the region had made substantial changes which were
not necessarily viewed as such by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"We are a region whose history has been shaped by colonialism,
particularly patterns of decolonisation and the threat of
recolonialisation," Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
"The process of decolonialisation has, in the main, left our
economies dependent on exogenous factors such as raw materials
and sunshine which the SADC members are working assiduously to
address," Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa owes the major creditors, among them the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), over 200
billion U.S. dollars in foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The delegates pointed out the debt problem had over the past
few decades threatened to overshadow some of the major
achievements by the continent with most countries complaining of
the impact of high debt servicing on the fiscus.

<HEADLINE> UK Board of Trade President Visits Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Board of Trade President
Margaret Beckett is to visit Japan next week (26-28 May) in her
first official visit overseas since taking up her post.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in Japan, she will have meetings with ministers
from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the
Ministry of Finance, and Toyoda, chairman of the Keidanren and of
Toyota.
</P>
<P>
She will also address senior representatives of the major
Japanese investors in Britain and senior figures from the Japanese
financial sector at a British Invisibles seminar, and the British
Chamber of Commerce in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Announcing her forthcoming visit, Beckett said today, "The
economic relationship between the UK and Japan is vitally
important. A key element of my visit will be to brief Japan's
leading investors in the UK on the new government's continuing
strong support for them."
</P>
<P>
Japan is Britain's largest export market outside America and
Europe. In 1996 Britain's exports to Japan reached 4.3 billion
pounds (6.88 billion US dollars), an increase of over 13 percent
on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Britain's big companies like ICI, Glaxo and BP are doing
successful business out there, and the government also encourages
more small and medium-sized companies to fully realize the
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Action Japan, the UK's business initiative, is driving this
forward with practical assistance to industry in partnership with
the government.
</P>
<P>
It is a government/industry partnership focusing on 13 priority
sectors to promote British exports to Japan to 5 billion pounds (8
billion US dollars) by the end of 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
Britain currently secures over 40 percent of Japanese
investment into the European Union, with all 10 of the major
Japanese electronics firms located in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Japanese manufacturing firms in Britain now account for over
65,000 direct jobs and a total of 20 billion pound (32 billion US
dollar) investments.
</P>
<P>
Beckett expressed a genuine sense of optimism by saying, "The
UK and Japan can continue building on the good relationships that
have been established."

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Hopes Egypt to Make Contribution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu telephoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak this
afternoon, saying Israel would like Egypt to make "a genuine
contribution" toward advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Television report, the two leaders are
expected to talk again later this evening to discuss the current
deadlock in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon's phone conversation followed a meeting earlier
today between Netanyahu and Mohammed Bassiouny, Egyptian
Ambassador to Israel, who brought a message of concern to the
Israeli premier from Mubarak over the stalemate in the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
This development came after Mubarak, in a call to Israeli
President Ezer Weizman Wednesday night, suggested that they meet
in person so as to try to find a new formula to renew the talks.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's Director-General Arye Shumer told Israel Radio today
that the meeting will probably be held in Egypt. He added that
details of the planned meeting have not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Weizman informed Netanyahu of the
telephone-conversation, and Netanyahu later called Bassiouny to
send him a message for Mubarak, calling on Egypt to show positive
interventions in the diplomatic moves.
</P>
<P>
The invitation to Weizman has reportedly triggered criticism
in Jerusalem that Mubarak is "trying to make Netanyahu appear
the obstacle to the resumption of peace talks."
</P>
<P>
However, this allegation was dismissed by Weizman, who told
Israel Television today that he believes that "if anyone who can
contribute to the peace process, he should do."
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that Mubarak has asked him to use his influence to
help break the ice on both the Israeli-Palestinian and
Israeli-Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
Reports here revealed that European Union sources have told
Israel that Egypt is preparing a new initiative for peace talks
between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as between Israel and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that U.S. special Middle East
Coordinator Dennis Ross will attempt to bring together all the
different peace initiatives during his next visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
Ross is also expected to make a public call on both Israel and
DPA294NAB054I22TEQL01:1401:152205
the Palestinians to renew their peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the two sides stalled in March after
Israel started to build a controversial new Jewish neighborhood
at Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim) in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have said that Israel must stop the construction
before talks can resume, while Israel insisted that the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) crack down on terror and
reestablish full security cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Wednesday that the
peace process is in "serious crisis" and all sides must make an
effort to resolve the impasse.

<P>
HARARE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa should take
measures to ensure it was not left out of globalisation of the
world economy, a leading German businessman told delegates
attending the ongoing southern Africa economic summit in Harare
today.
</P>
<P>
Germany based Daimler-Benz vice-president Matthias Kleinnert
said the region had potential for job creation due to its stable
political environment and growing economies.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Excellent potential is here since countries have
already sown the seed of democracy and a market-oriented economy,
and to keep these developments dynamic the region must develop a
strategy that quickly integrates into the global market."
</P>
<P>
Such a strategy, he said, would include continued
liberalisation of the new market economies and regional
integration which was the pre-condition for globalisation.
</P>
<P>
He cited Germany's integration into the European Union and
into the global market, saying at present, 50 percent of all its
exports were sent to neighbouring countries.
</P>
<P>
"It was this brisk trade with its neighbours that formed the
economic basis Germany needed before it could look farther
afield, and i think the same will hold true for southern Africa,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> OECD Praises Irish Economic Performance Since 1994 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) has praised the economic
performance of Ireland over the past three years, attributing the
success to its macro-economic management, a strong productivity by
the country's work force, and a flexible salary policy.
</P>
<P>
In its annual study on the economic situation of Ireland
published Wednesday, the OECD said, "The strong expansion of the
Irish economy during the past three years has boosted the real
level of activity by almost one-fourth, more than three times the
average increase in the rest of Europe."
</P>
<P>
It said that the growth rate in Ireland since 1994 is close to
those of New Zealand and South Korea, the two most well performing
members of the OECD, and is far greater than Europe and North
America.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's gross national product increased by 22 percent over
the past three years, while the country's unemployment rate
dropped from 15.1 percent in 1993 to 11.9 percent in 1996, it
said.
</P>
<P>
"Macroeconomic management has played an important role in this
performance by enabling Ireland to remain relatively immune to the
recessionary forces evident in much of Europe," it said.
</P>
<P>
The OECD said that the devaluation of the Irish pound in 1993
has allowed the country not to maintain excessively high interest
rates to protect the exchange rate of the Irish currency, and
thereby established confidence of the monetary market in the
stability of the currency.

<HEADLINE> Trans-Indian Ocean Airline Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Plans by two Mauritians to set up a
regional airline project, African Islands Airways (AIA), to link
southern Africa and the Indian ocean with emerging nations of
Asia and southeast aAia are at an advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
Project director Nimesh Mehta today said at the 1997 southern
Africa economic summit that the project which had taken two years
of preparations would offer scheduled region passenger, cargo,
courier services and promote regional tourism.
</P>
<P>
Proposed destinations in the Indian ocean would include the
Comoros, Madagascar and Seychelles while in east and southern
Africa it would cover Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania,
Uganda and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It follows that the project will need strong support
from the governments of the respective countries which we aim to
service. Essentially this support will be in the form of granting
landing rights to AIA and in extending to us other airport
facilities which we will inevitably need."

<P>
It said that the current upswing of the Irish economy, which
also benefited from a "very favorable supply-side response,"
includes the growth in labor supply, continued inflow of foreign
investment and an extended period of social consensus.
</P>
<P>
"A rapid increase in the size and quality of the labor supply
has been the key, helped by the large number of young people with
relatively high qualifications entering the labor force," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It said that almost half of high school graduates of Ireland
continue their study in colleges, "which produces, proportionally,
the highest number of scientists and engineers in the OECD area."
</P>
<P>
The participation by the female labor force in the country has
increased "in line with the rising educational qualifications of
women and the decline in the birth rate," and emigration to the
United Kingdom has ceased, both reflecting increased job
opportunities in the Irish labor market, it said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment by multinational enterprises has also
greatly contributed to the upswing of the Irish economy, with
production in modern sectors of the Irish economy, such as
computer, chemical and soft drink enterprises, having increased by
two-thirds over the past three years, said the OECD.
</P>
<P>
It said that these positive factors are "reinforced by a high
degree of social consensus, which is reflected in the income
policy agreements" signed by social partners and the government
over the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
These agreements, which covered policies on wages, taxation and
government spending, are now added by a new agreement called
"Partnership 2000" which is intended to consolidate wage
moderation in exchange for tax cuts and public spending increases
from now until 2000, and allow more flexibility in the
determination of salaries by enterprises at the local level.

<P>
HARARE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Southern African states should
focus on improving regional infrastructure to increase efficiency
and trade, Zambian finance and economic development minister
Ronald Penza said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on integration and reform in the free market during
the ongoing southern African economic summit, Penza said,
"Improved regional infrastructure would contribute to increased
efficiency and lower costs and should be a focus of regional
development."
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia was in the process of deciding on its overall
strategy for trade liberalisation against the merits of regional
versus multilateral liberalisation.
</P>
<P>
He said, "if general duty rates can be reduced while regional
integration proceeds, the problems that arise from regional
integration can be minimised."
</P>
<P>
Zambia considers that a productive approach will be to work
within SADC (Southern Africa Development Community) in concert
with other members to convince South Africa to lower its duties
on imports on trade with SADC members, he said.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Congo to Organize Govt on Non-Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Democratic Republic of Congo
president Laurent Kabila has so far refused to admit any
candidates proposed by the country's political parties to his new
cabinet, his aide said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The government of the Democratic Congo will be formed on the
non-party basis," said the presidential aide who declined to be
named.
</P>
<P>
"There are thousands of political parties and organizations in
this country. How can you have so many ministers in the
government?" asked the official.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who declared himself to be president of Democratic
Congo on May 17 as his troops captured capital Kinshasa to topple
exiled Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko, is calling on various
political leaders to apply for joining his government "as persons
instead of party candidates."
</P>
<P>
"We are advocating democracy. We will organize a broad-based
national salvation government. But we have to abolish the
westernized multi-party system created by Mobutu, which has
provided nothing but a disaster to our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are still going on today between Kabila's team
and representatives of the political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are working hard to strike a deal," said his aide.
</P>
<P>
The new government will be formed "very soon", he added.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the new cabinet will mark a new chapter for
the Democratic Congo, Africa's third largest country which has
this week ended its seven-month civil war with Kabila's absolute
military victory and Mobutu's disastrous fate of fleeing in
exile.

<P>
Johannesburg, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Swazi goverment has
suspended operations of the Swaziland Federation of Trade
Unions,report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's Minister for Enterprise and Employment Absolom
Dlamini said today the labour federation and its 17 affiliated
unions have been suspended from operating because they were late
to submit their financial statement.
</P>
<P>
He told the press in Mbabane that the deadline to hand over
the statement was the 30th of last month.
</P>
<P>
The union's secretary General, Jabulani Nxumalo, said the
government's decision effectively bans his organisation and its
affiliates, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
He said the union has retaliated by boycotting the on-going
labour and constitution negotiations with the government.
</P>
<P>
The Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions, with 83,000 members,
has been at the forefront of a campaign for political and labour
reforms in the tiny kingdom.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Military Complains Defense Budget Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Minister Joe Modise today expressed concern over defense budget
cut, saying the national armed forces would have to give up idea
of fulfilling its regional responsibilities if they did not get
enough funds.
</P>
<P>
Addressing parliament, Modise complained that the continuing
reductions in military budget were seriouly affecting South
African military capacity to fight against crimes and maintain
regional stability.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the 59 percent cut in the defence budget
since 1989 was creating great difficulties to the military in
South Africa, and the Defense Department was unable to sustain an
adequate defense program.
</P>
<P>
"Our police support and regional roles will be adversely
affected...Important projects, like the Rooivalk, may fall
through," Modise said.
</P>
<P>
Rooivalk is South Africa's latest-designed and developed gunship.
</P>
<P>
Modise's deputy Ronnie Kasils also told parliament today that
although the Ministry of Defense would not ask for a single Rand
more than was needed, it insisted there was an essential minimum
that had to be spent on defense.
</P>
<P>
Rand is name of South African currency.
</P>
<P>
"Because if we spend less than the minimum required, we may find
that we have no houses, no schools, no hospitals because we could
not defend our country against the worlords, thieves, pirates, and
predators," Kasils said.

<HEADLINE> EU Cancels Dumping Dues on Egypt's Cloth Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today decided
not to impose dumping dues any longer on Egyptian exports of cloth
DPA305PAB196I22TEQL02:2602:261205
to the European Union and to pay back those duties already charged
from several Egyptian exporters and companies in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Egyptian Trade Representation Ahmad Khaled
Hamdi told the Egyptian MENA news agency today that the dues to be
thereby drawn back from the European Commission amount to 28
million Egyptian pounds (8.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The charges had been levied, temporarily, on Egypt's exports of
material and textiles worth 211 million pounds (62 million dollars)
last year, according to statistics of the Spinning Support Fund.
</P>

The penalties took place despite the fact that the volume of
cotton products exports of Egypt to European Union slumped by 45.6
percent from 386 million pounds (113.6 million dollars) in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, African Asians in UK Enjoy Higher Living </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic minorities in Britain have
mixed experiences, with African Asians and Chinese doing as well
as white people, and Pakistanis and Bangladeshis living in serious
poverty, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
The study, based on detailed interviews with more than 5,000
people of Caribbean, South Asian and Chinese origin and nearly
3,000 white people, found that Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are the
poorest group in the UK, with more than 80 percent living in
households with income below half the national average, four times
the number of whites.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, men of working age from the group are more than 2.5
times as likely to be unemployed as whites, and those in work
receive only two-thirds of the earnings of whites. Most of this
group's people live in overcrowded homes.
</P>
<P>
However, the report, by the independent Policy Studies
Institute, said that Chinese and African Asians -- Indians whose
parents had lived in Africa -- are now doing better financially
than the average white Briton.
</P>
<P>
People from this group have unemployment rates as low or lower
than the general population and are more likely than whites to
earn more than 500 pounds (815 US dollars) a week.
</P>
<P>
The group includes a high proportion of professional and
managerial workers and many are self-employed.
</P>
<P>
The study said that educational attainment was one of the keys
to understanding the different levels of attainment of the various
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
It urged the new Labor government to take note of the findings
and treat minority groups with the individual attention they each
required.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, May 23 (Xinhua) - Sporadic clashes between soldiers,
and Kamajors mainly in the rebel invaded north in Sierra Leone,
continue despite statements by government officials that the fued
was now over.
</P>
<P>
Local journalists and rebel officials said Friday that at
least one soldier died on Thursday at Mile Five along the
strategic Makeni- Kono highway leading to the east.
</P>
<P>
According to one journalist quoting a passenger on board the
commercial vehicle, two soldiers in uniform were among the
passengers heading for Kono.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle was stopped at a checkpoint and only the soldiers
were asked to disembark as another vehicle will be provided for
them.
</P>
<P>
"The soldiers alighted and without warning one was gunned down
while the other was matcghed several times on the head and
shoulder" the journalist said.
</P>
<P>
West African diplomats said unless the killings are brought to
an immediate halt, the chances of both Kamajors and soldiers
fighting side-by-side against the rebels appear remote.
</P>
<P>
The govt in the past has blammed RUF rebels for disguising as
Kamajors during attacks.
</P>
<P>
The commission investigating the frequent friction between
Kamajors and soldiers will end its tour of the interior on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, over 600 witnesses including paramount
chiefs, battallion commanders, police officers and civilians have
testified.
</P>
<P>
"Some of their testimonies are horrific", one official said.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Urges Stronger Mandate for EU Treaty Negotiators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOORDWIJK, The Netherlands, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Dutch Prime
Minister Wim Kok said today he will strive towards a stronger
mandate for negotiators working on a new European Union (EU)
treaty to be signed at the Amsterdam summit next month.
</P>
<P>
Kok was speaking before the opening of an informal summit of
the heads of state and government of the 15 EU states, in the
Dutch seaside town of Noordwijk.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister, whose country holds the current EU
presidency, said that EU leaders should give their ministers and
negotiators the room to resolve the remaining obstacles to an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Issues to be tackled include common foreign and security
policies and institutional reforms of the EU.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair arrived for his first EU
meeting since his Labour government took office after the May 1
general election.
</P>
<P>
Blair's victory over the Euro-sceptic Conservative Party was
considered crucial to the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC)
talks on European reform, which have been stymied in part by
British objections to further EU integration.
</P>
<P>
The new government has pledged to work with its EU partners and
has lifted Conservative threats of a veto on various parts of the
new treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, while Blair promised a new constructive approach to
Europe, he said there would be no surrender of control over the
island nation's borders, mainly involving immigration and rights
of asylum.
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely essential that Britain retains control of its
own borders," Blair said. "Of course we want to be constructive
players in Europe, but we will stand up absolutely and firmly for
British interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
Border control is one of the key issues in a rewrite of
Europe's treaties designed to prepare the bloc for new member
states from the east.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he had a strong message for his fellow leaders. "We
will also be saying to all our European partners that it's
important that Europe itself focuses on those things that clearly
matter to people: jobs, competitiveness, the environment -- the
basic issues that will determine whether Europe is a success," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the new treaty among EU foreign ministers,
which was formally mandated by EU leaders in Turin, Italy, have
been running since March 1996, but today's meeting marked the
beginning of a new phase in which the leaders themselves would
take control.
</P>
<P>
Some leaders have said that ambitions must be scaled back by
those countries seeking a bold new step towards political union,
and that the new treaty should simply deal with what has to be
done to ensure that the union works over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
This includes moving to more majority voting and streamlining
some EU institutions.

<HEADLINE> Region Forging Ahead With Reforms: Schwab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- President of the World Economic
Forum Klaus Schwab said here today the international business
community is now convinced southern Africa had made great strides
to transform their economies to warrant significant inflows of
foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Schwab told journalists after meeting Zimbabwean president
Robert Mugabe success of the three-day southern Africa economic
summit, which ended today, was testimony of the positive right in
which the region was viewed by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"The summit has proved of great significance because it showed
that the international community is ready to do business not only
in South Africa but also other countries," he said, adding that a
number of bilateral agreements were concluded during the summit.
</P>
<P>
Schwab noted, however, that there were still areas that needed
to be addressed before the region could comfortably tackle
competition from other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
This year's summit was widely regarded as a success after
having attracted over 600 business executives and 100 political
leaders and academics drawn from the region and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The summit was organised by the World Economic Forum in
conjunction with the Southern African Development Community
(SADC).

<HEADLINE> Preparatory Committee Suggestion on What National Laws to be Added to or Deleted from Annex 3 of Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Five national laws were suggested
to be added to Annex 3 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region to be applied in the region, and one
national law was suggested to be deleted from the Annex.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made at the ninth plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong SAR that closed here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Members suggested that the following laws be added to Annex
3 of the Basic Law:
</P>
<P>
-- National Flag Law of the People's Republic of China;
</P>
<P>
-- Regulations on Consular Privileges and Immunity in the
People's Republic of China;
</P>
<P>
-- Law on the National Emblem of the People's Republic of China;
</P>
<P>
-- Law on China's Territorial Waters and Adjoining Areas;
</P>
<P>
-- Garrison Law of the People's Liberation Army Troops
Stationed in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
However, the Order on the National Emblem of the People's
Republic of China Proclaimed by the Central People's Government
should be deleted from the Annex, they suggested.
</P>
<P>
They held since the stipulation of the Basic Law in 1990, the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) has
newly formulated a host of national laws, including some laws
concerned with national defense and foreign affairs, as well as
some other ones that do not relate to the autonomy of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they suggested the NPC Standing Committee add or
delete some national laws in the Annex, according to Article 18 of
the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Article 18 of the Basic Law stipulates: "National laws shall
not be applied in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
except for those listed in Annex 3 to this Law. The laws listed
therein shall be applied locally by way of promulgation or
legislation by the Region."
</P>
<P>
"The NPC Standing Committee may add to or delete from the list
of laws in Annex 3 after consulting its Committee for the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the
government of the Region. Laws listed in Annex 3 to this Law shall
be confined to those relating to defense and foreign affairs as
well as other matters outside the limits of the autonomy of the
Region as specified by this Law."

<HEADLINE> ZGHT Sends "Space Flags" to HKSAR Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today received here
national and HKSAR regional flags that traveled to outer space,
from the China Aerospace Corporation (ZGHT).
</P>
<P>
At a special ceremony in the Great Hall of the People in
downtown Beijing, Tung Chee Hwa, the first chief executive of the
HKSAR, accepted the "space flags" presented by Liu Jiyuan,
president of the ZGHT.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the two flags were sent into space with the
company's 17th retrievable satellite, which was launched on
October 20 last year from Jiuquan in Gansu Province, and returned
to the earth on November 4.
</P>
<P>
"The two flags were kept in the retrievable module of the
satellite, and stayed 15 days in space," he noted, adding that the
Beijing Municipal Notary Office notarized the event.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that after the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland, the ZGHT would further expand its economic and
technological cooperation with the region, to promote development
for both Hong Kong and the aerospace industry in inland China.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his gratitude for the ZGHT, Tung noted that Hong
Kong would enter a new period of "one country, two systems" in 39
days.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Hong Kong will gain more benefits from the
scientific and technological development and modernization process
of the motherland, and will certainly also make greater
contributions to the motherland's development.
</P>
<P>
Today's ceremony was attended by Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Launches New Scientific Instruments Management Method </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Relevant state and municipal
departments today jointly set up a "Beijing scientific instruments
and equipments coordinating and sharing fund", deepening the
city's reform of scientific and technological management.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou Zuye, director of the Beijing Municipal
Science and Technology Commission, the first 13 million yuan (1.6
million US dollars) has been allocated to the fund.
</P>
<P>
Zhou cited Beijing as the most concentrated area in China in
terms of scientific instruments, but said that due to different
ownership and separate management systems, some instruments have
not been effectively used while other institutes still suffer from
the lack of scientific instruments.
</P>
<P>
"In order to make full use of these instruments a sharing and
coordinating machinism should be established among various
institutes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said former efforts in this regard have shown that the
efficiency of a single scientific instrument can be improved by an
average rate of 23 percent, if it is opened to the whole society.
</P>
<P>
At present, a regional coordinating network has been
established in Beijing, in which 28 institutes of 13 sectors
participate to share 75 scientific instruments whose total value
is worth 24 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the State Science and Technology
Commission, the practice of setting up such scientific instruments
sharing and coordinating fund and network will be spread to the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
"When the conditions are available a nation-wide coordinating
network will be founded to more effectively distribute and use the
scientific instruments," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sampras First Faces Santoro at French Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete Sampras will
first clash with the local hero Fabrice Santoro in his opening
match at the French Open tennis tournament, according to the draw
issued here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. player, who is dying for the only Grand Slam event
still to elude him, had the worst draw of all the men's seeds
here, as the French youngster Santoro is one of the most
successful players on clay this season.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who scored the best-ever French Open results here last
year as a beaten finalist, has failed to win a match on clay this
season. He had to pull out of the World Team Cup Championship in
Duesseldorf this week with a strained thigh.
</P>
<P>
Sampras will face a tough challenge from Santoro at the
tournament which starts on Monday.
</P>
<P>
If Sampras should beat the 24-year-old Santoro he could then
face another hard opponent Spaniard Francisco Clavet, a losing
finalist in Estoril this season.
</P>
<P>
World number two Michael Chang had a relative good luck as he
was drawn to play against a qualifier in the first round, but
could run into Bruguera in the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
Reigning champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia also looks safe
in a part of the draw where Briton Tim Henman, Australian Mark
Philippoussis and Frenchman Cedric Pioline look the most serious
threats. The Russian meets Czech Martin Damm in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Thomas Enqvist, ranked ninth in the world, extended
the pulled-out seed list here following American Todd Martin and
Germany's Boris Becker. Enqvist withdrew with an unspecified
injury.
</P>
<P>
In the women's draw world number one Martina Hingis of
Switzerland could meet Russian hopeful Anna Kournikova as early as
the third round.
</P>
<P>
Former number one Monica Seles could also clash early on with
compatriot Venus Williams, another promising teenager.

methods for forming the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong
SAR is an important task of the Preparatory Committee entrusted by
the relevant decision by the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
In the process of drawing up the specific methods, the
Preparatory Committee had a full discussion of the three ways for
electing the first 60-member Legislative Council of the Hong Kong
SAR, namely the geographical constituency through direct
elections, elections by functional constituency, or the Election
Committee, and of other relevant issues after widely soliciting
opinions from Hong Kong people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Since the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR, its
principal officials, the Executive Council and the Provisional
Legislative Council have been selected and are working, and the
government of the Hong Kong SAR will be responsible for electing
the first Legislative Council, the specific methods make
stipulations for choosing ways for direct elections, the division
of the geographical constituency, and on how to define the new
functional sectors by the Hong Kong SAR itself.
</P>
<P>
The meeting held that the suggestions on what national laws
should be added to or deleted from the Annex 3 of the Basic Law
are set forth in accordance with the development of the country's
legal system.
</P>
<P>
The Annex 3 of the Basic Law stipulates the six national laws
to be applied in the Hong Kong SAR. According to the suggestions
approved by the meeting, five national laws will be added to the
Annex 3 and one deleted from the Annex 3.
</P>
<P>
The meeting pointed out that over past one year or more, the
Preparatory Committee have fulfilled a series of tasks connected
with preparing for the formation of the Hong Kong SAR. At last,
the task of the Preparatory Committee has been completed on the
whole, laying the basis for the founding of the Hong Kong SAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL May, 23 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Government today
allowed five new companies to invest in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
It is the first approval of South Korean investment in DPRK
since Daewoo Co. in 1995 received permission for a joint venture
with the DPRK in the Nampo Industrial Park, west of Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Today's decision came while the two sides were holding their
second Red Cross meeting in Beijing on the delivery of the South's
relief food aid to the North.
</P>
<P>
Cho Kun-shik, chief of the Inter-Korean Interchange and
Cooperation Bureau of the Ministry of National Unification, said
the decision was part of the overall policy to continuously
increase and expand exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Taechang, one of the leading knitwear makers in South Korea,
will set up a joint venture mineral water company with the DPRK's
Rungla Trading Co., in Kangwon Province on its east coast.
</P>
<P>
The estimated investment for Taechang Co. is around 5.8 million
U.S. dollars, accounting 60 percent of the total 9.7 million
U.S. dollars capital of the joint firm.
</P>
<P>
The company, when set up, will be the second inter-Korean joint
venture following Daewoo's investment.
</P>
<P>
Another four companies which are also permitted to invest in
the DPRK are Mihung Foods, Shinil Leather Co, Hanhwa Co. and LG
Electronics Co..

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish to Exchange Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May (Xinhua) -- The Greek and Turkish committees of
experts examining differences between the two countries will soon
present their findings to the Dutch European Union (EU)
presidency, the Greek Foreign Minister, Theodoros Pangalos, said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos told a press conference that the experts would do
this possibly as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Greek and Turkish groups would study each other's
reports which would be exchanged via the EU presidency. He said he
hoped the Turkish group's report would contain "positive and
constructive positions."
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Greece rejected a proposal by the Dutch EU
presidency for a direct meeting between the committees of experts
which were formed last month with the aim of studying the problems
between the two countries over territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>
As for the gravity of the situation in the Aegean, Pangalos
said no politician in either Greece or Turkey would want to assume
the burden of a military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the proposed summer moratorium on military
flights in the Aegean, he reiterated that Greece was in favor of
such a move, but noted that Turkey had voiced reservations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reservations expressed by Cypriot leaders over a
possible non-aggression pact between Athens and Ankara, he
stressed that any military action by Turkey against Cyprus would
be considered by Athens as cause for war.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that neither Greece nor Cyprus should dictate
policy to each other.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey have been strained for
decades over territorial disputes and the Cyprus problem. But
recent months have witnessed a thawing of Greek-Turkish
antagonism, with a lot of "positive gestures" from both sides.

ROME, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Beaten UEFA Cup finalist
Internazionale Milan has rejected an immediate resignation offer
from the English coach Roy Hodgson, according to local reports on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hodgson, who will manage English Premier League Blackburn
next season, was reported to have offered his resignation to
Inter owner Massimo Moratti 24 hours after Inter lost the UEFA
Cup final to German club Schalke 04 in a penalty shoot-out in
Milan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Inter spokesman Sandro Sabatini said on Friday it was still not
clear whether Hodgson would withdraw his resignation and lead the
team through to the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
With Juventus needing just a point to clinch the league title
on Friday, Inter was third in the standings, eight points behind
the leader and two behind second-placed Parma. They could still
surpass Parma to claim the second place and a berth in the

<HEADLINE> China's NPC Protests EP Inviting Taiwan's "Foreign Minister" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Affairs Committee of
China's National People's Congress (NPC) issued a solemn statement
here today protesting the European Parliament (EP) Foreign Affairs
Committee's invitation to John Chang, Taiwan's so-called "foreign
minister" for a visit there.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that on May 22, the Foreign Affairs,
Security, and Defense Affairs Policy Committee of the EP,
disregarding the repeated representations of the Chinese side,
insisted on inviting Chang in the capacity of "government official
of the Republic of China" to conduct activities in the EP, thus
providing a platform for him, who aims at creating "two Chinas",
and "one China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
This is a grave event constituting an infringement upon China's
sovereignty, interference in China's internal affairs, and a
premeditated provocation against the Chinese people, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Committee of China's NPC "hereby expresses
its utmost indignation and a strong protest to the EP's Foreign
Affairs Committee over this issue."
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that there is only one China in the world,
and the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate government representing China with Taiwan as an
inalienable part of the Chinese territory, which is a fact
acknowledged by the international community including the European
Union (EU) and its member states, noted the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that recognizing and observing the "one China"
principle is the basis for the establishment of diplomatic ties
and development of relations between China and the EU, as well as
EU member states.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the EP's permission for Chang to conduct
activities there is an open support for the attempt of the Taiwan
authorities to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan",
which goes against the fundamental principle set for the
establishment of China-EU diplomatic ties, insulted the feelings
of the Chinese people, and undermined the relations between
China's NPC and the EP.
</P>
<P>
It continued that in the past few years, a small number of
people in the EP have conspired with the Taiwan authorities to
constantly create disturbances and wantonly interfere in China's
internal affairs, in an attempt to undermine the great cause of
China's reunification, stop China's development and obstruct
China-EU relations.
</P>
<P>
Their deeds can only harm others in the beginning and harm
themselves in the end, pointed out the statement, adding that
China admonishes some people in the EP not to walk farther down
the road of confronting China.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the firm stand of the Chinese people on the Taiwan
question, the statement urged the EP leaders to keep their
repeated commitment in earnest to improve relations with China,
and stop the occurrence of any event which will damage the great
cause of China's reunification and hinder the China-EU relations.
</P>
<P>
China-EU relations can only move forward in a sound and steady
way on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Companies Protest against US Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nanjing Chemical Industries
Group and Jiangsu Yongli Chemical Engineering and Technology
Import/Export Corporation issued a joint statement today,
resolutely opposing and protesting the United States imposing
irrational sanctions on the two companies.
</P>
<P>
The full text of the statement is as follows:
</P>
<P>
We are surprised to learn that the government of the United
States made groundless accusations that Nanjing Chemical
Industries Group and Jiangsu Yongli Chemical Engineering and
Technology Import/Export Corporation are engaged in the activities
of proliferating chemical weapons, and declared to impose
sanctions upon these companies. Thereby we make the solemn
declaration that follows:
</P>
<P>
Our two companies have carried out chemical trade and
commercial activities strictly in accordance with the
international trade norms and the relevant laws of China. We have
accurately reported to higher authorities every relevant export
deal in accordance with regulations. We have never violated the
laws and decrees of China, neither have we violated the Chemical
Weapon Convention. The US government's accusation that our
companies pursue activities of proliferating chemical weapons is
absolutely drawn from the air. The so-called sanctions by the US
government against our companies are indeed completely without the
backing of international law and a brutal intervention in normal
international trade and commercial activities. The above-mentioned
activities of the US government have severely damaged the fine
reputation of our two companies.
</P>
<P>
We definitely cannot accept the groundless accusation made by
the US government against us. We feel utmost indignation and
express diametrical opposition to and strong protest against the
unreasonable sanctions that the US government has imposed on us.
</P>
<P>
In order to safeguard the legitimate interests and reputation
of our companies, we demand that the US government should
immediately cancel the unreasonable sanctions that it imposed on
our companies.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Names Sergeyev New Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
demonstrating his resolution to deepen the reform in the army,
today named Igor Sergeyev as defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The president also appointed General Anatoly Kvashnin as acting
chief of general staff.
</P>
<P>
The appointments were announced by Yeltsin's Press Secretary
Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev, 59, was appointed as acting defense minister Thursday
after Yeltsin surprisingly sacked Defense Minister Igor Rodionov
for "doing a bad job" in reforming the army.
</P>
<P>
Kvashnin, head of the North Caucasus military district, was
named to replace Viktor Samsonov, who was also sacked Thursday for
the same reason.
</P>
<P>
According to Defense Council secretary Yuri Baturin, the
appointment of Sergeyev showed Yeltsin's desire to reform the
Russian army into a leaner, professional one.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, had
pledged during his re-election campaign to overhaul the present
conscription system to build a modern, professional army by 2000.
</P>
<P>
It was also expected that Russia's nuclear force would be
strengthened since the new minister, who has headed the Strategic
Missile Forces since 1992, viewed it as the backbone of the
country's defense, and described it as especially economical when
the government was short of funds.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev reputation for high moral standards also made his
appointment possible because corruption has became common among
high-level army officers.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had focused on fighting army corruption when he sacked
Rodionov Thursday. He said:"The soldier is losing weight while the
general is getting fatter".
</P>
<P>
Military prosecutors say about 20 generals and 100 colonels are
being investigated for graft.

<HEADLINE> Central Government Party Conference Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A three-day Party conference for
the central government departments ended here today after choosing
delegates to the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) through multi-candidate election.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which opened Wednesday, was attended by 500
delegates from the 103 departments of the central government.
</P>
<P>
The delegates elected to attend the 15th CPC National Congress,
which is due later this year, include both veteran and new Party
members, leading officials and ordinary government functionaries,
as well as a number of female Party members and members from
minority ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Luo Gan, who is also secretary-general of the
State Council, told the elected delegates that they should cherish
the honor and try their best to live up to the expectations of all
other Party members from the central government departments.
</P>
<P>
"There are only 39 days remaining before the Chinese government
resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and the date
for the significant Party national congress is also approaching
day by day," said Luo.
</P>
<P>
While feeling excited, he said, all Party organizations and
members in the central departments should also realize the heavy
responsibility on their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
"We must follow Premier Li Peng's call to build a civilized
government and work to the satisfaction of the people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Luo went on to call on all Party members and functionaries of
the central government to unite closely around the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, and concentrate
their work on this year's two major events -- the return of Hong
Kong and the Party congress.

<HEADLINE> Iran Extends Voting for New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran's election headquarters
announced here today that the deadline for today's presidential
polls has been extended for two hours.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters said that the extension was made due to the
massive turnout of the citizens in polling stations across the
country.
</P>
<P>
As the pre-set deadline reached 18:00 hours local time (13:30
GMT), there are still a lot of people queueing in front of many
stations.
</P>
<P>
Upon the agreement of Interior Minister Ali Mohammad
Besharati, the deadline for voting has been prolonged until
20:00 hours local time (15:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Many political specialists hold that today's turnout is the
largest in the past 18 years, which they described as "incredible"
because many people, especially youths, are longing for democracy,
freedom and economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Observers here estimated earlier that about 80 percent of the
eligible voters is expected to cast their ballots at various
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Four people announced their candidacy to run for the elections
earlier in the year, namely, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the incumbent
parliament speaker, Mohammed Khatami, former minister of culture
and Islamic guidance, Mahammad Mohammadi Reyshahri, former
information minister, and Saied Reza Zavareie, vice-chairman of
the Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Among the candidates, the main contenders are the hardliner
speaker Nateq-Nouri and Mohammed Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, the winner must secure an absolute
majority of more than half of the votes cast. In the absence of
a clear winner, there will be a runoff between the top two
candidates in a week.

<HEADLINE> Japan Foresees Sustainable Growth in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian-Pacific economies will
achieve sustained growth in the long run despite a minor economic
slowdown in 1996, Japan's Economic Planning Agency predicted today.
</P>
<P>
"It is still difficult to see any limit on growth for these
economies," the organization said in a 350-page report on 16
economies in Eastern and Southern Asia and Oceania.
</P>
<P>
The report said the region's growth last year slowed by 0.8
points, from 8.2 percent in 1995 to 7.4 percent, largely due to
plunging exports resulting from the semi-conductor price dive.
</P>
<P>
However, there were no substantial obstacles lying ahead in the
region's growth, said the report, which examined the economies'
potential in mobilizing labor, raising capital and improving
technology.
</P>
<P>
It estimated a considerable extra labor force of 470 million in
rural areas of China, Indonesia, newly industrialized economies
and other southeastern Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Ample bank deposits in the region, and growing saving rates,
would guarantee the capital needed for development, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
It said the region's technology acquisition from Europe and the
United States was gaining momentum, which ensured efficiency rises,
a key element in achieving long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
The surveyed economies were China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Australia and New
Zealand.

PERTH, Australia, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhu
Rongji said a better Sino-Australian relationship will be
conducive to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech upon his arrival at an airport in the port
city of Perth in southwest Australia, the Chinese vice premier
said he hoped his week-long visit will help increase high-level
exchange, deepen understanding and expand cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Pushing the Sino-Australian ties to a higher level will be
conducive to the peace and stability in the region," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier and his party arrived at Perth tonight
on a state visit at the invitation of the Australian government.
They were greeted at the airport by Australian Minister for Small
Business and Consumer Affairs Geoff Prosser, officials with West
Australia state and Chinese Ambassador to Australia Hua Junduo.
</P>
<P>
Among those accompanying the vice premier are Finance Minister

the visit by the Chinese vice premier is an important chance to
pursue opportunities for expanded commercial cooperation, building
on the high level of complementarity between the two economies.

and the depth of the bilateral relationship between Australia and
China following on from Prime Minister John Howard's successful
visit to China in late March and early April," the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Longdongbao Civil Airport in
southwest China's Guizhou Province, which passed the state
appraisal today, has been a field test for China's most advanced
technology in airport construction.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese experts, the airport, located on the
southeastern outskirts of the provincial capital of Guiyang City,
is a modern airport which faced the greatest construction
challenges in China.
</P>
<P>
The most advanced airport in southwest China can handle Boeing
747 airplanes and has a designed annual turnover of five million
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The airport is built in the karst areas. In the course of its
construction, which cost 1.3 billion yuan in six years, some 20
hills were leveled, five valleys were filled, and nearly 100
underground caves were dealt with.
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty in constructing the Longdongbao Airport is
unprecedented in the history of China's aviation industry," said
Wei Yihua, general engineer of the China Civil Airport Project and
Design Institute.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact," Wei said, "The airport became the field
test for China's new airport construction technology in the 1990s."
</P>
<P>
The airport is scheduled to officially go into service on May
28.

STOCKHOLM, May 23 (Xinhua)-- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook says his country will do its best to find common ground in
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party's landslide victory in the election meant a new
start for Europe, Cook wrote in an article carried in today's
Dagens Nyheter newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Britain will now cease to be the country that says no
to everything, and obstructs agreements just for the sake of
obstructing.
</P>
<P>
He emphasizes, however, that Britain is not prepared to abandon
its demand for the retention of British border controls.
</P>
<P>
He also stresses that the EU should not take over the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) military tasks.
</P>
<P>
The new Labor government has promised to actively take part in
EU affairs. Conservative Euro-sceptics had tried to block further
European integration by threatening to use Britain's veto power.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state and government of the 15 EU states are gathering
in the Dutch seaside town of Noordiwijk to give impetus to EU
reform.
</P>
<P>
An Inter-Governmental Conference of foreign ministers, mandated
by EU leaders in Turin, Italy in March 1996, has been working on a
new European treaty, but sensitive issues, such as a common defense and
security policy and institutional reforms, still remain.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Economy Not Yet Fully Developed: Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's economy does not have
the depth and breadth of fully developed countries, the Ministry
of Trade and Industry (MTI) said today, while saying the country
is glad to be reclassified by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) as one of the advanced economies.
</P>
<P>
The ministry noted that in its World Economic Outlook, the IMF
reclassifies Singapore and four other economies into the group of
advanced economies.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad that the IMF recognized the progress made by
Singapore. However, ... our economy does not have the depth and
breadth of fully developed economies," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that Singapore still lags behind many of the
developed economies and even some of the Newly Industrialized
Economies (NIEs) in terms of the educational profile of
Singapore's workforce, its indigenous technological base, and
corporate strength.
</P>
<P>
On the educational profile of the workforce, the ministry noted
that only 31 percent of Singapore's labor force has at least
post-secondary education compared with 89 percent in the United
States, 78 percent in Japan and 60 percent in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
As for indigenous technological base, the ministry noted most
of the country's technology is not home-grown, but brought in by
the multi-national corporations.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it said the scale of Singapore companies is still
small. No Singapore company is in the "Fortune Global 500" list of
world's largest corporations.

<P>
PARIS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Zairian President Mobutu Sese
Seko will stay in Morocco for only a few days before leaving for a
second leg of his exile -- most probably France, the Agence
France-Presse (AFP) quoted the Moroccan government as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu, who is expected to arrive in Rabat today from Lome, Togo,
will be received according to "traditions of reception" of
Morocco, said the Moroccan Ministry of Communication.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted a "good source" in Rabat as saying that the "case
of Mobutu is a humanitarian problem which should be treated in the
framework of the interests of Morocco and France."
</P>
<P>
This apparently indicates that Mobutu will leave Morocco for
France after France holds the second round of the legislative
elections on June 1.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu will be living in "strict privacy" and be treated daily
by a medical team, said Moroccan officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo Laurent Kabila announced the first 13 members
of his cabinet early this morning, a week after he toppled former
Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and renamed the country.
</P>
<P>
There is no post of prime minister in the cabinet list. The
cabinet was expected to consist of 20 ministers in total.
</P>
<P>
Kabila himself assumed the position of defence minister. He
will also remain Commander-in-Chief of the Congo People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Nine ministers including the ministers of foreign affairs,
finance and mining were coming from Kabila's own political
organization, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL).
</P>
<P>
The other four ministers were from the country's two major
opposition parties -- the Patriotic Front and the Union of
Democracy and Social Progress.
</P>
<P>
However, they have chosen to back out of their original
political background and to "participate in ruling ADFL's party
activities".
</P>
<P>
Almost all the cabinet members are new faces, except Foreign
Minister Bizima Karaha, who has been Kabila's official spokesman
since late last year.
</P>
<P>
The only female cabinet member, Justine Mpoyo Kasavubu, who
serves as the minister of public function, is the daughter of the
country's first President Joseph Kasavubu after its independence
in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Kabila proclaimed himself President of the Democratic Republic
of Congo on May 17, when his troops captured the capital
Kinshasa. Former Zairean President Mobutu fled the capital in
exile on May 16. enditem

BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The three express cargo trains that
transport fresh and frozen foodstuff to Hong Kong and Macao will

In a meeting held to mark the 35th anniversary of the three

He said departments of foreign trade and railways at each level

MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
demonstrating his resolution to deepen reform in the army, today
named Igor Sergeyev as defense minister.

</P>
<P>
The appointments were announced by Yeltsin's Press Secretary,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky.

Kvashnin, head of the North Caucasus military district, was
named to replace Viktor Samsonov, who was also sacked Thursday for

<HEADLINE> China to Boost Passenger Transport in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Buses will reach 95 percent of the
towns and 80 percent of the villages in China by the year 2000, a
senior official from the Ministry of Communications said here
today.
</P>
<P>
China's rural areas will put more than 20,000 new buses into
use in the remaining years of this century, and will open another
2,000 public transport routes, and build 1,000 bus stops.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhiqiang, director of the Department of Highway
Management of the Ministry of Communications, made the remarks at
a meeting on rural highway building held in Zibo City, in east
China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
He said that the effort is to cater to the increasingly
vigorous markets and a fast-growing economy in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
"We will encourage state-owned, collective, and private
businesses to handle passenger transport in the rural areas," he
said, adding that at present, the network has taken initial shape.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, about 90 percent of the towns and 74
percent of the villages had access to public transport, with
167,000 buses running on 39,000 routes, as well as 16,000 bus
stops.
</P>
<P>
Highways transported a total of 11.4 billion passengers last
year, 60 percent of whom were in rural areas, according to
statistics.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Exports to Southern Africa Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- South African exports to the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) increased by 30.9
percent to 2.9 billion U.S. Dollars last year compared with 1995,
the local daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
This has widened Pretoria's surplus to 2.4 billion Dollars,
the report quoted figures issued by the Industrial Development
Corporation (IDC) as reporting.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, South Africa's surplus to the SADC, now chaired by
President Nelson Mandela, amounted to 1.9 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to an IDC survey, South Africa, together with Botswana,
Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland, sold products worth 2.9 billion
Dollars to African countries in 1995, while buying only 682 million
Dollars from the continent.
</P>
<P>
Their exports to the whole of Africa surged to 3.8 billion
Dollars last year while imports inched up to 841 million Dollars,
the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the imbalance was likely to endure for
more years partly due to structural problems in SADC nations.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Trade Organization official Anne Moore
said Thursday that most SADC nations did not have the products
South Africa imports. These include such industrial goods as
machinery, equipment and sophisticated chemicals. enditem

KATHMANDU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A Russian climber has died when
descending Mount Makalu, the Nepalese Tourism Ministry announced
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Salavat Khabiboulline, 36, a resident of Ekaterinburg, Russia,

BRUSSELS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea player-manager Ruud Gullit
will not make a farewell appearance for the Netherlands in a
friendly against South Africa in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The match is part of celebrations to mark the fifth anniversary
of the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president and there had
been speculation that Gullit would play one last match for the
Dutch national team to honor Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Gullit and Mandela have been friends since the former AC Milan
star dedicated his 1987 European Footballer of the year prize to
Mandela, who was then still in jail.
</P>
<P>
Gullit, who has not played for the Netherlands since winning
his 65th cap in May 1994, had been invited to attend the match by
the Dutch football association (KNVB).
</P>
<P>
Gullit has strongly hinted that he will not play again next

</P>
<P>
Ajax players will not be available for the match as they will

JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni will pay his first state visit to South Africa next
Monday, informed sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit, Museveni will have talks with South
African President Nelson Mandela over bilateral relations and
issues of mutual concern, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Although the visit will focus on the relations between the two
countries, it is expected that problems in the Great Lakes
region, including developments in Zaire, will form part of the
agenda, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, an ally of Zairean leader Laurent Kabila, was widely
consulted with by Mandela and South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki during recent mediation efforts in ending the war in
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on double taxations will also be signed after
bilateral talks between Ugandan and South African government
officials, they said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between South Africa and Uganda stood at 30.4 million
U.S. Dollars last year, up from 20.3 million Dollars in 1995.
South Africa exports to Uganda totalled 29 million Dollars in
1996. enditem

<HEADLINE> Electronic Device Offers Hepatitis B Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A device which can produce electric
impulses may offer new hopes to patients suffering from Hepatitis
B, a research team of non-drug therapies for liver diseases
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The researchers attach the device on certain acupuncture points
on the patient's body. The impulses stimulate blood vessels in the
liver and accelerate blood circulation.
</P>
<P>
"Increased blood circulation provides sufficient oxygen and
nutrition to liver cells to vitalize them, and finally heal the
liver," said Prof. Wang Boxiang, the head of the team.
</P>
<P>
"The therapy signifies a new and significant progress in
treating liver diseases through non-drug methods," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to traditional Chinese medicine, blood stasis is the
major cause of fibrosis of liver and cirrhosis.
</P>
<P>
"So promoting blood circulation by removing blood stasis is a
fundamental method to treat liver diseases," said Prof. Wang,
director of the National Medical Center of Liver Diseases of
Traditional Chinese Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The device was developed by a medical equipment company in
Beijing five years ago. The research team has made clinical use of
it at hospitals in Beijing, Wuhan, Lanzhou, and Taiyuan for three
years.
</P>
<P>
"The new therapy has been proved to be about 80 percent
effective in restoring liver function, treating fatty liver, and
curbing fibrosis of the liver," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The professor is attending a symposium on non-drug therapies
for liver diseases in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to develop various methods, including drugs and
non-drug therapies, he noted, to treat Hepatitis B since it still
remains as a difficult problem for the world's medical authorities.
</P>
<P>
"I think the new therapy will play a promising role in
assisted-treatment of liver diseases in future," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Massive Turn out in Iranian Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian voters today turned
out massively to choose a new president, yearning for a change
in the Islamic country.
</P>
<P>
This is the historical turning point for the 18-year-old
Islamic rule as millions of Muslim people, especially the
youth, seek democracy, freedom and economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Many political specialists held that today's turn out is
the largest in the past 18 years and they just described it
as "incredible".
</P>
<P>
It is rare to see hundreds of voters lining up in front
of polling stations at schools or mosques in early morning.
The polling is expected to get momentum in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that this is because those who had no interest
in politics before, such as housewives, young girls, have been
enthusiastically involved in the voting as they believe that their
votes count in the tense and close contest.
</P>
<P>
However, some specialists noted that there are very strong
sentiments against the religious rule, especially the hardline
policy. So, many intellectuals turn to support a moderate
candidate rather than a hardliner picked up by the Islamic
regime.
</P>
<P>
Shirin Banaie, a housewife in 50s, told Xinhua that it is
the first time for her to come out to vote today along
with her son and daughter. She said that they will vote for
open-minded candidate Mohammad Khatami because he is well-educated
and more competent.
</P>
<P>
But a heavily-bearded Clergyman named Ali Tehrani said that
he would vote for his favorite candidate Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri
because he thought that Nateq-Nouri is much experienced than
other candidates.
</P>
<P>
The competition between two front-runners has been so tense
and so close in the past two weeks that many political
analysts feel hard to predict the result.
</P>
<P>
The two main contenders are hardliner Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri and former cultural and Islamic guidance
minister Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri, 54, represents the Iranian conservative camp called
the Association of Combatant Clergymen (ACC) and enjoys support
of rich bazaar merchants. He is also backed by Iranian Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei and at least half of the 270-seat
Parliament as well as the clerics of the religious cities of
Qom and Mashhad.
</P>
<P>
The white turban clergyman is maneuvering into position with
a policy of "privatization" and "more social justice". However,
he said that he would follow the same policies pioneered by
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani with emphasis on the Second
Five-Year Development Plan (1995-1999).
</P>
<P>
After casting his vote, he said, Iran's foreign policy
vis-a-vis ties with the United States and European Union will
not change. Policies will be adopted in line with wisdom and
expedience,
</P>
<P>
He said that national interest will precede everything else.
Iran's foreign policy will also be based on non-interference
in domestic affairs of other countries and reciprocal respect in
ties with other countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to predict his possible victory in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, 54, who had been obscure from the political scene
in Tehran for more than four years, has focused his campaign
strategy on cultural issues such as freedom of press and
tolerance for remarks by opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
The black turban clergyman has secured the backing of the
left-wing group called the Society of Combatant Clergymen (SAA)
and the pro-Rafsanjani liberal camp called G-6 and is counting
on the youth and intellectuals for their votes.
</P>
<P>
After casting his vote, he said in an emotional and
confident way that the elections are being held in a healthy
atmosphere. "I will do my best to work for the prosperity of
the nation", he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was surprised by the high degree of
support for him, Khatami said the Iranian youth love their
country and revolution and their overwhelming participation in the
elections stems from this love.
</P>
<P>
As for the result of the elections, Khatami said, "whatever
God desires. What is important to me is the elevation of
Islamic Iran and not who becomes the next president."
</P>
<P>
On chances of winning, he said any one elected as Iran's
next president must continue with the construction programs and
pave the way for enthusiastic presence of the people on the
scene.
</P>
<P>
Other two candidates -- former information minister Mohammad
Mohammadi Reyshahri, also clergyman, and Deputy Judicial Chief
Seyed Rerza Zavarei -- vowed to fight to the end though
there is no chance for them to win. They are widely regarded
as outsiders unlikely to have any impact on the elections but
expected to take votes away from Nateq-Nouri because they belong
to the same camp.

SINGAPORE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
today repeated his call on all Singaporeans to take it as a
national mission to "maintain our international competitiveness,"
saying that Singapore will work with its neighbors in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"It is more than about being able to continue to improve our
standard of living. It is about survival, of making sure of our
place in the future," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be more disciplined, efficient and united than
others," he urged his countrymen at the 160th anniversary dinner
of the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
With no direct reference to recent friction in the relations
between Singapore and Malaysia, Goh said, "Singapore will work
with other countries, especially our neighbors, to synergize each
other's comparative and competitive advantages."
</P>
<P>
"Sure we will also compete even as we cooperate. But we do not
envy nor fear the big plans of others, nor their success. On the
contrary, we wish them well because their success will also spill
over to us. We will also invest in their economies to ride on
their growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between countries, especially between neighbors,
will enhance a country's competitiveness and efficiency, he said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Democratic Congo Born as New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Zaire has become a history, and a
Democratic Congo was born with the formation of its new
government announced by President Laurent Kabila early this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Kabila assumed the presidency of the country on May 17, the
same day when his troops of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for
the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) captured capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
He abolished the country name of Zaire and the river name of
Zaire, both given by exiled former President Mobutu Sese Seko in
1971. The Africa's third largest country is now named the
Democratic Republic of Congo, and the famous African river, the
Congo river.
</P>
<P>
Kabila may soon issue a new currency to replace the present
one, Zaire, which has been depreciated for so many times that the
largest note of 50,000 is almost nothing, taking the four zeros
into consideration.
</P>
<P>
One U.S. dollar is equal to 80,000 Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Only days before the capture of Kinshasa by Kabila's army,
Mobutu ordered to print the 100,000 Zaire notes, only to find the
money rejected by the local citizens.
</P>
<P>
"All the rediculous stuff in the Mobutu era will be abolished,
because now the Congo people are liberated, and a new Democratic
Republic of Congo is born," said Kabila's presidential spokesman,
Raphael Ghenda.
</P>
<P>
Ghenda was referring to the wide-spread corruption. He said
the first top priority of the new government would be to raise
the "down,down morale" of the people and the old country.
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesman said: "Clean, democratic politics
is what we are striving for. Every citizen in this country should
not forget what forced down the Mobutu regime -- corruption."
</P>
<P>
"The new government will take up the challenges, left over by
Mobutu's corrupted regime, to re-build this country which has
been crushed to pulp," said Grattas Bugera, ADFL
general-secretary who is also believed to be the second man to
President Kabila in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mining-rich Zaire, which had been among Africa's richest
countries during the 1970s, dropped to a list of the world's most
under-developed countries in 1995 according to the United Nations
rating.
</P>
<P>
The per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was only 120 U.S.
dollars that year. Although no estimates were made in 1996 due to
the difficulty of gathering information, the situation could be
much worse in 1996 because of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
"With the formation of the 20-member new Government of
National Salvation, the Democratic Republic of Congo, led by
President Kabila, will be right on track of economic development
and national reconstruction," said Ghenda.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 members of the new cabinet were announced early
today, by the president via the state tv and radio, leaving seven
vacancies to be filled in later.
</P>
<P>
Political negotiations are still vehement in the capital among
various political parties, groups and organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The new government will be democratic and broad-based," said
Kabila, quoted by his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Kabila announced himself president of the new republic on May
17, 1997, the same day when his ADFL troops took over capital
Kinshasa after gaining control of nearly all the territory of the
central African country.
</P>
<P>
A long follower of Zaire's first prime minister, Patrice
Lumumba who was a passionate advocator of national unity
regardless of ethnic and regional differences, Kabila said he has
been cherishing a dream of "keeping the nation together and
building it into a strong, prosperious country."
</P>
<P>
"My long years of struggle were like spreading fertiliser on
the field. Now it's time to harvest," said Kabila, who began his
political struggle against Mobutu since 1960s.
</P>
<P>
But it took only seven month for the ADFL leader to "liberate
Zaire", with a territory of 3.45 million square meters, since he
started an armed revolt in the eastern part of the country in
October 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Now i proclaim the formation of the National Salvation
Government. Today, a Democratic Republic of Congo was born,"
announced the president.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders to Meet to Give Impetus to Treaty Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOORDWIJK, The Netherlands, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state
and government of the 15 European Union (EU) countries will gather
this afternoon in the Dutch seaside resort of Noordwijk, to give a
fillip to the Maastricht Treaty review talks.
</P>
<P>
Called for by the Netherlands, which currently holds the
rotating EU presidency, the informal get-together is vital for
taking the sting out of several prickly issues, such as defense,
Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the bloc's
institutional reforms, before the EU summit in Amsterdam on June
16-17.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who will be welcomed for the
first time by his EU counterparts, is expected to make concrete
commitments in favor of European integration.
</P>
<P>
The commitment of Blair's new Labour government to building
more positive relations with EU has breathed new life into the IGC
(Inter-Governmental Conference) talks on European reform, launched
in March 1996 in Turin, Italy.
</P>
<P>
However, the United Kingdom has not budged an inch on defense
and reform of the CFSP.
</P>
<P>
The UK also remains hostile to any surrender of sovereignty in
the areas of immigration and rights of asylum, as envisaged by
most of its European partners.
</P>
<P>
Because of the delicacy of the institutional reforms, the Dutch
presidency seems to have given up the idea of presenting texts
focused on such issues as composition of the European Commission,
the re-weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers and in stepping up
the European Parliament's powers at today's summit.
</P>
<P>
"On the question of institutional reforms, it is possible that we
have to leave it open in the draft treaty and deal with it at a
later stage," Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo said after
an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in The Hague last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, EU governments are still wrestling with the plan
calling for the EU's military role by integrating the Western European
Union (WEU), a defense group that comprises 10 of the 15 EU
states, into the EU.
</P>
<P>
The plan, modeled on long-standing French-German ideas, has been
backed by nine countries, but faces strong opposition from Britain,
Denmark and four neutral EU states - Austria, Finland, Ireland
and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
While ruling out the possibility that the EU will be
transformed into a full-fledged defense club, diplomats said it
was increasingly likely that the new treaty would give the EU the
power to ask the WEU to plan and carry out peacekeeping,
humanitarian and other crisis-management operations on its behalf.
</P>
<P>
On the CFSP issue, a consensus is emerging on plans to establish
a new planning and analysis unit and on the appointment of a senior
official to give foreign policy a public face.

<HEADLINE> Massive Turn out in Iranian Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
Observers said that this is the most closest and toughest
election contest in the past 18 years since the founding of
the Islamic Republic in 1979.
</P>
<P>
This is because the candidates are politically almost equal
and heavy-weighted and powerful figures such as Iranian Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei and current President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
stay away from the race.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei won the majority of votes in the 1981 presidential
election. He was reelected in 1985 and ran for the second
term in office. He has been now the lifetime leader ruling
the 62-million populated Islamic country since the demise of
late spiritual leader Ruhollah Mousavi Khomeini in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani won a landslide victory in the 1989 presidential
election and was reelected in 1993. He has to step down
from the office since the Constitution bars him from running
for the term of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
From 08:00 hours local time (3:30 GMT), voters aged 15 or
above, old and young, men and women, turned out at 33,209
polling stations over the country for the 7th presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The polling will last to 18:00 hours local time (13:30 GMT)
and 33 million eligible voters can cast their votes in various
constituencies under the heavy security protection by 200,000
security forces and 34,000 units of militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Observers estimated that about 80 percent of the eligible
voters will cast their ballots at 33,400 polling stations.
The high turn-out rate should be ascribed to the political
excitement of the people in determine the future of the
Islamic country toward the 21 century.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law the winner must secure an absolute
majority of more than half of the votes cast. In the
absence of a clear winner, there will be a runoff between
the top two candidates.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei cast his vote shortly
after polls opened in the morning and advised the nation to
rush to the polling stations and no leave this major task
till late in the day.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his expectations from the future president,
Khamenei said, "we expect him to consider himself servant of
the nation and do all he can within his legal jurisdiction
what is required for the spiritual and material well being of
the nation."
</P>
<P>
He said that the nation expects all the measures taken
for their prosperity and well being to be within the framework
of Islamic laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately all the candidates have declared their platforms
and that is what we expect from the future president," he
added.
</P>
<P>
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani cast his ballot at Jamaran
Mosque, northern Tehran, and urged the nation to follow suit.
His neighborhood has been still decorated with pictures of
moderate candidate Khatami. There is no any picture of
Nateq-Nouri. However, he kept secret about his vote.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that it was a religious and national
obligation of all Iranians to vote. He also recommended the
nation not to leave the voting until late hours.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman Refutes US on Chemical Companies' Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China is resolutely opposed to the
United States imposing sanctions on Chinese companies and persons
pursuant to its domestic law, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen
Guofang stated here today.
</P>
<P>
China demands that the US side cancel the sanctions
immediately, Shen said, noting that such sanctions are totally
groundless.
</P>
<P>
The US announced on Thursday that it will impose sanctions on
two Chinese mainland companies and five Chinese citizens for the
proliferation of chemical weapons pursuant to its domestic law.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that China earnestly performs its obligations as a
signatory of the Chemical Weapons Convention and guarantees the
attainment of the purpose and objectives of the convention,
including the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of
chemical weapons and the promotion of international trade and
scientific and technological exchange in the chemical industry to
turn achievements in chemistry into substantial benefits for
humankind.
</P>
<P>
He said that China opposes the development of chemical weapons
by any country, let alone assist any other country in developing
such weapons. China exercises export controls over sensitive
chemical products and relevant equipment and technology in strict
accordance with the schedules and stipulations of the Chemical
Weapons Convention. It does not export any chemical products or
the technology and equipment for turning out such products, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that relevant regulations of the convention
guarantee the smooth process of normal international trade and
cooperation in the chemical industry. The trade activities that the
relevant Chinese companies and persons carried out in the chemical
industry are normal ones of international trade and in no way
violated the purposes and objectives of the Chemical Weapon
Convention, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that both China and the US are signatories of the
convention. They both are duty bound to strictly abide by the
obligations of the international law under the convention. They
should act completely and accurately in accordance with the
provisions of the convention, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China does not recognize that any country
has the right to place its domestic law above international law.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Advance Stalled by Opposing Shiite Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A massive offensive launched by
the Afghan Taliban militia was foiled by an opposing Shiite
faction, securing a strategic gateway to their stronghold,
according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The fierce assault on the Shibar pass, which guards the
entrance to Bamyan province, stronghold of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, has
left at least 100 Taliban fighters dead and hundreds more injured,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the provincial capital city of Bamyan, about 120
kilometers northwest of Kabul, confirmed that the Shiite faction
had inflicted heavy casualties on the Taliban, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who launched the offensive on Tuesday, had failed
to break defenses on the Shibar pass, which lies a mere 40
kilometers east of Bamyan, after four days of heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban sources in Kabul denied any heavy losses
at the front, claiming the militia were aiming at steady progress
over the pass and confident in the spread of pro-militia revolts
throughout the north.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the right-hand man of northern warlord Rashid
Dostum, Abdul Malik, defected to the Taliban's ranks, which
enabled the Taliban to shatter Dostum's western flank and sparked
similar revolts to the east.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Hezb-e Wahdat faction is allied to Dostum and the
ousted Afghan government. The alliance controls around a third of
the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia, who control at least two-thirds of
Afghanistan, have vowed to impose strict Islamic law on a war-torn
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Automobile Sales Expects 30 Percent Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The sales of cars and other
automobiles in Macao are expected to plunge 30 percent this year
following a 45 percent increase in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The import of light and heavy vehicles declined in the
first quarter of 1997 after a car tax increase starting from
January 1 this year, the Macao Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Last year's increase in sales of motor vehicles sales was
largely the result of the looming tax increase, prompting many
potential buyers to take action ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Macao imported a total of 5,420 light and heavy vehicles last
year, 95 percent of which were light ones. In last December
alone, Macao imported 523 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the lower- and middle-priced automobiles
will sell better than the luxury ones this year, while the price
of all will drop in general.
</P>
<P>
Cars made in Japan and South Korea will continue to dominate
the local market, and those luxury ones made in Europe will lose
share, the report said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Review Sanctions on Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Europeann Union (EU) is to
decide next month whether to prolong its sanctions against the
country.
</P>
<P>
The decision will be made at a meeting of EU foreign ministers,
and a European Commission (EC) delegation is visiting Nigeria to
prepare ground for the meeting, according to press reports today.
</P>
<P>
A EU release was quoted as saying on Thursday that the
seven-day visit is mainly aimed at exploring available channels
for improving dialogue between the two sides and obtaining an
on-the-ground assessment of Nigeria's transition to civil rule
program.
</P>
<P>
The EU sanctions came in the wake of the execution of nine
minority activists in Nigeria in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include an arms embargo, visa restrictions for
members of the Provisional Ruling Council and the Federal
Executive Council and their families, a suspension of cooperation
involving an aid of about 235 million U.S. Dollars and a sports
boycott.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which arrived in Nigeria last Monday, is led
by Tim Clarke, acting head of the unit responsible for Benin,
Togo, Niger and Nigeria at the EC in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
After a series of high-level talks with the Nigerian
government, Clarke said on Thursday that the EC has observed that
there have not been transparency in several aspects of the
transition process.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is scheduled to end its tour on Sunday. enditem

<HEADLINE> IFC Wants to Expand Chinese Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) said it intends to expand business in China and
is interested in making investments in the underdeveloped inland
areas, a company official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"China is a large emerging market and IFC's business in China
has just begun," Davin Mackenzie, chief of the international
financial organization's resident mission in China, told Xinhua in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
China's effort to reform its state-owned enterprises and the
rapid growth of the non-state sector have offered new
opportunities for IFC to increase its presence in China, Mackenzie
said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that China will account for an increasingly bigger
proportion in IFC's business portfolio," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the largest multilateral source to extend loans to and raise
funds for the non-state sector of developing economies, IFC is
willing to make investments in and raise funds for projects in
China's inland provinces and regions, the chief said, noting that
currently the bulk of overseas investment in China goes to the
more-developed coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
China's endeavor to develop a market economy over the past ten
or more years has made it the country where IFC has posted the
fastest increase in investment, Mackenzie noted.
</P>
<P>
IFC data show that the corporation has since 1985 invested
nearly one billion US dollars in 30 Chinese projects and helped
raise even more funds from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1956 as a member of the World Bank Group, IFC now
has a total of 168 member countries, including China.

<HEADLINE> Rajesh Pilot Wants to Be Indian Congress' New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- India's former union minister and
senior leader of the Congress Party Rajesh Pilot today formally
declared his candidature for the party's new president.
</P>
<P>
"I will contest the election for the party's presidentship,
slated for early next month, and I will also come out with an
agenda in the next few days to revitalize the party and restore
inner-party democracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission has set a deadline of June 15 for the
Congress to complete the party's organizational elections. The
election of the party's new president is scheduled on June 9. The
present Congress chief is Sitaram Kesri, who is also expected to
try retaining his present post.
</P>
<P>
The congress has been deeply divided over several major
national issues. Kesri has been trying to reunite all factions in
the party but he failed.
</P>
<P>
"Only a party president who is empowered with an election
mandate and consequently the moral authority, can regain the lost
prestige and also build the party's image," Pilot said adding that
many hard decisions needed to be taken by the Congress at this
juncture.
</P>
<P>
Four MPs who announced Pilot's candidature for the party's
presidentship Thursday, said that the Congress had "touched its
lowest ebb" in recent times and claimed that Pilot with his clean
record and acceptability among all sections of society was ideally
suited to galvanize the party at the grassroots.

according to the Basic Law to advise the Chief Executive on
judicial appointments.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that the Chief Executive must obtain
the endorsement of the Legislative Council on the appointment of
the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal.
</P>

LUSAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has set up a
team to probe the import of outdated cellular telephone equipment
worth 8.5 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Telephone Company (ZAMTEL) purchased an analogue
cellular telephone equipment from the United States instead of a
more modern digital machine through a questionable tender which
reportedly gave the U.S. supplier advantage.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted sources as saying that the team
wondered why the ZAMTEL bought the equipment which is being
phased out in developed nations even when there are better offers
from German, Japan, Britain and France. enditem

<HEADLINE> HK Faces Challenges in Managing Its Success: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- In spite of all the ups and downs
in the past years, the situation in Hong Kong by now can be
described as "surprisingly good" to pessimists and "not
unexpected" to those who have always believed in Hong Kong's
resilience, a Hong Kong government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Acting Financial Secretary Rafael Hui made the remarks when
addressing the opening ceremony of the Money World Asia - Hong
Kong '97, which featured a wide array of financial services and
money-related products.
</P>
<P>
This does not mean that Hong Kong has no more problems to face
but new challenges are rather different from what pessimists had
in mind about Hong Kong, he noted.
</P>
<P>
For example, one of the challenges is how to "put our resources
to the best possible use," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
"When the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
government inaugurates five weeks from now, it would be one of the
richest governments in the world with an estimated total reserves
exceeding 78 billion US dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another challenge concerns a growing population -- a
combination of returnees from overseas as well as immigrants from
the Chinese mainland. "The challenge for us is to ensure not only
that their needs are attended to, but they also have the
opportunities to give their best to the further development of
Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hui recalled that when he spoke at the first Money World Asia
exhibition last year he predicted "business as usual" for Hong
Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Given the events and developments in the past 12 months, I can
confidently say that the same outlook is still very much valid --
it will be business as usual after the inauguration of the HKSAR,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, our focus is no longer set on what happens on June 30
or July 1, but much beyond that," he concluded.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Inflow of Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) reached 132 million U.S. Dollars in Zambia last year,
according to ANGLO American Managing Director Anderson Mazoka.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia newspaper today quoted Mazoka as saying
that 1997 is likely to be another good year for Zambian economy,
although the prolonged heavy rains early in the year suggested
that agricultural growth will be slower than 1996.
</P>
<P>
Zambia desperately needs more investments in infrastructure
and skills-upgrading so as to compete with some of its neighbors
with better infrastructure and stronger skills base, said Mazoka.
</P>
<P>
The infusion of new management and capital will reverse the
decline in the country in recent years, said Mazoka.
</P>
<P>
He said the privatization of copper mining industry marked a
"watershed" for the Zambian economy.
</P>
<P>
The full impact of privatization of the copper mining industry
will not be felt until the next century, he predicted. enditem

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Plunges Following Cash Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar today shed
almost 1.5 US cents after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)
surprised the financial markets by cutting its official cash rate.
</P>
<P>
News that the TBA had cut its rate to 5.5 percent from 6.0
percent shocked the foreign exchange market, where many investors
had expected interest rates to remain steady.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar recorded a startling 1.49 US cent fall,
losing more than one US cent within minutes of the announcement,
and closing local trade today at 76.79 US cents, down from 78.28
US cents late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers are concerned that offshore investors
will offload the currency tonight, now that official rates here
are at the same level of those in the U.S., reducing the relative
attraction of Australian securities.
</P>
<P>
Analyst Glenn Bull said dealers he had surveyed had said they
were concerned the Australian dollars would be "slammed" overnight
by U.S. investors.
</P>
<P>
Mathew Jeremy, another expert, said the currency was
technically vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
Based on the price of commodities, the Australian dollar was
undervalued against the U.S. unit, Jeremy added.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed locally at 88.95 Japanese yen from
90.54 yen and at 1.2983 German marks from 1.3273 marks.

NEW DELHI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A big fire broke out at the
Lajpatrai market in the walled city of New Delhi today, destroying
electrical goods and other properties, Fire Brigade sources said.
</P>
<P>
At least ten shops were completely gutted in the fire and two
three-storeyed buildings collapsed, yet there have been no reports
of any casualty so far.
</P>
<P>
Clearing operations are still going on. It took over four hours

<HEADLINE> Afghan Warlord, Taliban Hold Separate Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Afghanistan's
northern warlord Rashid Dostum have held talks with leader of the
rebel forces Abdul Malik, a local newspaper reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which are likely to give a new turn to the
prevailing Afghan situation, were aimed at securing reconciliation
between Dostum and Malik, who has emerged as a serious threat to
the presence of the former in the north, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no details about the talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said, a high-level delegation of the
Taliban also have held discussions with Malik in Maimana, capital
of the northwestern province of Faryab where the former Dostum's
senior commander defected to the Islamic student militia early
this week.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban claimed that they had reached an understanding with
Malik and were supporting the rebel troops in their advance
towards Dostum-held areas, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The defection of Malik allowed the Taliban to have made major
gains in northern Afghanistan after almost six-month stalemate.
</P>
<P>
But Malik has so far not allowed the Taliban to enter any of
the two provinces controlled by him, the report quoted independent
Afghan sources as saying.

<HEADLINE> India Likely to Suggest Reduction in Quota from Women' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is likely
to suggest a reduction in the quota from the present 33 percent
reservation for women in parliament to 15 or 20 percent, a
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Given the strong opposition by various 13-party United Front
(UF) constituents to the Women's Reservation Bill in its present
form, Prime Minister I.K. Gujral is likely to place this
suggestion at the forthcoming meeting of the UF Steering Committee
on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Deve Gowda had first mooted the proposal
for a reduced quota when he encountered stiff opposition to the
Bill.
</P>
<P>
This suggestion, however, did not gain much ground as it was
rejected outright by women parliamentarians who did not want any
dilution in the 33 percent quota.
</P>
<P>
This matter is slated to figure prominently at the Steering
Committee meeting particularly in view of the snowballing
controversy over the Bill which has created fissures between the
various UF constituents and within the Janata Dal (JD), the major
constituent of the UF.
</P>
<P>
The Left parties, who are pressing hard for the passage of the
Bill and have taken an unequivocal stand on the issue, are getting
ready to grill the government, particularly since it was decided
by all at the last Steering Committee meeting to go ahead with the
Bill as suggested by the Joint Select Committee of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, there is a growing clamor from various UF parties for
reservation for women from Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and
minorities ever since JD leader Sharad Yadav denounced the Bill in
its present form and made a case for the inclusion of OBCs women.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the UF parties, the other major parties such as the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main opposition party in the
Parliament, as well as the Congress Party have also developed
different views over the Women's Bill.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak to Meet Netanyahu in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will
meet with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu Tuesday in
Sharm el-Sheik, an Egyptian Red Sea resort.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to exchange views on means to further the
Middle East peace process and to advance solutions to the present
crisis, the Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was decided during the second phone talks between
Mubarak and Netanyahu Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, in his earlier phone conversations with Netanyahu,
expressed sorrow over the frozen peace process and emphasizing the
importance of finding a way out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier told Mubarak during his earlier call that
he agrees with him on the necessity to present and exchange ideas
for the sake of propelling the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In a rare gesture to solicit Egypt's mediating role, Netanyahu
urged Mubarak to continue his "positive political peace efforts"
in a message he entrusted with Egyptian Ambassador to Israel
Mohamed Bassyouni Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The telephone contacts between Mubarak and Netanyahu came
following phone talks between Mubarak and Israeli President Ezer
Weizman who had decided to come to Egypt to meet the Egyptian
president in a few days on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president is also expected to visit Jordan
Saturday for talks with King Hussein on the latest development in
the region, apparently to coordinate stance before meeting the
Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has recently proposed a six-month freeze on the
construction of Israeli Jewish settlements until negotiations open
on the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process came to a halt after Israel
started construction of new Jewish housing project in Arab East
Jerusalem in March.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Nateq-Nouri, Favorite of Conservatives in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, who has
headed the 270-seat Iranian Parliament for five years, is one of
the front-runners of Iran's 7th presidential elections which are
being held today throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri declared his willingness to run for presidency a
year ago. He has pledged to follow the policies of outgoing
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the Second Five-Year
Development Plan (1995-1999), on which the country's economic
planning is based.
</P>
<P>
But unlike Rafsanjani, he is in favor of accelerating
privatization instead of the government-controlled
industrialization process.
</P>
<P>
He has based his election campaign on generating employment
for the youth and harnessing inflation. Given Iran's large young
population and the prevalence of unemployment among them,
Nateq-Nouri is trying to win their favor with promises of
employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
As to his foreign policy, Nateq-Nouri just follows the order
by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and maintains that Iran
should have normal relations with all countries except the United
States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri had criticized Rafsanjani's administration for
pushing ahead with the development programs at the expense of the
poor and attempting to resume relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The heavily-bearded and white turbaned clergyman now faces strong
challenge from his rival Seyed Mohammad Khatami, former cultural
and Islamic guidance minister.
</P>
<P>
Most political analysts say "If it was three months ago, I
would say Nateq-Nouri would win. But it is hard to predict who
will win today."
</P>
<P>
Many people, especially the intellectual circles, university
students and professors and the middle class in big cities,
dislike Nateq-Nouri because of his hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri is indeed a favorite of the conservative camp
called the Association of Combatant Clergymen (ACC) and backed
by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
ACC has a majority in the 270-seat Parliament and supports
Nateq-Nouri with its allies. He has also been backed by most
influential Ayatollahs and other senior clergyman of the
prestigious Association of Qom Seminary Teachers.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Nateq-Nouri is a key player in the Islamic
government. He was born in 1943 in the coastal city of Nur in
Mazandaran province on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. He
began his theological studies in one of Islamic seminaries in
Tehran at the age of 15. He transferred to the theological
school in the religious city of Qom in 1960 and completed
advanced theological courses there.
</P>
<P>
In 1965, he was admitted to the School of Theology of Tehran
University and completed there his BA course in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
He has eight girls, and is an avid sportsman, enjoying
horseback riding, skiing and mountain climbing. He is also known
for his good sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Islamic movement, Nateq-Nouri played an
important role in combating the former Shah since the 1960s. He
was also a member of the influential "Welcome Committee," put in
place ahead of the Islamic Revolution to organize the mass
demonstrations which destabilized the regime of the defunct Shah
and prepared the return of late spiritual leader Ayatollah
Ruhullah Khomeini in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri served as interior minister in the cabinet of
former prime minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi from 1982 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
He became Speaker of the Parliament in 1992 and was reelected
in 1996. He has led with a firm hand the powerful conservative
faction.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Khatami, New Star in Iranian Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Seyed Mohammad Khatami, who had
been obscure from Tehran's political arena for four years,
today turns into one of two major candidates for 32 million
eligible voters to choose as Iran's next president.
</P>
<P>
The competition between Khatami and his arch rival Parliament
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri is so tense and close that
most of politicians feel hard to predict the final result of
the ballot boxes over the country.
</P>
<P>
This is a miracle for the 54-year clergy to gain so
much popularity and support in the 62-million populated Moslem
country in a time less than four months.
</P>
<P>
What is the myth for his successful presidential campaign?
The answer is simple.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is the new idol of millions of intellectuals
ranging from professors, artists, university students, government
employees to the middle class in big cities for his moderate
image of being open-minded, well-educated, tolerant to different
views, kind and honest with clean background.
</P>
<P>
Although Khatami is a black-turbaned clergy which means that he is
descending from the lineage of the prophet of Islam, Khatami
is widely regarded as a liberal clergy who helped the growth
of Iranian cinema, literature and press with his liberal
policies while he was the minister of culture and Islamic
guidance.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is crowned with BA and MA degree in philosophy and
speaks three foreign languages of English, German and Arabic.
He has so far published two books entitled The Fear of
Wave and From the World of City to City of World. He has
also written a book on political thought among Muslims, which
is ready for publication.
</P>
<P>
The son of the late well-known Ayatollah Ruhollah Khatami
(former Friday prayer leader of the city of Yazd) is currently the
advisor to President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and head of the
National Library.
</P>
<P>
Declaring his candidacy for the 7th Iranian presidential
elections on January 29, Khatami has been nominated by the two
political groups -- the left wing called the Society of Combatant
Clergymen (SCC) and the pro-Rafsanjani technocrat group called G-6.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is believed to follow the same policies as
Rafsanjani but has promised reforms on controversial issues such
as freedom of the press and literature, women's rights and
effective solutions for the problems of the youth.
</P>
<P>
"Freedom under the Constitution and rules of the law in
the civic society" is his motto, which attracts more and more
educated people who seek to have more freedom and social
justice under the Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Addressing university students at Tehran University early this
month, he said, "The government should provide a safe
environment for the people so that they may express their
opinion on internal issues and economic affairs."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on development and reconstruction in the country,
Khatami said, "We should study the West, a foundation of all
transformations ... and analyze the developments according to
Islamic values."
</P>
<P>
As to his foreign policy, he said, "Iran is an independent
country capable of recognizing its own interests" and willing to
have normal relations with any country that accepts these basic
principles.
</P>
<P>
He even holds critical attitude toward the present foreign
policy, noting "Iran should not get involved in matters that
cause international friction and should refrain from actions that
may create such an impression."
</P>
<P>
"We would like the international community to be free of
any friction, and we are fully prepared to use the Islamic
Republic's good offices to remove any tension within the world
community," added the presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
However, local observers analyzed that Khatami is a good
professor and decent man but he is not a wise politician or
powerful statesman.
</P>
<P>
In comparison to his rival, Khatami is inexperienced on
international issues and his lack of management was also
witnessed during his ministerial years.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who is father of a son and two girls, was born
in 1943 and raised in the dry and arid city of Yazd. After
graduation from high school, he left Yazd for the religious
city of Qom to pursue Islamic studies at the theological
school there.
</P>
<P>
In 1965, he transferred from Qom to Isfahan in central Iran to
study philosophy at Isfahan University and received a BA degree
from there. He also continued his advanced theological studies at
 the theological school in Isfahan.
</P>
<P>
He continued his graduate studies in philosophy in Tehran
and received his MA degree from Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, he went to Hamburg, Germany, to run the Islamic
center there.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, after the victory of the Islamic revolution,
Khatami was elected by the Ardakan and Meybod constituencies to
the Islamic Consultative Assembly (parliament). In 1980, he was
appointed by late spiritual leader Khomeini as head of Keyhan
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was appointed as minister of culture and Islamic
guidance in the cabinet of former prime minister Mir-Hossein
Mousavi in 1982. He held the portfolio for almost 10 years,
three years of which he served in the cabinet of President
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
He was sacked by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei because
he was labeled as "a liberal-minded minister" and not close
enough to the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
However, Khatami was appointed by Khamenei as member of the
Supreme Council for Cultural Revolution early this year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Climbers Conquer Mount Qomolangma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Two Malaysian climbers today
conquered Mount Qomolangma, the world's highest peak by pitching
their national flag on the top.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians M. Magendran and N. Mohandas became national heroes
when they succeeded in reaching the 8,848-meter summit this
afternoon after braving thick snow and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
Mohandas works for a Private Limited while Magendran is a
teacher in Klang, about 33 kilometers southwest of here.
</P>
<P>
The duo, who are members of the Malaysian Climbing Association,
are part of 20 climbers who attempted to scale the mountain in
their first attempt.
</P>
<P>
The expedition "Project Malaysia-Everest '97" is the
brainchild of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who
launched it on June 4 last year.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir handed over the Malaysian flag to the climbers on
February 28 this year, a day before they left for Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Pak Gas Reserves to Start Diminishing after 2008: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Petroleum Minister
Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan warned here today that the country's gas
reserves would start diminishing after 2008.
</P>
<P>
But the government was taking measures to tackle the situation,
Ali Khan said in a speech delivered to the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said that as part of the government's plan to import gas,
work on a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan would begin at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
"A Memorandum of Understanding with Turkmensitan has been
reached," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the import of gas from abroad, local exploration would
be encouraged, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The strike rate in Pakistan is the best in the world. On an
average we hit gas well after drilling 2.5 wells. While in the
rest of the world the success rate is one after eleven wells," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, there was very little machinery for exploration
manufactured in the country. The money spent on the import of
machinery for exploration and development of oil and natural gas
during 1996 was around 129 million U.S. dollars, according to the
minister.

<HEADLINE> Reserve Bank of Australia Announces Interest Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA) announced today it had decided to cut the official interest
rate to 5.50 percent from 6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Following consideration at the board meeting earlier in the
month, the bank will operate in the money market today to reduce
the cash rate from 6.0 percent to 5.5 percent," RBA said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Underlying inflation in Australia has been about two percent
over the past year, and the bank's assessment is that it will fall
below two percent in coming quarters," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The cut is the fourth one in the past year.
</P>
<P>
In response to the cut, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd
moved today to guard its position as the country's biggest home
loan lender, slicing 0.5 percent from its standard variable
interest rate and announcing cuts to its suite of business loans.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth's decision to take the knife to its lending
rates is certain to prompt a wave of cuts from its major
competitors in the home loan market while casting further doubt on
bank profitability as margins contract, the Australian Associated
Press said in a report.
</P>
<P>
David Bassanese, a senior economist with Bankers Trust,
described the interest rate cut as a surprise to the market.
</P>
<P>
"We thought there was a chance they could move in the next few
months... I think the economy deserves it," the economist said.
</P>
<P>
Economist John Edwards said the cut gives greater assurance
that Australia will get 4.0 percent growth by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The federal government forecast earlier this month in a
proposed budget for 1997-1998 that the economic growth will be
3.75 percent while the inflation rate will remain at two percent.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Tourism Industry Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- By using its unique ethnic folk
life and fascinating landscape, southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region attracted 105,000 overseas tourists during the
slack first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented an increase of 28.7 percent over the
same period last year, according to the Regional Department of the
Tourism.
</P>
<P>
Regional tourism officials attribute the boom to the growing
interest in the region's colorful ethnic culture. The southwestern
part of the region is not only home to the Zhuang people, but also
11 other ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
While most tourists go to Guilin to enjoy the "most beautiful
rivers and mountains in the world," an increasing number want to
go to newly-opened but well-furnished Miao and Yao villages for
the ethnic charm.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Fangchenggang and Dongxing City on the
Sino-Vietnamese border, which are home to the Jing people, had
eight tourists per capita, the highest in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of the year, Dongxing had 100,000
tourist per month. Last year, the city had about 800,000 tourists,
bringing it 240 million yuan (28.91 million US dollars),
accounting for a third of the city's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Rongshui Miao Autonomous County in the northern part of Guangxi
had 639,000 tourists from 1991 to 1995 and earned over 19 million
yuan in tourism income, increasing the per capita income of the
local people from 200 yuan to 1,200 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Boom In North China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The real estate business in this
major industrial city of north China, which had been sluggish for
three years, is picking up again with higher sales of vacant
houses and a marginal increase in the housing prices.
</P>
<P>
According to one local source, house sales in the city have
climed monthly since last September, with best performance for
apartments, which are sold at around 2,500 yuan per sq m.
</P>
<P>
In the Huayuan Residential Area, a total of 1,300 flats were
sold within the eight-month period, 80 percent of available
housing.
</P>
<P>
In some districts near the downtown area, as much as 85 percent
of the housing has been sold.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the renovation of old houses, the
housing reform, and the housing fund-collection system have played
a role in improving the city's real estate market.
</P>
<P>
The city has put aside one billion yuan for a public housing
fund and mortgage application procedures have been greatly
simplified, a move that helped the housing market.

BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong and Hunan provinces and
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southern China have
successfully waged an war against pollution, which ended in

to close.
</P>
<P>
The factories include small paper mills with annual production
of less than 5,000 tons, small tanneries, coking plants using
outdated production methods, and other factories causing serious
pollution.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the decree is implemented, the State Bureau of
Environmental Protection (SBEP) and the Supervision Ministry
conducted a nationwide inspection last month.
</P>
<P>
Lu Huangsheng, of SBEP and the head of the Guangxi, Guangdong
and Hunan team, said that on the whole, governments in the three
areas have done a good job in implementing the state's
environmental protection policies.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhao Qinghai, an official with the Supervision
Ministry and a team member, said that some governments care merely
for short-term results, and interfere with the law enforcement
work of environmental protection departments.
</P>
<P>
"Some even change the state's environment policies at will," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the local governments have been urged to make
immediate corrections and report to them on a certain date.
</P>
<P>
The team has inspected nearly 20 cities and counties.

<HEADLINE> Drug Addiction on Rise in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has found 134,000 drug
addicts including students and pupils, a government report
revealed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report released by the Vietnam National Drug Control
Program said that among the drug addicts, 60 percent are in
mountain regions and the rest in urban and delta areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone, 3,850 drug-related cases were uncovered with
6,650 persons charged with producing, trafficking and using of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1995, drug-related cases increased by 48.9
percent and the number of offenders by 66.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, drug traffickers even established ties with
government drug control agents.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the seriousness of the problem in the country,
Vietnam has made drug control the most important task in its
anti-social evils campaign.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, eight persons were given death sentences
and another eight, life imprisonment, in the trial of the
country's largest drug trafficking case.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Kind of Crisis Unlikely to Occur in Asia Pacific Region: IMF Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican kind of currency
crisis is not likely to happen in the Asia Pacific, despite the
crisis last week with the Thai currency baht, an International
Monetary Fund (IMF) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing on the Spring 1997 issue of the IMF's World
Economic Outlook, Graham Hacche, Chief of the World Economic
Studies Division of the IMF, said, "It is difficult to imagine the
Mexican kind of crisis happening here in the region".
</P>
<P>
He noted that the economic fundamentals are so much stronger,
the levels of savings and investments are higher, current account
deficits are generally smaller than they were in Mexico, and the
importance of short-term borrowing, external borrowing, is less
than was the case in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the levels of foreign reserve are higher than
those in Mexico. "And for all these reasons, I think that it is
very difficult to imagine the Mexico kind of crisis occurring in
this region" he said.
</P>
<P>
In the newly-released World Economic Outlook, the IMF projected
that the economic growth of the developing countries in Asia would
be 8.3 percent for 1997 and 7.7 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The IMF official said that though the projected growth
represented some kind of moderation, compared to the 8.9 percent
in 1995, it is still much higher than the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
As for the Newly Industrialized Asian Economies, their growth
is projected to be 5.7 percent for this year and 6.1 percent for
the next year.
</P>
<P>
The World Economic Outlook is a biannual publication, prepared
for the IMF/World Bank Interim Committee and Annual Meetings. And
the projections and analysis in the World Economic Outlook form an
integral part of the IMF's ongoing surveillance of economic
developments and policies in its 181 member economies and of the
global economic system.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Urged to Move Against Lifting Ivory Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) has
asked the government to move swiftly to unite other wildlife-rich
African nations to oppose a proposal for the re-introduction of
ivory trade.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today quoted KWS Director David Western as
saying that until a mechanism was in place to effectively control
poaching, there should not be any trade now.
</P>
<P>
He told a one-day workshop held here on Thursday that "our
position is very firm and we are in a more solid position this
time than ever before."
</P>
<P>
The workshop was designed to map out Kenya's stand at a
meeting of the U.N. Convention of International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES) scheduled for Harare, Zimbabwe, next
month.
</P>
<P>
At the workshop, John Waithaka, Head of the Elephant Species
Program at the KWS, gave statistics showing that the ban in ivory
trade had drastically reduced poaching.
</P>
<P>
He said that between 1970 and 1989, the elephant population in
Kenya had declined from 130,000 to 20,000, an average loss of
about 20,000 elephants every year.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, since the ban took effect in 1989, an
average 34 elephants have been killed each year and the
population has increased by more than 6,000.
</P>
<P>
The price of the tusks has also plummeted from 300 U.S.
Dollars a kilogram in 1989 to about three Dollars at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official noted that "the ivory ban has worked and
we want to maintain the same position -- placing the elephant
under Appendix I."
</P>
<P>
Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe have proposed to CITES to have
the elephant downlisted to enable them dispose of their ivory
stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
The elephant is among 2,000 species placed under the Appendix
I classification of the CITES.
</P>
<P>
About 141 CITES members are expected at the meeting while 38
African nations are considered elephant range countries.

<HEADLINE> Preferential Policies For Overseas Investors In Southeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China's coastal city of Fuzhou in
Fujian Province has developed new preferential measures to
encourage more overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
These include rebates for the past few years for
overseas-funded enterprises established after April 1, 1996, the
executive vice-mayor Gong Xiong said.
</P>
<P>
Key overseas-funded enterprises in the petrochemical industry,
and in electronics, machinery, building materials, forestry,
aquatic products, light industries, textiles, and tourism will be
exempt from income tax for the first two years, and the paid
income tax in the third to fifth year will be returned, and 50
percent of the paid income tax will be refunded for another five
years.
</P>
<P>
Value-added tax will be refunded in the cases of special
key projects like enterprises applying advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises approved after April 1, 1996, with
an investment of more than 10 million US dollars, will be allowed
to pay land-use fees in installments for two years, while
high-tech agricultural development projects may be exempt from
other land-related fees.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded infrastructure or key industrial projects can
have five years of free land use right and more preferential
land-use prices will be granted to those which develop wasteland,
baren hillsides and beaches.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises will be allowed to set up
investment companies when they have three companies or
subsidiaries in China, or have invested more than 30 million US
dollars in China.
</P>
<P>
And another concession is that the city will treat overseas
businesses the same as Chinese companies, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Imported Technology Bringing Efficiency to Chinese Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Imported technology is helping make
some stagnant state-owned enterprises better in north China's
Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The Shanxi Vinylon Works, for example, had record pre-tax
profits of 90 million yuan last year thanks to an imported acetic
acid ethylene synthetic reactor.
</P>
<P>
Experts had managed to adapt their old equipment to the
imported equipment, and as a result, they launched 15 key
technological improvement projects, and developed more than 40
types of products.
</P>
<P>
A white emulsion was one of their outstanding accomplishments,
with a quality that is reported to have surpassed international
standards.
</P>
<P>
Technological innovations have added 130 million yuan in fixed
assets to the factory, and have resulted in 250 million yuan in
output value over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi is the largest coal producer of China and has taken the
lead in improving its coal production conditions by using imported
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Eight key state mining enterprises there produce 200 million
tons of coal annually, accounting for a seventh of the national
total. The number of fatalities on the job site in the process of
producing one million tons of coal are less than one, and in some
mines, there were none reported in the process of cutting 10
million tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
The Changzhi Machine Tool Plant, which previously only produced
one product and was running at a loss, imported a steel forming
machine technology in the early 1990s, and has become the largest
producer of steel forming machinery in Asia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua)-- A book commemorating Deng Xiaoping's
historical contributions to the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland published by the Contemporary World Publishing House
has hit the bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
The 330,000-Chinese-character book, "Deng Xiaoping and Hong
Kong", contains historical material on the significance of Deng's
great "one country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
It reviews a century of Hong Kong's history and describes how
Deng traveled to Hong Kong five times in his life. It tells of how
Hong Kong was ceded to the British, how Chiang Kai-shek lost the
chance to recover Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, the
background of the "long-term planning and making full use of Hong
Kong" policy pursued by Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and other Chinese
leaders of the older generation, the difficult process of
negotiating with the British government, and China's solemn and
staunch stand on the Hong Kong issue.
</P>

The book is intended to help the public understand Deng's
patriotic sentiments, his breadth of vision, his courage and
wisdom, and his personal characteristic of seeking truth from
facts and handling affairs in a decisive manner, one of the book's
editors said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rejects Israel's Joining in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
has rejected Israel's participation in a proposed Cairo-based
Middle East development bank, saying the U.S.-backed idea mooted
two years ago "will never see the light of day".
</P>
<P>
"We are not enthusiastic about the idea. Although Egypt has
won approval to have the bank's headquarters in Cairo, this is not
enough," the Lebanese prime minister was quoted by the Daily Star,
the only English daily published in Beirut, Friday morning as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Israel will want to maintain the upper hand
and have a say in any loan or assistance which may be requested by
a Arab member," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese premier's statement came in an open dialogue last
night with hundreds of participants in the third conference of the
Arab capital markets, which is currently held in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not wish to predict the future, but "I think
this proposed bank will never see the light of day".
</P>
<P>
Hariri drew loud applause when he said that Lebanon would
boycott the Middle East and North African Economic Conference
scheduled to be held in Doha in November with Israel's presence.
</P>
<P>
"We had rejected the previous conferences held in Morocco,
Amman and Cairo because the purpose of these gatherings is to
create a development institution for the post-war era in the
Middle East," he said.
</P>
<P>
Refuting speculation that the stalemate in Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations would lead to a new war in the region, Hariri
said: "There are no indications that there will be a war against
Lebanon or any other country. I say this after my contacts with
world leaders."
</P>
<P>
"Israel is being blamed for interrupting the peace
process. But moving from a stalemate to a military conflagration
is a big jump and is out of the question," the prime minister
underlined.
</P>
<P>
"An Arab-Israeli war needs a green light from the big powers
and no superpower is in such a frame of mind," Hariri said. "They
are all working to revive the peace process, albeit not
successfully, or may be not doing enough."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the situation in south Lebanon, the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict where Lebanese Muslim
guerrillas are fighting the Israeli occupation, the Lebanese
leader ruled out a major confrontation there.
</P>
<P>
He said that thanks to the mobilization of the international
community after Israel's April 1996 blitz on Lebanon, "the
situation in the south has been contained and under control."
</P>
<P>
Hariri urged the Arabs "not to link their own development to
the peace process," insisting he never linked the reconstruction
and development drive, which he launched when coming to power in
1992. to regional developments.

HARARE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and South Africa have
reached agreement on reducing tariffs on some products by
reinstating tariff preferences for agricultural and animal
products under a trade accord in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The 1964 accord was adversely affected by changes to South
Africa's overall tariff structures in 1992.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference Thursday, Zimbabwe's Minister of
Industry and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira and his South Africa
counterpart Alec Erwin described the new agreement as a
breakthrough on trade tariffs.
</P>
<P>
It is following bilateral meetings between Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe and South African President Nelson
Mandela during the week.
</P>
<P>
The list of the items whose tariffs are reduced under the
agreement will be published very soon.
</P>
<P>
However, the implementation of tariff preferences could be
slightly delayed because citrus and tobacco products, the two
outstanding items, have to be further consulted with relevant
industries.
</P>
<P>
South Africa expressed fear that a fungus disease which had
affected citrus trees in Zimbabwe could spread to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
A team of experts has been appointed to investigate the extent
of the disease at local plantations and further discussions on
the issue have been lined up for early next month.
</P>
<P>
On tobacco, Erwin said Zimbabwe had requested an increase in
the preferential quota of exports and the issue had been referred
to South African Minister of Agriculture Erek Hannekom for
further consultations.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the two countries reached another agreement on
textiles and clothing. enditem

<HEADLINE> More Effective Therapies Needed to Cure AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Human beings still need to go
through a long and hard process before the HIV/AIDS can be
eliminated, said a renowned Chinese-American scientist.
</P>
<P>
"The new 'Cocktail' therapies for AIDS has not put an end to my
studies in therapies for AIDS," Doctor David Da-i Ho, the inventor
of the therapies told a local press conference, when he was
visiting his hometown in central China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
"The therapies can kill 99 percent of the HIV virus in the
patients' blood during the first two weeks, but it is very
difficult to get rid of the rest of it," Doctor Ho said, adding
that more effective therapies are still needed.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was made after a two-year experiment of using
the new therapies on eight AIDS/HIV patients. The results of the
experiment was published in the British science magazine "Nature".
</P>
<P>
Ho has also found that the HIV virus can only be killed after
two to three years' of continuous treatment with the therapies.
</P>
<P>
The new therapies, also called the "cocktail of hope," combine
one of the three protease inhibitors -- saquinavir, ritonavir and
indinavir -- with older AIDS drugs such as AZT, DDI, DDC, 3TC and
D4T.
</P>
<P>
Protease inhibitors can disable HIV when used with other
drugs. But their prohibitive prices, up to 10,000 US dollars a
year, restricts their use to the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 percent of new HIV infections occur in the developing
world where few could afford the drugs.
</P>
<P>
"I will do my best to invent a vaccine for HIV and develop
cheaper drugs to treat the disease," Doctor Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Ho won his doctorate at the Harvard University and began his
studies in AIDS therapies 15 years ago. He was given the title of
"Man of the Year" by the American magazine, "Time", for the new
therapies he invented.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The mineral water industry is
developing rapidly in China, with its annual output topping 1.5
million tons.
</P>
<P>
China has 3,500 mineral water spots, and more than 900 mineral
water factories, according the Chinese Mineral Water Association.
</P>
<P>
The mineral water industry had been restricted to the coastal
areas in China until the early 1990s, when the country began to
develop the mineral water industry in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Henan Province, more than 120 places in 64
cities and counties have been developed to produce mineral water.
</P>
<P>
Some 51 factories, with a combined annual output of over
100,000 tons, have been built in 50 places in Zhengzhou and
Luoyang, the two largest cities in the province.
</P>
<P>
The quality of the mineral water produced by the domestic
manufacturers is also improving.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey, conducted last year showed that 94 percent of
the mineral water met the state-set standards, compared with 34
percent in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Modern Industry Becoming Part of Inner Mongolia's Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 23 (Xinhua) -- At the mere mention of the name
Inner Mongolia, the image that comes to many people's minds is one
of a vast grassland dotted with cattle and sheep.
</P>
<P>
However, economists in the region's capital say that this view
reflects the situation 50 years ago, but that now the traditional
animal husbandry has already given way to more modern industry.
</P>
<P>
One Mongolian economist says that animal husbandry, the
region's major sector for several centuries, accounted for six
percent of its economy in 1966, while industry and the service
trade accounted for 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
When the autonomous region was established 50 years ago, it was
a typical agricultural society, with no modern industry or trade
in its one million sq. km. of land. There were only small
factories for processing agricultural and animal husbandry
products. But in 1966, Inner Mongolia's GNP was 98.3 billion yuan
(about 19 billion US dollars), 49 times that of 1947.
</P>
<P>
Liu Di, an official with the regional government's Planning
Commission, says that the region's industry has had two surges in
the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1952, the beginning of China's first five-year development
plan, Inner Mongolia started building a number of modern
industries like the Baotou Iron and Steel Plant, the No.1 and
No. 2 Baotou machinery plants, the Baotou Thermal Plant, a textile
mill, and the Greater Hinggan Mountains' forestry base, laying a
foundation for industrial development.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the region began a second phase of industrial
development focusing on mineral resources and building a number of
large coal mines and large power stations.

</P>
<P>
Shenzhen plans to continue to be Hong Kong's main supplier of
food, and co-operation will continue in science and technology,
finance, commerce, trade, and real estate. The two sides will
clear up a number of transport obstacles and control the pollution
of the Shenzhen River.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen also plans to apply more international practices in
cooperation with Hong Kong, increase macro-economic controls, and
speed up the introduction of a legal framework, and forge a
relationship with Hong Kong on the basis of mutual benefit.

links with the outside world. In the past four years, Liu said,
the league has established 28 joint ventures with businessmen from
Japan, the US, the ROK, Singapore, and other countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
These ventures have got 120 million dollars in direct overseas
investment and the earlier ones have begun to show a profit, Liu

Inner Mongolia and has played a major role in its
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
The region now has more than 100,000 industrial enterprises
which employ more than two million workers.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago, the region had no more than 200,000 people in
urban areas, but rapid industrial development has lead to the
establishment of quite a number of cities. Inner Mongolia now has
20 cities and 68 towns and an urban population that accounts for
50 percent of its 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
It has 6,800 km of railways, 45,000 km of highways, and seven

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 23 (Xinhua)-- The Yellow-Huaihe-Haihe river
plain, the largest in China, has succeeded in turning 3.34 million
hectares of saline-alkali soil into more fertile land.
</P>
<P>
The plain covers 350,000 sq.km. of Hebei, Henan, Shandong,
Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, and the Beijing and Tianjin
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, central and local governments have
pooled funds to dig 730,000 wells on the plain, and since the
early 1980s, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has sent scientists
to set up a dozen experimental agriculture plots in Henan, Hebei
and Shandong.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists transformed 667 ha of low-yield farmland, raising
per ha grain output from 2,910 kg to 7,620 kg, and new agriculture
techniques like water-efficient irrigation, biological
insecticides, and the rational application of fertilizer have been
used in recent years.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the grain output in the plain accounted for 20
percent of the country's total last year and cotton output
accounted for 40 percent of China's total.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, China plans to raise its grain
output by 50 billion kg, 30 percent of which is expected to come
from the Yellow-Huaihe-Haihe river plain.

<HEADLINE> Rising Costs Take Their Toll on India's Steel Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Spiraling input costs, challenges
from imports, increasing domestic competition and slowdown in the
infrastructure and manufacturing sectors have resulted in a crisis
for Indian steel majors, industry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Rising costs of inputs such as coal and electricity, which
accounted for nearly 30 percent of the cost of steel production,
continued to inflate production costs in India as the
manufacturers tried to stay afloat in a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
While the prices of coal declined or marginally increased in
developed countries between 1980-90, coal prices in the country
had gone up by 27.5 percent last year. The situation is the same
in the power sector, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
While input costs kept spiraling, steel producers had to keep
the prices constant because of increasing competition from both
imports and indigenous manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
During 1996-97 alone, the hike in prices of petroleum products
was between 15 and 25 percent, while power became dearer by 10-12
percent and naphtha cost went up by 30 percent besides a 10-12
percent increase in railway freight.
</P>
<P>
This bind was taking its toll on the bottom line of steel
producers. In the first nine months of 1996-97 six infrastructure
industries recorded a growth of only 3.3 percent as against 9.3
percent in 1995-96. Due to slowdown in the growth of the
infrastructure sectors, the manufacturing sector showed signs of
deceleration during the first three quarters of the last financial
year.

<HEADLINE> Malawi, Tanzania Airlines Move to Beat Stiff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The national airlines of
Malawi and Tanzania are due to start joint air services so as to
enable them to beat the stiff competition in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The local paper the Guardian today quoted Air Malawi Sales
Manager Beatrice Malenga as saying that an accord to that effect
was reached following her corporation's recent purchase of a Boeing 737.
</P>
<P>
The venture would take off on June 1, this year and was
expected to enable the airlines to make more sub-continental
flights, Malenga said here on Thursday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Air Malawi currently flies to a number of cities in Africa,
including Johannesburg, Harare, Luanda, Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"The newly acquired Boeing will make our business expand enough
for us to remain competitive and could see us fly more routes",
Malenga stated.
</P>
<P>
She further said that they planned to go into joint vennture
agreements with the national airlines of more African countries if
the pact with Air Tanzania bore fruit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Malawi High Commissioner to Tanzania, Rev.
Peter Kaleso said that the Air Tanzania-Air Malawi accord would
make the two airlines more competitive, adding that Air Malawi
would soon introduce a second weekly flight from Lilongwe to
Dubai via Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Air Malawi has also picked Tanzania's Holiday Africa Tours and
Safaris Ltd its marketing and promotion agency, according to
Malenga.

<HEADLINE> India Likely to Suggest Reduction in Quota from Women' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is likely
to suggest a reduction in the quota from the present 33 percent
reservation for women in parliament to 15 or 20 percent, a
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Given the strong opposition by various 13-party United Front
(UF) constituents to the Women's Reservation Bill in its present
form, Prime Minister I.K. Gujral is likely to place this
suggestion at the forthcoming meeting of the UF Steering Committee
on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Deve Gowda had first mooted the proposal
for a reduced quota when he encountered stiff opposition to the
Bill.
</P>
<P>
This suggestion, however, did not gain much ground as it was
rejected outright by women parliamentarians who did not want any
dilution in the 33 percent quota.
</P>
<P>
This matter is slated to figure prominently at the Steering
Committee meeting particularly in view of the snowballing
controversy over the Bill which has created fissures between the
various UF constituents and within the Janata Dal (JD), the major
constituent of the UF.
</P>
<P>
The Left parties, who are pressing hard for the passage of the
Bill and have taken an unequivocal stand on the issue, are getting
ready to grill the government, particularly since it was decided
by all at the last Steering Committee meeting to go ahead with the
Bill as suggested by the Joint Select Committee of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, there is a growing clamor from various UF parties for
reservation for women from Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and
minorities ever since JD leader Sharad Yadav denounced the Bill in
its present form and made a case for the inclusion of OBCs women.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the UF parties, the other major parties such as the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main opposition party in the
Parliament, as well as the Congress Party have also developed
different views over the Women's Bill.

HAIKOU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The economic performance of South
China's island province of Hainan continued its upward movement
since 1995 after experiencing stagnation of previous years.
</P>
<P>
The province had 1.5 billion yuan in value-added industrial
output during the first four months of this year, a year-on-year
increase of 17.1 percent. Consumer retail sales amounted to 4.32
billion yuan, up 14.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Retail prices in April dropped 6.2 percentage points compared
to the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
The island province also has better prospects in agricultural
production, and is expected to have 820,000 tons of early rice,
1.85 million tons of fruits and vegetables, both up by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
Local economists attribute the good growth to an improved
economic structure. Priority has been given to tropical farming,
resource-intensive industries, and tourism-centered service

WELLINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A New Zealand expedition that
includes Tashi Tenzing, the grandson of one of the first two men
to climb Mount Qomolangma, reached the peak's summit on Friday,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30 climbers from six expeditions were expected to
conquer the world's tallest peak Friday.
</P>
<P>
After a week waiting for jet stream winds to abate, 34-year-old
New Zealand team leader Guy Cotter and his party left Camp Four on
the South Col under a full moon, wearing headlamps.
</P>
<P>
Nine hours later the group had reached the 8,848 meter
summit. After about 40 minutes at the peak and well ahead of
schedule, Cotter and his companions started their descent.
</P>
<P>
It was Cotter's second successful ascent of Qomolanmgma.
</P>
<P>
American Ed Viesturs made his fifth successful ascent,
equalling the late Rob Hall's record for the most ascents by a
Westerner, and it was an historic moment for Australian Tashi
Tenzing, the grandson of Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, who stood
alongside Sir Edmund Hillary 44 years ago on the summit.
</P>
<P>
Also in the party was American David Carter and sherpas Ang
Dorje and Mingma Tshering. The other member, Veikka Gustafsson, of
Finland, made the ascent about an hour after his companions,
without oxygen.

<P>
Malaysian, Canadian, British, American and Mexican expeditions
were also attempting to reach the summit.

<P>
WUHAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese culture researchers have
found a lot of historical relics of folk art in the Three Gorges
Area in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 ethnic groups are living in the area. These people
are descendants of ancient kingdoms in southwest China such as
Ba, Shu, Chu, and Qin.
</P>
<P>
Many historical relics and funerary objects unearthed here
belong to the Ba Kingdom of the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th century
B.C.) and the Zhou Dynasty (11th century to 221 B.C.), said an
archaeologist from a local museum.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists also have discovered a variety of bronze
articles such as weapons and musical instruments from the Qin and
Han Dynasties (221 B.C.-220 A.D.), the archaeologist said.
</P>
<P>
The traditional wedding ceremony, funeral rites, ethnic-style
buildings, handicraft art, folk songs, dances, and music have also
developed as special tourism attractions for domestic and foreign
visitors.

<HEADLINE> Private High-tech Business Grows In Northern Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,200 privately-run
high-tech enterprises enjoy booming business in Harbin city in
northeast China's Heilongjiang province, one of the country's
industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises had 3.7 billion yuan worth of sales last year,
a year-on-year increase of over 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city adopted preferential policies in 1994 to
encourage scientific institutes, colleges, large state enterprises
and other groups to develop private businesses using state
assets.
</P>
<P>
Some state or collective enterprises have been turned into
private ones by issuing shares, being leased, or by being
auctioned off. Science and research institutes have also been
asked to encourage specialists to set up privately-run businesses,
or permitted to hold part-time jobs in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The city's finance department has established a risk fund to
support those private high-tech enterprises that are competing
profitably in the market.
</P>
<P>
Local economists attribute the good performance of the private
sector to an independent management system, under which the
enterprises assume responsibility for their own profit and loss.
The system has enabled them to adapt themselves much more quickly
to the market economy, and provided useful experience to the
the state-owned enterprises undergoing reform.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Cosmopolitan Shanghai will erect a
460-meter building, eight meters taller than the world's tallest
building in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 94-storey Shanghai World Financial Center
will start this September and be completed by 2001, according to a
senior employee of the Japan-based Mori Building Co. Ltd., one of
the major developers of the building.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 960 million US dollars to be jointly
funded by Mori Building Co. Ltd, the Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund of Japan, and 36 Japanese and the US financial companies,
said Youxikawa Kiyouxi with Mori's Forest Overseas Co. Ltd..
</P>
<P>
The office-and-hotel building, located at Lujiazui Financial
and Trade Zone in Shanghai's Pudong New Area, was designed by KPF,
a US architectural firm.
</P>
<P>
Kiyouxi said it was Pudong's promising future of economic
development which encouraged Mori to pour 30 percent of the total
investment into the project.
</P>
<P>
Mori is building a 50-storey office building near the site of
the skyscraper.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Launches Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranians today launched a
nationwide election to choose a new president with real little
choice -- either a white turban clergyman or a black turban
clergyman.
</P>
<P>
From 08:00 hours local time (3:30 GMT), voters at age
above 15, old and young, men and women, turned out at 33,400
polling stations over the country for the 7th presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The polling will last to 18:00 hours local time and 32
million eligible voters can cast their votes in various
constituencies under the heavy security protection by 200,000
security forces and 34,000 units of militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Despite guarantee by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei for
fair election, a great number of eligible voters, including
university students, professors, shop keepers and taxi drivers,
are still gossiping their worries over the possible vote rigging
today. Thus, the race is a crucial test to the Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
The competition between the two front-runners has been so
tense and so close in the past two weeks that many
political analysts feel hard to predict the result.
</P>
<P>
The two main contenders are hardliner Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri and former cultural and Islamic guidance
minister Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri, 54, represents the Iranian conservative camp called
the Association of Combatant Clergymen (ACC) and enjoys support
of rich bazaar merchants. He is also backed by Iranian Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei and at least half of the 270-seat
Parliament as well as the clerics of the religious cities of
Qom and Mashhad.
</P>
<P>
The white turban clergyman is maneuvering into position with
a policy of "privatization" and "more social justice". However,
he said that he would follow the same policies pioneered by
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani with emphasis on the Second
Five-Year Development Plan (1995-1999).
</P>
<P>
Khatami, 54, who had been obscure from the political scene
in Tehran for more than four years, has focused his campaign
strategy on cultural issues such as freedom of press and
tolerance for remarks by opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
The black turban clergyman has secured the backing of the
left-wing group called the Society of Combatant Clergymen (SAA)
and the pro-Rafsanjani liberal camp called G-6 and is counting
on the youth and intellectuals for their votes.
</P>
<P>
Other two candidates -- former information minister Mohammad
Mohammadi Reyshahri, also clergyman, and Deputy Judicial Chief
Seyed Rerza Zavarei -- vowed to fight to the end though
there is no chance for them to win. They are widely regarded
as outsiders unlikely to have any impact on the elections but
expected to take votes away from Nateq-Nouri because they belong
to the same camp.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that this is the most closest and toughest
election contest in the past 18 years since the founding of
the Islamic Republic in 1979.
</P>
<P>
This is because the candidates are politically almost equal
and heavy-weighted and powerful figures such as Iranian Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei and current President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
stay away from the race.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei won the majority of votes in the 1981 presidential
election. He was reelected in 1985 and ran for the second
term in office. He has been now the lifetime leader ruling
the 62-million populated Islamic country since the demise of
late spiritual leader Ruhollah Mousavi Khomeini in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani won a landslide victory in the 1989 presidential
election and was reelected in 1993. He has to step down
from the office since the Constitution bars him from running
for the term of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts believe that there would not much
change in the domestic policy and foreign policy despite the
transition of power from the current president to the new
one.
</P>
<P>
This is because the Islamic Republic is now run by
moderate President Rafsanjani but ruled by the spiritual and
revolution leader Khamenei who vowed to firmly follow the path
of late spiritual leader Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The president is actually playing a secondary role under
the leader and takes care of executive affairs of the country.
The leader delineate the general policies of the country and
is in charge of politics, foreign policy and national defense.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Keep Developing Missile Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will continue to develop
missile technology and manufacture short and medium-range
missiles, in spite of a request by the U.S. government to stop it.
</P>
<P>
Security Secretary Vladimir Gorbulin said today, "Ukraine will
always remain a nation boasting first-class missile and space
technology."
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin's statement reinforces President Leonid Kuchma's
rejection of a U.S. request to stop research and production of
short and medium-range missiles during his visit to Washington
last week.
</P>
<P>
But Gorbulin said Ukraine's missiles are used to defend its
borders and not to attack other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Ukraine has never violated the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty signed by 62 countries in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin said Ukraine could not promise not to develop
strategic missiles before 2010. "Ukraine will always remain a
nation boasting first class missile and space technology."
</P>
<P>
On May 5, Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexander Kuzmuk said all
Ukraine's remaining missile silos would be dismantled by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine used to have 176 silos for storing long-range missiles
with the capability of carrying nuclear warheads. It completed the
removal of all 1,269 nuclear warheads to Russia in June 1996 as
part of its commitment to becoming a nuclear-free nation under a
pact signed in January 1994 with Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
President Kuchma has promised the United States he would send
SS-24 strategic missiles to Russia for destruction.

The EU said that it looked forward to the implementation of
President Laurent Kabila's commitments to convene a constituent
assembly within 60 days and to hold elections within two years.
</P>
<P>
The Union restated its willingness to support the
democratization process leading to free and fair elections, which
it maintains should bring lasting peace, stability and prosperity
to all the people of the country.
</P>
<P>
The transitional government has the responsibility of promoting
reconciliation between all the people of former Zaire, now the
Democratic Republic of Congo, the EU said in the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The Union recalled that the new authorities were responsible
for security throughout the country, including the protection and
dignified treatment of refugees, who largely remain in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The EU attached importance to the implementation of Kabila's
earlier commitments in a guaranteed full and unrestricted access of
humanitarian organizations to the refugees and urged Kabila to
ensure that there was full respect for international humanitarian
law.
</P>
<P>
It regretted that the investigative mission of the
U.N. Commission for Human Rights was prevented from visiting the
country. It urged the new authorities to allow the U.N. to carry
out its work in relation to human rights as a matter of urgency
and to guarantee unhindered access to all the regions it wished to
visit.
</P>
<P>
On this basis, the EU said that it hoped to develop its
relations with the Democratic Republic of Congo to help its people
pursue their legitimate aspirations.
</P>
<P>
An EU Presidency-led mission, including the European Commission
and the EU special envoy, will convey the EU's views to the new
authorities.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Warlord, Taliban Hold Separate Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Afghanistan's
northern warlord Rashid Dostum have held talks with leader of the
rebel forces Abdul Malik, a local newspaper reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which are likely to give a new turn to the
prevailing Afghan situation, were aimed at securing reconciliation
between Dostum and Malik, who has emerged as a serious threat to
the presence of the former in the north, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no details about the talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said, a high-level delegation of the
Taliban also have held discussions with Malik in Maimana, capital
of the northwestern province of Faryab where the former Dostum's
senior commander defected to the Islamic student militia early
this week.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban claimed that they had reached an understanding with
Malik and were supporting the rebel troops in their advance
towards Dostum-held areas, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The defection of Malik allowed the Taliban to have made major
gains in northern Afghanistan after almost six-month stalemate.
</P>
<P>
But Malik has so far not allowed the Taliban to enter any of
the two provinces controlled by him, the report quoted independent
Afghan sources as saying.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Not Haste to Join NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia, which has not decided
to join NATO, should not be overanxious on the issue, Yugoslav
Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovic made the remarks at a press conference after meeting
with his visiting Greek counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos, the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the top priority for Yugoslavia to join NATO or any
other military alliance. The most important thing for the country
is to return to the international political, economic and
financial organizations," said Bulatovic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yugoslavia will weigh the pros and cons on the issue
of joining NATO, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav defense minister pointed out that during the
meeting, they also discussed the issues, such as the security
situation in the Balkan region and Europe at large, and the
possibility of cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos' visit has paved the way for the two countries
to strengthen the cooperation in the fields of military industry,
technology and research.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos, who had suggested opening a meeting among the
Balkan defense ministers in Greece, said that the Balkan countries
should make efforts for the stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Greek defense minister is on a two-day official visit to
Yugoslavia beginning Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Local Polls in West Nepal Free, Fair: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The local polls held last weekend
in West Nepal were the first free and fair election in the history
of the country, Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautam said.
</P>
<P>
Gautam made the remark Thursday at a campaign rally here
organized by his Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML) for the local elections' second phase to be
held Monday in East and Central Nepal including this capital city,
the local press said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister's claim on fair polls came in the
wake of mounting opposition allegations that the government
resorted to state power to give an advantage to major ruling
partner the CPN-UML during the elections.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition the Nepali Congress (NC) party has accused the
government of tacitly encouraging CPN-UML workers to carry out
illegal activities including physical attacks against rival
candidates during the polling day.
</P>
<P>
However, the party' demands for nullifying the Saturday polling
results and holding re-elections have been rejected by the
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
Latest results of the local elections showed that the CPN-UML
has won in most of the municipalities and over half of the
villages in West Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The NC party is likely to lose its current majority control of
the country's over 4,000 local administration bodies to the
CPN-UML after the polls in East and Central Nepal on Monday,
analysts here predicted.
</P>
<P>
The NC and the CPN-UML have been arch rivals in Nepali politics
with almost same strength in the hung parliament, while Prime
Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand's rather smaller National
Democratic Party (RPP) holds the key to any political equation.

<HEADLINE> Hansonism Hurts Australia's Tourism: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Almost 86 percent of Australia's
tourism industry leaders believe independent MP Pauline Hanson's
high public profile is hurting their businesses, the national
newspaper the Australian today quoted the results of a poll as
saying.
</P>
<P>
A poll of more than 100 chief executives of Australia's top
tourism companies by Arthur Andersen and the Tourism Task Force
(TTF) also revealed that 96 believed Hanson hurt overall Asian
inbound tourism to Australia.
</P>
<P>
Of those surveyed, 86 believed the "continued political
advocacy and media coverage" of Hanson was having a negative
effect on their businesses. Fifteen said it was having no effect
on their businesses.
</P>
<P>
TTF Chief Executive Christopher Brown said "anyone who believed
Pauline Hanson would just go away has been proved completely
incorrect, from Prime Minister to some media commentators and
possibly some skeptics in this industry."
</P>
<P>
He said that while the initial controversy had led to
cancellations of tour groups from Asia last year, it was
impossible to know how many had decided not to book at all.
</P>
<P>
The 14 billion Australian dollar (10 billion US dollar) tourism
industry was quick to condemn Hanson following her maiden speech
to parliament last September, in which she spoke out against Asian
immigration and multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
Following the cancellation of several Asian tour groups, the
TTF called on the government to fund a 25 million Australian
dollar (19 million US dollar) campaign to counter negative
publicity in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Hanson's views against Asian immigrants and foreign investment
have drawn strong criticism from the nation's top political and
business leaders over the past month, including Prime Minister
John Howard, leaders of education and agriculture communities.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- About 200 Taliban soldiers were
killed on Thursday during fighting in central Afghanistan, a local
newspaper reported here today.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest number of casualties Taliban suffered in
their efforts for the control of Sheikh Ali district, about 20
kilometers east of the strategic Shibar Pass, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces had to retreat when Hezb-i-Wahdat forces,
whose stronghold is only five kilometers away from the pass,
launched a counter attack from mountains around the district,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Despite their repeated attacks, the Taliban failed to break the
frontline of Hezb-i-Wahdat, an ally of northern warlord Rashid
Dostum, the report quoted Afghan sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Abdul Malik, right-hand man of Dostum,
defected to the Taliban in the northwestern province of Faryab,
which allowed the militia to have made major gains in northern
Afghanistan after almost six-month stalemate.

<P>
JAKARTA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
reiterated its call to people not to abstain from voting on May
29.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will conclude its 27-day campaigning period today
during which the three political parties -- the ruling Golkar, the
United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI) -- have conducted their campaign activities across the
country in turn.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the general election institute Suryatna
Subrata said here Thursday that people "must use their political
rights and vote".
</P>
<P>
He said people will help ensure that the country's development
programs continue through their participation in the electoral
process.
</P>
<P>
Suryatna spoke after chairing a meeting evaluating the past
week of sometimes violent campaigning. The authorities reported
126 fatalities in traffic accidents during the rallies.
</P>
<P>
However, hours later, the ousted chief of the Indonesian
Democratic Party Megawati Soekarnoputri declared her decision to
abstain from voting.
</P>
<P>
"I, Megawati Soekarnoputri, in my capacity as an individual,
have decided not to use my political right to vote on May 29," she
said in her home here.
</P>
<P>
Megawati insisted she remained the lawful PDI chief, termed
Soerjadi's leadership unconstitutional and vowed to continue
challenging him in court.
</P>
<P>
Megawati was replaced by Soerjadi last year at a
government-backed congress held in June in Medan, north Sumatra.
However, she still get support from many PDI members.
</P>
<P>
It was the third statement given by Megawati during the
election campaign from April 27 to May 20. The first two calls
were to remind her supporters not to get involved in what she
called "unconstitutional" PDI campaigns.
</P>
<P>
More than 124 million eligible voters are expected to go to the
polls next week to elect 425 members of the house of
representatives.

<HEADLINE> Two Arrested on Arson Charges in Venice Opero Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VENICE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Investigating judge Gioachino
Termini ordered two people to be arrested today on charges of
setting a fire that destroyed Venice's historic La Fenice opera
house last year.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources said Massimiliano Marchetti and Enrico Carella
were electricians working on a restoration crew inside the theater
in the weeks before the fire.
</P>
<P>
Termini said in an arrest warrant that the two men were held on
charges of conspiring to cause the fire and destroy the theater.
</P>
<P>
It said other, as yet unidentified people, may also be involved.
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that the motive for arson lay in the fact
the construction company faced stiff penalties because they were
seriously behind the schedule of the refurbishment of the
world-famous theater.
</P>
<P>
The city has pledged to use at least 100 million U.S. dollars
to rebuild La Fenice which was first opened in 1792 and renovated
after a fire in 1836.
</P>
<P>
Several companies are now bidding for the reconstruction of the
theater, which held priceless memories as the stage for premieres
of some of Italy's most famous operas.
</P>
<P>
Venice is expected to choose the winning bidder next month for
a July start and a November 1999 completion date for the project.

<HEADLINE> Private Air Firms Hit by Defense Ministry Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's private air flight companies
have accused the Defense Ministry of effectively grounding them in
a bid to set up a state-owned rival.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has scrapped leasing agreements for more than 60
Air Force cargo planes which it was renting out to private
companies in a bid to ease a cash shortage. The planes were
converted into civilian cargo carriers and rented out together
with their crews for 84,000 U.S. dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
The private firms say the ministry's action is symptomatic of
government's attitude toward commercial firms.
</P>
<P>
"We've suffered morally and financially, but it's not just a
problem of the relations between the Defense Ministry and
airlines," said Alexandr Sanin, president of the BSL air flight
company. "Its a problem of business in the whole country."
</P>
<P>
He said the companies were not even told when the cancellations
would become effective nor who took the decision.
</P>
<P>
The media here has reported that the Defense Ministry plans to
use the recalled planes to create a new state cargo company, a
move confirmed by defense ministry spokesman Sergy Nagorianski.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the returned planes would be used to set up a
special state cargo company for the ministry of defense, but
didn't say how many planes would be involved in the venture.
</P>
<P>
However, Nagorianski claimed the ministry had cancelled the
leases because the planes were being poorly maintained by the air
cargo companies, and because companies had failed to pay taxes and
contract fees. He said the decision was made about a month ago at
a defense ministry meeting at which National Security Council
Secretary Vladimir Gorbulin was present.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Alexander Kuzmuk also accused the air cargo
companies of neglecting planes leased from the Air Force.

<P>
VIENNA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Albania's bickering political
parties have finally agreed on the mechanisms of the country's
parliamentary elections due on June 29, the European envoy to the
crisis-hit country said today.
</P>
<P>
Franz Vranitzky, head of the Albanian mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), told a
press conference he got the news Wednesday night by phone from
Albania's caretaker Prime Minister Bashkim Fino.
</P>
<P>
The country's 10 opposition parties, led by the main opposition
Socialist Party, and the ruling Democratic Party led by President
Sali Berisha, agreed on rules for the poll which are to be
monitored by the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
The agreement ends a two-week dispute which erupted after a new
electoral law was passed by the ruling Democratic Party-dominated
parliament. The country's 10 opposition parties, led by Fatos
Nano's Socialist Party, had threatened to boycott the elections,
claiming the law was unfairly weighted in favor of the Democratic
Party led by President Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the elections will be carried out in a
combination of majority and proportional voting.
</P>
<P>
Members of the central electoral commission will be nominated
by each party and then confirmed by Fino instead of being named by
President Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
The election is aimed at bringing an end to the months of
lawlessness which followed the collapse of pyramid investment
schemes in January in which thousands of Albanians lost their life
savings.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky, who had pushed hard for an agreement between the
parties, said the OSCE will hold a meeting in Rome on May 26 to
hold preparatory talks on Albania's reconstruction and economic
assistance to the troubled Balkan country.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Produces 85 Percent of Cocaine in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-five percent of cocaine in
the world was produced in Latin America, especially in Colombia,
Peru, and Bolivia, while 80 percent of the opium and heroin in
Asia, Amazonian Parliament President Luis Emilio Rondon said.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 percent of the production was seized, with much more of
the drugs going onto the black market, Rondon said in the five-day
European-American Interparliamentary Conference which ended today.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 5 billion U.S. dollars of drugs were seized. Drug
trafficking has damaged Latin American economies by money
laundering and caused difficulties to the nations when they face
decertification by the U.S. in the war against drugs, added Rondon.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the drugs produced in Peru, Bolivia and
Colombia were transported abroad through the Orinoco waterway.
Drug producers have moved to jungle areas to evade the fight
against drugs, said Rondon.
</P>
<P>
Drug traffickers use the Bolivian Amazonian jungle for the
transportation of drugs and the Venezuelan Amazonia for waterway
transportation through the Orinoco River toward the Atlantic
Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Concern Deepens Over Waterless Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The lower reaches of the Yellow
River, the second largest river in China, are beginning to run dry
more and more often.
</P>
<P>
This unfortunate situation drew the attention of experts and
concerned departments to a symposium on ecological influences and
related countermeasures that closed in Beijing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The more serious seasonal dry runs in certain sections of the
nation's "Mother River" have unfavorably affected the economic and
social development in nearby areas, as well as disrupting the
ecological environment, the 60 experts and government officials at
the symposium concluded.
</P>
<P>
They believe the drying up of the river bed in some sections
has brought about detrimental effects over wider areas, including
a decrease in biological diversity, degradation in land resources
and losses in aquatic breeds, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuqing, vice-director of the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection, pointed out during the meeting that the dry sections
resulted from a serious ecological imbalance and irrational
exploitation of natural resources in the valley over the past
years.
</P>
<P>
The ecological environment in the valley is very fragile, he
said.
</P>
<P>
For example, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, as
well as Inner Mongolia and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions, which
carry the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, have
little forest coverage and little natural ability to retain water.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, most of the valley is situated in dry areas, and the
quantity of water drawn from the river for agricultural,
industrial and household use has been increasing year by year
because of rapid economic and population growth.
</P>
<P>
If the problem was not resolved, not only this area but also
the country's ability to achieve sustainable development would be
restricted, since the river waters the country's important areas
for producing grains and cotton, Wang warned.

<HEADLINE> Governments Fund Operations for Cataract Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Although Tan Jinli had lived with
him for four years, he had no idea what his son looked like
because Tan, who is 35, had lost his eyesight seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
But he was fortunate to be one of the 109 blind people in
suburban areas of Beijing to regain his sight thanks to a cataract
operation that also gave him an artificial lens implant this year.
</P>
<P>
The operations were funded by the Beijing Municipal People's
Government as part of a program to help poor cataract patients and
their families with cures.
</P>
<P>
Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness in China. Out of
nine million people suffering from visual impairments, about four
million are victims of the disease, according to the Ministry of
Health.
</P>
<P>
And, 400,000 new cases are reported in China each year.
Unfortunately, the incidence of cataract-caused blindness has not
been brought under control because most of the victims cannot
afford surgery or other treatment.
</P>
<P>
One national study found that more than half of those with
cataracts are unable to work and many can not even get around to
take care of their own daily lives, meaning further financial
burdens for their families.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government of the Chinese capital announced plans
to help 100 poor cataract patients this year by paying for
operations, and 109 patients have been cured and say that they are
very satisfied with the results of the operation, Xun Xiucheng, an
official at the Beijing Disabled Persons' Federation, said.
</P>
<P>
In the past six years, more than 30,000 cataract patients in
Beijing have regained their sight after operations, Xun noted.
</P>
<P>
East China's Fujian Province recently also announced that it
would "do something practical for the people," meaning that it
would see to it that 3,000 cataract patients would have the
operation this year. Most of the medical costs will be covered by
local governments.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (99-100) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (99-100) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: May the Basic Law be amended? Who has the power to
amend it?
</P>
<P>
Answer: No laws are not amendable. The Basic Law is no
exception. Since the Basic Law will not take effect until July 1,
1997, it lacks any legal basis to amend this law before its
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Given the special nature of its content and its important
status, the Basic Law differs from ordinary laws not only in the
process of its enactment but also in the authority and procedures
for its amendment.
</P>
<P>
1. The power to amend the Basic Law is vested exclusively in
the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
2. The Standing Committee of the NPC, the State Council and the
Hong Kong SAR have the power to propose bills for amending the
Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
3. Strict and special procedures are required for an amendment
bill to qualify as such. Before an amendment bill is put on the
agenda of the NPC, the Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong
Kong SAR must study it and submit its views.
</P>
<P>
Amendment bills from the Hong Kong SAR should be submitted to
the NPC by the delegation of the region to the NPC after obtaining
the consent of two-thirds of the deputies of the region to the NPC,
two-thirds of all the members of the Legislative Council of the
region, and the Chief Executive of the region.
</P>
<P>
4. No amendment to the Basic Law should contravene China's
established basic policies regarding Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that any amendment to the Basic Law will be
extremely strict and prudent. This is to ensure its authority and
stability, thereby providing a reliable legal guarantee for the
implementation of the "one country, two systems" and "no change for
50 years" policies regarding Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Question: Under what circumstances may the central government
issue an order applying relevant national laws in Hong Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Laws in force in the Hong Kong SAR will be the Basic
Law, laws previously in force in Hong Kong as provided for in
Article 8 of the Basic Law, and laws enacted by the legislature of
the region.
</P>
<P>
National laws will not be applied in the Hong Kong SAR except
for those listed in Annex 3 to the Basic Law. The laws listed
therein will be applied locally by way of promulgation or
legislation by the region.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the NPC may add to or delete from the
list of laws in Annex 3 after consulting its Committee for the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR and the government of the region.
</P>
<P>
Laws listed in Annex 3 to the Basic Law will be confined to
those relating to defense and foreign affairs as well as other
matters outside the limits of the autonomy of the regions as
specified by the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
In the event that the Standing Committee of the NPC decides to
declare a state of war or, by reason of turmoil within the Hong
Kong SAR which endangers national unity or security and is beyond
the control of the government of the region, decides that the
region is in a state of emergency, the central government may issue
an order applying relevant national laws in the region.

<HEADLINE> Trademark Violations Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 30,058 trademark
violation cases were reported and investigated last year, with
half of them related to infringement on trademark rights,
according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
"This is a decrease of about 15 percent from the previous
year", the daily newspaper quoted Teng Jiacai, an official with
China Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry
and Commerce (SAIC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fines levied from the illegal trademark cases totalled 81.03
million yuan (9.76 million US dollars), a slight increase of 2.8
percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Administrators from SAIC and local offices confiscated and
destroyed 440 million sets of illegally printed trademarks and
more than 5,000 models and printing plates for printing bogus
trademarks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the violators were ordered to pay 5.4 million yuan
(650,000 US dollars) in economic compensation to the concerned
parties.
</P>
<P>
A total of 57 people were sent to the court for criminal
charges last year.

<HEADLINE> Italy Supports Romania, Slovenia Joining NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Italy supports bids by Romania and
Slovenia to be among the first wave of countries to join NATO,
said visiting Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Hungarian newspaper Nepszava published
today, Prodi said that in addition to Hungary, the Czech Republic
and Poland, who are seen as the front runners to gain membership
of the military alliance, Italy also backs Romania and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The Italian prime minister pointed out that due to its
geographical position, Slovenia would be a link between Hungary
with other NATO member countries.
</P>
<P>
It would also be beneficial to bring Romania into the
organization as great changes have taken place since the new
government came into power, the newspaper quoted Prodi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said French President Jacques Chirac also supported him
on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who arrived in Budapest on Tuesday for a joint meeting
with his Hungarian and Slovenian counterparts Gyula Horn and Janez
Drnovsek, started a three-day official visit to Hungary on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have signed several cooperation agreements.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela to Extradite Colombian Drug Trafficker to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's Supreme Court of
Justice (SCJ) today ordered the extradition of alleged Colombian
drugs kingpin Justo Pastor Perafan to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Perafan, the alleged leader of the Bogota and Cauca drugs
cartels which have links with the notorious Medellin cartel, was
arrested early March by Venezuelan military troops in San
Cristobal in southwestern Venezuela after a week-long chase.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. and Colombia have asked the Venezuelan government
for Perafan to be extradited.
</P>
<P>
Perafan is wanted by New York prosecutors for promoting gangs
of drug traffickers who have sold more than 30 tons of cocaine
onto the streets of the U.S. since 1988.
</P>
<P>
The New York district court also issued a standing arrest
warrant against Perafan on eight charges related to trafficking,
possession and distribution of drugs.
</P>
<P>
In Venezuela, Perafan is wanted for possession of forged
documents and illegal entry into the country.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to Venezuela John Francis Maisto said he was
happy with the extradition decision.
</P>
<P>
It was a clear message to all drug traffickers that they could
find no safe haven in Venezuela and that the country is serious
about fighting the drugs war, the ambassador said.

<HEADLINE> New Pension Plan for Employees of Private Firms in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest business
center, has set up a new pension system for employees of private
companies, according to local officials,
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to allow workers at private companies
to enjoy a comfortable life after they retire and to encourage
displaced workers from State-owned enterprises to find jobs in the
private sector, they explained.
</P>
<P>
Initated three years ago, the program involving 1200 private
companies has yielded satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
Qing Zhihua, a 60-year-old retired employee of a private
computer company who is one of the first workers who have gotten a
pension from private business, says, "Now I can set my mind at
ease."
</P>
<P>
Qing says that when the system had just started, he was not
sure that it was right. He had worked in a State-owned research
institute for 30 years before finding a job in a private firm in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Workers who had worked in a State-owned or collectively-owned
company can transfer their pension account from their
originaly employees to private companies that currently hire
them. According to loal oficials, retired workers who are on the
new pension plan enjoy the same treatment as those retired from
state-owned companies.

<HEADLINE> Local Telephone Network Operation Opens Wider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Potential telephone subscribers in
Sichuan province and Tianjin and Chongqing municipalities may soon
find they have alternatives to local telecom departments when
installing telephones, once a problem for Chinese urban residents.
</P>
<P>
According to latest issue of China Electronic News, the State
Council, or China's cabinet, has in principle approved an emerging
telecom corporation to run independent local telephone networks in
the above localities.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom, the only telecom corporation capable of vying
with China Telecom under the Ministry of Post and
Telecommunications, recently has been granted the status to be the
country's second state telecom enterprise authorized to operate
basic telecom businesses and other value-added telecom services,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The telecom networks run by Unicom in the future will be
considered part of China's national public telecom networks, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Local experts said that the move will not only enhance Unicom's
competitive edge in the telecom marketplace, but also play an
active part to promote technical advancement, improve services,
and push forward fair competition.
</P>
<P>
Unicom broke the monopoly in the marketplace in 1995. The
company opened China's first 80,000-line mobile telephone network
run by a non-China Telecom organ in four cities.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Unicom built mobile telephone networks in
76 cities, of which 22 local nets have been in operation. The
roaming service provided by Unicom via its mobile telecom net is
expected to reach Hong Kong this year.
</P>
<P>
Unicom has started to build telephone networks which are
integrated to the nets run by China Telecom in 37 cities, of which
Unicom-run telephone switching stations have been in use in 16
cities, including Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the company has developed a nationwide paging network
with 100,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, Unicom is set to build its own national
long-distance transmission trunklines based on optic cables and
centered around Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.

<HEADLINE> Pharaohs Rally to Roll in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The 15th international car race, held
annually in Egypt under the catchy sobriquet "Pharaohs Rally,"
will take place on October 4-14.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 best drivers from the U.S., France, Italy,
Germany, Spain and Egypt crave for a berth in the 4000-kilometer
round trip across the Western Desert, said Fenouil, a key
organizer of the event for the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 70 motorcycles, 130 trucks and cars, 10 light
aircrafts will be employed in the desert competition, he said,
adding that the drivers are allowed to change their vehicles
during the trip.
</P>
<P>
"But security is still my top concern," the 46-year-old French
told Xinhua, since he himself has been a professional rally man
for nine years before coming up with the idea of making it big on
the Western Desert, which boasts one of the most drenched place in
the world.
</P>
<P>
To ensure safety in such a demanding and strength-consuming
sport, three emergency aid planes will hover overhead all through
the route and provision services will be scattered in certain
spots.
</P>
<P>
The "Pharaohs Rally," which has become one of the world's
best-known and most-inspiring car race was born of his love of the
virgin desert and adventure, said Fenouil, who is so famous in the
circle that he is now only identified by his nickname.
</P>
<P>
The preparation work is in full swing. Fenouil returned to
Cairo just two days ago from the Desert where he took a survey of
the destinations, which he said would pose a great challege even
for the world best rally fanatics.
</P>
<P>
But for the Egyptian government, this highly-publicized sport
event offers a perfect chance to boost tourism, which has been
among Egypt's top foreign currency earners.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, Tourism Minister Mamdouh
el-Beltagui told reporters that the race is an important part of
the multi-facet tourism promotion campaign of Egypt this year.
</P>
<P>
The competitor will take a ceremonious promenade at the
newly-opened Dahashur Pyramid, which is only second to the Giza
Great Pyramids in grandeur, before setting off for Alexandria,
trespassing Siwa and Farafra and turning back to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the game, the rally participants will be treated
with a glitzy Opera Aida in front of a great pharaoh statue in
Luxor, a southern archeological treasure in Egypt.

troops in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, which is seen as one the most
challenging in the U.S. military after two car bomb attacks in
Saudi Arabia since 1995 that have killed 24 American servicemen.

Pentagon investigators earlier criticized U.S. military
officials because they allegedly were not prepared for the two car
bombing.

Zinni is a 32-year military veteran and is currently deputy
commander of the Central Command under Peay.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Chairman Urges Caution on Bank Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
Chairman Alan Greenspan today urged the U.S. Congress to complete
action on modernizing the financial system before it decides
whether to allow non-financial companies to own banks.
</P>
<P>
Testifying at the Banking Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives, Greenspan called for quick action to repeal the
Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that regulates banks.
</P>
<P>
He said modernization of bank regulation would "remove outdated
restrictions that serve no useful purpose."
</P>
<P>
But Greenspan said Congress should be cautious about allowing
commercial companies to get into the banking business or allowing
banks into non-financial businesses. He expressed "uncertainty"
about how to regulate banks and their non-financial affiliates.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has presented the outline of a plan
for modernizing bank regulation. But it sidestepped the issue of
allowing commercial businesses to own banks.

<HEADLINE> CDB Moves to Meet Challenges, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Caribbean Development Bank
(CDB) is moving for a new strategic plan that will enable it to
continue the leading role in the region's economic development, a
senior bank official said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session of CDB's 27th annual meeting
here, President Neville Nicholls stressed that the subregional
organization must have a strategic plan for the challenges brought
by rapid global changes.
</P>
<P>
CDB "must become more innovative in supplying services" that
its borrowing-member-countries (BMCs) now seem to require, the
president said at the end of the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The plan's key elements will be the design and putting in place
of the systems and policies for dealing with non-traditional areas
of financing, the management of a well-balanced portfolio,
training of skilled staff, and fostering closer ties with other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Nicholls foresees a CDB that places the highest priority on
preparing its BMCs to cope with the needs of global change, a CDB
that is flexible and adaptable, a CDB that can attain a reasonable
level of real growth in its portfolio each year and a CDB staff
with the highest quality dedicated to its goals.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate that, by year end, Management will have
completed the outlines of this vision and the major strategies for
achieving its key objectives," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1969, CDB is a major financer of infrastructure and
social sector development projects and promotes regional
integration in the Caribbean community.
</P>
<P>
Currently it is composed of 17 regional borrowing members,
three regional non-borrowing members and five non-regional
members.
</P>
<P>
During the annual meeting here, the bank has accepted China as
its full member.
</P>
<P>
The bank announced today that its 28th annual meetings will be
held in St. George's, Greenada, in May, 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says NATO Force in Bosnia to Expand Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The multi-national troops in
Bosnia led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would take on
new roles to enhance peace, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said here today.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the remarks when she testified before a U.S.
Senate hearing on foreign aid appropriations in the fiscal year of
1998.
</P>
<P>
She said that the U.S. decide to rededicate itself to fully
implementing the 1995 Dayton peace accords. The NATO-led troops in
Bosnia would help promote refugee returns and restoration of
telecommunications links.
</P>
<P>
The NATO force would remain principally focused on enforcing
the military aspect of the Dayton peace accords, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
But she added: "It will build on its past accomplishments by
actively supporting crucial civil implementation tasks within its
mandate and capabilities."
</P>
<P>
"These include helping to create a secure environment for
managed refugee returns and the installation of elected officials
in targeted areas and specific economic reconstruction projects
which include inter-entity telecommunications and restoring civil
aviation," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright is due to visit Sarajevo and other cities in Bosnia
next week in order to push forward the implementation of the
Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential to American interests and to the future
stability of Europe that we fully implement the Dayton Agreement
for Peace in Bosnia," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there remain important areas where progress has
been slow due to the failure of many Bosnian leaders to embrace
true political and social integration," she added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has said that it will pull all its troops out of
Bosnia by mid-1998 regardless of whatever conditions while its
European partners fear that new crisis would probably occur after
the peacekeepers withdraw.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Congress to Support KEDO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Thursday asked Congress to appropriate 30
million US dollars for the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Senate panel, Albright said: "We are asking 30
million dollars for the American share this year, and I hope we
will have your support on that."
</P>
<P>
Albright took a trip to South Korea last February and visited
the demilitarized zone that separate the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
She told the panel that she was "more convinced that ever" by
the visit that "KEDO is a national security bargain for the United
States."
</P>
<P>
KEDO was formed in 1995 to help the DPRK build light-water
reactors in replacement of the old graphite reactors.
</P>
<P>
Its members include the DPRK, South Korea, Japan and the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Vice President Ends Visit to Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President Abdul Halim
Khaddam concluded his brief visit to Yemen and left Sanaa
with his accompanying delegation late this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian vice president conveyed a letter during his several
hours' stay to Yemeni President Ali Abdulla Saleh from Syrian
President Hafez Assad concerning the developments of the Middle
East peace process, Israel's breach of the peace accord, the
Syrian stance and Damascus-Sanaa relations.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam met with President Saleh and Vice President General
Abdou Rabbou during the brief visit.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Saleh underscored Yemen's support of the
Syrian stance, and expressed the hope that the international
community would shoulder its responsibility to pressure Israel to
abide by its obligations, in order to save the peace process from
the "perils of Israeli extremism."
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Yemen's adherence to the resolutions of
the Cairo Arab Summit of June 1996.
</P>
<P>
In a departure statement, Khaddam said "we have discussed in
detail the situation in the Middle East and related issues in an
atmosphere of common understanding of Arab interests and Arab
future."
</P>
<P>
"We reached consensus on all these issues," he said, "we have
also discussed the importance and necessity of implementing Arab
resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Israeli
government's attitude, particularly on ceasing normalization as
well as all forms of contact with the Israelis because they have
closed the door to peace."
</P>
<P>
Khaddam said his talks with Saleh also dealt with the
Israeli-Turkish alliance and its serious consequences, adding that
it contradicts Arab interests as well as the overall interests of
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's interests, he said, are part and parcel of the Islamic
world and it should cooperate with the Arab world, by virtue of
religion, history, and political and economic factors. He
expressed the hope that the Arab stance and Arab contacts would
prompt Turkey to reconsider its policies.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam said the Turkish armed incursion into northern Iraq was
also a topic for discussion, describing the incident as a
consequence of the Israeli-Turkish accord. He condemned it as a
grave phenomenon in international relations, and a flagrant
violation of the sovereignty of an Arab state.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides agreed that the Arab economic situation
should be improved and it is necessary to build an economic bloc
to strengthen inter-Arab economic relations, with the ultimate
objective of enforcing the Arab common market.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam arrived in Sanaa at noon today on a brief visit to
Yemen.

<HEADLINE> Chad Denies Intention to Provide Asylum to Mobutu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chad today denied that it was going
to provide asylum for former Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko,
92 followers and his family members, according to Agence
France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Chadian government spokesman Salibou Garba said today that Chad
is making contacts with other countries to look for another
country to receive the 92 members of Mobutu's entourage who
arrived in Ndjamena, the Chadian capital, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is for humanitarian reasons and in conformity with the
Constitution of Chad that Chad abstained from driving back the
refugees of ex-Zaire," said Garba, who is also minister of
communication.
</P>
<P>
Among those who fled Zaire to Chad are the "great sister" of
Mobutu and her husband, who was chief of the former military
police Gendarmerie, and many small children.
</P>
<P>
AFP today quoted "a very good" source in the Togolese capital
Lome as saying that Mobutu will leave Lome Friday for Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu fled Zaire Sunday to Togo and has been staying in the
presidential palace of the Togolese capital since then. He was
reportedly "very, very tired."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French Socialist Party today urged the French
government not to receive "on our territory dictator Mobutu."
</P>
<P>
Guy Labertit, the party's national delegate for African
affairs, said that Mobutu's 32-year rule of Zaire was "marked by
permanent violation of the fundamental rights of the citizens of
the country."
DPA310PAB206I22TEQL02:5702:572742
</P>
<P>
France has neither confirmed nor denied that it would receive
Mobutu if the latter presented the request to go into exile in
France, where he owns a private villa in the southeastern part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo
has asked France not to receive Mobutu.

<HEADLINE> Economic Liberation Tops on Africa's Agenda: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary
general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), has said that
at this stage of Africa's struggle, "the priority is economic
liberation in which everybody has a role to play".
</P>
<P>
According to an OAU press release issued here today, the
statement was made by Salim when he was receiving a delegation of
Nigerian-Ethiopian Business Association here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Salim observed that in a world where every region fends for
its own due to geopolitical and historical changes, it has become
a necessity rather than a choice for Africa to look inwards and
find answers to the question of how best to make themselves more
relevant.
</P>
<P>
"We want to be a continent of the present that could help
build the future rather than be looked upon only as a continent
of the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Salim urged Africa to take seriously the proposal to encourage
bilateral trade relations within the continent and try to make a
difference by working together as a people with the aim of
enhancing intra-African business flow.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Nigerian delegation and President of the
Nigerian-Ethiopian Business Association, Goodie Ibru, on his part
stated that the Association is interested in promoting private
sector business and in how to build capacity for Africa to learn
to do business together with one another for mutual benefit and
self-sufficiency, the release added.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed Procedures for Entering CDB: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China will do its best to speed the
necessary procedures for entering the Caribbean Development Bank
(CDB), a senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Yin Jieyan, head of the Chinese delegation, told the 27th CDB
annual meeting that his government is "currently sparing no
efforts to fulfill all the necessary procedures" for entering the
bank.
</P>
<P>
The CDB's board of governors has decided to accept China's
application to join the bank as a non-regional, non-borrowing
member country.
</P>
<P>
The formal approval has taken much closer to the point of
completion the process which began in September 1993, when China
submitted its application.
</P>
<P>
China is now required to take a number of steps which will
culminate in its depositing with the U.N. secretary-general an
instrument stating that it had accepted the CDB agreement and
taken all the steps necessary to carry out all the obligations.
</P>
<P>
Marius St. Rose, vice-president of the CDB, told Xinhua that he
thinks China's membership will become effective no later than this
October.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is looking forward to a closer
relationship with the bank," said Yin, vice-governor of China's
central bank-- the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The acceptance of China as a full CDB member marks "an
important milestone of cooperation" between China and the CDB, Yin
said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the CDB is our efficient partner for fostering
the economic and social development of the Caribbean region," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1969, the CDB is a major financier of infrastructure
and social sector development projects and promotes regional
integration in the Caribbean community.
</P>
<P>
Currently, it is composed of 17 regional borrowing members,
three regional non-borrowing members and five non-regional
members.
</P>
<P>
The CDB's board of governors is gathering here for the two-day
27th annual meeting. This is the first time for the CDB to hold
its annual meeting outside of the Caribbean region.

AMMAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian and the United States armed
forces have kicked off a Joint military exercises named
"Infinite Moonlight 1997," well informed source who declined to
be named told Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
The drill, actually started on Tuesday and to be ended on
June 19, is the second one between the two countries since
march, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The place of the exercises has not been disclosed yet, the
source added.
</P>
<P>
The 5th Royal Mechanized Division of Jordan took part in the
joint exercises, the source said.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, both sides staged 3 weeks of military
exercises named "Early Victory 1997" to help upgrade the kingdom's
defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Washington had been Jordan's main arms supplier for nearly 3
decades until the mid of 1980s, when the kingdom resisted American
calls to break Arab ranks and make peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
But bilateral military ties strengthened after Jordan signed a
peace treaty with the Jewish state in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. provided Jordan 100 million U.S. dollars
worth of aircraft, helicopters, tanks, trucks, boats and other
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom was also granted non-NATO member status, giving
it more access to the U.S. aid.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Neighborhoods with successful
anti-drug programs would become eligible for federal matching
grants of up to 100,000 dollars in accordance with a bill which
cleared the House of Representatives today.
</P>
<P>
The bill passed 420-1, and goes to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Supporters said drug abuse has increased among teen-agers
despite federal anti-drug efforts and the time had come to
encourage communities winning their drug war.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich praised the bill, saying drug abuse
leads to other social ills, such as child and spousal abuse. On
Wednesday Gingrich stated his goal for a drug-free America by
2001.
</P>
<P>
Calling the bill a "significant building block in the right
direction," Gingrich said, "It is the kind of program that will
have fewer young people involved with drugs and a healthier and
safer country."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
which would administer the program, said the Clinton
administration supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
It authorizes 143.5 million dollars for grants over five years.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Syrian Official: Israeli-Turkish Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A Syrian ruling party's official
said today that the agreement signed by Israel and Turkey
constitutes an alliance of aggressive nature, portending grave
consequences on the security and stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a party meeting today, Abdulla Al Ahmar, assistant
secretary-general of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party, said
that at a time when the peace process is stalemated, this
agreement targets all Arabs and other countries of the region,
Syrian Arab New Agency (SUNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
It attempts to demonstrate hegemony and to impose de facto
status, said Ahmar, adding that it provides the climate for
aggressive moves.
</P>
<P>
This attempt is reflected in Israeli practices of settlement
expansion and the Turkish incursion into northern Iraq which, in
fact, constitutes an invasion, occupation and violation of the
sovereignty of an Arab state, Ahmar said.
</P>
<P>
With the support of air bombing and artillery fire, a Turkish
contingent of about 25,000 to 50,000 pushed across the border into
Northern Iraq assaulting the rebels of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party last week in the largest military assault over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the situation in the region, he said the peace
process had reached a dead end under the incumbent Israeli
government's aggressive, repressive and settlement practices, such
as rejection of the peace process principles, refusal to pull out
from the occupied territories, and denial of Arab rights already
approved by the international community and stipulated in relevant
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel signed a military training agreement in
February 1996, generating fear among the regional countries that
Turkey was aligning itself with Israel against Syria and other
Arab countries.

ATHENS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek government today rejected the
U.S. criticism on the country's media, saying that the U.S. State
Department contained "false information".

that might exist did not entitle anyone to make judgements of the
type contained in the U.S. state department report.

and they must promote it.

irresponsible".

It further accused the Greek press of lacking objectivity.

WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- FBI General Counsel Howard

<P>
Shapiro said Wednesday he will take the Summer off before going

Shapiro, whose contacts with the White House during the FBI

denied his resignation had anything to do with the recent Justice
Department review.
</P>
<P>
The review, released in March, cleared him of wrongdoing and
did not recommend any disciplinary action.
</P>

The review found that Shapiro's contacts with the White House

<HEADLINE> Big European Banks Set to Build Investment Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Big European banks are set to
build investment banking franchises in the United States through
acquisition of investment companies.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report of the New York Times, the Swiss
Bank Corporation has decided to buy Dillon Read &AMP; Company, a
investment company based in New York City.
</P>
<P>
The 600 million U.S. dollar transaction, which was negotiated
in last few weeks, is a new evidence of the determination of big
European banks to build investment banking franchises in this
country, the report commented.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. investment company has a history dating back to 1832
and now specializes in advising companies on mergers and
acquisition and in raising capital through equity and debt issues.
</P>
<P>
There have been frequent reports recently of possible talks
concerning potential combinations involving a number of banks and
securities firms, including Morgan, Chase Manhattan, Nationbank,
the Bank of America, Lehman Brothers and Salomon Brothers.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, an analyst was quoted as saying that
the sale of a small to medium-sized brokerage company like Dillon
Read to a larger bank with global aspirations, like Swiss Bank,
"is the type of the deal one would expect to see."

NEW YORK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Minister of Foreign Affairs of
the Republic of Korea (ROK), Chong-Ha Yoo, today called for a
strengthened partnership between the United States and his
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon here hosted by the Korea Society in the
United States, Chong-Ha Yoo said that the U.S. and South Korea
"are closely coordinating their policies" in order to "build a
lasting peace on the Korean peninsula and stability in northeast
Asia."
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries "will continue patiently to
persuade" the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to
start the four-party talks for the lasting peace in the Korean
peninsula. The talks were proposed by the leaders of the United
States and ROK in April 1996 during U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The trilateral meeting among the U.S., ROK and DPRK in New York
last month failed to reach an agreement to start the four-party
talks which will include China.
</P>
<P>
"The successful progress of the four-party talks will
contribute to building a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula and
stability in northeast Asia," said Yoo, who is visiting the
United States.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Ambassador to Zambia Manuel
Augusto said here today that the international community should
keep pressure on the opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) so that the UNITA will honor its
commitment to the implementation of the Lusaka peace accord
signed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said in a press conference that there
has been no war in his country for two years and nomal life has
returned some areas which remain under the UNITA control.

administration to the areas but the former anti-government forces
are "trying to find arguements for delaying the process", claimed
the ambassador.

must be pushed forward continuously and the central
administration must be extended to all the areas still occupied
by the UITA.

Motutu's forces.

<HEADLINE> Blair to Warn EU Partners Against Higher Costs on Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair is
to tell his European Union (EU) partners that he would stand in
the way of attempts to introduce higher social costs in Britain,
according to British government sources.
</P>
<P>
At the special EU summit to be held in the Dutch city Noordwijk
on Friday, Blair will say that although the new British government
is planning to sign up to the Social Chapter, it is also
determined to insist that the 15-nation bloc move to flexible
labor markets, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, whose Labor party won a landslide victory on the May 1
general election, is expected to press the case for Europe to move
towards the policies that have encouraged overseas firms to choose
Britain as a base for investment.
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old new British Prime Minister will tell the other
EU leaders that there is a third way between the Tory-style
non-intervention and the kind of over-regulation that is blamed
for imposing extra costs and higher unemployment on France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to make it clear at the summit that he will
not allow the Social Chapter to become a means of backdoor
imposition on Britain of European legislation on social security
and worker involvement on company boards.
</P>
<P>
An authoritative government official was quoted as saying
today: "We don't want to lose control of our social security
costs. We would veto such extra costs being imposed here."
